On DATE ORG Instance deleted the notice from the public register after it had received a notification by the company that the loan had been completely repaid .", "CARDINAL .

Mr PERSON 's claim was dismissed on DATE and DATE respectively , by ORG and ORG . The courts considered that the company had no legal capacity to stand in the proceedings as it had concluded the agreement with the applicant and not with PERSON The courts further found Mr PERSON 's claim ill - founded as he had not been a party to the agreement , even though the applicant had concluded it for his benefit .", "CARDINAL .

The court further declared as withdrawn the applicant 's claim against Mr PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant 's appeal and remitted the case for re - examination .

Relying on a letter of ORG DATE , it stated that the company had not been incorporated as a savings institution at the time when the agreement had been concluded and consequently , that it had not been authorised to give loans in foreign currency .

In the latter case , the company could only charge statutory interest , but not at the rate as provided for by the agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant 's claim .

It stated , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... In accordance with ORG of DATE in force at that time , [ the company ] was authorised to accept savings in domestic currency from physical persons and to give loans to physical persons and sole proprietors . Inferences can be drawn that [ the company ] was not authorised to accept or to give loans in foreign currency to citizens . However , that law does not provide for nullity of such agreements nor does it prohibit the execution of such operations by savings institutions . Such operation of a savings institution is regulated by penalty provisions . It is undisputed that the agreement concluded between the parties [ the company and the applicant ] was voluntarily executed by [ the applicant ] ... \u201c", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the lower courts ' reasoning that the agreement had been null and void , as the company had been registered and authorised to enter into such agreements irrespective of whether it had concerned foreign currency . It stated that that fact could have only influenced the execution of the agreement . It went on to conclude that the applicant could not have requested restoration of the money already paid to the company under the agreement , as the latter was a financial institution set up by virtue of law , the operation of which was authorised by ORG . Moreover , the scope of reference of the company was regulated by a law which could not have been unknown to the applicant .", "CARDINAL .
