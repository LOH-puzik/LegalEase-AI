POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , born in DATE . She runs a family business together with the second and third applicants , PERSON PERSON and Mr PERSON . They reside in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in FAC . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , their Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants run a small family business . By decisions of DATE ORG found all CARDINAL applicants guilty of a fiscal offence punishable under LAW in that they had failed to pay a DATE income - tax advance on wages for their employees for DATE , in the amount of MONEY ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) . ORG imposed on each of the applicants a pecuniary penalty of ORG , to be substituted by DATE of imprisonment in case of default of payment . The penalty was imposed under LAW , stipulating sanctions for fiscal offences ( cf . distinction between \u201c fiscal crimes \u201d and \u201c fiscal offences \u201d in the \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "The applicants lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG , arguing that the first - instance authority had wrongly instituted the fiscal proceedings against them as no criminal offence had been committed and that , in any event , the legal classification of the offence should be changed to a more lenient one . They submitted that as soon as they had noticed their error they had informed ORG and , on DATE , had paid the income tax in arrears with the statutory interest due . Therefore , the ORG had not sustained any loss . In their submissions , their conviction was a result of an overly formalistic , impractical and unreasonable approach of the tax authorities to the business activities and the tax obligations resulting therefrom .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed their appeals and upheld the contested decisions . No further appeal lay in law against this decision .", "The DATE LAW ( Ustawa Karna Skarbowa ) , applicable at the material time , distinguished CARDINAL types of wrongful acts in the area of fiscal law : \u201c fiscal crimes \u201d and \u201c fiscal offences \u201d ; fiscal offences being a category of less serious acts .", "LAW defined fiscal crimes as wrongful acts punishable by imprisonment , limitation of liberty or a fine between PLN CARDINAL and PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . By virtue of LAW , additional sanctions could be imposed for fiscal crimes such as : deprivation of civil rights , prohibition to exercise certain activities , confiscation of an object , and publication of the court judgment by which the offender was convicted .", "Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW defined fiscal offences as wrongful acts punishable by a \u201c pecuniary penalty \u201d ( as distinguished in terminology from \u201c fine \u201d ) MONEY . Under LAW , the additional sanction of confiscation of an object could also be imposed for a fiscal offence where the LAW expressly provided therefor .", "Under LAW , certain provisions of LAW of DATE , defining general notions of criminal responsibility , were applicable in proceedings concerning fiscal offences . The provisions in question concerned , inter alia , the definition of a punishable act , the prohibition of retroactivity , the definition of intentional and non - intentional offence , the age limit for liability , notions of attempted offence and aiding and abetting , the circumstances justifying exclusion of criminal liability , and the principles applicable to the determination of criminal sanctions .", "As provided by LAW , when pecuniary penalty exceeding ORG CARDINAL is imposed , it may be substituted by DATE imprisonment in default of payment .", "Pursuant to LAW , the courts were competent to examine cases concerning fiscal crimes punishable by imprisonment or limitation of liberty . Under LAW , cases concerning fiscal crimes in which only fines could be imposed , and cases concerning fiscal offences , were examined by fiscal administrative boards .", "Article CARDINAL of the Act stated that decisions given in proceedings concerning fiscal crimes and offences could be appealed against if the law so provided . The remedies were the following : an appeal , a request that the case be examined by a court , and an appeal against interlocutory decisions .", "Under LAW , in cases concerning fiscal crimes , a party to the proceedings could choose between an appeal to a higher administrative authority or a request that the case be examined by a court . An option to use one remedy barred the use of the other . In proceedings concerning fiscal offences , however , only an appeal to a higher administrative authority could be lodged .", "On DATE a legislative amendment to LAW was adopted to the effect that the demand that the case be examined by the court became available also with respect to fiscal offences . It entered into force on DATE .", "Subsequently , with effect as of DATE , the new LAW replaced the DATE LAW . According to the new law , the courts are competent to examine all cases concerning fiscal crimes and fiscal offences .", "On DATE , the new LAW entered into force in GPE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c In accordance with principles specified by statute , everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed , shall have the right to appeal to ORG for a judgment on the conformity with LAW of a statute or another normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in LAW . \u201d", "At the material time , the complaint had to be lodged within DATE from the date on which the individual decision was served ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ) . This time - limit was extended to DATE with effect as of DATE . Article CARDINAL of the LAW , insofar as relevant provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Judgments of the Constitutional Court shall be universally binding and final .", "CARDINAL . Judgments of ORG , ... shall be published without delay .", "CARDINAL . A judgment of the Constitutional Court shall take effect from DATE of its publication ; however , ORG may specify another date for DATE the binding force of a normative act . Such time - limit may not exceed DATE in relation to a statute or DATE in relation to any other normative act . Where a judgment has financial consequences not provided for in the ORG , the Constitutional Court shall specify a date for the end of the binding force of the normative act concerned , after seeking the opinion of ORG .", "CARDINAL . A judgment of ORG on the non - conformity with LAW , an international agreement or statute , of a normative act on the basis of which a legally effective judgment of a court , a final administrative decision or settlement of other matters was issued , shall be a basis for re - opening proceedings , or for quashing the decision or other settlement in a manner and on principles specified in provisions applicable to the given proceedings . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of LAW , as amended by LAW , provides , insofar as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c The Minister of Finance , in the exercise of his supervisory powers , shall , ex officio or upon request , amend or quash a final decision ... rendered on the basis of the legal provision which was found by ORG to be in contravention of the LAW , international agreement or statute .... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , provides , insofar as relevant :", "\u201c ORG should discontinue the proceedings ... when :", "[ ... ]", "CARDINAL . normative act challenged ... lost its binding force before the judgment of ORG was delivered . \u201d", "With effect as of DATE , an amendment was introduced which allows ORG to continue the proceedings if it considers it necessary for the protection of constitutional rights and freedoms .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "\u201c Within DATE of the day on which the LAW comes into force a judgment of ORG of the non - conformity with LAW of statutes adopted before its coming into force shall not be final and shall be required to be considered by the PERSON which may reject the judgment of ORG by a CARDINAL majority vote in the presence of CARDINAL of the statutory number of Deputies . The foregoing provision shall not concern judgments delivered by ORG upon requests for preliminary rulings . \u201d", "It was controversial among legal writers in GPE whether the PERSON was also empowered to reject judgments delivered upon individual complaints as this category was not expressly excluded from the scope of this provision . The issue had not arisen in practice as the PERSON has never rejected ORG judgments on individual complaints and the transitional period of DATE , referred to in the above provision , expired on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
