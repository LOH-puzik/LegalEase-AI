At present he sits in the second chamber ( PERSON ) of ORG , being one of the CARDINAL Senators elected by the graduates of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr PERSON is an active homosexual and has been a campaigner for homosexual rights in GPE since DATE ; in DATE he became a founder member and chairman of ORG . His complaints are directed against the existence in GPE of laws which make certain homosexual practices between consenting adult men criminal offences .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE the applicant instituted proceedings in ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) claiming that the impugned laws were no longer in force by reason of the effect of LAW , which declared that laws passed before LAW but which were inconsistent with it did not continue to be in force . Evidence was given of the extent to which the applicant had been affected by that legislation and had suffered interference with his right to respect for private life . Salient points in this evidence were summarised as follows :", "( i ) The applicant gave evidence of having suffered deep depression and loneliness on realising that he was irreversibly homosexual and that any overt expression of his sexuality would expose him to criminal prosecution .", "( ii ) The applicant claimed that his health had been affected when in DATE he fainted at a GPE restaurant and was sent to ORG for tests which resulted in his being referred to a psychiatrist . He was under the psychiatric care of Dr. PERSON for a period in excess of DATE . Dr. PERSON \u2019s advice to the applicant was that , if he wished to avoid anxiety attacks of this kind , he should leave GPE and live in a country where the laws relating to homosexual behaviour had been reformed . Dr. PERSON stated in evidence that the applicant was in a normal condition at the time of the first consultation . He did not recall being made aware of a history of collapse .", "( iii ) No attempt had been made to institute a prosecution against the applicant or the organisation of which the applicant was then the chairman ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant informed the police authorities of his organisation \u2019s activities but met with a sympathetic response and was never subjected to police questioning .", "( iv ) The applicant had participated in a television programme on ORG , the ORG broadcasting company , in or DATE . The programme consisted of an interview with him in the course of which he admitted to being a homosexual but denied that this was an illness or that it would prevent him from functioning as a normal member of society . A complaint was lodged against that programme . ORG report referred to the existing law criminalising homosexual activity and upheld the complaint on the ground that the programme was in breach of ORG in that it could be interpreted as advocacy of homosexual practices .", "( v ) The applicant gave evidence of suffering verbal abuse and threats of violence subsequent to the interview with him on ORG , which he attributed in some degree to the criminalising of homosexual activity . He also alleged in evidence that in the past his mail was opened by the postal authorities .", "( vi ) The applicant admitted to having a physical relationship with another man and that he feared that he or the person with whom he had the relationship , who normally lived outside GPE , could face prosecution .", "( vii ) The applicant also claimed to have suffered what PERSON Justice PERSON in a dissenting judgment in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) alluded to as follows :", "\" ... fear of prosecution or of social obloquy has restricted him in his social and other relations with male colleagues and friends : and in a number of subtle but insidiously intrusive and wounding ways he has been restricted in or thwarted from engaging in activities which heterosexuals take for granted as aspects of the necessary expression of their human personality and as ordinary incidents of their citizenship . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG It is common ground that at no time before or since the court proceedings brought by the applicant has he been charged with any offence in relation to his admitted homosexual activities . However , he remains legally at risk of being so prosecuted , either by ORG or by way of a private prosecution initiated by a common informer up to the stage of return for trial ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG NORP law does not make homosexuality as such a crime . But certain statutory provisions in force in GPE penalise certain homosexual activities .

Sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW should be read in conjunction with the provisions of LAW , section CARDINAL , by virtue of which the court is empowered to impose a lesser sentence of penal servitude than that mentioned in LAW or , in lieu thereof , a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding DATE or a fine . The provisions of LAW and of LAW are also subject to the power given to the court by LAW , to apply , by way of substitution , certain more lenient measures .", "The terms \" hard labour \" and \" penal servitude \" no longer have any practical significance , since anyone now sentenced to \" hard labour \" or \" penal servitude \" will , in practice , serve an ordinary prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW is the only CARDINAL of the legislative provisions attacked in the instant case that can be described as dealing solely with homosexual activities . What particular acts in any given case may be held to amount to gross indecency is a matter which is not statutorily defined and is therefore for the courts to decide on the particular facts of each case .", "CARDINAL . ORG The right to prosecute persons before a court other than a court of summary jurisdiction is governed by LAW , section CARDINAL of the LAW which is as follows :", "\" All crimes and offences prosecuted in any court constituted under LAW other than a court of summary jurisdiction shall be prosecuted in the name of ORG the suit of the Attorney General or some other person authorised in accordance with law to act for that purpose . \"", "Section CARDINAL of ORG , DATE , as adapted by LAW , DATE , provides that :", "\" All criminal charges prosecuted upon indictment in any court shall be prosecuted at the suit of the Attorney General of GPE . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The provisions of LAW DATE extended to ORG most of the prosecuting functions exercised by the Attorney General . ORG ( an office created by that LAW ) is independent of the ORG and a permanent official in ORG of the ORG as distinct from ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Any member of the public , whether an NORP citizen or not , has the right as a \" common informer \" to bring a private prosecution . He need not have any direct interest in the alleged offence or be personally affected by it . A private prosecutor \u2019s rights are limited in respect of offences which are not triable summarily . In ORG ) v. PERSON [ DATE ] Irish Reports CARDINAL , it was held by ORG that the effect of section CARDINAL of ORG DATE was that a private prosecutor may conduct a prosecution up to the point where the judge of ORG decides that the evidence is sufficient to warrant a committal for trial in cases of indictable offences i.e. triable with a jury . Thereafter the Attorney General , or now also ORG , becomes dominus litis and must then consider whether or not he should present an indictment against the accused who has been returned by ORG for trial with a jury .", "CARDINAL . ORG The offences which are at issue in the present case , namely those set out in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and in LAW of LAW , are indictable offences . Indictable offences are only triable summarily in ORG if the judge of ORG is of the opinion that the facts constitute a minor offence and the accused , on being informed of his right to trial by jury , expressly waives that right . This availability of summary trial is provided for by LAW DATE and is limited to those indictable offences set out in the Schedule to that Act . This does not include the offences under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The summary trial procedure is available in respect of an offence under LAW of LAW where the accused is over DATE and the person with whom the act is alleged to have been committed is legally unable to consent for being under DATE or an idiot , an imbecile or a feeble - minded person . Thus a summary trial can never be had in cases involving consenting adults and , save where the accused pleads guilty , the case can be heard only with a jury whether the prosecution was commenced by a private prosecutor or by ORG .", "Moreover , LAW permits a person charged with any indictable offence ( save an offence under LAW DATE , murder , attempt to murder , conspiracy to murder , piracy or an offence under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( i ) of LAW , DATE ) to plead guilty in ORG . If ORG , or the Attorney General , as the case may be , consents , the case may be disposed of summarily in that ORG . If sentence is imposed by ORG , it can not exceed CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . If the judge of ORG is of opinion that the offence warrants a greater penalty , he may send the accused forward to ORG for sentence . In such a case an accused may change his plea to CARDINAL of \" not guilty \" and the case will then be tried with a jury . ORG has a discretion to impose any sentence up to the limit permitted by the relevant statutory provision .", "CARDINAL . ORG Therefore , while a private prosecution may be initiated by a common informer , a prosecution brought under one of the impugned provisions can not proceed to trial before a jury unless an indictment is laid by ORG . According to ORG there have not been any private prosecutions arising out of the homosexual activity in private of consenting male adults since the inception of the ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The following statement was made by ORG in DATE , in reply to a question asked by the Commission :", "\" The Director has no stated prosecution policy on any branch of the criminal law . He has no unstated policy not to enforce any offence . Each case is treated on its merits . \"", "The Government \u2019s statistics show that no public prosecutions , in respect of homosexual activities , were brought during the relevant period except where minors were involved or the acts were committed in public or without consent .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE the applicant brought proceedings in the ORG seeking a declaration that sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and LAW of LAW were not continued in force since the enactment of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and therefore did not form part of NORP law . Mr Justice PERSON , in his judgment of DATE , found , among other facts , that \" CARDINAL of the effects of criminal sanctions against homosexual acts is to reinforce the misapprehension and general prejudice of the public and increase the anxiety and guilt feelings of homosexuals leading , on occasions , to depression and the serious consequences which can follow from that unfortunate disease \" . However , he dismissed Mr PERSON \u2019s action on legal grounds .", "CARDINAL . ORG On appeal , ORG , by a CARDINAL - to - CARDINAL majority decision of CARDINAL DATE , upheld the judgment of ORG . ORG was satisfied that the applicant had locus standi to bring an action for a declaration even though he had not been prosecuted for any of the offences in question . The majority held that \" as long as the legislation stands and continues to proclaim as criminal the conduct which the plaintiff asserts he has a right to engage in , such right , if it exists , is threatened , and the plaintiff has standing to seek the protection of the court \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the course of these proceedings it was contended on behalf of the applicant that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE of ORG in the PERSON case ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) should be followed . In support of this plea , it was argued that , since GPE had ratified LAW , there arose a presumption that LAW was compatible with the LAW and that , in considering a question as to inconsistency under LAW , regard should be had to whether the laws being considered are consistent with the LAW itself .", "In rejecting these submissions , Chief Justice O\u2019Higgins , in the majority judgment , stated that \" the ORG is an international agreement \" which \" does not and can not form part of [ GPE \u2019s ] domestic law nor affect in any way questions which arise thereunder \" . The Chief Justice said : \" This is made quite clear by LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW which declares : - \u2018 No international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the ORG save as may be determined by the ORG \"", "In fact , ORG already noted in its judgment of DATE in the PERSON case ( Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) that the ORG had not introduced legislation to make ORG part of the municipal law of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered the laws making homosexual conduct criminal to be consistent with the LAW and that no right of privacy encompassing consensual homosexual activity could be derived from \" the NORP and democratic nature of ORG \" so as to prevail against the operation of such sanctions . In its majority decision , ORG based itself , inter alia , on the following considerations :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) Homosexuality has always been condemned in NORP teaching as being morally wrong . It has equally been regarded by society for DATE as an offence against nature and a very serious crime .", "( CARDINAL ) Exclusive homosexuality , whether the condition be congenital or acquired , can result in great distress and unhappiness for the individual and can lead to depression , despair and suicide .", "( CARDINAL ) The homosexually oriented can be importuned into a homosexual lifestyle which can become habitual .", "( CARDINAL ) Male homosexual conduct has resulted , in other countries , in the spread of all forms of venereal disease and this has now become a significant public health problem in GPE .", "( CARDINAL ) Homosexual conduct can be inimical to marriage and is per se harmful to it as an institution . \"", "ORG , however , awarded the applicant his costs , both of the proceedings before ORG and of the appeal to ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
