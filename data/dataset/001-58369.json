This question must be considered in the light of how the statements were perceived by the ordinary newspaper reader . Moreover , the statements must not be interpreted separately . The decisive factor must be how they were understood when the articles were read as a whole . The position is somewhat different , however , as far as justification is concerned . The ORG will revert to this matter below . Even though the statements are to be considered on the basis of an overall assessment , it would nevertheless be correct to accord weight to the fact that the matter was splashed across the front page in bold type . The first impression given was thus that something serious had occurred . This impression was not appreciably lessened or altered by the more detailed article inside the newspaper .

It goes without saying that skinning an animal alive causes severe pain to it . When read as a whole , the statement must be understood to apply not only to one seal , but to several . It gives the impression that the seal hunters not infrequently skinned seals while they were still alive .", "The other statement reads : \u2018 Not least the report includes an account of his being beaten up by furious hunters , who also threatened to hit him on the head with a gaff if he did not keep PERSON . This statement must imply that the seal hunters had assaulted PERSON , which , objectively speaking , amounts to a criminal act , cf . LAW . The threat to hit him on the head with their gaffs if he did not keep quiet comes within the objective description of the offence set out in LAW . The allegation must therefore be understood to mean that the seal hunters had committed CARDINAL offences . Such a statement must clearly be considered defamatory .", "As regards the statements concerning female harp seals , it is not disputed that such seal hunting was not permitted in DATE .

In this regard , reference is made to LAW , according to which the seal shall first be struck with the blunt end of the gaff and then with the spike . The reason for this is that the animals are to be knocked unconscious before they are killed with the spike . The statement must imply that the blows with the blunt end had been omitted .", "A breach of the regulations constitutes a criminal offence . It is regarded as a misdemeanour and may be punished by a fine . Generally speaking , an allegation of such a violation must also be considered to be defamatory ...", "In the ORG \u2019s view , the statements relating to the killing of female harp seals must be regarded as defamatory .", "Hunting for this species of seal was not permitted at all in DATE . The statements do not differ from allegations of illegal hunting in general and imply that the crew behaved in a morally reprehensible manner . The ORG will deal below with the question as to whether the statements can be regarded as substantiated and thus lawful .", "The ORG is , however , in doubt as regards the statement quoted in item CARDINAL . It is not alleged that the seal pups were made to suffer , but simply that the killing methods used were not in accordance with the regulations . Given that it is not alleged that the seal pups were made to suffer , the statement can hardly be interpreted as implying strong moral condemnation of the seal hunter . ... The decisive question is whether the killing is carried out in a responsible manner . The statement can not be understood to mean that it was not . At any rate , given the fact that it was not suggested that the pups had been made to suffer , the matter must be regarded as trivial . The court has , with some doubt , reached the conclusion that the statement can not be considered defamatory .", "Accordingly , with the exception of item CARDINAL , the statements must fall within CARDINAL of the situations described in LAW , i.e. \u2018 to harm another person \u2019s good name or GPE , and \u2018 to expose him to ... loss of the confidence necessary for his position or DATE . There can be no doubt that the statements were capable of having such effects . In this regard , the defendants have pointed out that considerable sympathy was shown to the crew during the ensuing public debate . The legal requirement is , however , that the statements were \u2018 capable\u2019 of doing harm . The ensuing debate revealed that opinions about the hunting process differed .", "There has been considerable opposition to seal hunting for DATE , particularly at the international level . Although many people in GPE , especially in northern GPE , were opposed to PERSON , this did not automatically mean that there was a corresponding support for the seal hunters .

Apart from this , the crew members were not much involved in the debate about other aspects of seal hunting , in particular , the ecological aspect of the debate was especially heated during the so - called seal invasions at DATE .", "It is undisputed that the group of persons to whom the statements apply is not so wide as to leave unaffected the individuals concerned . The defendants have thus not argued that deletion [ of names ] ensured sufficient anonymity . Even though the names of individual seal hunters had been deleted , it was clear that the NORP was the vessel at issue . Therefore , everyone who was on board must be seen as having been aggrieved by the statements ... In fact the deletion had an effect which was contrary to its purpose . In the report CARDINAL of the crew are named as having committed offences . If the newspaper had not deleted the names , the group of persons targeted would have been reduced correspondingly ...", "Although the statements objectively fall within the scope of LAW , it is also a requirement that they be \u2018 unlawful\u2019 [ rettsstridig ] . In this regard the defendants have submitted several arguments . Firstly , it is argued that the seal hunting matter in GPE was probably the biggest news story in DATE . It is argued that in such a situation the press must enjoy a great deal of latitude in order to enable it to highlight all aspects of the matter ( the \u2018 public interest\u2019 point of view ) ...", "The ORG accepts that an extensive freedom of expression must apply to discussion on matters of general public interest . This consideration is precisely the linchpin of LAW and it is essential in a democratic society ... In spite of this , however , there are some limitations . Firstly , the ORG has in mind that certain requirements relating to privacy and truth must be taken into account . ... All the statements complained of must be understood to mean that the crew of the NORP committed unlawful acts . This is the main theme of the newspaper articles of CARDINAL and DATE .", "It hardly appears to the ORG that the newspaper \u2019s presentation of the matter , particularly on DATE , was primarily intended to promote a serious debate on matters of public interest . It focused on the criminal aspects . The public debate for and against seal hunting definitely remained in the background . The form in which the material was presented must also be taken into consideration . The affair was splashed across the front page in bold type . Words such as \u2018 lie\u2019 are used in CARDINAL of the headings of the articles that follow . The ORG is definitely of the impression that the primary motive of the newspaper was to be the first to print the story . In particular the front - page article is of a sensational nature . Sufficient attention was not paid to the protection of other persons in this disclosure . The newspaper was also aware that the material was sensitive and had thus particular reason to proceed with caution . The journalist , PERSON PERSON , had been told , presumably on DATE , during a telephone conversation with ORG , that the report was exempt from public disclosure . In the light of this , the ORG can not see that the newsworthiness of the matter could justify the manner in which it was presented .", "Secondly , it has been argued that the publication concerns an official document . According to the newspaper , such documents are reliable sources which one should be able to trust . In this regard , reference is being made to LAW . Generally speaking , the ORG agrees that official documents must normally be considered as good journalistic sources . How good they are , however , depends on the circumstances . In the present case , the newspaper was aware that the report had been exempt from public disclosure and the reasons therefor . The ORG wished to investigate the matter more closely before deciding whether to make the report public . Mr PERSON was also aware that the allegation that seals had been skinned alive would sound like a tall story . Mr PERSON himself kept sheep and had some insight into the killing of animals . In spite of this , the matter was given wide coverage . In the circumstances , the newspaper clearly should have investigated the matter more closely before printing the material . On the evidence adduced , the ORG finds that no investigation had been made . In his testimony , Mr PERSON , Secretary General of ORG , stated that , as a matter of press ethics , it was objectionable to print the allegation that seals had been skinned alive if PERSON was aware that it was untrue .", "Statements based on an inspection report clearly fall outside the ambit of LAW . This provision is exhaustive ...", "... The defendants have invoked LAW . In this connection what is called the \u2018 public interest\u2019 point of view has been stressed . This may be described as the doctrine of unrestricted freedom of expression with regard to matters of public interest . Although the ORG has in fact already dealt with this point , it sees reason to comment that the present case differs from the DATE ORG case and the PERSON v. GPE case .", "The latter case concerned in particular the expression of political opinions . Mr PERSON , the editor , had used such expressions as \u2018 the basest ORG , \u2018 immoral\u2019 and \u2018 ORG to describe certain aspects of Chancellor PERSON \u2019s character . These are value judgments and are not , like the statements in the present case , linked to facts ...", "A defamatory statement which is true is not unlawful , cf . LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . In the present case , the defendants have admitted that , except in the case of one female harp seal , no proof has been adduced . However , it has been argued that PERSON produced photos showing that several female harp seals had been killed . Notwithstanding the said admission by the defence , the ORG will assess the matter for itself . As regards item CARDINAL of the allegations , it has clearly not been proved that the statement was true or probably true . On the contrary , Mr PERSON was of the opinion that the statement had to be inaccurate . Mr PERSON and PERSON have submitted CARDINAL different versions . As to item CARDINAL there is no reason for the ORG to give greater credence to PERSON than to PERSON can not see that there are other circumstances that would support this statement . Thus there is no evidence to substantiate the statement .", "As regards the killing of female harp seals ORG states at p. CARDINAL of its report : \u2018 Our conclusion is that we must regard the allegations about the killing of QUANTITY female harp seals as highly improbable.\u2019 It is , however , a fact that the NORP was carrying the skin of a female harp seal when it returned from LOC . [ Crew member PERSON \u2019s ] explanation was that [ crew member PERSON ] had killed a harp seal pup . Its mother had been nowhere in sight . She had turned up afterwards and had attacked [ H. ] . He had become frightened and had tried to hit her on the nose with his gaff . He had , however , hit her too hard , so that she had started bleeding . The mother had been killed because of the blood . This is the matter referred to in item CARDINAL . The ORG can not see that the statement gives an objectively incorrect impression of what occurred . This does not imply that the ORG finds that [ H. ] acted unlawfully . If he acted in self - defence , his action was not unjustified . This question the ORG does not need to determine . Against this background the expression will not be declared null and void .", "The other statements concerning female harp seals have not ... been substantiated by documentary evidence . The seal hunters deny that CARDINAL female harp seal had been killed . In his testimony Mr PERSON referred to photos which , in his view , substantiated the statements . He refused to produce the photos so that they could be assessed by experts . DATE after [ his ] testimony ... an article appeared in ... PERSON , accompanied by a photo of female harp seals . According to the seal hunters , the photo dated back to DATE , when such seal hunting had been permitted . The ORG can not base its decision on newspaper articles but only on what has taken place during the main hearing . Therefore it must be obvious that the other statements can not be regarded as having been proved . Moreover , the ORG is somewhat surprised by PERSON refusal to produce the photos in court .", "To sum up , the ORG observes that the conditions have been fulfilled for declaring null and void the statements cited in items CARDINAL , TIME , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the allegations . The expression cited in item CARDINAL is not deemed to be defamatory , whereas that cited in item CARDINAL is deemed to have been proved true .", "It is not a requirement for declaring the statements null and void that the conditions for imposing a penalty have been fulfilled ... ORG will consider the question of liability when discussing the claim for damages .", "The conditions for awarding damages are set out in sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW DATE ( GPE , CARDINAL DATE , no . CARDINAL ) \u2026 Only [ compensation for non - pecuniary damage ] has been claimed . It is being specifically argued that the newspaper must be deemed to have acted negligently and that it would be reasonable if the ORG were to make an award for non - pecuniary damage . In its assessment , the ORG will attach weight to the existence of negligence as well as other circumstances . Thus , a number of factors are relevant to its determination of the compensation issue . In the ORG \u2019s view , the newspaper has behaved negligently . It had made no further investigation prior to the publication of the material in question , despite this having been called for in the circumstances . The ORG has expressed its views on this point above . As regards the compensation claim , it must nevertheless consider the significance of the measures taken to preserve anonymity . The deletion of names did not mean that the crew members could not be identified . As the name of the vessel , NORP , was clearly stated , it was easy to find out the identity of the crew . The individual seal hunters were known to their neighbours , acquaintances , families , etc . The newspaper must have been aware of this . In any event , it ought to have known that there was a real risk that the persons in question would be identified .", "The ORG finds it reasonable that the plaintiffs be awarded compensation . The newspaper coverage caused such inconvenience to the crew members and damage to their reputation as to justify upholding their claim . A total of CARDINAL seals were caught during the expedition to LOC . Even though it is probable that some violations of the seal hunting regulations occurred , the rendering of PERSON report gave a grossly distorted picture . The main impression is that the regulations were essentially complied with .", "As far as [ the second applicant ] is concerned , sections CARDINAL must be read in conjunction with LAW . The editor was at his cottage at the time and was not fully aware of the contents of the matters printed . Nonetheless , he did consent to the material being printed . Mr PERSON has not invoked the exception clause on freedom from liability . Accordingly , [ he ] must also be considered liable for the newspaper articles . This in turn will have a bearing on the compensation issue .", "...", "There are factors militating in favour of awarding a substantial amount in compensation : in the first place , certain statements in the preparatory work and , secondly , the degree of abusiveness of the material and the extent to which it was disseminated . In this connection it should be noted that PERSON has been ordered to pay each of the plaintiffs ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] . \u2026 In determining the amount , importance has been attached to the fact that the statements were widely disseminated . Given that this factor has already been taken into account , it must carry a little lesser weight in the case against the newspaper . Otherwise the crew would to some extent receive double compensation .", "Moreover , the newspaper was aware that the material was sensitive and that CARDINAL of the allegations was false . A further factor is the form in which the material was presented , as is the fact that no investigations had been made . In addition , the newspaper did not apologise for having printed the material .", "A factor pointing in the opposite direction is , in particular , the fact that the crew members were permitted to express their views . Generally speaking , the seal hunting matter was one of the biggest news stories in DATE . This fact must be accorded some weight , although it does not free the newspaper from liability . In the light of the circumstances , the ORG can not see that importance should be attached to the fact that inspector reports are normally public documents . PERSON report had been exempt from public disclosure . Nor is it significant that the report was eventually also published by PERSON . This fact was only mentioned but was not elaborated upon during the main hearing . The ORG has no knowledge of the context , circumstances , etc . The financial standing of [ the first applicant ] is of significance . The ORG finds that the newspaper has been in somewhat strained circumstances for DATE . Still its gross DATE turnover is said to be approximately ORG CARDINAL .", "Accordingly , each of the plaintiffs is to be paid ORG CARDINAL in compensation , of which ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL are to be paid by the newspaper , and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL by the editor . The newspaper is also jointly and severally liable with the editor for the amount he has to pay . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought leave to appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) , alleging that ORG had made an error of law . On DATE , ORG of ORG decided not to allow the appeal , finding it obvious that the appeal would not succeed .", "CARDINAL . The crew of the ORG also brought defamation proceedings against other media companies , including the newspaper GPE , its editor and journalist , in respect of an article published on DATE on the seal hunting issue . The action did not relate to an article of DATE in which GPE reproduced Mr PERSON \u2019s statements , published by PERSON , to the effect that seals had been flayed alive .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the action . ORG found that , although the impugned article had contained several allegations that seal hunting regulations had been violated , the manner of journalistic reporting at issue could not be considered \u201c unlawful \u201d ( \u201c rettsstridig \u201d ) .", "ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c PERSON received the report from PERSON in DATE and published a major article on DATE , in which it was claimed that seals had been \u2018 skinned ORG .

Its contents had been disputed by the seal hunters , a shipowner and ORG . All the different points of view had been reported in GPE . Despite the refutations of the report made by the seal hunters and ORG , its contents had not been effectively and objectively refuted \u2026", "GPE \u2019s report on DATE amounted to a continuation of the seal hunting debate which had already started . Attacks had been made against the report and these PERSON wished to counter , through the newspaper DATE together with photographs . The debate was going on and it was only natural that GPE allowed PERSON to present his version of the matter \u2026 The ORG considers that GPE \u2019s article enabled the discussion to progress .", "GPE \u2019s presentation is an objective , balanced account in defence of Mr PERSON \u2019s report .

PERSON focuses on the lawfulness of the existing seal hunting methods and has no intention of exposing the seal hunters to public contempt by means of malicious coverage ... The coverage clearly can not be compared to the article printed in ... PERSON on DATE . The ORG would also point out that GPE fairly consistently refers to PERSON as its source . Although the heading , when seen together with the photos , suggests that there have been violations of the regulations and cruelty to animals , these violations are not particularly highlighted . The newspaper focuses on the seal hunting case . It should also be noted that on DATE the sealers were given an opportunity , in a conspicuous place , to refute the inspector \u2019s report . This indicates that there was an ongoing debate on a matter of public interest in which the parties involved were , in a proper manner , given an opportunity to express their views . PERSON \u2019s coverage of the seal hunting case is characterised precisely by reciprocity : PERSON maintained that , from a journalistic point of view , the coverage of DATE was exemplary . The ORG agrees with the newspaper \u2019s view , particularly as regards the situation that obtained prior to the article published on DATE .", "The ORG does not see any reason to examine whether GPE has adduced proof . ORG report \u2026 concludes that the regulations have clearly been breached . At p. CARDINAL , the Commission states :", "\u2018 We can not avoid mentioning that during the period under consideration the implementation of the hunting regulations has been characterised by several defects which on the whole are not insignificant.\u2019", "The ensuing circumstances thus demonstrate that GPE to a large degree could substantiate the allegations that the rules had been breached . Mr PERSON \u2019s report was not a serious work and suffered from a number of shortcomings , but parts of it proved later to be accurate .", "Accordingly , the ORG concludes that GPE \u2019s coverage was not unwarranted .

The applicants have referred to a judgment of ORG , in which it accepted the standard applied by the lower court in a criminal libel case concerning allegations made in a television programme and a newspaper that a private practising lawyer had recommended his spouse to commit tax offences in connection with a property sale . In view of the seriousness of the accusation , it was found appropriate in that case to apply the same standard of proof as would apply to a public prosecutor in criminal proceedings on tax evasion .
