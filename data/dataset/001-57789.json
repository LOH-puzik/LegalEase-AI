The applicants in this case are ( a ) Open Door Counselling Ltd ( hereinafter referred to as Open Door ) , a company incorporated under NORP law , which was engaged , inter alia , in counselling pregnant women in GPE and in other parts of GPE ; and ( b ) GPE Well FAC ( hereinafter referred to as GPE Well Woman ) , a company also incorporated under NORP law which provided similar services at CARDINAL clinics in GPE ; ( c ) PERSON and PERSON , who worked as trained counsellors for GPE Well Woman ; ( d ) PERSON , born in DATE and ORG , born in DATE , who join in the GPE Well Woman application as women of child - bearing age . The applicants complained of an injunction imposed by the NORP courts on Open Door and GPE Well Woman to restrain them from providing certain information to pregnant women concerning abortion facilities outside the jurisdiction of GPE by way of non - directive counselling ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "Open Door and GPE Well Woman are both non - profit- making organisations . Open Door ceased to operate in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . GPE Well Woman was established in DATE and provides a broad range of services relating to counselling and marriage , family planning , procreation and health matters . The services offered by GPE Well Woman relate to every aspect of women \u2019s health , ranging from smear tests to breast examinations , infertility , artificial insemination and the counselling of pregnant women .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , at the time of the referendum leading to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , GPE Well Woman issued a pamphlet stating inter alia that legal advice on the implications of the wording of the provision had been obtained and that \" with this wording anybody could seek a court injunction to prevent us offering \" the non - directive counselling service . The pamphlet also warned that \" it would also be possible for an individual to seek a court injunction to prevent a woman travelling abroad if they believe she intends to have an abortion \" .", "CARDINAL . The applicant companies were the defendants in proceedings before ORG which were commenced on DATE as a private action brought by ORG ( hereinafter referred to as GPE ) , which was converted into a relator action brought at the suit of the Attorney General by order of ORG of DATE ( the Attorney General at the relation of ORG v. Open ORG and GPE Well ORG [ DATE ] ORG , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . GPE sought a declaration that the activities of the applicant companies in counselling pregnant women within the jurisdiction of the court to travel abroad to obtain an abortion were unlawful having regard to LAW which protects the right to life of the unborn ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and an order restraining the defendants from such counselling or assistance .", "CARDINAL . No evidence was adduced at the hearing of the action which proceeded on the basis of certain agreed facts . The facts as agreed at that time by GPE Well Woman may be summarised as follows :", "( a ) It counsels in a non - directive manner pregnant women resident in GPE ;", "( b ) Abortion or termination of pregnancy may be one of the options discussed within the said counselling ;", "( c ) If a pregnant woman wants to consider the abortion option further , arrangements will be made by the applicant to refer her to a medical clinic in GPE ;", "( d ) In certain circumstances , the applicant may arrange for the travel of such pregnant women ;", "( e ) The applicant will inspect the medical clinic in GPE to ensure that it operates at the highest standards ;", "( f ) At those medical clinics abortions have been performed on pregnant women who have been previously counselled by the applicant ;", "( g ) Pregnant women resident in GPE have been referred to medical clinics in GPE where abortions have been performed for DATE .", "The facts agreed by Open Door were the same as above with the exception of point ( d ) .", "CARDINAL . The meaning of the concept of non - directive counselling was described in the following terms by Mr Justice PERSON in the judgment of ORG in the case ( judgment of DATE , [ DATE ] NORP Reports CARDINAL at p. CARDINAL ) :", "\" It was submitted on behalf of each of the Defendants that the meaning of non - directive counselling in these agreed sets of facts was that it was counselling which neither included advice nor was judgmental but that it was a service essentially directed to eliciting from the client her own appreciation of her problem and her own considered choice for its solution . This interpretation of the phrase \u2018 non - directive counselling\u2019 in the context of the activities of the Defendants was not disputed on behalf of the Respondent . It follows from this , of course , that non- directive counselling to pregnant women would never involve the actual advising of an abortion as the preferred option but neither , of course , could it permit the giving of advice for any reason to the pregnant women receiving such counselling against choosing to have an abortion . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON , President of ORG , found that the activities of Open Door and GPE Well Woman in counselling pregnant women within the jurisdiction of the court to travel abroad to obtain an abortion or to obtain further advice on abortion within a foreign jurisdiction were unlawful having regard to the provisions of LAW .", "He confirmed that NORP criminal law made it an offence to procure or attempt to procure an abortion , to administer an abortion or to assist in an abortion by supplying any noxious thing or instrument ( sections DATE of the Offences against LAW DATE paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Furthermore , NORP constitutional law also protected the right to life of the unborn from the moment of conception DATE .", "An injunction was accordingly granted \" ... that the Defendants [ Open Door and GPE Well Woman ] and each of them , their servants or agents , be perpetually restrained from counselling or assisting pregnant women within the jurisdiction of this Court to obtain further advice on abortion or to obtain an abortion \" . ORG made no order relating to the costs of the proceedings , leaving each side to bear its own legal costs .", "CARDINAL . Open Door and GPE Well Woman appealed against this decision to ORG which in a unanimous judgment delivered on DATE by Mr Justice PERSON rejected the appeal .", "ORG noted that the appellants did not consider it essential to the service which they provided for pregnant women in GPE that they should take any part in arranging the travel of women who wished to go abroad for the purpose of having an abortion or that they arranged bookings in clinics for such women . However , they did consider it essential to inform women who wished to have an abortion outside the jurisdiction of the court of the name , address , telephone number and method of communication with a specified clinic which they had examined and were satisfied was one which maintained a high standard .", "CARDINAL . On the question of whether the above activity should be restrained as being contrary to the LAW , Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\" ... the essential issues in this case do not in any way depend upon the Plaintiff establishing that the Defendants were advising or encouraging the procuring of abortions . The essential issue in this case , having regard to the nature of the guarantees contained in LAW , s.CARDINAL , sub - s.CARDINAL of LAW , is the issue as to whether the GPE admitted activities were assisting pregnant women within the jurisdiction to travel outside that jurisdiction in order to have an abortion . To put the matter in another way , the issue and the question of fact to be determined is : were they thus assisting in the destruction of the life of the unborn ?", "I am satisfied beyond doubt that having regard to the admitted facts the Defendants were assisting in the ultimate destruction of the life of the unborn by abortion in that they were helping the pregnant woman who had decided upon that option to get in touch with a clinic in GPE which would provide the service of abortion . It seems to me an inescapable conclusion that if a woman was anxious to obtain an abortion and if she was able by availing of the counselling services of CARDINAL or other of the Defendants to obtain the precise location , address and telephone number of , and method of communication with , a clinic in GPE which provided that service , put in plain language , that was knowingly helping her to attain her objective . I am , therefore , satisfied that the finding made by the learned trial Judge that the Defendants were assisting pregnant women to travel abroad to obtain further advice on abortion and to secure an abortion is well supported on the evidence ... \"", "The ORG further noted that the phrase in LAW with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother \" did not arise for interpretation in the case since the applicants were not claiming that the service they were providing for pregnant women was \" in any way confined to or especially directed towards the due regard to the equal right to life of the mother ... \" .", "CARDINAL . Open Door and GPE Well Woman had submitted that if they did not provide this counselling service it was likely that pregnant women would succeed nevertheless in obtaining an abortion in circumstances less advantageous to their health . The ORG rejected this argument in the following terms :", "\" Even if it could be established , however , it would not be a valid reason why the ORG should not restrain the activities in which the defendants were engaged .", "The function of the courts , which is not dependent on the existence of legislation , when their jurisdiction to defend and vindicate a constitutionally guaranteed right has been invoked , must be confined to the issues and to the parties before them .", "If the ORG enacts legislation to defend and vindicate a constitutionally guaranteed right it may well do so in wider terms than are necessary for the resolution of any individual case . The courts can not take that wide approach . They are confined to dealing with the parties and issues before them . I am satisfied , therefore , that it is no answer to the making of an order restraining these GPE activities that there may be other persons or the activities of other groups or bodies which will provide the same result as that assisted by these GPE activities . \"", "CARDINAL . As to whether there was a constitutional right to information about the availability of abortion outside the ORG , the court stated as follows :", "\" The performing of an abortion on a pregnant woman terminates the unborn life which she is carrying . Within the terms of Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINALo it is a direct destruction of the constitutionally guaranteed right to life of that unborn child .", "It must follow from this that there could not be an implied and unenumerated constitutional right to information about the availability of a service of abortion outside the ORG which , if availed of , would have the direct consequence of destroying the expressly guaranteed constitutional right to life of the unborn . As part of the submission on this issue it was further suggested that the right to receive and give information which , it was alleged , existed and was material to this case was , though not expressly granted , impliedly referred to or involved in the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions provided by DATE , s.CARDINAL , sub - s.CARDINAL ( i ) of the LAW , since , it was claimed , the right to express freely convictions and opinions may , under some circumstances , involve as an ancillary right the right to obtain information . I am satisfied that no right could constitutionally arise to obtain information the purpose of the obtaining of which was to defeat the constitutional right to life of the unborn child . \"", "CARDINAL . The court upheld the decision of ORG to grant an injunction but varied the terms of the order as follows :", "\" ... that the defendants and each of them , their servants or agents be perpetually restrained from assisting pregnant women within the jurisdiction to travel abroad to obtain abortions by referral to a clinic , by the making for them of travel arrangements , or by informing them of the identity and location of and the method of communication with a specified clinic or clinics or otherwise . \"", "The costs of ORG appeal were awarded against the applicant companies on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the judgment of ORG , Open Door , having no assets , ceased its activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE applied to ORG for a declaration that the dissemination in certain student publications of information concerning the identity and location of abortion clinics outside the jurisdiction was unlawful and for an injunction restraining its distribution . Their standing to apply to the courts for measures to protect the right to life of the unborn had previously been recognised by ORG following a similar action in the case of ORG v. ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG decided to refer certain questions to ORG for a preliminary ruling under LAW concerning , inter alia , the question whether the right to information concerning abortion services outside GPE was protected by Community law .", "CARDINAL . An appeal was brought against this decision and , on DATE , ORG granted an interlocutory injunction restraining the students from \" publishing or distributing or assisting in the printing , publishing or distribution of any publication produced under their aegis providing information to persons ( including pregnant women ) of the identity and location of and the method of communication with a specified clinic or clinics where abortions are performed \" ( ORG ( Ireland ) Ltd v. PERSON and Others , [ DATE ] ORG , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "Mr Justice PERSON ( with whom Mr Justice PERSON , Mr Justice PERSON and Mr Justice PERSON concurred ) considered that the reasoning of the court in the case brought against the applicant companies applied to the activities of the students :", "\" I reject as unsound the contention that the activity involved in this case of publishing in the ORG manuals the name , address and telephone number , when telephoned from this ORG , of abortion clinics in GPE , and distributing such manuals in GPE , can be distinguished from the activity condemned by ORG in [ the Open Door Counselling case ] on the grounds that the facts of that case were that the information was conveyed during periods of CARDINAL to CARDINAL non - directive counselling . It is clearly the fact that such information is conveyed to pregnant women , and not the method of communication which creates the unconstitutional illegality , and the judgment of ORG in the Open Door Counselling case is not open to any other interpretation . \"", "Mr Justice PERSON also considered that an injunction should be issued and commented as follows :", "\" In the light of the availability of such information from a variety of sources , such as imported magazines , etc . , I am far from satisfied that the granting of an injunction to restrain these defendants from publishing the material impugned would save the life of a single unborn child , but I am more than satisfied that if the courts fail to enforce , and enforce forthwith , that guarantee as construed in ORG ) v. Open ORG ( [ DATE ] NORP Reports CARDINAL ) , then the rule of law will be set at nought . \"", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE on the questions referred under LAW , following ORG judgment , ORG of ORG ruled that the medical termination of pregnancy , performed in accordance with the law of the ORG in which it is carried out , constitutes a service within the meaning of LAW . However it found that the link between the activity of the student associations and medical terminations of pregnancy carried out in clinics in another member ORG was too tenuous for the prohibition on the distribution of information to be capable of being regarded as a restriction on the freedom to supply services within the meaning of LAW . The Court did not examine whether the prohibition was in breach of LAW ) of the LAW . In the light of its conclusions concerning the restriction on services it considered that it had no jurisdiction with regard to national legislation \" lying outside the scope of Community law \" . Accordingly , the restrictions on the publication of information by student associations were not considered to be contrary to Community law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above , ORG ( Ireland ) Ltd v. PERSON and Others [ DATE ] ORG Reports I , pp . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The interpretation to be given to LAW also arose before ORG in the case of The Attorney General v. X and Others which concerned an application to the courts by the Attorney General for an injunction to prevent a CARDINAL-year - old girl who was pregnant from leaving the jurisdiction to have an abortion abroad . The girl alleged that she had been raped and had expressed the desire to commit suicide . ORG , in its judgment of DATE , found that termination of pregnancy was permissible under LAW it was established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother if such termination was not effected . Finding that this test was satisfied on the facts of the case ORG discharged the injunction which had been granted by ORG at first instance .", "A majority of CARDINAL judges of ORG ( PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . ) expressed the view that Article CARDINAL empowered the courts in proper cases to restrain by injunction a pregnant woman from leaving the jurisdiction to have an abortion so that the right to life of the unborn might be defended and vindicated .", "During the oral hearing before ORG , the Government made the following statement in the light of ORG judgment in this case :", "\" ... persons who are deemed to be entitled under NORP law to avail themselves of termination of pregnancy in these circumstances must be regarded as being entitled to have appropriate access to information in relation to the facilities for such operations , either in GPE or abroad . \"", "CARDINAL . The applicants presented evidence to the ORG that there had been no significant drop in the number of NORP women having abortions in GPE since the granting of the injunction , that number being well over QUANTITY women per year . They also submitted an opinion from an expert in public health ( Dr PERSON ) which concludes that there are CARDINAL possible adverse implications for the health of NORP women arising from the injunction in the present case :", "CARDINAL . An increase in the birth of unwanted and rejected children ;", "CARDINAL . An increase in illegal and unsafe abortions ;", "CARDINAL . A lack of adequate preparation of NORP women obtaining abortions ;", "CARDINAL . Increases in delay in obtaining abortions with ensuing increased complication rates ;", "CARDINAL . Poor aftercare with a failure to deal adequately with medical complications and a failure to provide adequate contraceptive advice .", "In their written comments to the Court , GPE claimed that the number of abortions obtained by NORP women in GPE , which had been rising rapidly prior to the enactment of Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINALo , had increased at a much reduced pace . They further submitted that the number of births to married women had increased at a \" very substantial rate \" .", "CARDINAL . The applicants claimed that the impugned information was available in NORP newspapers and magazines which were imported into GPE as well as in the yellow pages of the GPE telephone directory which could be purchased from the NORP telephone service . It was also available in publications such as ORG which was obtainable in GPE .", "While not challenging the accuracy of the above information the Government observed that no newspaper or magazine had been produced in evidence to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINALo of LAW ( LAW ) , which came into force in DATE following a referendum , reads :", "\" The ORG acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and , with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother , guarantees in its laws to respect , and , as far as practicable , by its laws to defend and vindicate that right . \"", "This provision has been interpreted by ORG in the present case , in the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children ( Ireland ) Ltd v.

Apart from the present case and subsequent developments ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , reference has been made to the right to life of the unborn in various decisions of ORG ( see , for example , PERSON v.

The right to life necessarily implies the right to be born , the right to preserve and defend and to have preserved and defended that life ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG has also stated that the courts are the custodians of the fundamental rights set out in the LAW and that their powers in this regard are as ample as the defence of LAW requires ( The State ( Quinn ) v.
