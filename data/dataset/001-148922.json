NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a \u201c permanently resident noncitizen \u201d of GPE who was born in DATE and is currently serving a prison sentence GPE . He was represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE the applicant was detained in FAC ( GPE cietums ) . Prior to DATE it had been named Daugavpils Prison ( NORP cietums ) . In the course of his detention the applicant also spent certain periods of time in other prisons . It appears that he stayed in FAC until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG about the conditions in FAC . He asked to be released until prison conditions had been improved and requested a monetary compensation of CARDINAL NORP lati ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . First of all , he submitted that the prison was overcrowded . He was housed in cell no . CARDINAL , which was occupied by QUANTITY persons , even though it had been designed for CARDINAL . The situation was similar in other prison cells . On DATE he had been transported to a hospital owing to heart problems . Upon his release from the hospital he had been returned to the same cell no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant , a non - smoker , was exposed to cigarette smoke on a DATE basis .", "CARDINAL . Also , CARDINAL sets of bunk beds had been placed next to each other . The applicant had to sleep next to another man , and another inmate was sleeping above the applicant . His sleep suffered as a result , and his nervous system was also negatively affected .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant submitted that the cells were not equipped with emergency buttons in order to call for help . He generally stated that he was unable to purchase the necessary products in the prison shop .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s aforementioned complaint .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the issue of living space , ORG found that the applicant had been provided with living space as required by statute , namely a minimum of PERCENT ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In reaching that conclusion ORG provided information on the floor area and intended number of inmates for each of the applicant \u2019s cells DATE and DATE , including cell no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint of exposure to cigarette smoke , according to the applicant \u2019s submissions of DATE he had refused his transfer to a non - smoking cell . Also , on DATE he had requested that CARDINAL packs of cigarettes , a lighter and matches be purchased for him in the prison shop .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not react to the complaint concerning bunk beds .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , it provided general information on the products available at the prison shop .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision could be challenged before ORG ( ORG rajona tiesa ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG received the applicant \u2019s complaint , as supplemented on DATE , regarding poor conditions in FAC over \u201c a long period of time \u201d . The applicant requested financial compensation .", "CARDINAL . He submitted that his health had deteriorated as a result of the conditions in the prison . He raised most of the same issues as previously before ORG , namely overcrowding , his exposure to cigarette smoke , the bunk beds , and the absence of an emergency button .", "CARDINAL . He further criticised the first aid in response to his heart attack on DATE , and submitted that prior to his arrest in DATE he had not suffered from heart problems . Following the heart attack , the applicant had refused his transfer to a single - occupancy cell because it already held CARDINAL inmates and thus would not remedy his situation . He argued that he had purchased the cigarettes in order to use them to repel rodents .", "CARDINAL . In addition , owing to the large number of inmates , the applicant had difficulty in accessing sanitary facilities , including a non - partitioned toilet , and a table to have a meal . There was also a bad smell and a lack of ventilation in the prison cells . He was locked up in those conditions for TIME a day .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the issue of overcrowding , ORG concluded that the information provided by ORG showed that DATE and DATE the applicant had been held in prison cells with a surface area of CARDINAL m\u00b2 per person , which complied with statutory requirements .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s confinement with smokers , ORG held that the statutes did not require smokers and non - smokers to be held separately . However , such an obligation was incumbent on the prison once a convicted person had made a request to be transferred to a non - smoking cell .", "CARDINAL . In that regard , there was no evidence that the applicant had made such a request prior to his heart attack on DATE . He had made the request on DATE . Yet he had refused to be placed in non - smoking cell no . CARDINAL because of certain conditions in that cell . However , there was no indication in the case file that the applicant had informed the prison of these issues and had requested that they be addressed or that he be moved to a different cell . That being the case , it could not be said that the prison had ignored the applicant \u2019s requests in relation to non - smoking conditions and that he had been forced to share a cell with smokers .", "CARDINAL . As regards the bunk beds , ORG did not accept that beds had led to the applicant \u2019s being subjected to inhuman treatment . His sleep problem had nothing to do with the beds . It was a medical issue , concerning which the applicant ought to have consulted a prison doctor .", "CARDINAL . An appeal lay to a higher court against that decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal of DATE , as supplemented on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant requested that the above - mentioned decision of ORG be quashed and that he be awarded compensation of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that the lower court had been mistaken in finding that he had been provided with a minimum of CARDINAL m\u00b2 of living space as required by the statutes . The floor space had been taken up by furniture and the toilet , thus reducing the available floor space .", "CARDINAL . He further complained that the statutes should also require , with regard to prisons , that separate , isolated and well - ventilated rooms be provided for smoking . The applicant had no complaints about other inmates smoking , since they were his friends . It was therefore illegitimate to require him to move to a different prison cell . Furthermore , a fine metal mesh had been installed on the windows hampering air circulation . As a result , the applicant had experienced renewed heart problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( NORP apgabaltiesa ) examined the applicant \u2019s appeal and partly granted his claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that during the court hearing the applicant had stated that he had been subjected to inhuman conditions for DATE . It further stated that the scope of the case was limited to the matters in relation to which the administrative proceedings had been initiated .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s confinement with smokers , ORG endorsed the lower court \u2019s findings .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint of overcrowding , ORG noted the recommendation of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) that CARDINAL m\u00b2 be provided per prisoner in multiple - occupancy cells , as mentioned by ORG in GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s case , that standard had not been complied with for a period of ORG DATE , namely DATE and DATE . Also , as a result of overcrowding , the ventilation during that time had been inadequate . Consequently , the applicant had suffered treatment in breach of the prohibition of torture .", "CARDINAL . In determining the amount of compensation to be paid , ORG took into consideration the degree and duration of the violation of the applicant \u2019s rights . It referred to the case - law of the administrative courts . It also observed that in ORG had awarded CARDINAL ( ORG ) where a person had been held for DATE in conditions of overcrowding and also of limited out - of - cell activities , lack of personal hygiene products ( soap , toothbrush , toilet paper ) , insufficient ventilation and natural light ; in addition , there had been a suspicion that the person had contracted tuberculosis while in detention ( ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . That being the case , ORG deemed that compensation of ORG CARDINAL ( roughly corresponding to LAW ) was appropriate in the applicant \u2019s situation .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was open to appeal before ORG of the ORG of ORG ( PERSON tiesas ORG lietu departaments ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the above judgment of ORG . He requested that the ORG of ORG re - calculate the compensation awarded .", "CARDINAL . He submitted that the appeal court had not taken all the circumstances into account . He further specified that he had been detained in Daugavgr\u012bva Prison in inhuman conditions for a long period of time , namely DATE and DATE , and that owing to those conditions he had had a heart attack .", "CARDINAL . For DATE spent in FAC the applicant claimed ORG CARDINAL in compensation , in total ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , which he had rounded to LVL CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG upheld the impugned judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . It affirmed that LAW had been violated in the applicant \u2019s case on account of the small living space and insufficient ventilation , which had been switched on for CARDINAL or two hours every day .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint regarding the period of time considered by ORG , the ORG held that the circumstances of which the applicant had complained to ORG had been scrutinised in the present case . First , his complaint in relation to a non - smoking cell had been dismissed , and in that part ORG judgment had become final . Further , he had complained about the size of the prison cells . The ORG ruled that none of the facts of the case had been disregarded by ORG .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG about conditions of detention in FAC DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed that complaint as out - of - time .", "CARDINAL .
