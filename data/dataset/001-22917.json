LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant church , the Synod College of the Evangelical Reformed Church of Lithuania , is based in GPE . It was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , Agent of the Government .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Since DATE ORG had owned an apartment building of QUANTITY in the centre of GPE ( \u201c the building \u201d ) . In DATE , following the NORP invasion in GPE , the building was nationalised . In DATE the independence of GPE was re - established .", "During the period from DATE ORG ( seni\u016bnija ) transferred ownership rights of CARDINAL apartments in the building to the tenants of those flats under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Decisions of ORG of DATE", "On DATE ORG ( valdyba ) adopted a decision to return the building to ORG based on ORG .", "On DATE an executive branch of ORG took a decision to hand over the building to ORG .", "On DATE the necessary formalities were finalised whereby ORG was handed over the control of the building .", "CARDINAL . Annulment of the decisions of CARDINAL and DATE", "ORG", "The tenants brought court proceedings to quash the administrative decisions of CARDINAL and DATE . ORG filed a counter - claim , asking the court to declare null and void the contracts of privatisation of the flats between ORG and the tenants .", "On DATE the FAC satisfied the claim of the tenants . The court quashed the decisions of CARDINAL and DATE , holding that ORG had required the local authority to provide the former tenants with appropriate housing when deciding to restore property rights of the former owner . The court also held that , pursuant to ORG , houses and apartments that had leasehold tenants could not be returned to former owners . ORG and ORG appealed against this decision .", "By a decision of DATE ORG transferred the rights to the building and the claims thereto to ORG .", "On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and dismissed the tenants\u2019 claims . ORG found that ORG nullified the relevant NORP regulation of DATE under which churches and other property of religious communities had been nationalised . The court held that since the adoption of the law in DATE the ORG had had no property right to the building in question , and that the flats therein could not be privatised . Accordingly , the contracts of privatisation between ORG and the tenants had been null and void . ORG confirmed the validity of the decisions of CARDINAL and DATE .", "The tenants lodged a cassation appeal against the above decision , alleging that the flats in question were in fact their property .", "On DATE ORG examined the case acting as a court of cassation . It agreed with the tenants , reversing the decision of ORG and upholding the judgment of the first - instance court .", "ORG noted that the nationalisation of the building had been based on a NORP regulation of DATE , and not by that of DATE as it had been stated by ORG . Accordingly , ORG could not apply in the instant case .", "ORG recalled the decision of ORG of DATE , stating that only from the moment of the decision of a competent authority to return the property in kind or to compensate therefor did the former owner acquire a property right .", "ORG ruled that the right of ORG to control the building had been restored by the decision of ORG of DATE , that is , after the tenants had bought the flats in accordance with ORG . Therefore ORG , at the time when it had decided to return the building to the former owner , had no longer had ownership rights of the CARDINAL flats constituting part of the building . ORG had not therefore had the right to return the building in its entirety to the former owner . ORG also noted that ORG had not barred privatisation of flats in a building formerly owned by a religious community . ORG quashed the decisions of CARDINAL and DATE and confirmed the tenants as the lawful owners of the flats .", "ORG found that ORG was entitled to restitution of its property rights in respect of the building in accordance with ORG . Under the above law , however , no return of the whole building was possible . ORG noted in the reasoning part of the judgment that ORG will have to decide newly with the question of the property rights of ORG in accordance with the applicable domestic legislation ( also see the \u2018 Relevant domestic law and practice ORG below ) . ORG did not order the local authority to conduct any specific actions in this connection .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings concerning the charges for heating", "", "On an unspecified date in DATE a communal services company of the local authorities ( \u201c the company \u201d ) brought a court action against ORG , claiming that the applicant church had not paid for heating of the building during a period from DATE . On DATE the FAC rejected the action as unsubstantiated .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision , accepting the company \u2019s action and awarding damages against the applicant church for the unpaid charges for heating during the period from ORG until DATE . The court found that on DATE the control over the building had been handed over to ORG . It was further established that on DATE , in view of the judgment of ORG of DATE , the control over the building had been transferred back to the local authorities . The court found that the applicant church had entered into a contract with the company to pay for heating of the building , and that they had breached their contractual obligations . It was established that during the period from DATE until CARDINAL DATE the applicant church had controlled the use of the building and that it had , through a subsidiary unit , executed the functions of managing the building , of renovation , and of payment for communal services . The court found inter alia that the applicant church had the right to enter into sub - contracts with the tenants in order to act on their behalf in managing the payment of communal charges for the building . It stressed that the outcome of the proceedings concerning the validity of the decisions to restore the applicant church \u2019s property rights had no bearing on the obligation for the applicant church to perform its contractual duties .", "The applicant church did not state that it appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . Administrative proceedings", "On an unspecified date in DATE the Synod College of ORG filed an administrative action against the Government , claiming damages in the amount of CARDINAL litai ( LTL ) in connection with the failure of the Government to prevent the privatisation of the CARDINAL flats and the authorities\u2019 refusal to return the whole building to the applicant church .", "On DATE ORG rejected the action as unsubstantiated . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It found inter alia that the lawfulness of the privatisation of the flats had been established by the final judgment of ORG of DATE . No fault was attributed to the Government . ORG also noted that the applicant church had been entitled to file a civil action against a ORG authority if it considered that it had been prevented from making its property claims under the applicable domestic legislation .", "ORG for return to religious communities of property nationalised by a specific NORP regulation of DATE .", "ORG deals with instances of nationalisation of church property other than those specified in LAW . LAW provides for CARDINAL forms of \u201c restitution of property rights \u201d ( nuosavyb\u0117s teisi\u0173 atk\u016brimas ) : CARDINAL ) return of property in certain circumstances ; CARDINAL ) compensation in others ; compensation can be made in money or alternative items . LAW specifically bars a return in kind of buildings having tenants or owners of flats ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Under LAW , an appropriate form of compensation should be chosen by the former owner if the property can not be returned in kind .", "The Privatisation of Flats Act DATE specifies the conditions for tenants to privatise flats in apartments and houses in the ORG possession .", "On DATE ORG examined the issue of compatibility of the LAW with the domestic laws on restitution of property rights . In its decision ORG held inter alia that possessions which had been nationalised by the NORP authorities since DATE should be considered as \u201c property under the de facto control of the ORG \u201d . ORG also stated : \u201c The rights of a former owner to particular property have not been restored until the property is returned or appropriate compensation is paid . The law does not itself provide any rights while it is not applied to a concrete person in respect of a specific property item . In this situation the decision of a competent authority to return the property or to compensate therefor has such a legal effect that only from that moment does the former owner obtain property rights to a specific property item . \u201d ORG also held that fair compensation for property which could not be returned was compatible with the principle of the protection of property .", "In decisions of DATE and DATE the ORG emphasised that the notion of restitution of property rights in GPE essentially denoted partial reparation . In this respect ORG noted that the authorities of GPE as a re - established ORG in DATE were not responsible for the NORP occupation DATE , nor were they responsible for the consequences of that occupation . ORG held that since DATE many private persons had bought , in accordance with the legislation applicable at the material time , various property items which had been previously nationalised . The denial of these factual and legal aspects was impossible , and the domestic legislation on restitution of property rights duly took into account not only the interests of the former owners , but also the interests of private persons who had occupied or purchased the property under lawful contracts .", "On DATE ORG also said that the choice by ORG partial reparation principle was influenced by the difficult political and social conditions in that \u201c new generations had grown , new proprietary and other socio - economic relations had been formed during DATE of occupation , which could not be ignored in deciding the question of restitution of property \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
