GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "Since DATE the applicant lived as a tenant in a ORG - owned semidetached house in GPE in GPE ( \u201d GPE \u201d ) . The house \u2019s former owner had left the GPE in DATE and the house was subsequently seized and transferred into public property in DATE . On DATE the GPE \u2019s parliament ( ORG ) passed a law that allowed the purchase of ORG - owned buildings . On DATE the applicant acquired the house for the sum of GPE Marks CARDINAL . He was entered as the owner into the land register ( Grundbuch ) on CARDINAL DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the former owner requested the house \u2019s restitution under ORG ( PERSON \u00fcber die PERSON hereinafter called LAW ) .", "On DATE ORG ( Amt zur Regelung Offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen ) ordered the real estate \u2019s restitution according to LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . It stated that the house had been acquired after the key date ( PERSON ) of DATE and should not have been authorised under PERSON .", "In return for the restitution the Land of GPE was obliged to reimburse the applicant the purchase price of GPE Marks CARDINAL , converted into DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . On DATE ORG for ORG ( PERSON Verm\u00f6gensfragen ) rejected the applicant \u2019s objection . On DATE ORG confirmed those decisions , refusing the applicant leave to appeal on points of law .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW was amended by the second LAW ( Zweites Verm\u00f6gensrechts\u00e4nderungsgesetz ) of DATE . It introduced exceptions to the key date regulation , thus allowing the new owners in certain cases to keep their property even if they had acquired it after DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "The applicant then lodged a complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law with ORG . He held the opinion that the old version of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL infringed his right of property , as it did not contain any exceptions to the key date and thus led to expropriation . Moreover , he submitted that the key date regulation was discriminatory within the meaning of LAW . Therefore , he demanded that the new version of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW be applied to his case , in particular since the court proceedings were still pending .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant leave to appeal on points of law . On DATE it rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . Having recourse to LAW travaux pr\u00e9paratoires , it interpreted the second LAW as applying only to proceedings which had not yet been terminated by final administrative decision ( PERSON ) . It stated that this interpretation alone guaranteed the speedy handling of cases of outstanding property issues as intended by the legislator . It furthermore pointed out that the latter had opted for a compromise between the interests of the former and new owners by choosing the final administrative decision instead of the final court decision as a criterion .", "The court therefore applied the old version of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and found that it did not violate the applicant \u2019s right of property . It held that the restitution of the real estate had not been an expropriation within the meaning of LAW of LAW , because all it did was to balance the competing private interests of the former and the new owners . Therefore , the impugned provision of LAW was a determination of the subject matter of the right to property and its limitations within the meaning of LAW , sentence CARDINAL , of LAW ( Inhalts- PERSON ) . The court recalled that LAW aimed at creating a socially acceptable balance between the interests of the former owners who had been expropriated contrary to the rule of law , on the one hand , and the new owners which had acquired ownership rights in good faith , on the other hand . The court pointed out that LAW in fact favoured those new owners by excluding restitution , but only if they had acquired the property rights before DATE . On that date PERSON , President of ORG ( PERSON ) had resigned . The court stressed that the legislator had decided that in the light of those political events the purchaser of real estate could have no longer had a legitimate expectation that the acquired property rights would remain guaranteed or unaffected . The court held that for those reasons the key date regulation of LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL complied with the requirements of LAW , particularly in the light of the legislature \u2019s wide margin of appreciation . Lastly , the court stated that this regulation did not violate the prohibition of discrimination under LAW .", "The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint on DATE .", "On DATE ORG held in a pilot judgment that the key date regulation set in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW did not violate Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s complaint . It confirmed the reasoning of ORG , holding that in the light of the aforementioned pilot judgment of DATE , restitution based on the key date regulation did not violate Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . Furthermore , the court did not find it arbitrary that ORG had applied the old version of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "On DATE the Land of Berlin made it known that ORG had ordered that compensation for cases such as the present one should be provided by ORG ( Entsch\u00e4digungsfonds ) which , however , had not yet been established at that time .", "On DATE the applicant lodged his application with the ORG .", "On DATE the Land of GPE reimbursed the purchase price amounting to DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The applicant then brought an action against ORG for the payment of interest on arrears .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim , refusing him leave to appeal on points of law . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law .", "The applicant did not lodge a constitutional complaint against that decision with ORG .", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) All persons shall be equal before the law .", "... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Property and the right of inheritance shall be guaranteed . Their subject matter and limits shall be defined by the laws .", "( CARDINAL ) Property entails obligations . Its use shall also serve the public good .", "( CARDINAL ) Expropriation shall only be permissible in the public interest . It may only be ordered by or pursuant to a law that determines the nature and extent of compensation . Such compensation shall be determined by establishing an equitable balance between the public interest and the interests of those affected . In case of dispute respecting the amount of compensation , recourse may be had to the ordinary courts . \u201d", "\u201c ORG is furthermore excluded if individuals , religious communities ( ORG ) or foundations for public utility ( gemeinn\u00fctzige ORG ) acquired in good faith ownership or rights of user in rem over property assets . This does not apply to plots of land and buildings if the legal transaction which resulted in the acquisition took place after DATE and should not have been authorised pursuant to section QUANTITY of the Regulation of the Registration of Claims for Property Assests ( GPE ) . \u201c", "\u201c ORG is furthermore excluded if individuals , religious communities or foundations for public utility acquired in good faith ownership or rights of user in rem over property assets . This does not apply to plots of land and buildings if the legal transaction , which resulted in the acquisition , took place after DATE without the consent of the former owner , unless", "an application for the acquisition was made in writing or was established on record ( aktenkundig angebahnt ) before DATE", "the acquisition took place pursuant to LAW", "the acquirer made considerable investments that increased the property \u2019s value or maintained its substance . \u201d", "This amendment was introduced in the light of the fact that many of the new owners had already applied for the acquisition of real estate before DATE , but had not been able to complete the legal transaction , because the GPE authorities were unable to process those applications in time .", "In its judgment ORG found that the key date regulation in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW and the restitution of property thereunder did not violate Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . It recalled that the legislator had had to balance the interests of the former owners requesting restitution and the interests of the new owners requesting protection of their acquired rights . It stressed that the legislator had had a wide margin of appreciation when determining that balance . While LAW actually favoured the new owners who had acquired the property in good faith , it had been justified to introduce a key date in order to distinguish between those who had exercised their property rights already for a certain time and those who had done so for only a short period . ORG found that the resignation of PERSON as the President of ORG on DATE had been an adequate point in time to make that distinction .", "The court also noted that the GPE had already made clear in section CARDINAL of the Regulation of the Registration of Claims for Property Assets of DATE that the authorisation procedure had to be renewed ( wiederaufgreifen ) in cases of acquisitions after CARDINAL DATE . Hence the new owners in those cases could not have reasonably expected to remain proprietors and their legitimate expectation of remaining proprietors ( GPE ) did not deserve protection .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Regulation of the Registration of Claims for Property Assets of DATE held that that the authorisation for the purchase of real estate should be denied if the legal transaction concerned real estate that had been put , inter alia , under public administration and if the former owner did not consent to the purchase .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL stated that pending procedures for the authorisation of purchase of real estate had to be stayed until it was established whether they concerned cases of outstanding property issues . Cases of outstanding property issues were defined , inter alia , as those cases in which real estate had been transferred into public property after it had been put under public administration by an escrow .", "The same applied to cases in which former owners had lodged claims , inter alia , for restitution . The authorisation could however be granted if the former owner consented to the purchase or if the former owner did not apply for restitution until DATE .", "If the authorisation had already been granted , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided the following : At the former owner \u2019s request , the authorisation procedure had to be renewed if the acquisition had taken place after DATE and if it should not have been authorised pursuant to section QUANTITY ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
