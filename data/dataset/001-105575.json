During his prison terms he worked for lengthy periods in the prison kitchen or the prison bakery . As a working prisoner the applicant was not affiliated to the old - age pension system under ORG . However , from DATE he was affiliated to the unemployment insurance scheme in respect of periods worked in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application for an early retirement pension with ORG ( Pensionsversicherungsanstalt der DATE \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the application on the ground that the applicant had failed to accumulate CARDINAL insurance months , the required minimum for an early retirement pension . A list of the applicant \u2019s insurance periods , running from DATE , was appended to the decision . According to the list , the applicant had accumulated CARDINAL insurance months . The list shows lengthy periods during which no contributions were made , in particular from DATE to DATE , from DATE , from DATE to DATE , from DATE , from DATE to DATE and from DATE to DATE . DATE and DATE , during which the applicant received unemployment benefits or emergency relief payments under LAW , were counted as substitute periods .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant brought an action against ORG before ORG ( Arbeits- und ORG ) . He submitted that he had been working for DATE in prison and that DATE worked during that time should be counted DATE for the purpose of assessing his pension rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It confirmed that the applicant had not completed the required minimum number of insurance DATE . Referring to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG , the court noted that prisoners performing obligatory work while serving their sentence were not affiliated to the compulsory social insurance scheme . According to ORG established case - law ( judgment no . CARDINAL ObS CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and judgment no . CARDINAL ObS CARDINAL of DATE ) , their work , corresponding to a legal obligation , differed from work performed by employees on the basis of an employment contract . The difference in treatment under social security law did not disclose any appearance of discrimination .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , now assisted by counsel , appealed . He argued in particular that the wording of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG did not distinguish between work on the basis of a legal obligation and work based on a contract . Moreover , he argued that the distinction was not objectively justified . Since DATE , prisoners who worked had been affiliated to the unemployment insurance scheme . In the applicant \u2019s view , there was no reason not to affiliate them to the old - age pension system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that ORG had correctly applied the law . According to ORG established case - law , prisoners performing obligatory work were not to be treated as employees within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG and were therefore not affiliated to the compulsory social insurance scheme . The fact that , since the DATE amendment to LAW , prisoners were affiliated to the unemployment insurance scheme was not conclusive as regards the question of their affiliation to the old - age pension system . In essence , the applicant raised a question of legal or social policy . However , it was not for the courts but for the legislature to decide whether or not to change the provisions relating to the social insurance of prisoners . In that connection , ORG noted that it did not share the applicant \u2019s doubts regarding the possible unconstitutionality of working ORG non - affiliation to the old - age pension scheme .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant . Its judgment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant completed his last prison term . Subsequently , he received unemployment benefits until DATE and , upon their expiry , emergency relief payments ( Notstandshilfe ) . According to his counsel \u2019s submissions at the hearing , the applicant currently receives QUANTITY ( ORG ) per month ( composed of ORG CARDINAL per day plus ORG DATE in emergency relief payments and ORG CARDINAL as an allowance towards his rent expenses ) .", "CARDINAL . The basis of the NORP social security system is laid down in CARDINAL laws : ORG ( Allgemeines Sozialversicherungsgesetz ) and LAW ( GPE ) . NORP social security law is based on the contributory principle .", "CARDINAL . The General Social Security Act encompasses health and accident insurance and old - age pension .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the General Social Security Act regulates compulsory affiliation to the social security system . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , employees are affiliated to the health and accident insurance scheme and to the old - age pension scheme . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) defines an employee as any person working in consideration of remuneration in a relationship of personal and economic dependency . A further condition for compulsory affiliation is that the salary exceeds the marginal earnings threshold ( PERSON - grenze ) . At current levels , this amount is set at ORG DATE ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . For an employee affiliated to the social security system , compulsory contributions have to be paid in part by the employer and in part by the employee .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that persons who are no longer covered by compulsory affiliation to the social security system may continue to pay voluntary contributions ( freiwillige GPE ) if they have accumulated CARDINAL insurance months out of DATE within the system or CARDINAL insurance months during each of DATE . Contributions can be reduced within certain limits if the economic circumstances of the person concerned justify such a reduction .", "CARDINAL . Entitlement to an old - age pension arises when a person who has reached pensionable age has accumulated a sufficient number of insurance DATE , namely a minimum of DATE or , in the case of an early retirement pension , DATE . When calculating the number of insurance DATE , certain periods during which no gainful activity has been pursued , and thus no contributions were made , are nevertheless taken into account as substitute periods ( PERSON ) , for instance periods of child - rearing , military service or unemployment .", "CARDINAL . The amount of an old - age pension depends mainly on the number of insurance DATE and the level of contributions paid . If the pension thus calculated does not reach a certain minimum level , which at current rates is ORG DATE for a single person and DATE for a couple , a supplementary payment ( Ausgleichszulage ) is added in order to reach the minimum level .", "CARDINAL . During a prison term exceeding DATE , entitlements to health , accident and pension insurance are suspended ( section CARDINAL of ORG ) . The livelihood of prisoners is to be provided by the prison authorities . Likewise , their health care and care in case of an accident have to be provided for by the ORG in accordance with LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . As a matter of principle , working prisoners are not affiliated to the general social insurance system . According to ORG case - law , prisoners performing work are not treated as employees within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL ObS CARDINAL ) , ORG examined an appeal by a former prisoner against a decision refusing him an invalidity pension on the ground that he had not accumulated the requisite number of insurance DATE . ORG ruled as follows :", "\u201c According to the unanimous legal opinion of the competent ORG in ORG , SVSlg CARDINAL ) , ORG ( DATE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG SVSlg CARDINAL ) and ORG ( SVSlg CARDINAL.CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , this work , which is performed on the basis of a statutory rather than a voluntarily accepted duty to work , does not fall within the scope of the compulsory insurance scheme . Legal commentators also favour the interpretation that social insurance law , like labour law , requires that employment contracts be established voluntarily . Services rendered compulsorily under public law are not based on any service contract . Accordingly , work performed in the context of execution of a sentence can not be subsumed within section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see Krejci - Marhold in PERSON , SV - System CARDINAL . ORG CARDINAL ; MGA ASVG CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL ; PERSON in PERSON , ABGB \u00a7 CARDINAL Rz CARDINAL ) . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( B CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON = SVSlg CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the decision of the legislature that work performed in the context of execution of a prison sentence did not fall within the social insurance scheme \u2013 because the requisite voluntary acceptance of a specific duty to work required in order to make out a contract of employment necessitating the payment of social insurance contributions was absent \u2013 did not infringe the principle of equal treatment .", "...", "The medical care due to prisoners in accordance with sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW and the benefits due to them , in accordance with sections CARDINAL et seq . of that LAW , after work - related accidents or illnesses within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) of that LAW , provide to this category of persons a statutory health and accident insurance scheme adapted to the prison context .", "The fact that prisoners also , in the context of their duty to work \u2013 other than , for example , in the context of an employer - employee relationship \u2013 are not covered by compulsory insurance under the statutory pension scheme is justifiable on grounds of the above - mentioned substantive differences in relationship and accordingly \u2013 as held by ORG in its judgment \u2013 does not infringe the principle of equal treatment .", "Periods spent in pre - trial detention or serving a prison sentence or in preventive detention will , in accordance with ORG , only be regarded as compulsory contributory periods if the custodial measures have been imposed either on political grounds \u2013 other than national socialist activity \u2013 or on religious grounds or on grounds of descent ( section CARDINAL and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) or if an NORP court ( in accordance with ORG ) has given a binding decision in respect of the periods of detention recognising a claim for damages for the detention or conviction ( section CARDINALa ) . Such periods of time , regarded as valid compulsory contributory periods , are to be regarded in the first - mentioned case as not requiring the payment of contributions ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , third sentence ) ; in the second - mentioned case , the ORG shall pay the corresponding contributions to the relevant insurance institution ( section CARDINALa , second sentence ) . The purpose in both cases is to compensate for the disadvantages incurred under social insurance law that have arisen on socially acceptable grounds rather than deprivation of liberty on grounds of guilty conduct . An extension of these exceptional provisions to time served in detention on grounds of culpable conduct would be contrary to the principle of equal treatment . Recognition of such periods of time as substitute periods would also be contrary to the principle of equal treatment , for similar reasons . ... Prisoners to whom the above - mentioned exceptions under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and section CARDINALa do not apply shall not thereby accumulate , in the context of their duty to work , either contributory periods under the compulsory insurance scheme or substitute periods . They are not , however , prevented by the execution of the sentence from continuing to make contributions to the old - age pension insurance scheme under LAW and accumulating contributory periods through the payment of voluntary contributions , whereby continued insurance , at the request of the contributor , as far as this appears justified on the basis of his or her economic situation , shall be permitted , in accordance with section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) , at a lower contribution level than the one provided for in subsections ( CARDINAL ) of that provision . In accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , prisoners are to be informed of the possibilities and advantages of , inter alia , optional continued insurance , and they are also permitted to use funds for the payment of contributions to the social insurance scheme which are not otherwise available to them during execution of their sentence . By virtue of the very flexible continued insurance ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ) DATE particularly in respect of the beginning , end and determination of DATE a prisoner can also accumulate further contributory DATE in order to make up the qualifying period and/or obtain a higher pensions increment . In this connection , the fact should not be overlooked that if CARDINAL were to proceed on the basis that a prisoner is covered under the invalidity and old - age pension insurance scheme in respect of work done during the execution of the sentence , contributions would accordingly have to be made for the relevant periods . Other than under section CARDINALa , according to which ORG has to pay the contributions corresponding to these contributory periods ( as part of the criminal compensation scheme ) to the relevant insurance institution , a ORG contribution would not be reasonable here . ... It would not be reasonable in such cases to expect the community of insured persons to accept that periods for which no contributions have been made should give rise to pension entitlements ; prisoners would have to make such contributions , so the position would not be essentially different from optional insurance . Accordingly , if the legislature has decided that work done in the context of a prisoner \u2019s duty to work can not fundamentally give rise to compulsory contributory periods or substitute periods and , in the light of that , has made provision only for the above - mentioned exceptions , that decision is based on objective considerations .", "Accordingly , ORG has no doubts regarding the constitutionality of the statutory provisions applicable to the present case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL ObS CARDINAL ) ORG confirmed its previous judgment .", "CARDINAL . For the purpose of calculating entitlement to an old - age pension , periods spent in prison are only taken into consideration in specific circumstances defined in ORG .

The amendment came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the amendment to the law , which formed part of a broader reform of the system of execution of sentences , ORG ( PERSON ) considered the affiliation of working prisoners to the unemployment insurance scheme to constitute a first step towards their full integration into the social security system .
