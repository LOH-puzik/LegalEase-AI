The prosecutor 's appeal concerning the sentence was upheld in part and the applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyer lodged an appeal with ORG ( NORP ) . She again challenged ORG refusal to summon witnesses ORG and ORG , finding that the mere fact that the witnesses had not picked up the letters sent to them from the post office did not permit the conclusion that their place of residence had changed and that their whereabouts had been unknown to the court . She noted that ORG had not ordered the police to secure the attendance of the witnesses at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the appeal on DATE . It held that ORG had failed to employ all possible means to guarantee the applicant a fair trial in accordance with LAW , in that ORG had failed to secure the witnesses ' attendance by ordering the police to compel them to appear in court ( sundtoomine ) . By disclosing the statements given by ORG and ORG during the preliminary investigation , without the applicant having had an opportunity to put questions to them , ORG had also failed to observe the requirements of LAW ( d ) . However , after having analysed at length the case - law of ORG , ORG found that there was no ground for quashing the judgments of ORG and ORG , since the conviction of the applicant had not been based entirely or to a decisive extent on the statements of witnesses ORG and ORG"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
