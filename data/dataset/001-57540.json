Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG The applicant , a NORP national born in DATE , is resident at GPE , in the GPE of GPE ; he is a journalist by profession .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , he published in ORG a GPE DATE newspaper which is no longer in existence - an article containing accusations of fraud against a company , ORG , and its director , Mr. PERSON . In the article he called for a search to be effected at Mr. Vass\u2019 home , offices and other LOC and , should the search prove positive , for his arrest . DATE , Mr. PERSON had lodged with the LOC Attorney \u2019s office ( PERSON ) a complaint which , for reasons of jurisdiction , was transferred to the GPE authorities . The latter , after hearing evidence from Mr. PERSON on DATE , discharged the case on DATE .", "The facts recounted by the applicant had already been the subject of an article by another journalist , Mr. PERSON , which appeared on DATE in the DATE newspaper \" Blick \" . Mr. PERSON complained that in order to promote sales of a telephone directory , the company in question had been using subscription forms ( ORG ) that resembled telephone bills . In his view , such conduct could create the impression that this was an ordinary service provided by the NORP postal authorities , giving rise to a debt that had to be paid in the same way as a periodical invoice .", "CARDINAL . T\u00e9l\u00e9 - R\u00e9pertoire S.A. and Mr. PERSON brought against both journalists a criminal complaint of defamation ( ORG ) committed through the press .", "The complaint against Mr. PERSON was filed on CARDINAL DATE in the ORG . On DATE , the investigating judge questioned the parties in the presence of their lawyers . Previously , the applicant \u2019s lawyer , Mr. PERSON , had supplied certain documents and called for evidence to be submitted ; on DATE , he requested that several witnesses be heard . However , on DATE ORG suspended the proceedings , at Mr. Vass\u2019 request , until completion of the proceedings instituted against Mr. PERSON , the \" Blick \" journalist .", "The latter proceedings , which had begun on DATE and had encountered numerous procedural vicissitudes , resulted on DATE in a judgment of ORG ( Obergericht ) : Mr. PERSON was fined CARDINAL GPE and ordered to pay CARDINAL GPE in court costs , together with compensation of CARDINAL GPE to each of the private prosecutors in respect of their expenses .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , even before that judgment had been delivered , Mr. PERSON had formally requested that the proceedings against Mr. PERSON be resumed ; when doing so , he drew the ORG court \u2019s attention to the statutory limitation period .", "On DATE , the court granted the request and asked Mr. PERSON to indicate whether he demanded that his case be heard before an assize court . Mr. PERSON replied in the affirmative and ORG therefore relinquished jurisdiction on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG ( Anklagekammer ) of ORG declared the complaint admissible and directed that the case be remitted to the GPE of ORG ( Geschworenengericht ) ( Article CARDINAL of the Z\u00fcrich Code of Criminal Procedure ) . On DATE , the applicant entered a public law appeal against this decision ; it was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , the registry of ORG had told Mr. PERSON , Mr. Vass\u2019 lawyer , by telephone that the hearings would be held DATE , but they were subsequently postponed to await ORG judgment . When that judgment was delivered on DATE , it was too late , according to the Government , to hold the hearings on the date originally envisaged . However , on DATE ORG invited the parties to present their submissions on the apportionment of costs , having regard to the fact that the \" absolute \" limitation period ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was close to expiring . Both parties did so in writing . Mr. PERSON also asked ORG to obtain certain evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) decided that it could not hear the complaint ( ORG der ORG ) against the applicant because the \" absolute \" limitation period of DATE had expired on DATE ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It directed that Mr. PERSON should bear CARDINAL of the court costs ( ORG der PERSON ) , namely CARDINAL GPE out of a total of CARDINAL GPE , the balance being payable by the private prosecutors ; it also ordered him to pay to each of them compensation of CARDINAL GPE in respect of their expenses , as against their claim of CARDINAL GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The decision on this point was based on LAW , whereby the losing party is to bear the costs of the proceedings and is to pay to the other party compensation in respect of his expenses , unless special circumstances warrant a departure from this rule .", "ORG found that in the instant case it was the private prosecutors who were the losing party : as a result of limitation , they had not obtained the applicant \u2019s conviction . It then referred to GPE case - law according to which , in cases ending in an acquittal ( Freispruch ) on account of criminal irresponsibility or in a decision to terminate the proceedings ( ORG ) following the death of the accused , it is of significance to know , when the costs are being apportioned , what the judgment would have been had the accused been criminally responsible or survived . In its opinion , the same applied when the prosecution was terminated on account of limitation ; \" the obligation to bear the costs and expenses \" must in such circumstances \" depend on the judgment which would have been given had there not been limitation \" . The ORG added that the costs of a private prosecution could never be left to be borne by the ORG and that according to the established practice in the matter there was no call to conduct a further investigation into the facts .", "To discover what the result of the prosecution would have been in the absence of limitation , the ORG referred to the judgment ( which has since become final ) which ORG had given on DATE in the case of the journalist , Mr. PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . After summarising the judgment and citing extensive extracts , the ORG stated ( translation from NORP into NORP supplied by the Government ) :", "\" It can be accepted , as is done by the private prosecutors , that the present case is , with slight variations , the same as that referred to , namely the proceedings before ORG against the journalist PERSON for defamation . In fact , PERSON , by maintaining that there had been fraud in the instant case and calling for Mr. PERSON to be placed in detention on remand , has brought much more serious accusations against the private prosecutors . Unlike PERSON , the accused apparently made no effort to verify his accusations . PERSON was a target of the private ORG publicity campaign when , in DATE , he received from the company ORG Editions PERSON a printed subscription form . However , according to his own statement , he was not deceived . Looking at the card more carefully , he found on the back a printed note \u2018 which gave it to be understood in a rather indirect manner that the invoice was intended to pay for an entry in heavy print in a telephone directory\u2019 ( ref . CARDINAL ) . When , DATE , PERSON \u2019s article appeared in \" Blick \" , PERSON himself formulated the accusations in question , with the object , according to his own statement , of inducing the postal authorities to take action . Nevertheless , he did not previously contact either the private prosecutor Mr. PERSON or his company because the facts seemed to him so clear that he did not consider it necessary to do so ( ref . CARDINAL p. CARDINAL ) .", "By failing to obtain more precise information from the private prosecutors , the accused committed a breach of his duty of care . He ought in fact to have made himself aware of the steps taken by them with a view to avoiding all risk of confusion . After obtaining this information he could at most have indicated his disapproval of their methods , but he did not have the right to accuse them of fraud publicly and in such a flagrant manner . As he nevertheless did so , he would in all probability have been convicted of defamation if the present proceedings had not been terminated on account of limitation . This conclusion is rendered more compelling by the fact that the proceedings for fraud initiated on the complaint of the accused against Mr. PERSON in GPE ended in a discharge ( DATE ) ; the costs of the proceedings were ordered to be paid by the ORG . The discharge was based on the absence of facts which would have made it possible to find that the constituent elements of the offence of fraud existed ( ref . CARDINAL and DATE ) . The arguments the accused adduces against this decision can no longer be examined in the present proceedings . That would have been possible if ORG had been required to reach a decision on the merits of the charge .", "Given that LAW authorises the court to take account of the \u2018 special ORG , this means that it must take into consideration all the relevant circumstances in making its decision on the apportionment of costs . As stated by the GPE of ORG in its unpublished decision of DATE , cited above , these circumstances include the fact that the private prosecutors contributed by their behaviour to the initiation of the proceedings , within the meaning of LAW . The fact that the subscription forms were sent without envelopes until DATE and , sporadically , in DATE may have given the accused the impression that the prosecutors had sought to create confusion or were at least not concerned about it . The fact of combining the offer and the invoice in their communication must also be considered as improper , as was moreover already noted by ORG in its judgment . The private ORG commercial practices , which had already been publicly denounced , were indeed the cause of the article complained of . The accused \u2019s reactions were accordingly provoked by the private prosecutors . Even though the accused acted for a specific purpose , his attack was nevertheless excessive . It clearly went beyond the bounds of what was tolerable .", "It must therefore be assumed that if the proceedings had not been terminated on account of limitation , the article against which the complaint was filed would very probably have led to the conviction of the accused ; on the other hand , it was the private ORG behaviour which caused the accused to draw their reprehensible commercial practices to the attention of the public and the competent authorities . It is therefore justified to order the accused to pay CARDINAL of the court costs and the prosecutors CARDINAL . The parties\u2019 expenses must be settled in the same proportions , on the basis that the total sum involved amounts to MONEY ; ... \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON filed , on behalf of Mr. PERSON , an application for this decision to be quashed ( PERSON ) ; reliance was placed , inter alia , on LAW ( article LAW ) of the Convention .", "The GPE of ORG ( Kassationsgericht ) dismissed this application on DATE . It treated the presumption of innocence as being a rule of evidence . It noted that it was undisputed that the publication complained of was defamatory . Accordingly , the applicant could not have avoided conviction , if the proceedings had not been terminated on account of limitation , unless he had had grounds for believing his allegations to be true ; however , ORG had found that this was not the case . According to ORG , LAW ( article DATE ) could not be interpreted to mean that the good faith of a person charged with defamation must be presumed until the contrary was proved , in other words , that it was for the private prosecutor to prove bad faith on the part of the accused . It could not be supposed that the LAW intended to overturn ( umw\u00e4lzen ) in such a way the criminal law of GPE . Moreover , the field of application of LAW ( article LAW ) was not very clear . For the reason stated , it could not be accepted that it extended to the establishment of the truth in a criminal prosecution for defamation . It followed that ORG had not violated this provision by reaching the conclusion , without taking evidence ( GPE ) , that Mr. PERSON had not succeeded in proving the truth of his allegations against the private prosecutors .", "ORG directed that the applicant was to pay CARDINAL GPE in court costs and ordered him to pay to the private prosecutors compensation of CARDINAL GPE in respect of their expenses .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON , on behalf of Mr. PERSON , filed with ORG a public - law appeal based on LAW ( article LAW ) of the Convention .", "On DATE , at the applicant \u2019s request , the President of the ORG suspended the proceedings , on the ground that various cases raising similar issues were pending before ORG ( applications nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL , PERSON and GPE , respectively , against GPE ; application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , GPE against GPE ) . The proceedings were resumed after these cases had formed the subject of friendly settlements under LAW , sub - paragraph ( b ) ( article CARDINAL-b ) , of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG LAW of ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE .", "It recalled first of all that since this was a private prosecution for defamation , without the intervention of the public prosecutor , the costs could not be borne by the ORG : they had to be apportioned ( aufteilen ) between the parties in some way or another . Account also had to be taken of the fact that not only the accused \u2019s criminal responsibility but also the private prosecutor \u2019s reputation were at stake in such proceedings . This special situation might have repercussions on the method of apportioning the costs .", "According to ORG , if , owing to a subsequent procedural obstacle , criminal proceedings did not terminate in a judgment on the merits but in a decision which left open the question of guilt ( discharge or declaration that the complaint could not be heard ) , reasons of equity might necessitate the taking into account , in the decision on costs , of the probable result of the proceedings in the absence of such obstacle . It was therefore justified to consider , after a provisional examination of the merits of the case ( \" aufgrund einer provisorischen ORG materiellen ORG \" ) , which party would probably have been successful in the absence of limitation .", "In the instant case , there had been no violation of the presumption of innocence as the result of the imposition of a punishment without guilt being established in accordance with the law . Neither had there been any measure implicitly amounting to a judicial finding of a criminal offence , equivalent to a conviction . Admittedly , ORG came to the conclusion , \" by anticipating partially the assessment of the evidence , that the applicant should probably have been convicted of defamation \" . This was , however , not \" a formal finding of criminal guilt , but an estimation of the probable result of the proceedings ( \" W\u00fcrdigung der Prozesschancen \" ) \" . As the ORG had to come to its decision on the basis of the evidence before it and as Cantonal practice prohibited its making any further investigation into the facts for the sole purpose of apportioning the costs , it was still possible that the proceedings might have resulted in an acquittal had they run their ordinary course . An order to pay costs was not in itself to be regarded as equivalent to a criminal conviction . Since the ORG had rendered a decision only on the apportionment of costs and not on criminal guilt , the applicant ( and also the private prosecutor ) could not rely on LAW ( article LAW ) of the LAW to insist that the provisional examination undertaken in the present case should follow the procedure required for a decision on the merits .", "ORG added that the criterion of the probable result of the proceedings could be utilised only if the data available enabled a sufficiently reliable estimate to be made and if the parties had previously had an opportunity to express their views on the matters relevant to the apportionment of costs . However , the limits to be respected in this context were based not on the presumption of innocence but on the general principle forbidding arbitrary decisions and on the right to be heard . And the applicant had made no complaint in this respect .", "Finally , ORG noted that ORG had not only considered whether the proceedings would have ended in Mr. PERSON \u2019s conviction had there not been limitation , but had also had regard to the conduct of the CARDINAL private prosecutors before the trial . ORG directed that the applicant was to pay CARDINAL GPE in court costs and ordered him to pay to the respondents\u2019 compensation of CARDINAL GPE in respect of their expenses .", "CARDINAL . Offences involving an attack on a person \u2019s honour ( d\u00e9lits contre l\u2019honneur ) are governed by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Swiss Federal Criminal Code of DATE . Simple defamation ( diffamation ) entails liability to a sentence of imprisonment for not DATE ( Article CARDINAL ) and serious defamation ( calomnie ) , a sentence of imprisonment for not DATE ( Article CARDINAL combined with Article CARDINAL ) .", "Under LAW , prosecution for these offences is subject to a DATE limitation period . However , the running of time will be interrupted and will commence afresh whenever any measure of investigation is taken . Nevertheless , for offences involving an attack on a person \u2019s honour there is in any event \" absolute \" limitation after DATE , that is twice the normal limitation period ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In GPE , criminal proceedings for such offences are instituted by means of a private complaint ( PERSON ) . In the GPE of GPE , as in MONEY , the proceedings are known as LOC ( LAW ) : it is for the injured party , not the ORG authorities , to take the initiative . The public prosecutor does not take part in the proceedings .", "Cases are normally heard by ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) , but the accused may apply for a transfer to ORG if the alleged defamation has been committed through the press ( LAW and LAW of LAW of LAW ) . In that event , FAC of the GPE of ORG - rather than the President of the ORG - rules on the admissibility ( GPE ) of the complaint ( LAW ) .", "If the court decides that the complaint can not be heard , the private prosecutor may appeal ( LAW ) , but if the court decides that the complaint can be heard , the accused can not appeal except on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction .", "Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , judgments in criminal matters must include decisions both on the question of guilt and the consequences thereof - acquittal , sentence , imposition of measures of prevention or assistance - and on damages ( NORP ) , costs and compensation ( ORG ) .", "Details of the apportionment of costs and expenses , unlike those of the sentence passed , are entered only in the court \u2019s register of criminal cases and not in the judicial criminal records ( casier judiciaire ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the context of private prosecutions , costs include compensation to the parties in respect of their expenses ( ORG ) as well as court costs properly so - called ( court and registry fees ) ; their incidence is determined by reference , inter alia , to what caused the court costs and expenses to arise . It follows that the costs are in principle never paid by the ORG but must be borne by the parties themselves ( LAW ) . In this connection , LAW provides :", "\" The losing party shall bear the court costs and shall pay compensation to the other party in respect of his expenses ; a departure from this rule can be made only if special circumstances so warrant . \"", "When determining the apportionment of costs and expenses , the court , according to the ORG , enjoys a certain discretion in the choice of the criteria to be applied . It can take account , inter alia , of reprehensible or irresponsible behaviour by the parties before or during the investigation ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) ; of their having violated the principles of good faith or morality ; of the principle of equity ; and , finally , of questions of causation , which may lead it to form an estimate of the probable result of the proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
