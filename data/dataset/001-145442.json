That conclusion could not be altered by the fact that Mr PERSON had confessed and had helped the investigating authorities to uncover his criminal activities .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON has been detained in FAC since DATE . He was initially placed under the \u201c enhanced regime \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . With the entry into force of the Execution of Punishments and Pre - Trial Detention Act on DATE , that regime was replaced by the \u201c severe regime \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) by operation of law . On DATE ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) proposed that ORG place Mr PERSON under the \u201c special regime \u201d normally applicable to life prisoners , citing his \u201c negative attitude \u201d and lack of respect for internal order , as well as the fact that he should in any case have been placed under that regime from the outset . On DATE the ORG accepted the proposal . Mr PERSON \u2019s legal challenge against that decision , filed on DATE , was rejected by ORG and ORG as being out of time . The Government submitted that there was at present no intention on the part of the prison authorities to make further changes to Mr PERSON \u2019s prison regime .", "CARDINAL . DATE Mr PERSON was given CARDINAL disciplinary punishments . The latest such punishments , in DATE , were imposed in relation to ( a ) a scuffle between himself and another inmate during the DATE walk on TIME , and ( b ) the theft on DATE of food that another inmate had left in the communal toilet . In relation to the former , Mr PERSON was given a reprimand , and in relation to the latter isolation in a disciplinary cell for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s cell \u2013 in which he is currently alone but which he apparently shared with another inmate DATE is in the prison \u2019s high - security wing , reserved for life prisoners . According to PERSON PERSON , the cell was quite small , especially bearing in mind that the furniture alone occupied QUANTITY , and was lit at TIME by a CARDINALwatt incandescent light bulb that was constantly on . According to the Government , the cell was not undersized . It measured CARDINAL by QUANTITY and was QUANTITY high , with a total floor space of QUANTITY . It was furnished with a metal locker , a double metal bunk bed , CARDINAL stools and a small table , all of which were attached to the floor for security reasons . It had a window , facing south , that measured CARDINAL by QUANTITY . Artificial lighting in the cell consisted of CARDINAL CARDINAL-watt luminescent light bulbs . According to Mr PERSON , the incandescent bulbs had only been replaced with luminescent bulbs in DATE . He also pointed out that the cell did not have any low - intensity night lighting .", "CARDINAL . PERSON Prison does not have a ventilation or airconditioning system . Mr PERSON claimed that as a result temperatures in his cell were very high in DATE and there was no fresh air . In DATE , heating was only turned on for periods of TIME , at TIME and in TIME . According to the Government , the cell window could be opened , which allowed the cell to be aired at any time . The prison had its own heating installation with CARDINAL boilers and a heat exchanger . The boilers were fired for TIME a day , but the water that they heated circulated in the heating installation permanently . According to Mr PERSON , the radiator in his cell was hot for TIME each day and the poor state of repair of the cell window and the metal door were factors contributing to the low temperature in the cell in DATE . Mr PERSON also submitted that as he had to dry his clothes in the cell , it was very damp . As a result , the paint and rendering were peeling off the walls .", "CARDINAL . According to Mr PERSON , the common areas of the prison could only be kept clean by bleaching with calcium hypochlorite , and the cells were only cleaned with water . In support of that assertion , Mr PERSON relied on the witness statement of CARDINAL of his co - inmates made in the course of proceedings brought by him . According to the Government , the common areas of the prison were not merely cleaned with bleach . They were cleaned DATE with detergents , and at least twice a year subjected to pest and rat control , as evident from CARDINAL invoices for such services carried out during DATE . Mr PERSON replied that those invoices did not prove that the detergents had indeed been used as alleged by the Government . He also submitted that his cell was constantly infested with cockroaches and mice , and that all his complaints to the prison administration in that respect had gone unheeded . He submitted further that , since the window of his cell was not covered with a net , insects came into the cell all the time , drawn by the smell of excrement and the constant lighting at TIME , and bit him .", "CARDINAL . There is no toilet or running water in the cell . Mr PERSON submitted that as a result , apart from the CARDINAL daily visits to the communal toilets , he had to use a plastic bucket to relieve himself . During the period he had had to share his cell with another inmate , he had had to do so in his presence . The lack of running water prevented him from washing his hands or the bucket after relieving himself . The Government pointed out that the toilet and bathroom in the high - security unit were accessible to inmates CARDINAL times a day , and also whenever they asked the guards . It could not therefore be said that Mr PERSON was forced to use the bucket to relieve himself ; that was his own choice . In fact he had CARDINAL buckets in his cell , in which he stored clothes , laundry and other items . Mr PERSON replied that , apart from the CARDINAL daily visits to the toilet , TIME the guards never opened his cell to let him visit the toilet . It was therefore not his choice to resort to the bucket for his sanitary needs .", "CARDINAL . Apart from his TIME DATE walk , Mr PERSON can leave his cell to visit the toilet CARDINAL times a day . During each of those visits , he can also empty the bucket , wash his hands , and fill plastic bottles with water for drinking and sanitary needs . According to him , the visits to the toilet lasted TIME and TIME at lunch and in TIME , and did not coincide with the visits of the other inmates in the unit .", "CARDINAL . According to Mr PERSON , inmates in FAC could only take a shower once every DATE . According to the Government , all inmates in the prison \u2019s high - security unit could take a shower twice a week .", "CARDINAL . According to Mr PERSON , visits by relatives or lawyers took place in a special room . Prisoners and visitors were separated by a wire net , and prisoners had to remain seated . A prison officer was always present . According to the Government , the prison officer present during visits was only there to ensure good order and could not overhear conversations . Visits by lawyers took place in a separate room , in which no other person was present . The only form of control there was visual monitoring . In that context , the Government drew attention to the fact that as a result of the many claims that he had brought against the prison authorities , until GPE Mr PERSON had spent DATE outside FAC , and DATE and DATE had spent DATE , or PERCENT of the time , outside the prison .", "CARDINAL . According to Mr PERSON , food in the prison was poorly prepared , of low quality , tasteless , served cold and in unhygienic conditions , and insufficient in quantity . Meat was served once DATE . The rest of the time food consisted of beans , lentils , cabbage and potatoes , served as soups or stews . According to the Government , the quantity and the chemical and calorie content of the food were fully adequate . The DATE portions comprised QUANTITY , and there was meat in the meals at least once DATE . Mr PERSON replied that \u201c meat \u201d in effect meant boiled bones or canned meat . Both parties submitted menus and tables in support of their respective assertions .", "CARDINAL . According to Mr PERSON , medical care in FAC consisted of routinely giving all inmates aspirin or GPE , and inmates had to purchase all other medicines themselves . According to the Government , the prison \u2019s medical centre was staffed by a general practitioner , CARDINAL feldshers ( paramedics \u2013 one for the main prison building and CARDINAL for each of the CARDINAL separate prison hostels ) , a nurse , a psychiatrist and a dentist . Medical examinations were carried out DATE , and in cases of emergency inmates could be taken to the emergency ward of ORG . Medical examinations in the high - security unit were normally carried out on DATE . Inmates could also consult outside specialists , or be treated in the prison hospitals in GPE and GPE . Medicines were normally provided by the prison medical centre , or could be obtained from outside the prison . The only medicine that Mr PERSON had had to obtain himself , because the centre had not had any in stock , had been PERSON ( clonazepam ) , at a unit cost of MONEY ( ORG ) . Mr PERSON replied , without giving further details , that he routinely had to purchase medicines himself . He also submitted that his dental care had consisted merely in extracting teeth ; in spite of the obvious need to provide him with dental prostheses , the prison authorities had failed to take any action in that respect . The Government replied that dental prostheses did not form part of the standard medical cover for any health - insured person in GPE , and could not be obtained free of charge .", "CARDINAL . The Government also asserted that Mr PERSON could see the social inspector in charge of his unit DATE ; he could ask to see a psychologist , the prison governor or deputy governor , the prison legal officer , or another member of the prison staff ; he could socialise with other inmates of the same category during his DATE walk and during meal times ; and he had access to cable television , with CARDINAL channels , to the prison library , and to religious services . For his part , Mr PERSON submitted that , in spite of having expressed his desire to do so , he had not been given any opportunity to work or take part in sport , cultural or educational activities . In reply , the Government stated that in DATE Mr PERSON had been allowed to take part in a yoga course in order to reduce his stress levels .", "CARDINAL . NORP The annual psychological assessments of Mr PERSON for DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , submitted by the Government , are very similar . All of them say , often using the same language , that his conduct was characterised by the \u201c campaign that he ha[d ] mounted \u201d against the institutions and prison officials with whom he had had contact , which chiefly consisted in his bringing various legal challenges and in inciting other prisoners to give \u201c false evidence \u201d in his favour . Dialogue with him was very difficult , chiefly because of his lack of respect for authority , acute awareness of his own rights , stubbornness , and tendency to call the officials concerned to give evidence in the cases that he was bringing against the prison authorities . The risk of serious harm was high in view of his personality , the nature of his offences and the rigidity of his conduct . He had been verbally aggressive to prison staff .", "CARDINAL .

In its findings of fact the court noted , inter alia , that under the regime in the ward where Mr PERSON was being detained , he had to spend TIME in his cell and could only leave it during his DATE walk and CARDINAL visits to the toilet . He was not allowed to go to the prison canteen or library . His cell was adequate in size for CARDINAL prisoner , but too small for CARDINAL , and did not have a toilet or running water . As result , outside toilet times , Mr PERSON had to use a bucket . In DATE the cell was too cold owing to inadequate heating , and in DATE full of insects as a result of the lack of a window net . The cell was infested with cockroaches , moles and even rats , and there was no indication that the prison administration had disinfested it regularly . When the cell was locked , the only way to call the guards was to bang continuously on the metal door ; the guards did not always respond , especially at TIME . Mr PERSON did not have adequate materials with which to clean his cell , and evidence of the provision of cleaning products was inconclusive . It was undisputed that the prison administration had not provided him with work ; that had indeed been very difficult in view of the limitations imposed by his prison regime . Social work with all life prisoners had been very restricted , consisting essentially of meetings whenever a problem occurred .

Mr GPE \u2019s cell is furnished with a plank bed , CARDINAL small cabinets , a table , which is fixed to the floor , and a stool , also fixed to the floor . Mr GPE submitted that humidity from the communal bathroom , which was adjacent to the cell , penetrated the walls and the floor and produced mould on one of the walls . An additional factor that increased dampness in the cell was the need to dry clothes in it . The Government submitted that the cell adjoined the part of the bathroom which contained the sinks and did not generate humidity ; it was therefore impossible for mould to appear on the cell walls .
