{"ITEMID": "001-57549", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "BEL", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 1980, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF VAN OOSTERWIJCK v. BELGIUM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection allowed (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies)", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . When she lodged her application , PERSON had been working since DATE in the Secretariat of ORG ; she was at the same time studying at ORG and , in DATE , obtained a degree in law ( licence en droit ) . Subsequently , she was enrolled as a DATE pupil at FAC ; she is entered on the roll of pupils as \" PERSON \" .", "CARDINAL . At birth , on DATE , the applicant possessed all the physical and biological characteristics of a child of the female sex and she was entered on the birth register of the ORG district ( GPE ) as the daughter of PERSON , with the forenames PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON .", "However , according to her , from DATE she became conscious of a dual personality : although physically female she felt herself psychologically of the male sex . After going through a period of depression on this account , she attempted suicide in DATE and had to be treated in hospital ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s report ) .", "CARDINAL . From DATE onwards , the applicant - who will henceforth be referred to in the masculine , the male sex being the CARDINAL assumed by PERSON for social purposes at the time the application was lodged with the Commission - sought a solution to his problem by having a \" sex - change \" carried out on his body .", "In DATE , CARDINAL specialists , Doctor NORP and Doctor PERSON , respectively a neurologist and endocrinologist , found that the symptoms shown by the applicant unquestionably indicated transsexualism . In addition to having before them the report of a NORP psychiatrist , they had also consulted a NORP psychiatrist , Doctor PERSON .", "Whilst the doctors considered the use of psychotherapy ineffective in this field , they concluded , in the light of NORP , LANGUAGE and NORP research , that surgical treatment offered excellent prospects of success . They also took note of the fact that the applicant had consistently refused to accept the first kind of treatment and they believed it probable that he would attempt to commit suicide if the second kind were not adopted .", "Accordingly , they decided to apply hormone therapy , followed by surgery .", "CARDINAL . On being advised of the purposes , methods and effects of the treatment , the applicant stated his readiness to accept the risks . He therefore underwent hormone therapy which , after DATE led to appearance of the secondary sexual characteristics of a male , such as hair growth and change of voice .", "In DATE and DATE in GPE , CARDINAL surgeons , Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON , successfully performed on him CARDINAL operations of sexual conversion ( bilateral mammectomy ; hysterectomy - bilateral ovariectomy ) . Mr. PERSON had previously sought the consent of ORG : on DATE , the Secretary of ORG had sent him the following reply : \" As the problem you raise is a medical one , you should act according to your conscience but we must most strongly advise you to take all possible precautions in view of the very delicate nature of this type of operation . \"", "Subsequently , the applicant received a phalloplasty carried out in CARDINAL stages , from DATE , by Professor PERSON , a surgeon at ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The treatment has without any doubt substituted an outwardly male physique for a female physique , but the chromosomes remain those of the female sex .", "Part of the cost was borne by ORG ; the NORP administrative department issued the applicant with an employment card made out in the name of Mr. PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed a \" petition for rectification of a civil states certificate ( \" requ\u00eate en rectification d\u2019un acte de l\u2019\u00e9tat civil \" ) : he requested ORG to direct that his birth certificate should henceforth read \" a child of the male sex with the forenames PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , born on ... , son of ... \" . He relied , inter alia , on a decision delivered on DATE by ORG , which had adopted a similar solution in another case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The minist\u00e8re public ( Attorney - General \u2019s department ) submitted on CARDINAL DATE that the petition should be disallowed : it was argued that PERSON had not established , as he was obliged to do under the legislation in force , that the initial record of his sex was tainted by an error , whereas the case decided in GPE did concern such an error .", "ORG dismissed the petition on DATE on the ground that the petitioner had not demonstrated that the Registrar had made a mistake when drawing up the birth certificate ; indeed , the petitioner \u2019s submissions showed just the opposite since he did not claim to have been \" fundamentally \" a man from the outset .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed to ORG on DATE . He contended that a transsexual has by definition the sex opposite to that which is apparent at the time of his birth and criticised ORG for disregarding the concept of transsexualism . According to him , the rectification being claimed was therefore a pressing legal necessity . He also requested ORG to be guided by equity , humanity and the interests both of society and of himself in arriving at its decision . He maintained that , on this basis , the ORG would accept that he was a man who no longer possessed the characteristics of a woman ; that it was inconceivable not to recognise the consequences of transsexualism where it had been duly established ; that the decision under appeal led to results that were absurd and harmful to the social order , for example the possession of patently incorrect identity documents .", "The parquet ( Attorney - General \u2019s department ) submitted that the appeal should be dismissed , relying on the following arguments . There was controversy in medical circles regarding the syndrome known as transsexualism . Moreover , the assertion that PERSON had always belonged \" fundamentally \" to the male sex was not corroborated by the facts ; ORG had made no mistake in recording what outward appearances revealed . In point of fact , some lawyers questioned whether , in the absence of an error , the only conceivable legal remedy did not consist of an \" action d\u2019\u00e9tat pr\u00e9alable \" ( a \" preliminary action pertaining to personal status \" ) ; their views probably had force , but in the present proceedings the issue had not been put in that manner . Admittedly , the appellant had an affliction which caused him considerable suffering in human and personal terms ; if this were the only aspect to be considered , it might perhaps have been possible to grant his petition . From the point of view of public policy ( ordre public ) , on the other hand , the petition prompted the most serious reservation : its acceptance might provoke numerous other petitions and it would be dangerous to encourage indirectly by this means the proliferation of treatment whose effects , being irreversible , might subsequently be regretted by the patients themselves . Finally , the perpetual calling in question of certain situations , particularly in the realm of personal status , conflicted with the requirements of a rational organisation of the community : it would tend to an increase in personal problems and engender a climate of insecurity and instability in family and social relationships .", "ORG dismissed PERSON appeal on DATE . It held that , before it could be rectified , a civil status certificate had to contain an error committed when it was drawn up and that there was no provision in the laws as they then stood that allowed \" account to be taken of artificial changes to and individual \u2019s anatomy \" , such as those in the present case , \" even if they correspond[ed ] to his deep - seated psychical tendencies \" . However , \" neither the physical examination of the appellant ... nor the proposed scientific evidence as to the biological aetiology of transsexualism \" were capable of evidencing the existence , from the very outset , of \" physical characteristics of the male sex or even ( of ) transsexual tendencies \" .", "CARDINAL . PERSON decided not to take his case to ORG . According to PERSON to the ORG \u2019s report , he had previously consulted \" a number of qualified persons \" . In addition , Mr. PERSON , a lawyer practising before ORG , advised the applicant after the event , on DATE and in DATE , that in his view such an appeal would have had no prospects of success ( see the verbatim record of the hearings of DATE before the ORG and paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has not , until now , sought authorisation to change his forenames , authorisation which may be granted by the Government in pursuance of an Act of DATE supplementing the LAW of CARDINAL Germinal , DATE XI - DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He has an identity card bearing his female forenames , but with a photograph corresponding to his present outward appearance .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , there is no legislation dealing with transsexualism . In the only case of the kind which appears to have given rise to a criminal prosecution , ORG held , on DATE , that sex - change treatment and operations did not of themselves constitute criminal offences . They depended on the free decision of doctors and surgeons , acting according to their conscience and with the ORG consent .", "CARDINAL . The drawing up of civil status certificates , including birth certificates , is regulated by LAW . Under LAW , declarations of birth have to be made before ORG for the district . The certificate is drawn up immediately in the presence of CARDINAL witnesses and states , amongst other things , the child \u2019s sex and forenames ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "Rectification of civil status certificates is governed by Articles CARDINAL of the Judicial Code . The person concerned has to file a petition with ORG ( Article CARDINAL ) . The President of the ORG designated to hear the matter gives directions for the petition to be communicated to the minist\u00e8re public and appoints a judge - rapporteur ; the petitioner is invited to appear at a hearing in order to present his case ( Article CARDINAL ) . The operatives provisions of any judgment ordering rectification are transmitted to ORG who will forthwith enter particulars thereof on his registers and endorse them in the margin of the certificate to be amended ; thereafter , the certificate will only be issued bearing the rectifications ordered ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "The Government referred the ORG to a judgment dealing with the construction of these provisions : in the case of a couple who had obtained a judicial separation but later resumed co - habitation , ORG of First Instance held on DATE that \" rectifying a civil status certificate \" involves making thereto \" such additions , deletions or modifications as may be necessary to cause it to be in conformity with the law and with the true state of affairs regarding the status of the person or persons it concerns \" , including the situation where \" a certificate , though properly prepared in the first place , no longer corresponds to the true state of affairs \" .", "CARDINAL . Several NORP courts have had the occasion to hear petitions for rectification filed by persons who had undergone sex - change treatment in circumstances varying somewhat from CARDINAL case to another . ORG of GPE ( DATE ) and GPE ( DATE ) dismissed the actions , whereas that of GPE ( DATE ) upheld the petition . Another case also resulted in a favourable decision for the petitioner , although the person concerned , unlike NORP PERSON , had not received a phalloplasty ( ORG , DATE ) .", "ORG has never been called on to consider the issue .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , any civil status certificate may also be modified so as to coincide with the person \u2019s current situation by means of an action d\u2019\u00e9tat ( an action pertaining to personal status ) . This \" bringing into conformity \" only has effect as regards the future . Up to the present time , apparently no one has instituted such an action with a view to obtaining recognition of a new sexual identity .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , the date on which the above - mentioned LAW DATE came into force ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , any person who has grounds for changing his forenames may apply to the government authorities setting out his reasons ( section CARDINAL ) . If the application is allowed , the government authorities grant leave for the change by LAW ; on request by the person concerned , ORG will then enter particulars of LAW on his registers and endorse them in the margin of the birth certificate . Any short form birth certificate subsequently issued must state the new forenames and not the former ones .", "At the present time , at last seven transsexuals have taken advantage of this LAW , implementation of which in a given case has no legal bearing on the person \u2019s sex .", "CARDINAL . The short - form certificates of civil status which third parties may procure do not state the descent or sex of the persons concerned ( LAW CARDINAL , first sub - paragraph , of LAW ) , but only their place and date of birth , family name and forenames .", "On the other hand , certified copies of the full certificate may be obtained by the individual himself , his spouse or surviving spouse , his legal representative , his ascendants , descendants or rightful heirs , the public authorities and persons having a family , scientific or other legitimate interest ( LAW CARDINAL , second sub - paragraph ) .", "Identity cards , passports and driving licences do not specify the sex of the holder ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
