On DATE the applicant requested that the case be transferred to another judicial panel , alleging numerous procedural irregularities in the conduct of the proceedings . In particular , he complained that the present panel had ignored the fact that his detention had been in breach of applicable law . Namely , the decision to place the applicant in custody had been taken in his absence and following his arrest he had not been brought before a judge to present his case , in contravention of the provisions of LAW ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . Further , contrary to the requirements of LAW ORG , he had not been provided with a copy of the decision to remand him in custody , and had not been afforded an opportunity to appeal against it .
