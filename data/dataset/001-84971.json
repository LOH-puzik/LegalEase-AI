On DATE a preliminary investigation was opened against the applicant for robbery . On DATE , the applicant was charged with the offence and remanded in custody upon a decision of an investigator which was confirmed by the public prosecutor 's office . It was alleged that the applicant , together with another individual , had robbed an individual of CARDINAL old NORP levs ( ORG ; MONEY ( ORG ) ) and in the process had used force and rendered the victim unconscious . In ordering that the applicant be remanded in custody the investigator referred to , inter alia , the personality of the detainee , the gravity of the offence and , in general terms , the likelihood that he might abscond or re - offend .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an application for release on DATE , which was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The court found , inter alia , that the applicant was charged with a serious intentional offence , which warranted mandatory detention , and that it was likely that he might commit offences against some of the witnesses , thereby obstructing the investigation . In conclusion , no evidence warranting an exception to the requirement of mandatory detention was found to exist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed another application for release arguing , inter alia , that in the course of the preliminary investigation it had been established that the amount which he had allegedly taken from the victim had been only BGL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) because the latter had been robbed on CARDINAL occasion on DATE in question .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's application for release was dismissed by ORG on DATE , which found , inter alia , that the applicant was charged with a serious intentional offence , which warranted mandatory detention , that he might obstruct the investigation and that due to his lack of income he was likely to re - offend . In conclusion , no evidence warranting an exception to the requirement of mandatory detention was found to exist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed his third application for release claiming , inter alia , that there was no evidence that he would abscond , re - offend or obstruct the investigation , that he suffered from jaundice and that his health was deteriorating as a result of his detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant 's application for release was dismissed by ORG on DATE , which found , inter alia , that the applicant had been charged with a serious intentional offence , which warranted mandatory detention , that he was in good health and that there were indications that he might commit offences against some of the witnesses , thereby obstructing the investigation . In conclusion , no evidence was established to exist warranting an exception to the requirement of mandatory detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that the charges against him were amended on DATE , which the Government did not challenge .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant was released on DATE , DATE .", "CARDINAL . The preliminary investigation against the applicant was further partially terminated on DATE as a result of its findings pertaining to the amount and currency of the stolen money .

That judgment was subsequently upheld , also on an unspecified date , by ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was detained at ORG detention facility . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE he was detained at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant contended , in respect of both detention facilities , that there had been ( a ) insufficient oxygen in the cells ; ( b ) inadequate hygiene , the use of a bucket for the sanitary needs of the detainees and the presence of parasites ( fleas and wood worms ) , skin infections ( scabies ) and rodents ( mice and rats ) ; ( c ) insufficient natural light ; ( d ) no special recreational area ; ( e ) unhealthy food ; ( f ) no access to literature , newspapers , magazines , radio or television ; ( g ) no possibility for the applicant to meet with his attorney in private at his initiative ; and ( h ) no possibility to maintain active correspondence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's contentions in respect of the conditions of detention at the above facilities are corroborated by the signed declarations of CARDINAL other detainees , Mr PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and the NORP courts ' practice before DATE are summarised in the ORG 's judgments in several similar cases ( see , among others , PERSON GPE [ ORG ] , no .

CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL ( extracts ) ) .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the relevant law before DATE , when ruling on applications for release of a person charged with having committed a \u201c serious \u201d offence , the domestic courts generally disregarded facts and arguments concerning the existence or absence of a danger of the accused person 's absconding or committing offences and stated that every person accused of having committed a serious offence must be remanded in custody unless exceptional circumstances dictated otherwise ( see decisions of the domestic authorities criticised by ORG in the cases of NORP and PERSON , both cited above , and PERSON v. GPE , no . PERSON , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act DATE ( the \u201c ORG \u201d : renamed in DATE ) provided at the relevant time that the ORG was liable for damage caused to private persons by ( a ) the illegal orders , actions or omissions of government bodies and officials acting within the scope of , or in connection with , their administrative duties ; and ( b ) the organs of the investigation , the prosecution and the courts for unlawful pretrial detention , if the detention order has been set aside for lack of lawful grounds ( sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the regime of detention and conditions of detention , the relevant domestic law and practice under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG has been summarised in the cases of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG visited GPE in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . All but its most recent visit report have since been made public .", "CARDINAL . NORP ORG detention facility and ORG were visited in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that most , albeit not all , of the investigation service detention facilities were overcrowded . With the exception of CARDINAL detention facility where conditions were slightly better , the conditions were as follows : cells did not have access to natural light ; the artificial lighting was too weak to read by and was left on permanently ; ventilation was inadequate ; the cleanliness of the bedding and the cells as a whole left much to be desired ; detainees could access a sanitary facility twice a day ( morning and evening ) for TIME and could take a DATE shower ; outside of the CARDINAL daily visits to the toilets , detainees had to satisfy the needs of nature in buckets inside the cells ; although according to the establishments ' internal regulations detainees were entitled to a \u201c DATE walk \u201d of TIME , it was often reduced to TIME or not allowed at all ; no other form of out - of - cell activity was provided to persons detained .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted that food was of poor quality and in insufficient quantity . In particular , the DATE 's \u201c hot meal \u201d generally consisted of a watery soup ( often lukewarm ) and inadequate quantities of bread . At the other meals , detainees only received bread and a little cheese or halva . Meat and fruit were rarely included on the menu . Detainees had to eat from bowls without cutlery \u2013 not even a spoon was provided .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted that family visits and correspondence were only possible with express permission by a public prosecutor and that , as a result , detainees ' contacts with the outside world were very limited . There was no radio or television .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded that the NORP authorities had failed in their obligation to provide detention conditions which were consistent with the inherent dignity of the human person and that \u201c almost without exception , the conditions in the investigation service detention facilities visited could fairly be described as inhuman and degrading \u201d . In reaction , the NORP authorities agreed that the ORG delegation 's assessment had been \u201c objective and correctly presented \u201d but indicated that the options for improvement were limited by the country 's difficult financial circumstances .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG recommended to the NORP authorities , inter alia , that sufficient food and drink and safe eating utensils be provided , that mattresses and blankets be cleaned regularly , that detainees be provided with personal hygiene products ( soap , toothpaste , etc . ) , that custodial staff be instructed that detainees should be allowed to leave their cells during DATE for the purpose of using a toilet facility unless overriding security considerations required otherwise , that the regulation providing for TIME exercise per day be fully respected in practice , that cell lighting and ventilation be improved , that the regime of family visits be revised and that pre - trial detainees be more often transferred to prison even before the preliminary investigation was completed . The possibility of offering detainees TIME outdoor exercise per day was to be examined as a matter of urgency .", "CARDINAL . The ORG established that ORG detention facility had CARDINAL cells , situated in the basement , and at the time of the visit accommodated QUANTITY detainees , including QUANTITY women in a separate cell .", "CARDINAL . Six cells measuring QUANTITY were designed to accommodate CARDINAL detainees ; the other CARDINAL , intended for CARDINAL occupants , measured CARDINAL - and - QUANTITY . This occupancy rate was being complied with at the time of the visit and from the living space standpoint was deemed acceptable by the ORG . However , all the remaining shortcomings observed in the other investigation service detention facilities \u2013 dirty and tattered bedding , no access to natural light , absence of activities , limited access to sanitary facilities , etc . \u2013 also applied there . Even the TIME exercise rule , provided for in the internal regulations and actually posted on cell doors , was not observed .", "CARDINAL . In this report the ORG found , inter alia , that the prison was seriously overcrowded and that prisoners were obliged to spend most of DATE in their dormitories , mostly confined to their beds because of lack of space . It also found the central heating to be inadequate and that only some of the dormitories were fitted with sanitary facilities .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted that new rules providing for better conditions had been enacted but had not yet resulted in significant improvements .", "CARDINAL . In most investigation detention facilities visited in DATE , with the exception of a newly opened detention facility in GPE , conditions of detention were generally the same as those observed during the ORG 's DATE visit , as regards poor hygiene , overcrowding , problematic access to toilet / shower facilities and a total absence of outdoor exercise and outofcell activities . In some places , the situation had even deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . In ORG detention facility , as well as in CARDINAL other places , detainees \u201c had to eat with their fingers , not having been provided with appropriate cutlery \u201d .", "CARDINAL . During DATE visit some improvements were noted in the country 's investigation service detention facilities , severely criticised in previous reports . However , a great deal remained to be done : most detainees continued to spend DATE on end locked up in overcrowded cells TIME a day .", "CARDINAL . Concerning prisons , the ORG drew attention to the problem of overcrowding and to the shortage of work and other activities for inmates ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "5-4", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
