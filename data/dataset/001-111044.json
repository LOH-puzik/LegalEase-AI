On DATE , after a violent family dispute , the applicant killed his wife and injured CARDINAL of his sons . He was arrested DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the preliminary investigation the GPE prosecution service asked for the applicant to be committed to stand trial for murder , attempted murder , ill - treatment of his family and unauthorised possession of a firearm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , under the summary procedure under which the applicant had elected to stand trial , the GPE preliminary hearings judge ( giudice dell\u2019udienza preliminare ) found the applicant guilty of all the charges and noted that he should be sentenced to life imprisonment . However , because the summary procedure had been used , he sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment and a lifetime ban from public office within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that the applicant had first attempted to strangle his wife with the cable of the telephone she had used to call the police . Then , when his wife and children ran out of the flat and down the stairwell of the building , he had fired several shots at his wife at close range , and at one of his sons , who had initially been ahead of his mother but had gone back to help her .", "CARDINAL . NORP In fixing the sentence the judge took into account certain aggravating circumstances , namely the fact that the applicant \u2019s criminal behaviour had been against his own family and had been triggered by so trifling an incident as his children having allegedly broken his mobile phone .", "CARDINAL . The judge made no allowance for the fact that the applicant had no previous criminal record , an argument the applicant had relied on as a mitigating circumstance . He found that the applicant \u2019s attitude in denying some of his actions and blaming his family , who he claimed were guilty of rebelling against his authority , showed that he felt no remorse whatsoever .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the judge noted that according to witness statements the applicant had been responsible for other episodes of violence over DATE , such as insults , physical violence and threats against his wife and children , including with weapons .", "CARDINAL . Both ORG and the applicant appealed against that judgment , and in a judgment of DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment , upholding the conclusions of the preliminary hearings judge as to which aggravating and mitigating circumstances should be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , and in a judgment deposited with its registry on DATE ORG dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the life sentence imposed on the applicant entailed a lifetime ban from public office , which in turn led to the permanent forfeiture of his right to vote , in conformity with section CARDINAL of Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE ( \u201c Decree no . CARDINAL \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s disenfranchisement was not mentioned in the judgments against him .", "CARDINAL . In application of section DATE of Decree no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on DATE the electoral committee deleted the applicant \u2019s name from the electoral roll .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with the electoral committee . Referring to the ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , amongst other authorities , he alleged that depriving him of the right to vote was incompatible with LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The complaint was rejected , and on DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . He contended that the fact that the removal of his name from the electoral roll , as an automatic consequence of his life sentence and lifetime ban from public office , was incompatible with his right to vote guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment deposited with its registry on CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It pointed out that , unlike in the ORG ( no . CARDINAL ) case ( cited above ) , where every person sentenced to imprisonment was divested of the right to vote , with no assessment of the competing interests or the proportionality of the measure , in NORP law the impugned measure was applied only where the offence was punishable with a particularly heavy sentence , including life imprisonment . The court found that the automatic aspect of the application of the voting ban to any custodial sentence was lacking in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , alleging , inter alia , that his disenfranchisement was a consequence of the ancillary penalty banning him from public office ( which was itself the result of the main penalty imposed on him ) . In his view the impugned ban had nothing to do with the offence committed and the courts had no power to decide to apply such a measure .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment deposited with its registry on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . First , it referred to the ORG ( no . CARDINAL ) judgment of DATE ( ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX ) , where ORG considered that the withdrawal of voting rights in GPE \u201c concern[ed ] a wide range of offenders and sentences , from DATE to life and from relatively minor offences to offences of the utmost gravity \u201d . It then noted that in NORP law , under LAW , only those offenders sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment were deprived of the right to vote . Where the offence attracted a sentence of DATE , the disenfranchisement lasted DATE , a lifelong ban on voting being reserved for offenders sentenced to DATE and life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged an application with the ORG alleging , inter alia , that his life sentence had breached ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the Grand Chamber of the ORG found violations of those ORG ( see PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , by a judgment deposited with its registry on DATE , ORG reversed its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , set aside the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and fixed the applicant \u2019s sentence at DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In the NORP legal system a ban from public office is an ancillary penalty ( LAW ) which entails forfeiture of the right to vote ( Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL ) and for which express provision is made by law in connection with a series of specific offences , irrespective of the duration of the sentence imposed DATE such as embezzlement of public funds , by a public official ( peculato ) or otherwise , extortion , and market abuse ( punishable , respectively , under Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL bis , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) ; certain offences against the judicial system , such as perjury by a party , fraudulent expertise or interpretation , obstructing the course of justice and \u201c disloyal counsel \u201d ( consulenza infedele ) ( punishable , respectively , under LAW , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) ; and offences involving abuse and misuse of the powers inherent in public office ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .

In their reports , GPE parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote . The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable .

Persons who are deprived of liberty but who have not been convicted should not be excluded from exercising the right to vote . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its views on the LOC and PERSON v. GPE case ( DATE , no . DATE ) , ORG , referring to the ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG ( no . CARDINAL ) [ ORG ] ( cited above ) , stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... ORG , whose legislation provides a blanket deprivation of the right to vote to anyone sentenced to a term of imprisonment , did not provide any arguments as to how the restrictions in this particular case would meet the criterion of reasonableness as required by the LAW . In the circumstances , the ORG concludes there has been a violation of article CARDINAL alone and in conjunction with article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE of ORG , under the heading \u201c Right to Participate in Government \u201d , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Every citizen shall enjoy the following rights and opportunities :", "a. to take part in the conduct of public affairs , directly or through freely chosen representatives ;", "b. to vote and to be elected in genuine periodic elections , which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and by secret ballot that guarantees the free expression of the will of the voters ; and", "c. to have access , under general conditions of equality , to the public service of his country .", "CARDINAL . The law may regulate the exercise of the rights and opportunities referred to in the preceding paragraph only on the basis of age , nationality , residence , language , education , civil and mental capacity , or sentencing by a competent court in criminal proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This document , adopted by ORG ( \u201c the GPE Commission \u201d ) at its CARDINALst plenary session ( DATE ) and submitted to ORG of ORG on DATE , lays out the guidelines developed by the Commission concerning the circumstances in which people may be deprived of the right to vote or to stand for election . The relevant passages read as follows :", "\u201c i. provision may be made for depriving individuals of their right to vote and to be elected , but only subject to the following cumulative conditions :", "ii . it must be provided for by law ;", "iii . the proportionality principle must be observed ; conditions for depriving individuals of the right to stand for election may be less strict than for disenfranchising them ;", "iv . the deprivation must be based on mental incapacity or a criminal conviction for a serious offence ;", "v. Furthermore , the withdrawal of political rights or finding of mental incapacity may only be imposed by express decision of a court of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE examined in a comparative law study place no restrictions on the right of convicted prisoners to vote : GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , \u201c the former GPE \u201d and GPE .", "CARDINAL . Seven GPE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) automatically deprive all convicted prisoners serving prison sentences of the right to vote .", "CARDINAL . The remaining CARDINAL member GPE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) have adopted an intermediate approach : disenfranchisement of prisoners depends on the type of offence and/or the length of the custodial sentence . GPE \u2019s legislation on the subject resembles that of this group of countries .", "CARDINAL . In some of the GPE in this category the decision to deprive convicted prisoners of the right to vote is left to the discretion of the criminal court ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . In GPE and GPE , in the event of particularly serious offences disenfranchisement is applied independently of any court decision .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG unanimously struck down a legislative provision barring all prisoners from voting ( PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , ORG , DATE , vol . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . Amendments were introduced limiting the ban to prisoners serving sentences of DATE or more . ORG upheld that provision . However , on DATE ORG held by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , in the case of PERSON v. Attorney General of GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , that section CARDINAL ( e ) of the DATE LAW , denying the right to vote to all persons serving sentences of DATE or more in a correctional institution , was unconstitutional as it infringed ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , which provide :", "\u201c CARDINAL . LAW guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Every citizen of GPE has the right to vote in an election of members of ORG or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The majority opinion given by PERSON considered that the right to vote was fundamental to democracy in GPE and the rule of law and could not be lightly set aside . Limits on this right required not deference , but careful examination . The majority found that the Government had failed to identify the particular problems that required denying the right to vote and that the measure did not satisfy the proportionality test , in particular as the Government had failed to establish a rational connection between the denial of the right to vote and its stated objectives of enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law and imposing appropriate punishment .", "CARDINAL . The minority opinion given by PERSON found that the objectives of the measure were pressing and substantial and based upon a reasonable and rational social or political philosophy ( for further details of these opinions , particularly concerning the objectives of the impugned measure , see PERSON ( no . CARDINAL ) [ ORG ] , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG considered the application of prisoners for a declaration and orders that ORG take measures enabling them and other prisoners to register and vote while in prison . It noted that , under LAW , the right of every adult citizen to vote in elections for legislative bodies was set out in unqualified terms , and it underlined the importance of that right :", "\u201c The universality of the franchise is important not only for nationhood and democracy . The vote of each and every citizen is a badge of dignity and personhood . Quite literally , it says that everybody counts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that the right to vote by its very nature imposed positive obligations upon the legislature and the executive and that LAW must be interpreted in a way that gave effect to constitutional declarations , guarantees and responsibilities . It noted that many democratic societies imposed voting disabilities on some categories of prisoners . Although there were no comparable provisions in LAW , it recognised that limitations might be imposed upon the exercise of fundamental rights , provided they were , inter alia , reasonable and justifiable .", "CARDINAL . The question whether legislation barring prisoners would be justified under LAW was not raised in the proceedings and the court emphasised that the judgment was not to be read as preventing ORG from disenfranchising certain categories of prisoners . In the absence of such legislation , prisoners had the constitutional right to vote and neither ORG nor ORG had the power to disenfranchise them . It concluded that the ORG was under the obligation to make reasonable arrangements for prisoners to vote .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court of GPE examined whether the DATE amendment to LAW , depriving of the right to vote those prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment without the option of a fine , was compatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG found the measure unconstitutional , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , and ordered ORG to take the necessary steps to allow prisoners to vote in elections .", "CARDINAL . Chaskalson CJ , for the majority , concluded that in a case such as this where the government sought to disenfranchise a group of its citizens and the purpose was not self - evident , there was a need for it to place sufficient information before the court to enable it to know exactly what purpose the disenfranchisement was intended to serve . Moreover , in so far as the ORG relied upon policy considerations , there should be sufficient information to enable the court to assess and evaluate the policy that was being pursued ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the judgment ) . PERSON further noted that this was a blanket exclusion aimed at every prisoner sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine , and that there was no information about the sort of offences concerned , the sort of persons likely to be affected and the number of persons who might lose their vote for a minor offence .", "CARDINAL . Madala J , for the minority , considered that the temporary removal of the vote and its restoration upon the prisoner \u2019s release was in line with the ORG \u2019s objective of balancing individual rights and the values of society , particularly in a country like GPE with its very high crime rate ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . The High Court of GPE found by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL against the general voting ban that had been introduced in the place of the previous legislation , which had provided for the loss of the right to vote only in connection with prison sentences of DATE or more ( see PERSON v. ORG Commissioner [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted , inter alia , that the earlier legislation took into account the seriousness of the offence committed as an indicium of culpability and temporary unfitness to participate in the electoral process , beyond the bare fact of imprisonment ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
