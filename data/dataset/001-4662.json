THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["A.", "On DATE the ORG father , PERSON , was knocked down by a taxi . He died in hospital on DATE , without having regained consciousness .", "On DATE the applicants met with the Procurator Fiscal who was investigating their father \u2019s death . On DATE ORG wrote to the applicants informing them that he was entering a verdict of \u201c no proceedings \u201d .", "On DATE the applicants obtained from the police the \u201c Abstract of Road Occurrence Report \u201d , containing the names and addresses of CARDINAL witnesses to the accident , namely the taxi - driver and a DATE boy , and QUANTITY police officers who attended the scene after the accident . The applicants\u2019 solicitor took statements from the first CARDINAL witnesses , but the applicants were unable to understand how the accident had taken place .", "On DATE the Lord Advocate wrote to the first applicant \u2019s Member of ORG as follows :", "\u201c I have carefully considered the report and statements which were submitted by the Procurator Fiscal in relation to the death of PERSON and I do not consider it appropriate to instruct a Fatal Accident Inquiry in this particular case . The matter has been fully investigated by the police and ORG and all eye witnesses have been precognosced by LOC .", "I understand that the Procurator Fiscal spent some considerable time with your constituent \u2019s brother , Mr PERSON , and his wife , outlining to them the evidence of the various witnesses . The Procurator Fiscal also provided Mr PERSON with a list of the names and addresses of those witnesses to enable him to interview them personally if he wished to do so . Mr PERSON was also permitted to read the autopsy report .", "As you will appreciate the police report to ORG and the Procurator Fiscal \u2019s report to ORG are confidential and , accordingly , your constituent can not be provided with copies of these documents . ... \u201d", "On DATE the applicants again met with PERSON , who refused the ORG request for ORG , and also refused to grant the applicants access to all the documentation relating to their father \u2019s death . On DATE the applicants obtained the post - mortem report relating to their father \u2019s death .", "On DATE the Lord Advocate again wrote to the first applicant \u2019s Member of ORG :", "\u201c I understand that you telephoned ... enquiring as to the reasons for confidentiality attaching to the reports which your constituent , Mr PERSON , has requested copies of .", "There is a long and unbroken line of judicial authority that reports by the police to the Procurator Fiscal and communications between the Procurator Fiscal and ORG are very highly confidential and ORG would only order their production to a third party where it is necessary for the ends of justice in view of some great and overwhelming necessity . In the circumstances of this case I can not see that there is any great necessity . Indeed ... nothing material has been withheld . \u201d", "On DATE the applicants were informed by their solicitor that \u201c in view of all the facts , lack of witnesses and the policy of the authorities \u201d , it would not be possible for them to proceed with a civil action or force a ORG .", "On DATE an adjournment debate about the issues surrounding the applicants\u2019 father \u2019s death was held in ORG . On behalf of the Government , the Parliamentary Under - Secretary of ORG for GPE explained that :", "\u201c In the case of road traffic fatalities , a fatal accident inquiry would normally be held only if it was thought that there was a need to inquire into such matters as the layout of the road , the appropriateness of any speed limits at the locus , or the adequacy of street lighting . In other words , do the circumstances of the accident give rise to concerns about road safety ? Where it is considered that the driver of a vehicle was at fault to the extent that his driving was thought to have been careless or reckless , the appropriate step is for criminal proceedings to be instituted . Where criminal proceedings are not appropriate and no issues of road safety are raised , a fatal accident inquiry will not usually be held , especially where the investigations by the police and fiscal have already clearly established the circumstances leading up to the accident . \u201d", "He continued :", "\u201c No material information was withheld from the family . They remained dissatisfied , however , because they had not been shown the police report or the DATE \u2019s report . The police report was simply a summary of the evidence , the details of which had already been provided to the family .", "The DATE \u2019s report was accompanied by the statements of the witnesses but was itself an assessment of that evidence and a recommendation by the fiscal to ORG counsel as to whether a fatal accident inquiry should be held . The fiscal is clearly entitled to make an assessment of the evidence and offer his opinion to ORG counsel on a confidential basis . ... \u201d", "On DATE the second applicant wrote to the Procurator Fiscal requesting the official police sketch of the scene of the accident and photographs taken by the police . The Procurator Fiscal replied on DATE , enclosing a copy of the sketch plan and advising the applicant to contact the police directly in respect of the photographs . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the photographs had been disposed of . On DATE the first applicant wrote to the newly - appointed Lord Advocate again requesting an inquiry into his father \u2019s death . The Lord Advocate replied on DATE stating that he had read the papers in the case and agreed with the decision not to carry out a ORG .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "ORG and Sudden Deaths Inquiry ( GPE ) Act DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) places an obligation on the Lord Advocate to hold an inquiry into any death in custody or following an accident at work , unless the circumstances of the death have been established in the course of criminal proceedings . As regards other deaths , it is at the discretion of the Lord Advocate to decide whether it is expedient in the public interest to hold an inquiry into the circumstances of the death on the ground that it was sudden , suspicious or unexplained , or occurred in circumstances such as to give rise to serious public concern .", "In practice , the Procurator Fiscal investigates all sudden , suspicious , accidental and unexplained deaths , and informs ORG where there are suspicious circumstances , where it appears that a crime has been committed and there is a possibility that proceedings might be instituted , where the circumstances point to suicide , or where there has been a request by an interested person that a ORG be held . ORG then decides on behalf of the Lord Advocate whether the circumstances of the death give rise to serious public concern such as to justify the holding of an inquiry ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
