She explained that she was becoming increasingly frail as time passed and was unwilling to continue suffering the decline of her physical and mental faculties . She decided that she wished to end her life by taking a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital . She contacted an assisted - suicide association \u2013 EXIT \u2013 for support , which replied that it would be difficult to find a medical practitioner who would be ready to provide her with a medical prescription for the lethal drug .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a psychiatrist , PERSON , submitted an expert opinion in which he observed that there was no doubt that the applicant was able to form her own judgment . From a psychiatric medical point of view , PERSON did not have any objection to the applicant being prescribed a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital . However , he refrained from issuing the prescription himself on the grounds that he did not want to confuse the roles of medical expert and treating physician .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letters of CARDINAL DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s representative submitted on her behalf a request to be given a prescription for sodium pentobarbital to CARDINAL further medical practitioners , who all declined to issue the requested prescription .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request to ORG to be provided with QUANTITY grams of sodium pentobarbital in order for her to commit suicide . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of the GPE of GPE . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . ORG considered , in particular , that the prerequisite of a medical prescription for obtaining a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital was in accordance with LAW . The requirement to obtain a medical prescription served the aim of preventing premature decisions and guaranteed that the intended action was medically justified . It further ensured that the decision was based on a deliberate exercise of the free will of the person concerned . ORG observed that PERSON , in his expert opinion , had not considered whether the applicant was suffering from any illness which would justify the assumption that the end of her life was near . The wish to die taken on its own , even if it was well considered , was not sufficient to justify the issuing of a medical prescription . Accordingly , the content of the case file did not demonstrate that the necessary prerequisites for issuing a medical prescription had been fulfilled in the instant case . There was therefore a need for further medical examination . Under these circumstances , ORG considered that there was no sufficient reason to dispense the applicant from the necessity of a thorough medical examination and of a medical prescription .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant . It observed , inter alia , that the applicant undisputedly did not fulfil the prerequisites laid down in the medical ethics guidelines on the care of patients at the end of life adopted by ORG , as she was not suffering from a terminal illness , but had expressed her wish to die because of her advanced age and increasing frailty . Even though ORG had previously considered that the issuing of a medical prescription for sodium pentobarbital to a person suffering from an incurable , persistent and serious psychological illness did not necessarily amount to a violation of a doctor \u2019s professional duties , this exception had to be handled with \u201c utmost restraint \u201d and did not enjoin the medical profession or the ORG to provide the applicant with the requested dose of sodium pentobarbital to put an end to her life . ORG further noted that the issuing of the requested substance required a thorough medical examination and , with respect to the persistence of the wish to die , long - term medical supervision by a specialist practitioner who was ready to issue the necessary prescription . This requirement could not be circumvented by the applicant \u2019s request for an exemption from the necessity of obtaining a medical prescription .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for the applicant lodged an application with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant obtained a medical prescription for QUANTITY grams of sodium pentobarbital signed by a medical practitioner , PERSON On DATE she ended her life by imbibing the prescribed substance . According to a police report dated DATE , no relatives of the deceased could be identified . The report concluded that the applicant had committed suicide with the assistance of EXIT and that no third person was found to be criminally liable in this context .", "CARDINAL .
