The applicants , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , who are brothers , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the Court by Ms F. Sa\u011flam , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , PERSON , joined the army on DATE to perform his compulsory military service in GPE . According to the information in the case file , the medical examination conducted prior to his conscription found no medical conditions precluding his admission to military service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while he was still performing his military service , the first applicant was taken to ORG complaining of coughing , bloody phlegm and weight loss . Following certain medical tests , he was diagnosed with a mild infection and was prescribed a course of antibiotics and cough medicine . He was also given DATE of bed rest and was asked to attend a check - up at the end of that period .", "CARDINAL . When his condition deteriorated on DATE , the first applicant was hospitalised at FAC , where he was diagnosed with meningeal tuberculosis . He received inpatient treatment at the hospital until DATE . Following his discharge from hospital , he had physiotherapy at ORG in GPE and was subsequently given sick leave .", "CARDINAL . DATE the first applicant was readmitted to PERSON ORG for follow - up treatment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The neurological report issued by PERSON ORG on DATE found that the first applicant was exhibiting articulation problems resulting from dysarthria , and that he was suffering from dystonia . According to that report , he had also lost the ability to walk .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of PERSON ORG declared the first applicant unfit to continue his military service , owing to his major loss of speech and body function ( PERCENT ) as a result of meningeal tuberculosis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant , acting on behalf of his brother as his guardian , brought compensation proceedings against ORG before ORG , claiming pecuniary and non - pecuniary compensation for the damage his brother had suffered as a result of the disease he had contracted during his military service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed a panel of CARDINAL neurology experts to determine : the cause of the first applicant \u2019s disease ; whether it might have been caused by performance of his military service ; and whether there had been any delay or other shortcoming in the medical treatment offered to him .", "CARDINAL . In their report dated DATE the experts confirmed that the first applicant had been declared unfit for military service not because of a pre - existing medical condition , but as a result of meningeal tuberculosis . They further noted that there was no evidence that he had been infected with tuberculosis bacteria prior to his conscription . They also found , however , that since he had not performed his military service in an area where tuberculosis was prevalent , it could not be said that his disease was \u201c service - related \u201d . As for the quality of the treatment offered to the first applicant , the experts stated that they did not have enough information on the tests he had undergone and the initial treatment he had received at ORG , which prevented them from commenting on the adequacy of the medical assistance provided there . The detailed medical records pertaining to the treatment subsequently offered at ORG suggested , however , that he had received comprehensive assistance at that hospital , and that there was no evidence of negligence or other shortcomings in his medical care .", "CARDINAL . Upon receiving the relevant medical files from ORG , on DATE the experts issued an additional report regarding the quality of the treatment provided at ORG . According to the experts , the results of the initial medical tests carried out at that hospital had not pointed to tuberculosis , as the disease had been in its early stages at the time . There was therefore no evidence to suggest an unjustified delay in the diagnosis and treatment of the first applicant \u2019s tuberculosis at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on behalf of his brother , the second applicant responded to the findings of the expert reports submitted to ORG . The second applicant stated at the outset that , despite the expert report \u2019s focus on the quality of the medical treatment offered to his brother , he and his brother had no claims regarding the treatment provided following the diagnosis . The basis of the compensation proceedings they had brought before ORG was rather that the first applicant , who had been healthy at the time of his admission to military service , had contracted the disease while under the control and protection of the ORG , a fact which was also supported by the findings of the experts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested information from ORG as to whether any other soldiers who had performed their military service with the first applicant had been diagnosed with meningeal tuberculosis . On DATE the commander in charge of the brigade informed the court that no other cases of meningeal tuberculosis had been registered at the material time .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment dated DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s claims . Relying mainly on the expert reports in the case file , the administrative court held that there was no evidence to prove a causal link between the first applicant \u2019s illness and the military service . It further found that he had been provided with the necessary medical assistance without delay or fault , which exonerated the administration from any liability in respect of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant objected to ORG judgment , arguing that the court should have upheld the claim for damages on the basis of the principle of strict liability ( kusursuz sorumluluk ) , bearing in mind that the first applicant had been diagnosed with meningeal tuberculosis while under the control and protection of the ORG . The second applicant did not contest the court \u2019s finding as to the quality of the treatment offered to his brother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged claims for disability benefits with ORG , the pension fund of the armed forces , and the Retired Civil Servants\u2019 Fund ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL .
