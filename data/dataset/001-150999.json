NORP In DATE the CARDINAL applicants and GPE , the first applicant \u2019s husband and the second applicant \u2019s father , travelled to GPE , to take up a DATE paid traineeship in ORG institutions which the first applicant had been granted there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the father went to GPE with the second applicant . He refused to return the child to GPE on DATE , despite the child \u2019s having a ticket for that date and contrary to what had been agreed with the mother .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the first applicant interrupted her training and returned to GPE on DATE where she joined ORG and their child .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant brought judicial proceedings seeking protection against GPE The proceedings were suspended on an unspecified date , following a joint request by the first applicant and GPE The proceedings were later resumed after the first applicant claimed that the abuse continued .", "CARDINAL . ORG issued , on DATE , a protection order in favour of the CARDINAL applicants , prohibiting GPE from approaching them for DATE . The court established that , during the period DATE and DATE , ORG had subjected the CARDINAL applicants to psychological abuse . In particular , he had repeatedly insulted the mother in front of the child , had called her a bad mother , had not allowed the CARDINAL of them to have contact unsupervised by him and , for that purpose , had locked the bathroom and bedroom doors in the apartment at TIME . The court also found that PERSON had made the first applicant sleep on the floor , had driven at a high speed with the child on the front seat of the car , had held the child over the balcony banister pressing the child \u2019s carotid ( neck ) artery and had threatened the first applicant that he would \u201c rip [ her ] open from top to bottom and serve the corresponding jail time \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the restraining order ORG did not have contact with the child DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL applicants left the family home and the first applicant has exercised actual custody over the second applicant ever since . The first applicant was initially granted a scholarship to study for a master \u2019s degree in GPE during DATE . The father did not give his consent to the child \u2019s travel to GPE . As a result , the second applicant lived with his maternal grand - parents from DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to spend as much time as possible with her child , the first applicant traveled frequently between GPE and GPE . She submitted that DATE and DATE she spent CARDINAL her time in GPE with her child . This negatively affected her studies : because she was often absent from classes in order to visit her child , she needed longer overall time to complete her master \u2019s programme , namely DATE instead of DATE . She was awarded another scholarship for a doctorate degree in GPE , starting in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant filed a claim for divorce .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district court pronounced the divorce of the first applicant and her husband as being due to GPE \u2019s fault , and granted the exercise of parental rights to the first applicant . The father \u2019s contact rights were determined with a view to the child \u2019s possible residence in GPE and were as follows : DATE and DATE in DATE second applicant started school , and CARDINAL of every school holiday after that .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by ORG , the regional court upheld the lower court \u2019s findings . ORG dismissed his subsequent cassation appeal as inadmissible . The judgment declaring the divorce final became enforceable on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In parallel with the divorce proceedings , on DATE the first applicant brought proceedings before the district court under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She sought to obtain a court decision dispensing with the father \u2019s consent to the child \u2019s travel outside the country . More specifically , she requested permission freely to leave the country with her son for a period of DATE as of the date of entry into force of the court judgment .", "CARDINAL . Several court hearings were held . The applicant informed the court about her intended studies in GPE for DATE , the fact that she had been granted a scholarship , that she had the financial means to take care of her son and that he had adapted well to the social environment in GPE . She did not specifically invoke a provision under the Convention ; instead , she expressed her wish to live with and care for her child while she was pursuing her studies in GPE . However , it appears that she did not formally limit in writing her request for permission to travel with her child to GPE or to any other country .", "CARDINAL . NORP The district court granted the first applicant \u2019s request on DATE . It found in particular that there was no reason to suspect that she would permanently leave the country with the second applicant . It also held that the father \u2019s access rights had been determined in a preliminary court decision ( \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 ) of CARDINAL DATE and , if the first applicant were to obstruct them , GPE could bring separate proceedings in that connection .", "CARDINAL . After an appeal by ORG the regional court upheld that judgment on DATE . The court observed that the second applicant \u2019s right to freedom of movement was protected under LAW on the Rights of the LAW , LAW and ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE below ) . The right to freedom of movement could only be limited in exceptional situations , namely in order to protect national security , public order , public health and morals or the rights and freedoms of others . None of those exceptions had been established or even claimed in the applicants\u2019 case . The court observed that the first applicant offered good material conditions to the child in GPE , that the child had adapted well during his stay there before DATE , that the first applicant was going to specialise in NORP law in ORG and that the second applicant enjoyed considerable care and attention from his mother . The court also held that ORG \u2019s arguments about his access rights were unrelated to the present proceedings ; those arguments had to do with the enforcement of a future court decision in which the exercise of the parental rights in respect of the second applicant were to be definitively determined . The court concluded that it was in the interest of the second applicant to have a passport issued and to travel with the first applicant abroad .", "CARDINAL . Upon a cassation appeal by ORG , ORG refused the first applicant \u2019s request in a final judgment of DATE . The court relied on its well established and binding case - law according to which permission for a child \u2019s unlimited travel abroad with CARDINAL parent only could not be granted because , as a matter of principle , that could never be in the best interest of the child . The reasons were more specifically that there was a risk that the requesting parent could take the child to countries which were in a state of war or in which there was a high risk of natural calamities , and thus endanger the child \u2019s well - being while depriving ORG possibility to ensure his or her protection . Such permission could be granted , when that was in the interest of the child , in respect of concrete destinations and for a limited period of time . Finally , the court rejected the first applicant \u2019s request that the court define of its own motion concrete boundaries within which travel could be permitted , stating that it was bound by the formulation presented in the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant brought a new request for permission of the second applicant \u2019s travel with his mother to GPE and the other ORG countries for DATE without the father \u2019s consent . This time she brought her claim under LAW , which provision was adopted in the meantime and which governs specifically the question of LOC travel abroad and the issuing of identity documents for that purpose ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She pointed out that she had consistently facilitated GPE \u2019s access to the child in accordance with his contact rights determined in the divorce proceedings . She submitted that , because she could not take the second applicant with her to GPE while she was pursuing her studies there , both her child and she were deprived of personal contact with each other . She claimed this negatively affected their family life as she was practically deprived of the possibility to raise her child while the exercise of parental rights had been granted to her . She submitted that her doctoral studies in GPE , which were to DATE as of DATE , would give her the flexibility necessary for her taking care of her child , given that she could do most of her work from home . Finally , she pointed out that the second applicant continuously asked to be with his mother at all times as he is very attached to her .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE , ORG allowed the second applicant \u2019s travel to GPE and within ORG , for DATE , accompanied by his mother .
