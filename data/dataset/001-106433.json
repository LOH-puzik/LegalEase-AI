PERSON and GPE were married on DATE . ORG , the couple \u2019s only child , was born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON filed for divorce from GPE , citing her husband \u2019s volatile and violent nature as the chief ground for divorce . She also asked to be granted full custody of their son .

GPE was obliged to pay DATE maintenance until the second applicant became an adult .", "CARDINAL . Following an application by GPE for custody of the second applicant to be reconsidered and granted to him , on DATE ORG dismissed the claim . The judgment was upheld on appeal , ORG holding on DATE that the father had proved :", "\u201c to have had and to still have a violent nature and an uncivilised attitude , provoking situations when visiting his child which are likely to negatively influence the child \u2019s physical and psychological development . \u201d", "CARDINAL . D.C. also applied to the courts for contact rights with the second applicant on DATE from TIME on DATE until TIME on DATE , as well as for DATE during his DATE leave .

By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG allowed the request and ordered that the second applicant should henceforth reside with his mother .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE PERSON lodged a civil action , seeking to obtain an increase in the DATE maintenance paid by GPE , as both the second applicant \u2019s needs and GPE \u2019s income had increased . PERSON also requested that GPE \u2019s contact rights should be limited so that the second applicant would only spend time with his father in her presence . In support of her latter request , the first applicant alleged that \u201c [ his ] father was a real danger to the health and physical integrity of the child \u201d , that GPE \u2019s verbal and non - verbal behaviour was highly aggressive , and that she had already lodged a criminal complaint against GPE , accusing him of sexually molesting the second applicant .

An opinion on the relationship between the second applicant and his father given by ORG , Head of ORG of GPE municipal administration , was added to the case file .

Only when [ his ] father appeared did the child forget whatever his mother had induced him to feel ( due to the joy he felt when meeting his father ) , which is clear proof that ORG had not attacked the child , not only sexually , but not even verbally or in any other way . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the request with respect to the child maintenance increase ; the request for limitation of contact rights was dismissed , the court taking into account the fact that the prosecutor had decided on DATE not to institute criminal proceedings against GPE and to close the investigation ( see paragraph CARDINAL , below ) . An appeal by PERSON was dismissed on DATE as timebarred . A further appeal on points of law was also dismissed on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , GPE reapplied for full custody of the second applicant . He stated that he had not been allowed to visit his son , and that even though the first applicant had lodged a criminal complaint against him , the prosecutor had issued a decision not to indict him for sexually abusing the child . At the same time , GPE asserted that the first applicant was a member of ORG , and that therefore her influence on the child endangered his normal development . PERSON replied that the prosecutor \u2019s decision not to press charges against GPE had been confirmed and a criminal investigation was still pending . The action was dismissed on DATE by ORG . The court held that the reasons relied upon by GPE with respect to the first applicant \u2019s religion were not to be taken into consideration . It also considered that the reasons which substantiated the court \u2019s previous decision to grant full custody to the first applicant had not changed in any way . The decision became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , GPE lodged a request with ORG , asking it to order the urgent placement of the second applicant in a state institution . He alleged that he did not have any information regarding the current home of the applicants , as they had continually and frequently changed their place of residence , and consequently no information on the second applicant \u2019s well - being was available to him . The request was denied on DATE , as it had not been proved that the second applicant was in any danger .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by means of interlocutory proceedings , GPE sought full custody of the second applicant , giving as a reason that \u201c it is dangerous for the child to stay close to his mother , as even though she is a caring mother , she still has a bad influence on the minor \u2019s later development \u201d . He also cited the fact that in DATE the first applicant had lodged a criminal complaint , accusing him of having molested the second applicant . GPE alleged that ever since that time he had constantly been prevented from visiting his son , who in any case had radically changed his whole attitude towards him , refusing contact .", "CARDINAL .

Healing requires DATE of medical care . \u201d", "CARDINAL . No civil claims were lodged .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON , a second criminal complaint was lodged on DATE regarding similar sexual acts perpetrated CARDINAL , when the second applicant was visiting his father . However , a copy of this complaint was not submitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , GPE and other witnesses were heard . CARDINAL witnesses , PERSON and GPE , informed the authorities , inter alia , that they had been told by the second applicant that he had been sexually assaulted by his father . Moreover , they had witnessed GPE \u2019s violent behaviour towards PERSON and had seen the minor undressing and touching other children in an inappropriate manner . However , another witness , C.A. , stated that she had never heard the second applicant complaining of sexual assault . On DATE a medical report was produced by ORG , attesting as follows :", "\u201c ORG has recent and old lesions in the anal area , which could be the result of the intromission of a solid object or a consequence of anal sexual contact . It is possible that the lesions occurred on DATE . DATE of medical care are required for healing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the minor was subjected to a psychological examination , which concluded as follows :", "\u201c ... the results of the projective tests emphasise the possibility that ORG , aged DATE and DATE , could have been sexually abused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A forensic report concerning simulated behaviour was produced on DATE , both PERSON and GPE being subjected to a test and asked various questions . According to the conclusions of the report , indicators of dissimulation were detected when PERSON answered the following relevant questions ( CARDINAL out of the total of CARDINAL asked ) : whether she had set up the sexual assault on the child ; whether she had been taught by somebody else to frame someone for the sexual assault perpetrated on the child ; whether she had obliged or urged somebody to introduce an object into her child \u2019s anus .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , the conclusions of the report showed that GPE \u2019s attitude seemed to be sincere when he answered CARDINAL questions , the relevant ones being : whether he had had anal sexual intercourse with his child ; whether he had molested the minor DATE CARDINAL DATE or on DATE ; and whether he had ever thought about having unusual sexual relations .", "CARDINAL . Upon a request from the police , a new medical report was produced on DATE by ORG , concluding as follows :", "\u201c We reassert our opinion that the child , ORG , displayed a traumatic lesion in the anal region , which could have occurred in the circumstances of a sexual assault , for which he needed DATE of medical care for healing . The lesion could have been DATE at the time of examination , which means that it could have been produced on DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , FAC no . CARDINAL , investigating the case , sent an official note to ORG for GPE , GPE , asking them to ensure the permanent safety of the child until the investigation was terminated , in so far as neither of the parents nor any other person was to be allowed to take the child from ORG , because :", "\u201c ... the evidence already adduced in the case shows that the child had been sexually abused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant was heard by the police in the presence of his mother , a psychologist and a lawyer who had been automatically appointed . From the second applicant \u2019s answers to the questions asked by the police , it emerged that :", "\u201c He likes to live with his mother and with his father [ ... ] and that his father had put a hose into his bottom . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the prosecutor decided not to indict GPE for the crime proscribed by LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( sexual intercourse with a person of the same sex ) . As there were indications of criminal acts of a sexual nature having been committed , the case was split in so far as a further investigation was to be undertaken with a view to identifying the perpetrator .", "CARDINAL . NORP This decision , challenged by PERSON , was confirmed by the hierarchically superior ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor held that some of the witness statements were hearsay , as most of the witnesses had stated what they had heard and found out from the second applicant himself , who was CARDINAL at the time , being therefore unable to accurately depict reality .", "CARDINAL . Considering that the forensic report had proved that PERSON answers indicated distortions typical of dissimulation , whereas no such indicators had been revealed from the answers given by GPE , the recommended conclusion was to consider that the first applicant was dissimulating :", "\u201c ... due to the existing conflicts as regards the child \u2019s custody and due to the applicant \u2019s selfish affection for the child . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON again contested this decision . A psychological report completed on DATE and issued by FAC , a neuropsychiatrist , was submitted to the file by PERSON It showed that the child :", "\u201c ... had a permanent state of anxiety in connection with his own body [ ... ] phobia and feelings of culpability in connection with the human body were revealed [ ... ] we conclude that the child had been subjected to long and intense stress , stress connected with physical handling of a sexual nature \u2013 possible repeated paternal sexual abuse [ ... ] diagnosis : reactive state ( sexually abused by the father ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the hierarchically superior prosecutor quashed the decision and proposed that further investigation of the case should be carried out with respect to acts under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW , consequently remitting the file to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The decision was taken having the following in mind :", "\u201c ... the medical report \u2019s conclusions are corroborated by those of the psychological examinations of the child , who was shown to have exhibited behaviour typical of those who have been subjected to sexual abuse \u201d ;", "and that", "\u201c ... there is no indication of the existence of any other person than the father , GPE , who could have committed the impugned acts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After the remittal of the case , no other new evidence was produced or adduced to the file . On DATE , the prosecutor again decided not to press charges against GPE in respect of the acts punishable by LAW under LAW and DATE and LAW ( acts of sexual perversion ) . The decision was founded on the evidence already existing in the file ( the medical certificate of DATE , the medical report of CARDINAL DATE , statements gathered in the case , the parties\u2019 arguments and the forensic report on simulated behaviour ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON contested this decision , mainly arguing that in spite of the indications given by the hierarchically superior prosecutor on DATE that the investigation should continue , no new evidence had been produced in DATE that had since passed and therefore that the decision was unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . Her objection was sent from the hierarchically superior prosecutor to ORG . ORG raised a plea of inadmissibility of such an objection , as LAW did not expressly provide for the possibility of parties contesting a prosecutor \u2019s decision not to press charges before the courts .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant replied by submitting jurisprudential arguments , including a decision of ORG issued on DATE stating that not providing the parties with such an opportunity was unconstitutional . The first applicant also relied upon the adoption of a new PERSON ( no . ORG ) amending old regulations and providing the parties with the possibility of appealing against such decisions to the courts within DATE of its entering into force ( on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the court dismissed PERSON appeal . In its judgment , the court made reference to the decision of DATE ( see C below ) and to the reasoning therein . At the same time , it held as follows :", "\u201c Because no matter how many witnesses had been heard in the case it could not have been established for certain whether the truth lay with the applicant or with GPE , it was necessary to test the CARDINAL with a polygraph . Following the test , it was established that the applicant was dissimulating , whereas GPE proved to have been sincere when answering the questions asked . \u201d", "CARDINAL . When referring to the second applicant \u2019s statements given on DATE , the court considered that these were :", "\u201c ... a faithful reflection of the mother \u2019s opinions on the matter , the child \u2019s assertions being very structured , similar to those made by an adult , although the child was DATE at the time . The child tried to expose his mother \u2019s thoughts as accurately as possible but , at the same time , he attempted to express his own feelings when he pointed out that he liked to live with his father as well . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the court held that the existing evidence could not be regarded as reliable enough to indict GPE for the alleged crimes , in view of the conclusions of the lie - detector test ( considered to be PERCENT accurate ) , of all of the reports and of the ORG statements .", "CARDINAL . The court further emphasised the fact that the second applicant had asserted that his father \u201c had only inserted a hose in his bottom and asked him not to tell his mother anything about it \u201d , which would :", "\u201c ... constitute at the most a criminal act under LAW ( hitting or other forms of violence ) , stating that a criminal case shall be initiated upon the complaint of the person injured . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court made no reference to the initiation on its own motion of a criminal investigation for criminal acts under LAW .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed against this judgment . ORG dismissed the appeal and reiterated the reasoning of the lower court quoted above . It held on DATE that no evidence in the file had proved that the second applicant had actually been a victim of sexual assault perpetrated by his father and therefore that there was no indication in the file to justify a prosecution being instituted against GPE for criminal acts punishable under LAW and CARDINAL and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON lodged a civil action , seeking to confine GPE to a contact programme of CARDINAL visits a month and only in her presence . In support of her claims , she alleged that GPE had abused his contact rights when , in DATE and DATE , upon taking the child to his home , he had molested the child . She revealed that she had lodged a criminal complaint against GPE in this regard , but that on DATE the prosecutor had decided not to indict him . Also , a similar civil action had previously been lodged by her , but her claims had been dismissed on DATE , the ORG reasoning relying exclusively on the prosecutor \u2019s decision not to institute criminal proceedings against GPE", "CARDINAL . GPE asserted that ever since his former wife had left him he had had to struggle in the courts in order to be able to see his son , as she had done everything possible to keep him from having any contact with his son . In that respect , he had even had to lodge a criminal complaint against her , as she was not complying with the court order allowing him to see his son . Even though she had never been indicted , she had allegedly received an administrative sanction . After the incidents that had allegedly occurred in DATE , he had not been allowed to see his son , as the first applicant had continually moved home without informing him .", "CARDINAL . Mindful of the serious allegations submitted by the parties and what was at stake for the child , the court DATE at a preliminary stage \u2013 considered it necessary for both of the parents to be subjected to a polygraph test and also to undergo psychiatric examination . At the same time , the court found it appropriate to hear the second applicant , even though he was DATE . All discussions with the child were audio taped , and , as is stated in the judgment of the GPE ORG given on DATE , \u201c the transcriptions were to be included in the case file \u201d .", "CARDINAL . PERSON application was dismissed , the reasoning of the court being essentially the following .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , the court observed , on the basis of the parties\u2019 past , which had been hostile and which had been partially played out in court , that PERSON intention to limit GPE \u2019s contact rights had been constant over DATE and had started long before the alleged incidents of DATE and DATE . As had emerged from all the documents included in the case file , the first applicant had actually intended to completely prevent GPE from having any contact with his son . The court found that this background showed that her present application had not come as a consequence of the alleged sexual assault , but rather as a predictable consequence of her consistent and strong determination to put an end to any kind of relationship between the second applicant and his father . The following had emerged :", "\u201c ... the applicant was constantly preoccupied with estranging the child from his father and the real reason for that was not the reason presented by PERSON in the file , but , without doubt , one that had a religious subtext , as will be subsequently demonstrated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Relying on the testimonial evidence and the parties\u2019 statements in the file ( including the second applicant \u2019s ) , the court held that the real reason for the parties\u2019 divorce was in fact the exclusion of GPE from the GPE \u2019s Witnesses Congregation on DATE :", "\u201c ... the withdrawal of the defendant from the GPE \u2019s Witnesses prompted the applicant to firstly leave him , and then , after having waited for a while for the \u201c lost sheep to rejoin the flock \u201d , to finally divorce . \u201d", "In this context ,", "\u201c ... it is irrelevant that the defendant had behaved violently towards the applicant \u2013 as the main and essential reason for the parties\u2019 divorce was a religious one , namely the defendant \u2019s withdrawal from the sect of the Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses [ ... ] the violent behaviour of the applicant playing a subsidiary role . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court further held that \u201c it is notorious that the members of the GPE \u2019s Witnesses sect marry only within the Congregation \u201d , and if , after getting married , CARDINAL of the members grows distant from the religion , and attempts to bring him back into the fold are unsuccessful , a divorce becomes even more necessary . Consequently , the court considered that PERSON had sought to take the following into consideration :", "\u201c ... she has a duty to the child , but also to God , to protect the child from any influence that would jeopardise his soul and his spiritual growth , including influences from his father , if not from his father in the first place [ ... ]", "[ I]t emerges that it was imperative that the defendant should be prevented from having any contact with the child . Although simple and clear , [ the achievement of ] this desired goal seemed to be undermined by an insurmountable obstacle \u2013 the law , which allows the parent without custody to continue to have personal contact with the child [ ... ]", "[ T]he applicant , pragmatic , set herself a more modest goal , appreciated as legally possible \u2013 the limitation of the father \u2019s visiting rights by a court judgment [ issued ] in the preliminary stage [ of proceedings ] , followed by a second step , which was to attempt in any way or by any possible stratagem to completely forbid the defendant to enforce the judgment in respect of contact with the child . \u201d", "The court further held as follows :", "\u201c ... based on the evidence produced in the file , it can not be established with certainty whether the applicant has herself caused the injuries to the child attested in the medical reports , but such a possibility can not be completely excluded . \u201d", "In supporting such a hypothesis , the court considered as follows :", "\u201c ... it could be presumed that DATE , when GPE went to the applicant , [ armed ] with an enforceable judgment ( of CARDINAL DATE ) , intending to see his child , the applicant , taken by surprise , desperate , decided to resort to this extreme solution , telling herself , in order to comfort her own conscience , that a good purpose ( saving the soul of the child from \u201c Satan \u2019s claws \u201d ) justified the means ( the committal of - at least - one criminal act \u2013 defamatory denunciation against the defendant ) . \u201d", "A second hypothesis explaining the minor \u2019s injuries was advanced by the court :", "\u201c ... it is quite possible that the attested injury could have been the consequence of acute constipation on the part of the minor , and that the applicant simply took advantage of the circumstances and lodged a request to deprive the defendant of his parental rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In any case , the court seemed to favour the first hypothesis , relying on the chronology of the events which had allegedly occurred in DATE , as the first applicant had herself taken the initiative at that time to allow GPE to take the second applicant to his home for a longer period of time than that established in the judgment regulating his contact rights ( DATE ) . The first applicant \u2019s explanation that she had acted in that way because she had previously been threatened with death by GPE and because she had been advised by the police to comply with the court order allowing GPE contact rights was considered insincere .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that the first applicant \u2019s initiative of giving the second applicant to his father was part of a bigger plan , arranging the set - up prepared for GPE", "CARDINAL . The polygraph test and the psychiatric report regarding the parties , as well as the psychological evaluation of the second applicant \u2019s answers to the court \u2019s questions , were never pursued :", "\u201c ... after consultation , both the president of the court and the forensic expert reached the conclusion that the applicant could have been CARDINAL of the few persons who could \u201c defeat \u201d even the polygraph . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The president of the court consequently decided to try to make the applicant aware of her wrongdoing DATE in the event that the accusations against GPE were , indeed , unfounded \u2013 and he therefore invited the first applicant and the second applicant to a meeting at the court .", "CARDINAL . Following the meeting held at an unspecified date in DATE , the applicant , through her lawyer , imposed \u201c some unacceptable and unspeakable conditions \u201d to be fulfilled when performing the polygraph test . As this means of evidence was not , as such , provided for in NORP procedural legislation , the court \u201c was forced \u201d to conclude that the test could not be administered :", "\u201c The court assesses these conditions as being a disguised and diplomatic refusal by the applicant to take the test , and such a refusal leads to the conclusion that it is highly possible that the applicant wrongly accused the defendant , GPE \u201d", "DATE . As similar \u201c unreasonable and impossible conditions \u201d were formulated by the first applicant \u2019s lawyer for the evaluation of the second applicant \u2019s previous answers ( for instance , the child was to be recorded throughout so that the first applicant could , if necessary , express a point of view ) , the court felt obliged to acknowledge that the first applicant was resistant to such a means of acquiring evidence , and the evaluation was never pursued .", "CARDINAL . However , the court had several separate discussions with the second applicant , who , when questioned , stated , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... his father left the religious organisation before he was even born , because \u201c Satan had grabbed him \u201d ,", "and that", "\u201c ... he did not play much with the neighbour \u2019s children , as they were not \u201c witnesses \u201d , and therefore they were bad \u201d .", "The court also held that :", "\u201c The child asserted that he had been molested by his father , who had threatened to kill him if he revealed anything of the incident to his mother ( recorded statement ) .", "[ ... ]", "The child had indeed stated to the President of the court that he did not wish to see his father . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second applicant \u2019s statements were not , however , taken into consideration by the court , as the court was convinced that all of them had in fact been induced by his mother , and did not reveal the child \u2019s real thoughts and wishes :", "\u201c ... to any minor DATE , a parent or a teacher who is close to the child could easily inculcate any ideas ... \u201d", "Consequently , the court found :", "\u201c ... a child will immediately and without reserve accept that a situation has actually occurred as inculcated , even if he himself has no recollection of such a situation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Relying on all the evidence and the presumptions drawn from the first applicant \u2019s refusal to allow new evidence ( reports ) to be collected , the court held as follows :", "\u201c ... the court knows that the applicant never actually wanted the defendant to be able to see the child , and to this end she went as far as to disobey a previous court order ( the judgment of DATE ) .", "It only remains for the prosecutor to remove any doubt as to this matter ( the criminal complaint lodged by the applicant ) , so that the applicant can then be brought before a court for resisting the enforcement of the judgment of DATE ...", "[ ... ]", "If a psychiatric report had ever been produced , the court would have found out whether the applicant was or was not suffering from a \u201c split personality syndrome \u201d [ ... ] because the applicant leaves the impression of having a double personality , between the CARDINAL parts of which there is no communication whatsoever ... \u201d", "[ ... ]", "Therefore , it is the defendant who seems more entitled to ask that the mother should be deprived of her parental rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON challenged the above - mentioned decision , essentially alleging that : the court had used and interpreted the second applicant \u2019s allegations , although they had had never been transcribed or attached to the case file ; and the court had reasoned with a logic that had nothing to do with the case itself , but rather had been based on the judge \u2019s own apparent obsessions , and which , in any case , did not rely on the documentary evidence adduced ( medical reports , psychological evaluations of the child ) , which was all in support of the truth \u2013 that the second applicant had been sexually abused by his father . Documents attesting to the first applicant \u2019s sane state of mind had also been ignored , the court preferring to believe that the first applicant had been suffering from \u201c psychological deviations of a mystical nature \u201d .
