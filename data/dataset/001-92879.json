DATE the applicant acted as the legal representative of several industrial companies belonging to a group associated with a strategic steelworks in eastern GPE . For a period of time starting on DATE he was on the board of directors of the company owning the works .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Minister of the ORG set up a special team of investigators to investigate large - scale organised criminal activities of a financial nature which were supposedly being committed in connection with a company belonging to the above group . The team was composed of officers from the financial police .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the investigators charged an individual , ORG , with aggravated fraud .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the investigators applied for judicial authorisation to tap the applicant \u2019s telephone . At an unspecified time a judge of ORG granted the authorisation . The applicant \u2019s professional mobile phone was subsequently tapped .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant learned that calls from his phone were being intercepted ; that the interception was being carried out by the financial police ; and that the contents of his telephone communications were known outside the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received an anonymous letter confirming the above information and advising him that the interception had taken place from DATE and had been carried out at the request of opponents of his clients .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE a DATE paper published interviews with the Minister of the ORG and the chief of ORG . From those interviews the applicant understood that there had been confirmation that the interception had actually taken place .", "CARDINAL . Verbatim records of the applicant \u2019s calls had been leaked to various interest groups , politicians and journalists , as well as to representatives of several legal persons .", "CARDINAL . Thus in DATE the DATE PERSON received by mail a transcript of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversation with a journalist of ORG . On DATE PERSON published a statement by a politician who had declared at a press conference that he possessed approximately CARDINAL pages of copies of transcripts of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was informed that verbatim records of his conversations with third persons which had been made by the financial police were freely accessible on a website . They included conversations with his colleagues , clients , the representative of the other party in a case , and friends . The records had been manipulated in that they included statements which the applicant and the other persons involved had not made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG ( \u201c the Inspection Service \u201d ) that he had been warned in a letter signed \u201c member of the Financial Police \u201d about the interception of his telephone . He claimed that the interception was unlawful and unjustified and accused CARDINAL or more unknown police officers of having abused their official authority . The applicant stated that an appropriate investigation should be carried out into the matter in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . The director of the special division of the financial and criminal police ( odbor zvl\u00e1\u0161tnych \u00faloh spr\u00e1vy krimin\u00e1lnej a finan\u010dnej pol\u00edcie ) lodged a criminal complaint as , on the basis of his own examination of the case file , he had come to the conclusion that the interception contravened sections DATE and DATE ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) . This was so in particular because it had not been based on any specific suspicion against the person being targeted and no specific purpose had been indicated . In his view , the members of the special investigative team had abused their official authority within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge who had authorised the interception made a written statement to the President of ORG . The judge stated that the request for the authorisation had met all formal and substantive requirements . In his view , the police director had no authority to challenge the authorisation . The judge therefore considered it inappropriate to address the substance of the director \u2019s objections . He nevertheless remarked , in general , that requests for authorisation were made in writing , but were submitted in person . The officer submitting the request had presented the case orally and the oral presentation was usually more comprehensive than the written request . As requests for authorisation had to be handled with the utmost urgency , judges had had no realistic opportunity to examine the case file or to check that the request for authorisation corresponded to the contents of the case file . Furthermore , the information in the case file was often obtained from unverifiable sources . Judges therefore had to rely on the information in the request for authorisation , which presupposed a certain element of trust . The judge further observed that there had been an enormous increase in the workload concerning tapping and that this was due , inter alia , to an interagency agreement which had been reached under the auspices of ORG ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) and had extended the jurisdiction of ORG in this area . In his view , questions of jurisdiction should not be regulated by \u201c agreements \u201d but by statute , which was not the case in relation to tapping . The judge stated that telephone tapping had been authorised on CARDINAL previous occasions in the course of the investigation into the suspected extensive criminal transactions within the industrial group mentioned above . He had thus had sufficient and detailed knowledge about the applicant \u2019s case . The judge associated himself completely with the decision taken , although the suspicion against the applicant might later have been dispelled . This was nothing unusual and happened in PERCENT of cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to take measures with a view to eliminating unlawful interception and recording of telephone conversations .", "CARDINAL .

ORG agreed on CARDINAL and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant , in reply to his above request of CARDINAL DATE , that the framework for the interference was defined by LAW and the relevant statutory provisions including LAW DATE . Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL defined the court \u2019s jurisdiction in such matters in cases where criminal proceedings had not been brought . The fact that the relevant issue was not governed by a law was only a formal shortcoming . Moreover , a draft law had been prepared to cover the relevant issue .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG questioned CARDINAL members of the investigative team . Their depositions included , inter alia , the information that the operative part of the team had been colluding with the applicant ; that the applicant had been in close contact with ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; that the applicant had been involved in several contractual transactions within the group , which had eventually harmed the interests of the steelworks ; that the request for authorisation to tap the applicant \u2019s phone had been based on the suspicion that he had committed the offences of aggravated fraud ( LAW ) and money laundering ( LAW ) ; that the request had been drafted without consultation of the case file ; that the interception had been necessary because it had not been possible to move the investigation forward without it ; and that after the interception had been compromised the case file had been made available to various officials , including the Minister of Justice , who at that time also acted as the Minister of the ORG ad interim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the criminal complaint by the police director . It noted that a \u201c committee of experts specialising in operational tasks \u201d had been set up and \u201c had detected no breach of the applicable regulations \u201d . The interception had been authorised by a judge and had thus been lawful . There was no basis for scrutinising the judge \u2019s decision . In conclusion , there was no case to answer . The decision has never been served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he had lodged some CARDINAL criminal complaints DATE about the interception of his telephone conversations and mishandling of the verbatim records . Without submitting further details the applicant indicated that those complaints had been rejected without an appropriate examination of the facts .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE that officer had complained to ORG office and to ORG office about abuse of authority in the context of examination of the applicant \u2019s complaints .", "CARDINAL .
