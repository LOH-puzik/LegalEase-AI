THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , born in DATE , was an NORP national at the time of the events complained of . He has since obtained GPE nationality and , as far as the ORG is aware , is at present living in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant first arrived in the GPE in DATE . DATE he met PERSON , a GPE national . On DATE a daughter , PERSON , was born to the couple , who were not married and were not living together . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG judge ( kantonrechter ) appointed the applicant as the auxiliary guardian ( toeziend voogd ) of PERSON as her mother ipso jure being her guardian ( voogdes ) .", "CARDINAL . At some time in or around DATE , the applicant moved in with PERSON and their daughter in the house of PERSON \u2019s mother . They lived together for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant went to LOC in DATE and stayed there for DATE . During this time , contact between the applicant on the one hand and PERSON and PERSON on the other was limited to the exchange of some letters .", "CARDINAL . The applicant returned to the GPE in DATE . The applicant states that he saw DATE until DATE . Despite the applicant \u2019s repeated requests , PERSON refused to give him permission to recognise ( erkennen ) S.", "CARDINAL . PERSON contracted a terminal illness . On DATE she made a will in which she expressed the wish that , after her death , her brother PERSON should have guardianship of her daughter , PERSON In DATE the applicant instigated summary injunction proceedings ( kort geding ) before the President of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) , seeking an order for PERSON to give him permission to recognise PERSON On DATE the President gave a judgment refusing to grant the injunction sought . The President considered that PERSON had not abused her power to withhold permission to the applicant \u2019s recognition of PERSON , since the change of surname which such recognition would entail for PERSON could not be deemed to be in her best interests . However , the President added by way of obiter dictum that it was important for both the applicant and his daughter that contacts between them be continued . The President therefore thought it desirable that S. spend DATE with her father .", "CARDINAL . In a further , supplementary will dated DATE PERSON stated that she had agreed with another of her brothers , PERSON , that after her death PERSON would be placed with his family . PERSON further stated that it was her express wish that the applicant should not visit her daughter as this would seriously disrupt the life of the family in which PERSON was to be raised . PERSON also expressed the opinion that it would be contrary to the best interests of her daughter if the applicant were to obtain access to S. According to PERSON , the applicant had no fixed abode , no residence permit , no employment and no financial means ; he would only use the care for his daughter as a pretext for obtaining a residence permit in the GPE and thus be entitled to social - security benefits . Prior to her illness , the applicant had not shown much interest in LOC , nor had he contributed financially to S. \u2019s upbringing .", "CARDINAL . PERSON died on DATE . In conformity with her wishes , her brother , PERSON , was granted guardianship of PERSON and she was placed in PERSON PERSON \u2019s family . The applicant saw PERSON once DATE under an arrangement with the NORP family .", "CARDINAL . Following PERSON death , the applicant requested ORG , Deaths and Marriages ( ambtenaar van de burgerlijke stand \u2013 \u201c the Deventer Registrar \u201d ) to draw up a deed of recognition and to enter this into the register of births . By a letter of DATE , ORG notified the applicant of his refusal to do so , being of the opinion that NORP law , which did not provide for the recognition of children , applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request pursuant to LAW ) with ORG asking that ORG be ordered to draw up the deed of recognition and enter it in the appropriate registers . Although ORG agreed with the applicant that GPE law applied , it nevertheless refused to grant the request on DATE . It considered that , when alive , PERSON had always withheld her permission for the applicant \u2019s recognition of PERSON ; it had not been established that there was family life within the meaning of LAW ; following Ms R. \u2019s death somebody other than the applicant had been granted the guardianship of PERSON ; and PERSON was , moreover , not living with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE , the applicant requested ORG to grant him access to LOC every other weekend , as had been recommended by the President of ORG . He submitted that Mr H.R. was frustrating his right to regular and undisturbed access to his daughter . At the hearing in those proceedings on DATE , Mr ORG and PERSON stated that there was not and never had been family life between the applicant and PERSON ; that the applicant only wanted regular access to S. in order to obtain a residence permit ; that PERSON was settling into her new family ; that PERSON called Mr PERSON \u201c Daddy \u201d ; that PERSON did not enjoy the applicant \u2019s visits ; and that she did not trust him . In reply , the applicant stated that PERSON was very important to him ; that the late PERSON had been heavily influenced by her overbearing mother ; that unbeknownst to PERSON mother the applicant had continued the relationship with PERSON after they had stopped living together ; and that it was PERSON mother who had told PERSON not to call the applicant \u201c Daddy \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At the conclusion of the hearing ORG , being of the opinion that there was \u201c family life \u201d between the applicant and PERSON , decided provisionally that the contacts between the applicant and PERSON were to continue at the offices of ORG ( PERSON ) , and that it would take a decision based on a report to be drawn up by that organisation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE against the decision of ORG not to order ORG to draw up a deed of recognition . He argued that PERSON refusal to consent to his recognition of S. no longer had any effect after her death . That being so , there was no call for the courts to go into the question whether or not there existed family life between the applicant and S. Should the Court of Appeal nevertheless be of the opinion that it ought to examine this question and that a balancing exercise as required by LAW was called for , the applicant submitted that he was the natural father of PERSON ; that not only had there been a meaningful relationship between PERSON and himself , they had also lived together as a family for some time and they had contributed equally to the care and upbringing of PERSON The applicant also referred to his request lodged with ORG to have his rights of access to S. increased . While he conceded that during the mother \u2019s DATE an unwanted recognition might have constituted a disproportionate interference with her private and family life , after her death only the interests of the applicant and the child remained to be balanced against each other , and there were no weighty interests on the side of the child which militated against recognition .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lastly submitted that it had been his desire from the outset to obtain guardianship ( voogdij ) of S. after her mother \u2019s death and that PERSON should live with him . In order for a request for a change of guardianship to stand any chance of success , the applicant ought first to have recognised his daughter . The applicant urged ORG to deal with his request speedily as he was being threatened with expulsion , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) not accepting that there was family life between the applicant and PERSON would serve to confirm officially the natural ties between father and daughter .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before ORG on DATE , the applicant submitted , inter alia , that he had always done everything possible to ensure PERSON \u2019s happiness but that PERSON family had never accepted him . However , the relationship between PERSON and him was very strong .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that the explicit refusal of PERSON to consent to the applicant \u2019s recognition of PERSON had not ceased to have effect after her death , as she had stated in her will that she maintained the refusal which she had considered to be in the best interests of S.", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further found that , even assuming that family life had at CARDINAL time existed between the applicant and PERSON , that tie had been broken by subsequent events . The contacts which had taken place between the applicant on the one hand and PERSON and PERSON on the other had been so sparse and irregular , and so devoid of mutual commitment , that they could no longer be regarded as constituting family life . ORG went on to hold , however , that even if it had to be assumed that family life still existed , the interests of the child should be its foremost consideration . These interests would be best served by allowing PERSON to grow up in the family where she had been placed after the death of her mother and in accordance with her mother \u2019s explicit last wishes , and where she received the care she needed . The recognition intended by the applicant was aimed at bringing about a change in this situation and , for that reason , could not be held to be in the best interests of ORG found that this was all the less so as the applicant had never had the care of S. , had not previously indicated that he actually wished to care for her and , in addition , had not substantiated his claim that he would be able to discharge his duty of care in a responsible manner . Moreover , recognition would mean that S. would automatically take the applicant \u2019s surname , whereas she now had the same surname as the other members of the family in which she was growing up .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) , arguing , inter alia , that ORG had been wrong to hold that the refusal of PERSON to consent to the applicant \u2019s recognition of PERSON could still have effect after her death . Moreover , the relevant legal provisions did not require that , in order for the natural father to recognise a child following the death of the mother , there should be family life between them . In any event , contrary to what ORG had found , there was family life between the applicant and PERSON , so that ORG finding on this point was incomprehensible .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , ORG had also been wrong to hold that it would be in the best interests of S. to be raised in PERSON family . The legislature had , on the contrary , deemed that recognition by the natural father would serve a child \u2019s interests in a case such as the present where the mother had died . Moreover , recognition as such would not entail any changes in the child \u2019s living arrangements . Such changes could only be brought about if the applicant were to file a request for a change in the guardianship arrangements , in which event the interests of the child could be assessed at that time . Finally , the applicant submitted that ORG could not have properly assessed what was in the best interests of S. without having sought the opinion of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law . It agreed with the applicant that PERSON refusal to consent to his recognition of DATE to which she had been entitled , such a right having been provided by law in order to protect the interests of mothers in her position \u2013 was no longer valid after her death . ORG had given additional reasons for its decision not to order ORG to draw up a deed of recognition , even assuming that family life did exist . This reasoning , in the view of ORG , was sufficient in itself to support ORG decision . In this regard ORG pointed out that , as a result of a valid recognition , legally recognised family ties ( familierechtelijke betrekkingen ) would be created between the child and the person who had recognised the child . This far - reaching consequence meant that recognition could affect interests of the child which were protected by LAW . Although recognition could serve these interests , it could similarly harm them . LAW had thus required ORG to balance the applicant \u2019s interest in having the relationship between himself and PERSON confirmed as a legally recognised family tie , assuming that this relationship constituted family life , against the interest of the child in continuing to live with the legal family in which she had lived ever since her mother had died , and to keep that family \u2019s surname . ORG found that ORG had adequately acquitted itself of this task .", "CARDINAL . Given that the applicant had never made a secret of the fact that he intended to obtain guardianship of LOC and to have her live with him , ORG had been correct to take into account S. \u2019s interest in not having her residence with PERSON family threatened by the outcome of further legal proceedings . Finally , the legal provisions in force had not required ORG to seek advice from ORG , and it had been up to ORG itself to determine whether or not it needed such advice .", "CARDINAL . During and following the proceedings before ORG , a change in PERSON \u2019s living arrangements occurred ; ORG was unable to take these new circumstances into account as , pursuant to LAW ) , it was bound by the facts as established by ORG and contained in the case file .", "CARDINAL . In DATE returned to live with her maternal grandmother . According to ORG , CARDINAL of the reasons for this was the distress caused to the family of her uncle , PERSON , by the applicant \u2019s seeking access to S. On DATE ORG requested the juvenile judge ( kinderrechter ) of ORG to issue a supervision order ( ondertoezichtstelling ) in respect of S. During a hearing on DATE , the juvenile judge stated that for the time being it would be best if PERSON stayed with her grandmother , but that there should be contact between the applicant and PERSON and that the applicant \u2019s future role in the life of PERSON should be further examined . On DATE the juvenile judge issued a supervision order and appointed a family guardian ( gezinsvoogd ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to comply with a new request from the applicant to draw up a deed of recognition and enter it in the register of births . The applicant again turned to ORG , submitting that the circumstances leading to the rejection of his first request had changed as PERSON was no longer living with her uncle . He further stated that he was concerned about his daughter \u2019s well - being in view of the advanced age of the grandmother and the latter \u2019s overbearing character . Moreover , the applicant submitted that he was capable of looking after PERSON himself .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request on DATE . It considered that the change in LOC \u2019s living arrangements had been brought about by the juvenile judge and could not be held to be to the detriment of S. Moreover , the persons responsible for the care and upbringing of S. were in receipt of assistance as a result of the supervision order . The change in the living arrangements could therefore not , as such , alter the result in the balancing exercise that had been carried out by ORG . Noting that the applicant was still attempting to obtain guardianship of PERSON , ORG finally considered that the recognition of PERSON by the applicant would not be in her best interests .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not file an appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the entry into force of the Law of DATE , which abolished the institution of auxiliary guardianship , the applicant is no longer S. \u2019s auxiliary guardian .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who since the events complained of has taken GPE nationality , has married another woman by whom he has a son .", "CARDINAL . A child born out of wedlock had the status of the natural child of its mother . It became the natural child of its father after having been recognised by DATE the \u201c father \u201d , for the purposes of this provision , being the man who recognised the child , whether or not he was the biological father ( Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A child born out of wedlock automatically had legally recognised family ties with its mother and her relatives . ORG by the father entailed the creation of a legally recognised family tie between him and the child , as well as between the child and the father \u2019s relatives ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . At the relevant time the surname of such a child was the surname of its father if the latter had recognised the child , and the mother \u2019s surname if not ( LAW of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Recognition of a child could be effected on the birth certificate itself or by a separate deed of recognition drawn up for that purpose by ORG , Deaths and Marriages or a notary ( LAW ) . A deed of recognition drawn up by the registrar was entered in the register of births ( LAW ) . At the request of an interested party , the regional court could order that a deed be entered in the appropriate registers ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A recognition was invalid if it was done during the mother \u2019s lifetime without her prior consent in writing ( LAW ) of LAW ) . However , in view of the right of the father and the child to respect for their \u201c family life \u201d , as guaranteed by LAW , ORG construed this provision in such a way that the effective right of veto which the provision gave the mother could be overridden if she abused it ( see , inter alia , ORG decision of DATE , PERSON , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The man who had recognised the child could apply to the district court for guardianship of the child . If a person other than the mother had guardianship , such an application could only be refused if there was reason to fear that the child \u2019s interests would be neglected . However , if the mother had guardianship , the application would only be allowed if the district court considered that the child \u2019s interests would thus be best served ( Article ORG of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In proceedings concerning , inter alia , parental authority , guardianship and access , the competent court could obtain advice from ORG if it felt that it needed such advice in order to make a proper assessment of the best interests of the child ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW came into force . It is still provided that , for a man to recognise a child who is not yet DATE as his , the prior written permission of the mother is required ( LAW ) ) . If the mother \u2019s permission is lacking , it may be replaced by the permission of the regional court ( LAW ) . However , the man who seeks such permission must be the child \u2019s biological father ; in addition , recognition must not be detrimental to the mother \u2019s relationship with the child or to the child \u2019s own interests ( ibid . ) . The explanatory memorandum on the bill which eventually led to the enactment of this provision makes it clear that the permission of the regional court is required in all situations where the mother \u2019s permission can not be obtained , including in the event of her death ( GPE ( Parliamentary Documents ) II , DATE session , CARDINAL no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . In addition , the child \u2019s written permission is required if he or she has reached DATE ( d ) ) .", "CARDINAL . At the same time LAW was introduced into LAW , pursuant to which a child may request the regional court to issue a judicial declaration of paternity ( gerechtelijke vaststelling van vaderschap ) in order to have a legal tie established between him or her and the biological father . No time - limit applies for lodging such a request .", "CARDINAL . The status of the Convention in GPE domestic law is regulated by the following provisions of LAW :", "\u201c Provisions of treaties and of resolutions of international institutions which may be binding on all persons by virtue of their contents shall become binding after they have been published . \u201d", "\u201c Statutory regulations in force within the GPE shall not be applicable if such application is in conflict with the provisions of treaties that are binding on all persons or of resolutions by international institutions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An example of a decision of ORG in which a provision of domestic law was considered to be incompatible with a provision of the LAW , and for that reason held to be overridden by the latter , is that of DATE , cited in paragraph CARDINAL above ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
