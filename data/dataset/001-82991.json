On DATE the applicant was arrested by the NORP police in GPE , GPE , where he lived with his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was extradited to GPE where he was taken into custody by the ORG . He was charged with several counts of aggravated smuggling .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was granted access to the materials in the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was referred for trial before ORG of PERSON . According to the Government , the case materials comprised CARDINAL binders ; charges had been brought against CARDINAL individuals who had acted in conspiracy ; the witnesses ' list included CARDINAL prosecution witnesses from several cities in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , as well as CARDINAL witnesses and experts for the defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held the preliminary hearing and fixed the opening trial date for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the case be returned to ORG for correcting defects in the indictment against the applicant . That decision was set aside by ORG on DATE , which referred the case back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial resumed but it was subsequently stayed from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released on bail .", "CARDINAL . According to the information provided by the parties and the elements available in the case - file to date , the criminal proceedings are still pending before the trial court .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG upheld the detention order , following an appeal by the applicant 's counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention . Each time ORG referred to the gravity of the charge against the applicant and to unspecified grounds to believe that he would abscond .", "CARDINAL . Further extensions were granted by ORG on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . By way of justification , ORG invoked the gravity of the charges against the applicant and noted that the applicant had been in hiding DATE [ sic ] and that CARDINAL other co - defendants had also absconded . The extension order of CARDINAL DATE specified that the applicant should remain in custody \u201c until the defendants and their counsel had finished studying the case file , the prosecutor had referred the case for trial and the trial court had decided on the measure of restraint \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeals against the extension orders were rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was moved to remand centre no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention , referring to the gravity of the charges against the applicant , his history of absconding , and the risk that he would \u201c otherwise \u201d interfere with the course of the trial because CARDINAL other defendants had gone into hiding . On DATE the Nizhniy ORG upheld that decision on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a single decision , ordered to extend the applicant 's and his co - defendant 's detention until DATE , holding as follows :", "\u201c In deciding on extending the period of detention , the court takes into account that the measure of restraint in respect of [ the applicant and his co - defendant ] was imposed in accordance with Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW as there existed sufficient grounds to believe that they would abscond investigation and trial or interfere with the criminal proceedings . The grounds justifying the application of the measure of restraint still obtain to date . Positive references of the defendants and their medical ailments do not remove the grounds to believe that they can abscond because they are charged with particularly serious offences \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant filed an appeal . He submitted , in particular , that the first - instance court had failed to take into account the facts mitigating for the applicant 's release , such as the absence of a prior criminal record , positive references , a need to provide for his minor son , his chronic ailments , and the long period of detention which had already exceeded DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nizhniy ORG upheld on appeal the extension order of DATE , noting that the initial grounds justifying the holding of the applicant and his co - defendant in custody still obtained and that the defence had not put forward any arguments warranting a change in the preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG granted further extensions of the applicant 's and his co - defendant 's detention , invoking CARDINAL grounds : that they were charged with particularly serious offences punishable with up to DATE imprisonment , and that the applicant had once absconded , whereas the investigation had established that his co - defendant had planned to abscond .", "CARDINAL . In the decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that :", "\u201c ... if the preventive measure is replaced with a more lenient one , there exists a risk that the defendants would not appear at trial ; thus , only the custodial measure may ... ensure the protection of the interests of the ORG and society against crime and the possibility of a fair trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE employed a somewhat different wording which read as follows :", "\u201c Another , more lenient preventive measure , such as bail , would not be able to ensure a fair trial in this particular case . For that reason the need to ensure an effective protection of the public interests \u2013 notwithstanding the presumption of innocence and long periods of detention of both defendants \u2013 justifies a departure from the principle of individual liberty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG upheld , in a summary fashion , the above decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant 's and his co - defendant 's application for release on bail . It found that , although the risk of absconding still existed , with the passage of time that risk was no longer sufficient to justify a breach of the principle of individual liberty .
