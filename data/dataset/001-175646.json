De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . Following an altercation with other persons , the applicant was prosecuted by the public prosecutor at ORG for threatening conduct . An expert report was produced during the investigation , stating that the applicant had limited intellectual and cognitive capacities but that she should be held criminally responsible for her acts .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s defence of diminished criminal responsibility and sentenced her to CARDINAL DATE - fines , amounting to a total of MONEY ( ORG ) , for threatening and insulting conduct , as well as ordering her to pay damages to the victims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) against the judgment . She repeated that she had been unaware of the unlawfulness of her acts and sought an acknowledgment of her lack of criminal responsibility owing to the psychiatric disorders from which she claimed to suffer . Consequently , she asked for a fresh assessment of the facts and the opportunity to state her case at a hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing attended by the public prosecutor and counsel for the applicant . However , no examination of the applicant herself took place .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction for threatening and insulting conduct , but reduced the sentence to CARDINAL day - fines , amounting to a total of ORG CARDINAL . It held that there was no need for a fresh assessment of the facts because the applicant had not succeeded in challenging the validity of the assessment conducted by the court of first instance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant paid the fine in several instalments .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing before the ORG it was pointed out that in DATE , DATE after the fine had been paid in full , the entry concerning the applicant \u2019s conviction had been deleted from her criminal record .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the ORG complaining that she had not been heard in person by ORG , and that this violated LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG declared admissible the complaint under LAW and found a violation of that provision , holding as follows :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that in the present case ORG was invited to determine several questions relating to the facts of the case and to the person of the applicant . As before the court of first instance , the applicant raised , in particular , the question whether her criminal responsibility should have been deemed diminished , which might have had a major impact on the determination of the sentence .", "CARDINAL . The ORG takes the view that that question could not have been settled by ORG without a direct assessment of the applicant \u2019s personal testimony , particularly since the judgment of ORG had departed slightly from the conclusions of the psychiatric report without setting out the reasons for such a departure , as required under domestic law ... ORG re - examination of that question should therefore have comprised a full rehearing of the applicant ...", "CARDINAL . Those factors are sufficient for the ORG to conclude that in the instant case a public hearing should have been held before the appellate court . There has therefore been a violation of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the claims in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage under LAW , the ORG stated the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG firstly considers that when , as in the instant case , an individual has been convicted after proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of LAW , a retrial or the reopening of the case , if requested , represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation . In that regard , it notes that LAW permits the reopening of proceedings at domestic level where the ORG has found a violation of a person \u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms . However , the specific remedial measures , if any , required of a respondent ORG in order to discharge its obligations under the LAW must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the terms of the ORG \u2019s judgment in that case ( see PERSON GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-IV , and PERSON v. GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . In the present case , the only point at issue is the fact that the applicant was not given a hearing by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the ORG notes that in the present case the only applicable basis for an award of just satisfaction lies in the fact that the applicant was not afforded the safeguards of LAW . In that regard , it does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged , and rejects this claim . The ORG can not speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings before ORG would have been if it had examined the applicant at a public hearing ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . On the other hand , it considers it appropriate to award the applicant LAW in respect of non - pecuniary damage . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted an action plan to ORG concerning the execution of the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE . They confirmed that the amount awarded to the applicant had been paid to her on DATE . As regards the general measures , the Government pointed out that ORG had proposed amending LAW to allow hearings to be held in any court of appeal determining the issue of guilt or the sentence in respect of an accused person .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before the ORG it was pointed out that the aforementioned proposal had not been approved and had therefore not in fact been included in the final version of the revised Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL . At the time of adoption of the present judgment no plans to reform the Code of Criminal Procedure were on the domestic authorities\u2019 agenda . The procedure for supervising the execution of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Concurrently , on DATE , relying on LAW , the applicant lodged an application for review with ORG . She submitted that ORG judgment of DATE was incompatible with the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution submitted that the application should be allowed on the grounds that serious doubts could legitimately be raised about the conviction , particularly as regards the sentencing .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to grant a review . It held that there was no cause for a review because the judgment delivered by ORG was not incompatible with the ORG \u2019s judgment . It considered that the lack of a hearing for the applicant in ORG had constituted a procedural irregularity that was not amenable to review , and held as follows :", "\u201c ... under domestic law , an application for review can be submitted solely in respect of judgments ( in particular , convictions ) , and not in respect of orders concerning the conduct of proceedings , it being understood that ... \u2018 judgment\u2019 denotes any judicial decision on a case or on a procedural application ( see LAW ) .", "In the light of domestic law , however , a review of the judgment in the present case can not be allowed on the basis invoked by the applicant , because the conviction is not incompatible with ORG judgment ( LAW ) . On the other hand , the procedure followed by ORG in holding the hearing at the close of which the appeal was determined was incompatible with what ORG has deemed vital in order to guarantee the rights of the defence .", "Under domestic law , where the accused is legally required to appear in court , his or her absence entails an irremediable nullity ( LAW ) .", "However , even where a nullity is irremediable , it can not give rise to an extraordinary application for review of the judgment ...", "Furthermore , as noted by ORG , it is impossible to speculate about the decision which ORG might have taken if the convicted person had been examined at the hearing which led to the decision on her appeal , and , in particular , about whether or not the sentence would have been the same .", "ORG thus precluded from the outset any possibility that its decision might raise serious doubts about the conviction , regardless of the sentence actually imposed .", "In short , the conviction is not incompatible with ORG binding decision , and no serious doubts arise as to its validity .", "For that reason , being aware that it is not always possible to secure a retrial or the reopening of proceedings under the applicable domestic law , as in the present case , ORG decided to require ORG to compensate the applicant in respect of non - pecuniary damage , and thus to afford redress not for the unfairness of the conviction , which has not been established , but for a serious defect in the conduct of the proceedings which infringed the applicant \u2019s defence rights ...", "For the above reasons , the applicant \u2019s argument in support of her application to be granted a review is not substantiated .", "Consequently , the judges of ORG decide not to grant a review . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
