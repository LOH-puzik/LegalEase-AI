The first applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The second applicant , her son Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He has cerebral palsy and severe arrested social and intellectual development . He was defined as a \u201c patient \u201d within the meaning of LAW DATE and as such lacked the capacity to bring or defend legal proceedings . His application to the ORG was made through the first applicant , who acted as his \u201c litigation friend \u201d throughout the domestic proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , PERSON ( the first applicant \u2019s son and the second applicant \u2019s CARDINAL - brother ) was arrested on suspicion of murder and detained on remand at ORG , GPE . Following a report by a senior prison officer raising suspicions that Mr O\u2019Neill was involved in the supply and use of drugs within the prison , on DATE the governor ordered , inter alia , that all Mr O\u2019Neill \u2019s visitors be strip - searched before visits .", "CARDINAL . Unaware of the governor \u2019s orders , on DATE the applicants attended PERSON to visit Mr O\u2019Neill . Until then , neither of them had previously been to a prison . On presentation of their visiting orders , the applicants were requested to join the queue of visitors lined up by a security barrier . As requested , they removed their coats and placed them with their bags on a conveyor belt to be X - rayed . They were then frisked and searched by metal detector . Whilst waiting with other visitors in a corridor to go inside , a number of prison officers approached them and told the applicants to follow them . They were taken across the courtyard from the south gatehouse by CARDINAL prison officers . The second applicant asked his mother what was happening . As they approached the north gatehouse , CARDINAL of the officers stated that they had reason to believe that the applicants were carrying contraband . When the first applicant asked what this meant , she was told that he was referring to drugs .", "CARDINAL . At the north gatehouse , the applicants were taken through another security barrier and up some stairs to the first floor . They were informed that they would be strip - searched and that if they refused they would be denied their visit to Mr O\u2019Neill . The second applicant was beginning to be distressed and the first applicant tried to calm him down . They were then taken to separate rooms for the searches .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was taken by CARDINAL female officers into a small room which had windows overlooking the road in front of the prison and the administration block beyond it . It was dark outside and the lights in the room were on . There were lights on in the building , which led the first applicant to believe that people were still working in the administration block . Although there were roller blinds on the windows , they were not pulled down . The first applicant was told to take off her jumper and vest . CARDINAL of the officers searched them whilst the other officer walked around her , examining her naked upper body . She was then instructed to remove her shoes , socks and trousers , which she did . At this point , a third female officer entered the room . This officer asked where the consent forms were , and was told by CARDINAL of the officers where to find them . In answer to a question from the first applicant , the third officer confirmed that the form was for the second applicant . The first applicant explained that it would be no use to him because of his learning difficulties , particularly with reading and understanding , and that someone else needed to be there to explain to him what was happening . The third officer then left and the search of the first applicant continued . By this time she was crying . She was standing naked apart from her underwear . On her request , she was returned her vest and allowed to put it back on . She was told to pull down her underwear which she did and then told to spread her legs . She was then told to take one leg out of her underwear so her legs could be spread wider . She was told to bend forward and her sexual organs and anus were visually examined . The officer inspecting her body then asked the first applicant to pull her vest up again , asking for it to be raised higher and higher until it was above her breasts . The first applicant asked why that was necessary since they had already inspected her top CARDINAL . The officer ignored her and continued walking around her body . She was then told to put her clothes back on .", "CARDINAL . By the end of the search , the first applicant was shaking and visibly distressed . She believed that anyone outside the prison looking at the windows in the room where she was being strip - searched could have seen her in a state of undress . She was worried that if she protested too much she would not be allowed in to visit Mr O\u2019Neill . She was also worried about what was happening to the second applicant . Although none of the officers touched her , she felt threatened by their actions and considered that she had no alternative but to comply with their instructions .", "CARDINAL . After she had been told to put her clothes back on , CARDINAL of the officers approached the first applicant and asked her to sign the form to consent to a strip - search ( FCARDINAL ) . Attached to the consent form is a summary of the procedure to be carried out . The first applicant told the officers that she might as well sign it as there was by that stage nothing else the officers could do to her and she then did so without reading it .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was taken to a separate room by CARDINAL male officers . At first he refused to go into the room but was told that he would not get to see his brother if he did not agree . Once in the room , CARDINAL of the officers put on a pair of rubber gloves . This frightened the second applicant who feared that there would be a search of his rectum . As requested , he removed the clothes from the upper CARDINAL of his body and they were searched . He was subjected to a finger search , which included poking a finger into his armpits . The prison officers then told the second applicant to remove the clothes from the lower CARDINAL of his body . At first he refused to remove his boxer shorts . He was by this stage crying and shaking . He reluctantly removed his boxer shorts and was told to spread his legs . Because of his physical disability , he had to balance with one hand on the wall to do so . CARDINAL of the prison officers looked all around his naked body , lifted up his penis and pulled back the foreskin . He was then allowed to get dressed .", "CARDINAL . After this , CARDINAL prison officer left the room and returned with a consent form . When presented with it , the second applicant explained that he could not read and that he wanted his mother to read it to him . The officers ignored this request and said that if he did not sign the form he would not be allowed in to visit his brother . He signed the form .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were led back to the prison to proceed with their visit . During the visit , the first applicant told PERSON O\u2019Neill what had happened . The first applicant went into the toilet where she cried and vomited CARDINAL times . The second applicant felt shaken and nervous and was upset . The applicants did not stay for the full length of their visit .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the first applicant , on returning home , she removed her clothes and bathed because she felt upset , angry and dirty . Because of her experience , she did not visit Mr O\u2019Neill for DATE . In DATE , in the context of the civil proceedings , she was examined by PERSON , Professor of Psychiatry . At that time ( DATE after the incident ) , the first applicant stated that she still thought about the strip - search DATE , continued to get upset about it , remained angry about what had happened and had difficulty sleeping . Dr ORG considered that the severe upset that she had experienced in the prison made her existing depression ( for which she was receiving medication at the time of the visit ) worse , but that , apart from recurrent intrusive recollections of her time at the prison and psychological distress at anything that resembled her experience , she did not show other symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . He concluded that , as a result of her aversive experience in the prison , the first applicant would be more vulnerable to future traumatic events and more prone to depressive reaction .", "CARDINAL . As for the second applicant , on his return home from the visit , he went to his bedroom crying . For DATE after the incident , he would not see his girlfriend , baby son , friends or anyone else and spent large amounts of his time in his bedroom . He was also examined by Dr ORG in DATE . At this time , he stated that he was still feeling bad about the incident , had difficulty sleeping , and had nightmares about going into the room at the prison and of being strip - searched . He thought about being in prison almost continuously and broke out in a sweat and felt frightened when he recalled the incident . During a subsequent visit , he saw some of the same officers who had strip - searched him and became very frightened . In addition , he became afraid to leave the house alone and therefore stayed at home , only going out with his mother , the first applicant . He lost interest in his previous activities , showed irritability and hypervigilance .", "CARDINAL . PERSON concluded that the second applicant was suffering from PTSD ( scoring CARDINAL on the DSM - IV ( ORG and Statistical Manual ) scale , where CARDINAL would indicate presence of PTSD ) and had a depressive illness . He found that both illnesses had been substantially caused by his strip - search experience . He found that the second applicant had experienced the strip - search as a threat to his physical integrity , believing that he was going to experience anal penetration , to which he had responded with fear and a feeling of hopelessness . His symptoms were severely impairing his ability for social functioning . Dr Sims concluded that even after recovery the second applicant would remain vulnerable to further symptoms with lesser provocation than previously .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the second applicant was further examined by Dr Sims . He concluded that he was still suffering from post traumatic stress disorder ( which in fact was more severe , measuring CARDINAL on the ORG scale ) and depressive illness . He predicted some improvement , with appropriate treatment , within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicants\u2019 civil claims against ORG , holding that the searches constituted a trespass to the person which could not be justified by Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of FAC ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) for CARDINAL reasons . Firstly , the trial judge held that the strip - searches were an invasion of their privacy exceeding what was necessary and proportionate to deal with the drug smuggling problem . Although he accepted that there were serious drug problems at the prison at the time of their visit and that there were reasonable grounds for believing that PERSON O\u2019Neill had been obtaining illicit drugs ( he referred to the report by a senior prison officer that his speech had been slurred and mannerisms incoherent ) , he held that the prison officers should not have searched the applicants as it would have been sufficient to have searched PERSON O\u2019Neill after they left . Secondly , the prison authorities had not adhered to their own rules . The judge rejected the applicants\u2019 submission that LAW was relevant , holding that although strip - searches were unpleasant they did not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment . The trial judge accepted the diagnosis of the second applicant as suffering from PTSD , but did not think that his symptoms had lasted as long as the psychiatrist thought , and that the second applicant had substantially recovered from the effects of the strip - search by DATE , when he made a parasuicide attempt . He awarded the first applicant a total of MONEY ( GBP ) ( comprising GBP CARDINAL basic damages and GBP CARDINAL aggravated damages ) and the second applicant a total of GBP CARDINAL ( comprising GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL basic damages and GBP CARDINAL aggravated damages ) , ORG having conceded battery following the trial judge \u2019s factual findings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed ORG appeal . The court disagreed that trespass to the person could be extended to fit these circumstances and found that no wrongful act ( save for the battery against the second applicant ) had been committed . Lord Chief Justice PERSON noted that there were numerous ways in which drugs could be smuggled into prison and that the most vigorous regime of searching prisoners would not in itself suffice . He found therefore that a search of PERSON O\u2019Neill would have been inadequate . He rejected the ORG arguments that LAW DATE , which did not have retrospective effect , could affect the outcome of the appeal . While agreeing that the LAW had no retrospective effect , Lord Justice PERSON commented that if the events had occurred after the coming into effect of the LAW , the applicants would have had a strong case for relief due to the manner of the search and the public authority \u2019s lack of regard for DATE . The court set aside the first - instance judgment and substituted an award of a total of ORG CARDINAL to the second applicant for battery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG and dismissed the ORG appeal . Holding that LAW DATE was not applicable as the events took place before its entry into force on DATE , ORG nevertheless went on to consider whether , if the LAW had been in force , breaches of the LAW could be made out . Lord PERSON , delivering the leading judgment , found that there was no infringement of LAW as the conduct had not been sufficiently humiliating to constitute degrading treatment .", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the present case , the judge found that the prison officers acted in good faith and that there had been no more than \u2018 sloppiness\u2019 in the failures to comply with the rules . The prison officers did not wish to humiliate the claimants ; the evidence of PERSON was that they carried out the search in a matter - of - fact way and were speaking to each other about unrelated matters . The ORG were upset about having to be searched but made no complaint about the manner of the search ; PERSON did not ask for the blind to be drawn over the window or to be allowed to take off her clothes in any particular order and both of them afterwards signed the consent form without reading it but also without protest . The only inexplicable act was the search of PERSON \u2019s penis , which the prison officers were unable to explain because they could not remember having done it . But this has been fully compensated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As for Article CARDINAL :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL is more difficult . PERSON thought , at [ DATE ] QB CARDINAL , CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL , that the ORG would have had a strong case for relief under section CARDINAL if LAW had been in force . Speaking for myself , I am not so sure . Although LAW guarantees a right of privacy , I do not think that it treats that right as having been invaded and requiring a remedy in damages , irrespective of whether the defendant acted intentionally , negligently or accidentally . It is one thing to wander carelessly into the wrong hotel bedroom and another to hide in the wardrobe to take photographs . Article CARDINAL may justify a monetary remedy for an intentional invasion of privacy by a public authority , even if no damage is suffered other than distress for which damages are not ordinarily recoverable . It does not follow that a merely negligent act should , contrary to general principle , give rise to a claim for damages for distress because it affects privacy rather than some other interest like bodily safety : compare PERSON v Chief Constable of ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Dealing with the applicants\u2019 submission that , in order for GPE to conform to its international obligations under LAW , ORG should find that there was ( and in theory always had been ) a tort of invasion of privacy under which the searches of the applicants were actionable and damages for emotional distress recoverable , Lord PERSON stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Nor is there anything in the jurisprudence of ORG which suggests that the adoption of some high level principle of privacy is necessary to comply with LAW . ORG is concerned only with whether LANGUAGE law provides an adequate remedy in a specific case in which it considers that there has been an invasion of privacy contrary to LAW and not justifiable under LAW . So in PERSON v GPE CARDINAL EHRR CD CARDINAL it was satisfied that the action for breach of confidence provided an adequate remedy for the PERSON complaint and looked no further into the rest of the armoury of remedies available to the victims of other invasions of privacy . Likewise , in PERSON GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL the court expressed some impatience , at paragraph CARDINAL , at being given a tour d\u2019horizon of the remedies provided and to be provided by LANGUAGE law to deal with every imaginable kind of invasion of privacy . It was concerned with whether PERSON ( who had been filmed in embarrassing circumstances by a ORG camera ) had an adequate remedy when the film was widely published by the media . It came to the conclusion that he did not .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the ORG relied upon PERSON \u2019s case as demonstrating the need for a general tort of invasion of privacy . But in my opinion it shows no more than the need , in LANGUAGE law , for a system of control of the use of film from ORG cameras which shows greater sensitivity to the feelings of people who happen to have been caught by the lens . For the reasons so cogently explained by Sir PERSON in ORG [ DATE ] ORG , this is an area which requires a detailed approach which can be achieved only by legislation rather than the broad brush of common law principle .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the coming into force of LAW DATE weakens the argument for saying that a general tort of invasion of privacy is needed to fill gaps in the existing remedies . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW are in themselves substantial gap fillers ; if it is indeed the case that a person \u2019s rights under LAW have been infringed by a public authority , he will have a statutory remedy . The creation of a general tort will , as ORG pointed out in ORG , at [ DATE ] QB CARDINAL , CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL , pre - empt the controversial question of the extent , if any , to which the Convention requires the ORG to provide remedies for invasions of privacy by persons who are not public authorities .", "CARDINAL . For these reasons I would reject the invitation to declare that since at DATE there has been a previously unknown tort of invasion of privacy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Prison Act DATE allows the Secretary of ORG for ORG to lay down rules relating to the management of prisons .", "\u201c The Secretary of ORG may make rules for the regulation and management of prisons , remand centres , young offender institutions or secure training centres , and for the classification , treatment , employment , discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to this power , the Secretary of ORG has issued ORG . Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Prison Rules DATE ( consolidated DATE ) , which was in force at the relevant time , provided :", "\u201c Any person or vehicle entering or leaving a prison may be stopped , examined and searched . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The details of the grounds for stopping and searching visitors and the procedure to be followed were set out at the relevant time in a document entitled \u201c Strategy and Procedures of Searching at FAC \u201d . This document is not available to the public . The relevant paragraphs ( as cited by ORG at paragraph CARDINAL ) are as follows :", "\u201c DATE Searches will be conducted in as seemly and sensitive manner as is consistent with discovering anything concealed .", "No person will be strip - searched in the sight of anyone not directly involved in the search .", "A person who refuses to be searched will be denied access to the prison or detained in accordance with s.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "DATE Strip - searching of visitors is not permitted except in the circumstances specified in CARDINAL and then only if police attendance is not possible . In cases where strip - searches of visitors are necessary it is preferable that this is done by the police .", "DATE A visitor who refuses to co - operate with the search procedures will be advised that the failure to comply will result in exclusion from the prison .", "DATE If the duty governor sanctions a strip - search , the visitor should be taken to a room which is completely private and informed of the general nature of the suspected article . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
