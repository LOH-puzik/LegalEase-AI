{"ITEMID": "001-78095", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "AYEGH v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in GPE in DATE , and is currently in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Mr C. H. Ehrenkrona of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant and her son A. ( born in DATE ) arrived in GPE . On DATE they applied to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) for asylum and residence permits and , on DATE , an initial interview was held with them . The applicant stated that her husband and an adult daughter remained in GPE where the family had always lived . She and A. had fled from GPE because A. would be called to do his military service when he reached DATE . There was a risk that he could be stationed at the border with GPE which would expose him to great danger . They further claimed that they had left GPE with the help of smugglers to whom the applicant had given her passport , in which A. was also registered . Thus , she could only show the NORP migration authorities a copy of her NORP identification certificate ( shenasnameh ) . However , neither the applicant nor A. , nor any other member of their family , had ever been arrested or otherwise persecuted by the NORP authorities .", "At a second interview , held on DATE , the applicant and PERSON added to their earlier statements that A. and a friend had once , in the school yard , glanced at The Satanic Verses by PERSON which another student had brought with him to school . The incident had been reported to the headmaster of the school who had beaten PERSON and then continued to harass him . Because of this , the applicant and her husband had tried in vain to get PERSON transferred to another school . Moreover , the applicant pointed out that , since PERSON was a minor , the fact that she had helped and accompanied him would cause her problems if she returned to GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application for asylum and residence permits . It first found that the applicant and PERSON had not been persecuted by the NORP authorities and thus could not be considered as refugees or granted asylum . It then noted that the son was obliged to do his military service once he reached DATE , but that this was not a reason for granting him a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . Moreover , the claim that he had had a conflict with his headmaster did not alter this conclusion . Thus , ORG found no reason for A. and the applicant to be allowed to stay in GPE on humanitarian grounds .", "The applicant and PERSON appealed against the decision to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , maintaining their claims and adding that the applicant and her husband were in the process of divorcing . Moreover , they alleged that ORG had , on several occasions , been raped and abused by his headmaster in GPE , who had also threatened him . A. had only told his mother about this in DATE after repeated attempts by the health care personnel to persuade him to tell her . Since homosexual acts were strictly forbidden in GPE , he strongly feared that he would be severely punished if he were forced to return to his home country . As a result of his traumas , A. suffered from a serious depression and there was a real risk that he would try to commit suicide if he was deported . Lastly , the applicant was also suffering from the uncertain situation .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , sharing ORG reasoning and conclusion . As concerned the new information provided by ORG and the applicant , it noted that , if a minor were forced to perform sexual acts with a grown man , he would not be punished for it . However , the adult man could be sentenced to death . ORG therefore considered that A. could get help from the NORP authorities if he were threatened by the headmaster , as there were no indications that the authorities would not assist the family in such a situation . It further considered that the mental health problems of the applicant and PERSON were not of such a serious nature that they could be granted residence permits on humanitarian grounds .", "On DATE ORG decided that the applicant and A. should be kept under supervision due to the risk that they would go into hiding to avoid deportation . Thus , they were ordered to report to ORG CARDINAL times a week .", "However , on DATE , ORG decided that the applicant and A. should be taken into custody pending the enforcement of the deportation to GPE , and the decision was enforced in respect of the applicant DATE . The decision was due to the fact that A. had gone into hiding and could not be found , and there was a real risk that the applicant would do the same . Moreover , on DATE , ORG handed over the responsibility for the enforcement of the deportation of the applicant to the police authority as she had declared that she would not leave GPE voluntarily .", "On DATE the applicant and A. lodged a new application for asylum and residence permits with ORG . They invoked medical certificates stating that PERSON was in poor mental health , suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder and depression , and that the applicant was also depressed and very afraid . Moreover , the applicant stated that her husband in GPE had repeatedly called and threatened to kill her if she returned to GPE and that the NORP authorities neither could nor would protect her . She claimed that her husband had divorced her and had threatened to kill her if she returned because he accused her of having committed adultery in GPE , having abandoned her home in GPE and having unlawfully kept his son from him . Her brother - in - law , with whom she and A. had stayed after their arrival in GPE , had also turned against her after her husband \u2019s accusations , and she had been forced to find another place to stay . The applicant explained the late submission of the new circumstances and evidence by the fact that she had been in despair over her son \u2019s situation and that she herself had suffered from serious mental problems . Furthermore , she had not realised the importance of telling the NORP authorities about her husband \u2019s threats until she had been detained .", "The applicant and PERSON also requested that ORG stay the enforcement of their deportation , but this request was rejected on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant and ORG renewed their request for a stay of the enforcement of the deportation . They submitted new evidence in the form of copies of documents in NORP which the applicant had received from her sister in GPE . Apparently , the applicant \u2019s husband had given the copies to her father but , due to her father \u2019s advanced age , she had not been able to find out when or how her husband had transmitted the copies . Moreover , since her husband had the originals , she would not be able to get hold of them . According to the applicant the documents were copies of :", "A report to a first instant court by the applicant \u2019s husband accusing her of adultery , abandoning her home and family , of unlawfully withholding her son from his father and of illegally leaving the country . This \u201c summons application \u201d is dated DATE .", "A \u201c formal notice \u201d whereby the applicant \u2019s husband warns her for the last time to come home and repent for what she has done or the court proceedings will go ahead ( dated DATE ) .", "CARDINAL summons to appear before the court to defend herself against the above charges ( dated DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively ) . The last of these CARDINAL warnings states that if the applicant does not present herself before the court , it will take an appropriate decision and the case might be examined on the material before it .", "A private letter from her husband ( undated ) stating that he has reported her for adultery and other offences to the authorities and that he will demand the harshest punishment possible for her .", "Before ORG , the applicant claimed that , due to the above charges , she would face a real risk of being either sentenced to death or punished in an inhuman manner . Moreover , there was a real risk that she would be tortured during interrogation in order to force her to confess to the alleged crimes .", "On DATE , DATE , ORG rejected the renewed request to stay the deportation .", "On DATE the applicant was taken by the police to FAC , GPE , to be deported . However , once there , the police decided not to go through with the measure as they considered that the applicant was not in a state to be transported as she was acting in a very violent manner , refusing to get on the plane . The police also decided that the applicant should no longer be kept in custody , but that she should be placed under an obligation to report to ORG CARDINAL times a week .", "Also on DATE , following the ORG \u2019s indication under LAW , ORG decided to stay the deportation of the applicant until further notice . ORG decision is still in force .", "On DATE ORG rejected the new application . It noted that the applicant had stated that her husband had started to threaten her DATE after her arrival in GPE , but that she had not mentioned it previously . ORG found this strange . Moreover , as the applicant had failed to give any reasonable explanation for this delay , it considered the statements questionable . It further observed that the applicant had only handed in fax copies of the documents invoked , not the originals , and DATE before the planned enforcement of the deportation . Thus , ORG considered that the copies had little value as evidence . Already against this background , it found it highly doubtful that the applicant had demonstrated that she was in need of protection in GPE .", "In any event , it noted that the applicant had not claimed that her husband had any proof that she had been unfaithful but that , on the contrary , his suspicions were unfounded . Having regard to what was known about the evidence required in GPE to convict someone of adultery , ORG considered that the applicant had not shown that it was likely that her husband could prove his accusations of adultery , which were groundless , in a court hearing . Moreover , to the best of ORG knowledge , it was not a criminal offence for a married woman to leave GPE without her husband \u2019s permission although , normally , it was not possible . However , it could constitute a ground for divorce . In view of the above , ORG found that even if the applicant had left the country illegally and without her husband \u2019s permission , she had not shown that it was probable that she would risk being subjected to such serious difficulties from the NORP authorities , if returned , that she was in need of protection in GPE . The fax documents which had been invoked by the applicant did not change this assessment .", "As concerned the applicant \u2019s claim that she would face problems because of the accusations of the unlawful removal of a child , ORG noted that the son had been DATE when they entered GPE and that he was now DATE . It further observed that , to its knowledge , a married woman who takes her child with her out of the country without the permission of the husband / father could not be convicted of abduction or kidnapping . In the event that someone were considered guilty of having wrongfully removed a child , no disproportionate sentence was known to have been imposed . Therefore , the applicant was not in need of protection on this ground either .", "ORG , ORG considered that , in so far as the applicant alleged that her husband and his family would pose a threat to her upon return to GPE , it was for the NORP authorities to deal with the matter . It noted that so - called honour killings were not accepted by ORG and that the authorities should be able to help her and offer protection . It followed that she was not in need of protection in GPE on this ground either . ORG also rejected ORG \u2019s request for asylum and a residence permit and concluded that , making an overall assessment , the circumstances were not such that it would be contrary to humanitarian standards to deport them to their home country .", "On DATE the ORG adjourned the case at the request of ORG following the enactment of an interim amendment to LAW , on the basis of which the applicant \u2019s case would be reviewed .", "On DATE the Government informed the ORG that , on DATE , ORG had decided not to grant the applicant a residence permit in GPE on the basis of the interim amendment to LAW . ORG had concluded that the applicant could not be granted leave to stay on either medical or humanitarian grounds .", "It appears that A. , in a separate decision by ORG , was granted a permanent residence permit in GPE .", "In a letter of DATE , the applicant informed the ORG that she had requested ORG to reconsider its decision of DATE because of her continuously deteriorating mental health . However , the request had been rejected on DATE as ORG considered that it had already examined her health status and that the new information invoked did not alter its previous conclusions . The applicant then stated in her letter that , due to her very poor mental condition , deportation would cause her personal suffering beyond her ability to endure , for which reason it would be a violation of LAW to deport her .", "The applicant has submitted CARDINAL medical certificates to the ORG dated DATE and DATE , respectively .", "The first certificate was written by PERSON , specialist in psychiatry at ORG , and based on CARDINAL consultation lasting TIME . She first noted that the applicant had previously had contact with psychologists and doctors because of depression and that , during the examination , she was distraught and anxious and expressed suicidal thoughts and an extreme fear of returning to GPE . She was taking sleeping pills and antidepressants . PERSON concluded that the applicant suffered from a serious depression with anxiety symptoms , and that there was a real risk that she would try to commit suicide if she were to be deported .", "The second certificate was written by PERSON , chief physician at the psychiatric clinic at ORG , who had examined the applicant on CARDINAL occasion in DATE , but had known her for DATE since she had treated A. at the clinic . According to this certificate , the applicant was very worried and afraid about her own situation but even more about how A. would recover and manage if she was deported from GPE and he was left alone . It was noted that she was traumatised by her experiences and the threats and abuses of which she had been , and continued to be , the victim . She was diagnosed as suffering from a serious mental illness in the form of a depression and an enduring crisis reaction with suicide plans . PERSON further stated that PERSON still had a great need for his mother and that , if she were deported , there was a real risk that A. might try to commit suicide . She concluded that the applicant was showing signs of pre - psychotic thinking and that she was very close to the limit of what she could bear .", "The basic provisions , applied in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE were laid down in the CARDINAL LAW ( utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) . However , LAW was replaced , on DATE , by a new LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslag , DATE hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Both the DATE and DATE Acts define the conditions under which an alien can be expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "LAW , LAW provided that an alien staying in GPE for DATE should have a residence permit . Such a permit could be issued , inter alia , to an alien who , for humanitarian reasons , should be allowed to settle in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) . For example , serious physical or mental illness could , in exceptional cases , constitute humanitarian reasons for the grant of a residence permit if it was a life - threatening illness for which no treatment could be provided in the alien \u2019s home country .", "Further , according to LAW , an alien who was considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection was , with certain exceptions , entitled to residence in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d referred to an alien who was outside the country of his nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or religious or political opinion , and who was unable or , owing to such fear , unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applied irrespective of whether the persecution was at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities could not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals ( LAW , LAW ) . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d was meant , inter alia , a person who had left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) .", "An alien who was to be refused entry or expelled , in accordance with a decision that had gained legal force , could be granted a residence permit if he or she filed a new application based on circumstances which had not previously been examined , and if the alien was entitled to a residence permit under LAW , LAW , or it would be contrary to the requirements of humanity to enforce such a decision ( LAW , LAW b ) . Regard could also be had to serious illness under this provision . Such new applications were filed with and examined by ORG ( Chapter CARDINAL , LAW ) .", "As regards the enforcement of a refusal of entry or expulsion , account had to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien could not be sent to a country where there were reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) .", "In essence , LAW did not substantially amend the above provisions , except for the following :", "By LAW , ORG has been replaced by ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW ) . Moreover , it is no longer possible to renew applications but , instead , ORG shall , on its own initiative , determine whether there is any impediment to the deportation or expulsion ( LAW , LAW ) .", "Furthermore , DATE and DATE , certain interim amendments to the DATE Act were in force , according to which ORG , upon application by an alien or on its own initiative , could re - determine final decisions already taken by ORG . The object of these temporary amendments was to grant residence permits to aliens who , inter alia , had been in GPE for a very long time or where there existed \u201c urgent humanitarian interests \u201d ( humanit\u00e4rt angel\u00e4get ) . Special consideration was given to the situation of children ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
