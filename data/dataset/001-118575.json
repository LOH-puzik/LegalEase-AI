On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor terminated the criminal proceedings on the ground that no offence had been committed .

The photographs can not show the ORG height [ ... ] . These identifications are useless , given the NORP statements . On the other hand , as seen from the [ albums attached ] , the witness was shown persons of a different age , not the CARDINAL described by him . Moreover , it is not clear why the identification parade had to be conducted through the showing of photographs , from which the FAC height and hair colour are not visible .", "In this connection , it is necessary to interview the head of the police directorate , as well as the officials responsible for criminal investigations , [ so as to establish ] which of their subordinates had a padlock - shaped beard at the time and met the description given by the victim .", "The court considers that the investigation was not comprehensive and objective , because important witnesses have not been interviewed by the military investigator and , if necessary , confrontations had to be organised .", "Moreover , it was necessary to collect evidence as to which officers worked on the case on the date at issue ; this had to be done though an interview with their direct superiors . It was necessary to conduct identification parades , and not photograph identifications , [ so as to perceive ] the features such as hair and beard . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On the basis of the facts , as established above , the ORG reached the following conclusions :", "\u201c By DATE Republic of Bulgaria , the ORG is liable for damage caused through the unlawful actions and omissions of its bodies and officials . The provision is of a general character and its implementation is to be regulated by statute . The tort liability of the ORG and the municipalities is thus regulated in the GPE and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act ( ORG ) , which is the applicable special statute [ ... ] The ORG \u2019s liability is strict , the victim receives damages directly from the juridical person to which the respective body or official belongs . The liability is objective as it is not necessary to show that the damage was caused through the fault of anyone . [ ... ]", "By DATE ( CARDINAL ) ORG , the ORG and the municipalities are liable for any damage caused to individuals and legal persons from the unlawful acts , actions or omissions of their bodies and officials , in the course of or in connection with an administrative activity . By DATE of the ORG , the action is to be directed against the [ bodies ] whose unlawful acts , actions or omissions led to the damage caused . By DATE , the compensation is to cover any pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage , which is a direct and proximate result of the harm done . For the liability to be engaged , the following preconditions have to be met : CARDINAL ) there has to be pecuniary or non - pecuniary damage \u2013 actual damage or lost profit ; CARDINAL ) it must have been caused by an unlawful act , action or omission of a body or an official of the ORG or the municipalities ; CARDINAL ) it has to be in the performance of an administrative activity , namely the damage has been caused by the unlawful act , action or omission of the body or official , in the course of or in connection with an administrative activity ; and CARDINAL ) direct and proximate causal link between the unlawful act , action or omission and the damage caused . [ ... ]", "The analysis of all written evidence in the present case leads to the unconditional conclusion that on DATE and DATE officials of the First police directorate in GPE caused to the plaintiff minor bodily injury . As early as DATE the [ doctor at ORG ] noted a \u201c light bruise on the left side of the chest and the back \u201d . During the plaintiff \u2019s examination on DATE [ the coroner ] noted CARDINAL different injuries in the areas of the left ear , left part of the chest , left side of the back , left and central parts of the waist , right side of the chest down to the waist and left side of the waist towards the pelvis . Part of these injuries correspond to the CARDINAL established by [ the in - house doctor ] , at the same time the coroner himself is explicit in his conclusion that the injuries could have been caused in the way and at the time indicated by the plaintiff . The plaintiff \u2019s description of the events of CARDINAL and DATE at the [ police directorate \u2019s building ] is consistent , as seen from the records of his [ examinations during the criminal proceedings ] . During these examinations the plaintiff was interviewed as a witness , after having been notified of the criminal sanctions in the event of perjury . [ ... ] The combined assessment of [ these records ] together with the remainder of the evidence shows that they all establish identical factual circumstances . In that regard , objective data are also contained in the CARDINAL court decisions given in the framework of the criminal proceedings [ concerning appeals of the applicant against decisions of the prosecution to discontinue the proceedings ] , which are obviously based on evidence collected during the investigation . It has not been disputed that the [ criminal proceedings in question ] were opened following a complaint by the plaintiff against unknown officers of the First police directorate in GPE that on DATE and DATE they had caused him a minor bodily injury , an offence under LAW ( CARDINAL ) taken in conjunction with LAW . As seen from [ the decision ] of ORG of DATE , in the course of the criminal proceedings a medical expert report was commissioned , which established that ORG \u2019s injuries had caused him pain and suffering . [ ... ]", "On the basis of all the evidence indicated above , the court concludes that on DATE and DATE the plaintiff PERSON was beaten by officers of the First police directorate in GPE where he had been detained . A full description of the injuries is contained in the [ coroner \u2019s ] medical report of DATE . The testimony of the witness ORG [ the plaintiff \u2019s mother ] establishes that prior to his detention on DATE the plaintiff PERSON was completely healthy . The court accepts this testimony as objectively given , despite the ORG close relation with the plaintiff , as it is logical and consistent . The testimony of [ PERSON ] corresponds to the remaining evidence as well . For example , at the time of the arrest the plaintiff was searched , but nothing irregular was noted on his body or in his behaviour . Also at the time of his detention on DATE the plaintiff filled in a declaration , where he indicated that he did not have health problems . The witness [ V. ] explains that on DATE her son left for work in a good state of health , but in the evening did not come back . He came back in the evening of DATE , TIME , in a deplorable state \u2013 his left eye was swollen , he had a yellow - blue bruise on the chest . They sent him immediately to see a doctor , for which there are medical documents . [ ... ]", "The court has appointed medical experts who submitted a report , which the court accepts as competently prepared . It has not been challenged by the parties . It establishes that the injuries described in the medical documentation in the case [ were such ] as to cause pain and suffering . The legal definition of the offence of minor bodily injury contained in LAW and QUANTITY of the Criminal Code covers cases of injuries to health causing pain and suffering .", "For the considerations above the court finds that the preconditions for the liability of the ORG under LAW ORG were met . It was shown in an unconditional manner that during his detention at the First police directorate \u2019s building , on DATE the plaintiff received a number of injuries , amounting to minor bodily injury within the meaning of LAW of LAW . Those injuries were caused by officials [ of the directorate ] , in the course of and in connection with their activity in relation to the plaintiff \u2019s [ detention ] . The fact that the [ detention order ] has not been quashed is irrelevant , because the plaintiff\u2019 \u2019s beating ] ) that the use of force was justified , within the meaning of [ the provisions of ORG ] . That is why it follows that in the course of the performance of their official activity in [ detaining the applicant ] officials of the First police directorate performed unlawful actions , namely caused a minor bodily injury to the plaintiff [ ... ] The medical documentation in the case establishes a direct and proximate link between the ORG behaviour and the damage caused to the applicant , namely injuries to his body . The considerations above show that all CARDINAL preconditions for the ORG \u2019s liability under LAW ORG have been met . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the amount of damages to be awarded , the ORG took into account the nature of the injuries caused to the applicant , as well as the particular circumstances , namely the fact that the injuries were caused by police officers , in a situation where the applicant had been particularly vulnerable as he had been deprived of his liberty . It referred once again to the testimony of the applicant \u2019s mother , who had stated that after his release the applicant had been in \u201c a deplorable state \u201d and that the events \u201c had destroyed the family \u201d . The ORG took note , furthermore , of the amounts awarded by the domestic courts in other similar cases . Lastly , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that the compensation should be comparable to the amount awarded in the ORG \u2019s case of PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ( where the ORG awarded ORG CARDINAL in nonpecuniary damage ) . It noted that the circumstances in that case had been much graver and that , in addition , unlike in PERSON , the case before it did not concern the ineffective investigation into the applicant \u2019s beating by the police .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the above , the domestic court awarded the applicant CARDINAL NORP levs ( ORG ) , the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) , in respect of non - pecuniary damage .
