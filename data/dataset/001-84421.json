The applicant is a NORP national and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the brother of PERSON In DATE the latter was a party to civil proceedings concerning a dispute between neighbours living in a block of apartments . PERSON lived above Mr F. The dispute related to Mr F \u2019s objection to PERSON habit of hanging out wet clothes to dry over Mr F. \u2019s yard , thereby allegedly interfering with his property rights . Mr F. relied on the provisions of section CARDINAL of ORG in this connection . Pending the trial of the dispute , PERSON applied for an injunction to restrain PERSON from hanging out clothes to dry over his yard .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL occasion during the application for injunction proceedings , and after PERSON and her lawyer , PERSON , had already left the court room , the presiding magistrate changed the date of a future hearing , which had already been fixed . As a consequence , PERSON was not aware of the new date and was not present at the hearing . In her absence the presiding magistrate issued the injunction in favour of Mr F. On DATE the relevant court trying the merits of Mr F. \u2019s civil action found against PERSON and issued a permanent injunction against her .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction , claiming that the injunction had been issued in her absence and without giving her the opportunity to testify .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld her claim . It held that the audi alteram partem principle was applicable to the procedure for issuing an injunction . Referring to LAW , which stated that an injunction should not be issued unless the court was satisfied that it was necessary in order to preserve any right of the person seeking it , ORG held that the relevant test was a matter for the court \u2019s discretion . However , if the court found it necessary to hear the parties , they should be duly heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice . In the present case , the court held that through no fault of her own , PERSON had been denied her right to be heard and therefore the said warrant was null and void .", "CARDINAL . Mr F. , the other party to the civil proceedings , appealed against the judgment of DATE . In the first - instance proceedings , PERSON had been assisted by PERSON , while at the appeal stage he had appointed the latter \u2019s son , PERSON was presided over by the Chief Justice , who sat with CARDINAL other judges . The Chief Justice was PERSON brother and PERSON uncle .", "CARDINAL . At the appeal hearing of CARDINAL DATE , the Chief Justice , after asking some questions , alleged that the conduct of PERSON was unethical , as he had impugned , without justification , the conduct of Mr. F \u2019s lawyer . When it was noted that in the first - instance proceedings Mr F. had been represented by the Chief Justice \u2019s brother , the Chief Justice threatened to refer the case to \u201c the competent authorities \u201d . Furthermore , he dictated a note to this effect , which read as follows :", "\u201c The ORG is asking PERSON , who himself is declaring that the date of the hearing at first instance had been changed when he and his client had already left the courtroom , why he insisted that the said change of date occurred consequent to a request by a lawyer . PERSON reply is : \u201c I deduce so , as there were CARDINAL lawyers present : PERSON and me . \u201d", "... PERSON lawyer asserts facts and has no problem hypothesising about the behaviour of another lawyer and the judge , after he and his client had walked out of the courtroom . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON said a few words in his own defence , but no oral submissions regarding the merits of the appeal were heard . The Chief Justice suspended the hearing and went to his chambers . TIME the lawyers of both parties were called into the Chief ORG \u2019s chambers . Explanations were heard and no further action appears to have been taken .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found against PERSON and reversed the judgment of ORG . It held that principles of natural justice were not mandatory and could not be invoked in preliminary proceedings that were essentially conditional and of a temporary nature . Moreover , ORG did not agree with the issue of fact mentioned in the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction . Relying on LAW , she alleged that the President of ORG ( the Chief Justice ) lacked objective impartiality by reason of his family ties with the other party \u2019s lawyers and that this had been manifest in the incident of CARDINAL DATE . Observing that ORG had denied facts which had been already proved , she further submitted that her right to a fair trial had been violated .", "CARDINAL . As PERSON had died before her constitutional claim could be determined , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant intervened in the proceedings before ORG in his capacity as brother of the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed PERSON claim as frivolous and vexatious . Although it noted that the plaintiff had failed to request the Chief Justice to withdraw from the case before the pronouncement of the final judgment , it rejected the ORG \u2019s plea of non - exhaustion of ordinary remedies and decided to exercise its constitutional jurisdiction . As to the merits , it made a thorough analysis of the notions and rights emanating from LAW , including equality of arms , but placed particular emphasis on the requirement of impartiality of ORG . However , it was unable to find any link between the incident of CARDINAL DATE and the content of the judgment of DATE . As confirmed by PERSON himself , the incident had been defused ; however , this could not have given PERSON or her lawyer any expectation that ORG would rule in her favour . Furthermore , ORG was composed of CARDINAL other judges , who had not been involved in the incident , and there had been no doubt that the judgment , which appeared to be well - reasoned , had been delivered by the bench as a whole .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG declared the appeal inadmissible . It reiterated that in accordance with LAW , no appeal lay against a decision dismissing an application as frivolous and vexatious .", "CARDINAL . LAW , ORG of ORG , regarding warrants of prohibitory injunction , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The object of a warrant of prohibitory injunction is to restrain a person from doing anything whatsoever which might be prejudicial to the person suing out the warrant .", "( CARDINAL ) The court shall not issue any such warrant unless it is satisfied that such warrant is necessary in order to preserve any right of the person suing out the warrant , and that prima facie such person appears to possess such right . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law , as it stood at the time of the present case , a judge could be challenged or could abstain from hearing a case if one of the parties was represented by the former \u2019s son or daughter , spouse or ascendant . Nothing prevented a judge from sitting in a case if the representative in issue was his or her brother or uncle . The pertinent articles of LAW , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The judges may not be challenged , nor may they abstain from sitting in any cause brought before the court in which they are appointed to sit , except for any of the reasons hereinafter mentioned . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A judge may be challenged or abstain from sitting in a cause -", "...", "( e ) if he , or his spouse , is directly or indirectly interested in the event of the suit ;", "( f ) if the advocate or legal procurator pleading before a judge is the son or daughter , spouse or ascendant of the said judge ; \u201d", "The relevant article of LAW was amended in DATE to include another ground :", "\u201c ( g ) if the advocate or legal procurator pleading before a judge is the brother or sister of the said judge ; \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
