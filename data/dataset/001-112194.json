The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been an employee of the embassy of GPE in GPE since DATE . From DATE onwards she had a contract of indefinite duration and worked as a photographer at the embassy . Following an accident in DATE the competent authority issued a decision stating that she qualified for protection under GPE ( Invalideneinstellungsgesetz ) . Following a further accident , classified as work - related , the embassy dismissed her in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Her dismissal was declared void by ORG ( Arbeits- und ORG ) on the ground that it required the prior agreement of the competent authority under ORG . The court dismissed the argument submitted by GPE that it lacked jurisdiction on account of the United States\u2019 immunity . It found that , while foreign GPE enjoyed immunity with regard to acta iure imperii , they came within the jurisdiction of the domestic courts with regard to acta iure gestionis . The conclusion and performance of an employment contract fell within the latter category . ORG ( Oberster Gerichthof ) upheld that judgment on DATE , noting that GPE had not maintained the objection of ORG immunity in the further course of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the above proceedings , the applicant continued to have a valid employment contract with GPE embassy in GPE . However , the latter refused to make use of her services . Instead , on DATE , they applied to ORG requesting retroactive approval of the applicant \u2019s dismissal or , alternatively , agreement to a future dismissal . ORG refused to grant retroactive approval for the applicant \u2019s dismissal of DATE but gave its approval for a future dismissal . The competent ORG upheld that decision . On DATE ORG , ruling on a complaint by the applicant , set aside the decision to grant approval for the applicant \u2019s future dismissal , finding that the authorities had failed to establish relevant facts and had not duly weighed the parties\u2019 interests . The case was referred back to the ORG . On DATE GPE withdrew its application , stating that it had always maintained that the application of ORG to employees of the embassy interfered with the country \u2019s sovereignty .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant brought proceedings against GPE requesting payment of her salary . In a first set of proceedings , concerning salary payments up to DATE , GPE unsuccessfully raised an objection of jurisdictional immunity . Subsequently , GPE paid the applicant salary arrears of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) . On the occasion of the payment , the lawyer who had represented GPE in the proceedings informed the applicant by a letter dated DATE that the payment did not imply any acceptance of the NORP courts\u2019 judgments and that GPE considered her employment contract to be terminated and would , if she raised any further claims , \u201c make use of its diplomatic rights and immunities \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Further proceedings relating to the payment of salary from DATE to DATE led to a final default judgment by ORG . However , GPE did not pay the amount awarded to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also unsuccessfully brought proceedings against GPE claiming reimbursement of the social security contributions which she had been ordered to pay by the NORP authorities and a part of which the employer was , under her employment contract , obliged to refund . In those proceedings GPE authorities refused to serve the summons to attend the hearing . The NORP courts dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a judgment in default . Their position was upheld by ORG judgment of DATE ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action against GPE before ORG , claiming salary payments from DATE . The court scheduled a first hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . An attempt to serve the applicant \u2019s action and the summons to the hearing on GPE through ORG , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) , failed . According to the file a staff member of the NORP embassy in GPE handed these documents over to a staff member of ORG . However , by letter of DATE ORG informed ORG , which in turn informed ORG , that GPE authorities had refused to serve the summons and had returned the documents at issue to the NORP embassy in GPE . The letter was accompanied by a note from ORG informing ORG that GPE wished to assert its immunity in any case brought by the applicant . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG also informed the applicant accordingly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a judgment in default , noting that it had been impossible to summon the defendant . An appeal by the applicant to ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) was unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed her appeal on points of law on DATE . Referring to its judgment of DATE in a parallel case brought by the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it noted that the summons had not been duly served on the defendant , namely ORG . Consequently , the conditions for giving a judgment in default were not fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG held that the applicant \u2019s action and the summons to the hearing had not been served on account of the manifest refusal of GPE to comply with the request for service . It followed that further attempts to summon the defendant did not have any prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant requested that the summons be served by means of publication under LAW ( Zivilproze\u00dfordnung ) or , alternatively , that it be served on a court - appointed representative ( Curator ) LAW CARDINAL of the Code .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE ORG appointed a lawyer , PERSON , to represent GPE . It noted that the foreign authorities had refused to serve the summonses in any of the proceedings brought by the applicant . In the court \u2019s view GPE had wrongly relied on its alleged immunity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following an appeal by Dr. PERSON , quashed that decision . The relevant part of its decision reads as follows :", "\u201c In acting on a request for service , the ORG to which the request is made is exercising sovereign powers . This applies even if the court documents in question are addressed to that ORG and the authority responsible for acting on the request for assistance ( in this instance ORG ) refuses to forward them to the authority empowered to represent the ORG in private - law proceedings ( in this instance ORG ) . This is not a case of refusal to accept service ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) but rather a case of refusal to comply with a request for legal assistance . Such refusal is a sovereign right of the foreign State , against which a remedy can be sought only through diplomatic channels ...", "ORG endorsed this legal stance ( CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL t ) , stressing that , as international law currently stands , compliance or refusal to comply with a request for legal assistance is to be regarded as a sovereign act , irrespective of the subject - matter of the claim . The nature of the act is the defining factor . It is beyond doubt that the service of documents in court proceedings falls within the scope of so - called acta iure imperii and not acta iure gesionis , as a private individual can not perform an act of this nature . Although negotiations have been in progress for some time on an international agreement concerning service of process on foreign States ( which might make it sufficient for the action to be served on the country \u2019s foreign ministry ) , no such agreement has to date been concluded , with the result that the issue remains unregulated by any treaty between GPE and GPE .", "In a commentary on this decision , which had been published in DATE , DATE , Hintersteininger observed , inter alia , that , while the restrictive theory of service of process applied by ORG might be appropriate for the purposes of avoiding disagreements between GPE , it was not a requirement under international law . The author concluded that section CARDINAL of the Service Act \u2013 at least as currently applied to judicial proceedings instituted in GPE against foreign States \u2013 amounted to a \u201c self - imposed shackle \u201d as a result of which the standard of protection of ORG legal interests was subordinated to international - law considerations . Unless and until the NORP courts saw fit to apply a different interpretation of the provision in question \u2013 the fact that ORG , in its DATE ruling , continued to apply its case - law from DATE indicated that this was unlikely DATE there was an urgent need for the legislature to enact amending legislation in order to provide a practical solution to the problem of service of process .", "Referring to ORG international - law argument , the appellant raises the possibility of transmitting the action and an explanation of the legal circumstances , together with a translation into the country \u2019s official language , to ORG through diplomatic channels . In this case the defendant ORG would have no justification for returning the copy of the action at will ; in the event of a refusal to accept service , it should be deemed to have received the request . This would make effective service possible and would remove the need to appoint a representative .", "The objection to this line of argument is that such a procedure \u2013 which from a general international - law perspective is possible \u2013 is incompatible with the applicable legal provisions in GPE . As clarified in CARDINAL ObA CARDINAL/CARDINAL t , the action has to be served on a competent body within ORG , which is the authority representing GPE in the present employment - related proceedings . It is not sufficient for the document to have somehow reached another authority which appears to be responsible for forwarding the request for service . Accordingly , it is incorrect to speak of a refusal to accept service if the document was never transmitted to the competent authority . In this connection ORG stressed that , conversely , it would not be sufficient , in order to institute legal proceedings , for an action against GPE to be received by ORG if , for whatever reason , it was not forwarded to the Attorney - ORG as the competent authority representing the ORG in such matters . The first - instance court already acknowledged that a further request for service would have little prospect of success in view of the earlier comments of the GPE authorities .", "Nevertheless , the ( definitive ) refusal of ORG to forward court documents concerning the appellant to ORG does not justify the appointment of a representative for the defendant in accordance with LAW . As the appellate court explained in detail in its decision CARDINAL Ra CARDINAL/CARDINAL t , cited above , service of process on a foreign ORG is ( also ) based on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Service Act . Hence , for the purpose of performing it , recourse is to be had in any event to ORG . On the basis of this provision , which takes precedence , service via any means other than the diplomatic channels to which it refers \u2013 for instance , on a court - appointed representative DATE is ruled out . In view of the principle whereby a remedy against a refusal to comply with a request for legal assistance , which flows from the sovereign power of the foreign State , can be sought only through diplomatic channels ( see FAC , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; for a critical perspective , see ORG , PERSON zivilrechtlicher FAC ausl\u00e4ndische ORG , ORG DATE , CARDINAL et seq . [ DATE ] ) , the impugned decision lacks any legal basis . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant . It started by referring to its decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in a previous case brought by the applicant against GPE . It followed from that decision that the action brought by the applicant had to be served through diplomatic channels . It held that LAW , although it concerned the service of summonses abroad , was not applicable in a case like the present one in which the person or legal entity to be summoned relied on their immunity . The applicant \u2019s interpretation of the provision in question would undermine the concept of immunity .", "CARDINAL . Only section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW was applicable . The applicant did not contest the fact that foreign GPE came within the scope of that provision as they enjoyed \u201c privileges and immunities \u201d under international law . In that context ORG went on to state as follows :", "\u201c No agreement exists between GPE and the defendant concerning service of process from the perspective of ORG immunity from jurisdiction . In the absence of such agreement the generally recognised rules of international law ( LAW ) , together with section IX of the Introductory Act to LAW ( ORG ) and the principles developed in this connection by the case - law and by legal commentators , must apply . On that basis it is unanimously agreed that foreign GPE enjoy immunity in the exercise of their sovereign powers and are to that extent exempt from the jurisdiction of the domestic courts ( see , among other authorities , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; PERSON , JBl DATE , CARDINAL ; JBl DATE , CARDINAL ; He\u00df , JBl DATE , CARDINAL ; ORG , CARDINAL [ ORG ] ; ORG , ORG DATE , CARDINAL ; ORG , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DRdA CARDINAL [ GPE ] ; PERSON , ORG des V\u00f6lkerrechts Bd CARDINAL para .

CARDINAL et seq . ) . The service of process abroad , as a sovereign act , amounts \u2013 in the absence of an agreement between the GPE concerned governing the relevant procedure \u2013 to interference with the sovereign rights of the foreign ORG in question . For that reason it is a requirement in such cases to have recourse to ORG , which maintains close contact with the milieu concerned and is competent to take account of the relevant international - law considerations ( ORG BlgNR XV.GP CARDINAL ) , as the appellant correctly points out . However , contrary to her assertion , exclusive recourse to ORG is not merely recommended , but is required by statute ( the mandatory \u201c shall \u201d in section PERSON ) of LAW and section CARDINAL ) of the Service Act ) . The service of documents by any other means would be in breach of the law ( ORG , op . cit . , LAW , footnote CARDINAL ) .", "Although PERSON , in her commentary on CARDINAL ObA CARDINAL/CARDINAL t ( JBl DATE , CARDINAL ) concludes that the \u201c restrictive theory of service of process \u201d is appropriate for the purpose of avoiding international disagreements , she nevertheless calls on the legislature to amend LAW , as she sees evidence of a \u201c self - imposed shackling \u201d at least in the way in which that provision is applied . The legislature has not taken any action to date . It should further be observed that the strict approach to diplomatic immunity can be traced back to LAW , according to which the violation of immunity renders the proceedings in question null and void , in a manner which can not be remedied even by the parties ( except by a waiver of immunity ) ( \u00a7 QUANTITY ; GPE , op . cit . , \u00a7 PERSON para . CARDINAL , CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , op . cit . , \u00a7 CARDINAL JN para . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) .", "Contrary to the appellant \u2019s assertion , her request for the action to be served on the defendant by publication or by the appointment of a representative does not fall in the present case within the \u201c classic scenario \u201d under LAW , but is governed by the exception thereto and undermines the defendant \u2019s claim to diplomatic immunity . Accordingly it is not possible , precisely in this case , to proceed on the basis of that provision . On the contrary \u2013 in so far as the proceedings against the defendant in GPE are concerned \u2013 exclusive recourse must be had to diplomatic channels , as reasoned by ORG in case CARDINAL ObA CARDINAL/CARDINAL t . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant reached pensionable age . She gave the GPE embassy in GPE notice of her intention to terminate her employment contract and applied to the competent ORG for an old - age pension from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant extended her claim in the above - mentioned proceedings to salary payments from DATE to DATE . She requested again that the defendant be summoned to a hearing . In that context she referred to ORG and their Property ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , and argued that , according to LAW , transmission of the documents to ORG through diplomatic channels would be sufficient to effect service . The summons was handed over to a staff member of ORG but was again returned to the NORP embassy in GPE with the remark that GPE wished to assert its immunity in any case brought by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance court \u2019s decision refusing to give a default judgment . Referring to ORG case - law , it held that the refusal to serve a summons was an act of sovereign power . It noted , inter alia , that the LAW relied on by the applicant did not apply to proceedings which had been initiated before its entry into force and added that there were no rules of customary international law to indicate that GPE could not rely on immunity in the context of the service of a summons . No further appeal on points of law lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Service Act ( Zustellgesetz ) deals with the service of official documents abroad and the service of official documents on foreign nationals and foreign GPE or international organisations enjoying privileges and immunities under international law . It provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Service of process abroad shall be effected in accordance with existing international agreements or as provided for by the laws or other legal provisions of the ORG in which service is to be effected or by international custom , if necessary with the cooperation of the NORP diplomatic authorities .", "CARDINAL . Service of process on foreign nationals or international organisations which enjoy international privileges and immunities shall be effected through the intermediary of ORG , irrespective of where their place of residence or headquarters is located . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( Zivilproze\u00dfordnung ) read as follows :", "\u201c In the case of persons on whom process can only be served by publication because their address is unknown , the court shall appoint a representative ( Article CARDINAL ) , on application or of its own motion , if the persons concerned would have to perform a step in the proceedings as a result of being served with the documents , and in particular if the documents to be served contain a summons . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the case of service on persons outside the country who do not fall into the categories of recipients referred to in CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , LAW , in agreement with ORG , may order service to be effected by post , using the system of advice of receipt customarily used for international postal deliveries , to countries in which service in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW is not possible or gives rise to difficulties .", "CARDINAL . If no confirmation is received within a reasonable time that process has been served on an individual outside the country , the applicant party may request , depending on the circumstances , that service be effected by publication ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) or by the appointment of a representative under LAW . This shall also apply in cases where an unsuccessful attempt has been made to serve process abroad or where the request for service has no prospect of success owing to a manifest refusal by the authorities of the foreign State to comply with the request for legal assistance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in a related case concerning claims for reimbursement of social security contributions brought by the applicant against GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c The appellate court was correct in taking the view that , as international law currently stands , the decision to comply with or refuse a request for legal assistance is a sovereign act , irrespective of the subject - matter of the request . The nature of the act is the defining factor .

It is not disputed that , under NORP Federal law , GPE is represented by ORG in matters which are to be regarded as acta iure gestionis ( compare CARDINAL ObA CARDINAL/CARDINAL = ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL with further references concerning the employment contract between the claimant and the defendant ) . The action must therefore be served \u2013 as correctly requested by the appellant herself \u2013 on a body within that authority . It is not sufficient \u2013 as the appellant has claimed in the appeal proceedings \u2013 for the document to have somehow reached another authority which is meant to be responsible for forwarding the request for service ( ORG ) ) .
