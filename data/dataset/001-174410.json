According to the records of the police questioning , on all but CARDINAL occasion GPE and GPE were questioned by GPE , a police officer , and they did not ask for a lawyer . Subsequently , when questioned by a prosecutor on DATE , DATE stated that police officers had coerced him into incriminating his co - accused , including the applicant ; PERSON told the prosecutor that he would testify in court .", "CARDINAL . The trial commenced before ORG ( ORG apgabaltiesa ) on DATE and lasted until DATE . During that period CARDINAL court hearings were held in the presence of the applicant and his defence council .", "At the trial , GPE and GPE testified that they had never before met the applicant , and that ORG , who had died in the meantime , had been the instigator of some of the crimes . The court read out the pre - trial statements of GPE and GPE When invited to explain the discrepancies between those initial pre - trial statements and their subsequent evidence , they claimed that they had been forced to sign the initial pre - trial statements . DATE submitted that the statements had been illegible and that he had not been given the opportunity to engage a lawyer . PERSON stated that police officer GPE had been writing a record of his questioning while another police officer had questioned him . On CARDINAL DATE PERSON lodged with the first - instance court a written request for the court to take into account his submission that the police had coerced him into incriminating the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE GPE appeared before the first - instance court . She testified that she had taken statements from the accused . She stated that it was possible that another police officer , ORG , had participated in their questioning . On DATE , ORG appeared before the first - instance court .

The applicant \u2019s lawyer , GPE , was given an opportunity to put questions to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE submitted a written request to the first - instance court for it to disregard his pre - trial statements as he had been ill - treated and tortured during the pre - trial investigation in order to force him to incriminate his co - accused , including the applicant . Specifically , he had been constantly beaten and ridiculed : electric currents had been applied to his body through his handcuffs , and narcotic substances had been forcibly injected into his veins . Nobody had offered to assign him a lawyer . He had not complained about these incidents at the time because he had been afraid of retribution . However , after the completion of the pre - trial investigation he had complained to the prosecutor , who had ignored his complaint .", "CARDINAL . In his closing statement , the prosecutor denied the allegations of GPE and PERSON , emphasising that they had not lodged any complaints prior to the first - instance proceedings . During their initial questioning GPE and GPE had given evidence in respect of facts which at that stage had not been known to the police .

On DATE ORG delivered judgment . The court cited the initial pre - trial statements of GPE and GPE incriminating the applicant . It did not regard as credible their submissions that police officers had pressured them into giving those statements . The police officers had also questioned another co - accused , GPE , who , unlike GPE and GPE , had not incriminated the applicant . Furthermore , had the police officers pressurised them into giving their statements , they would have contained more details as regards the applicant \u2019s involvement . A.D. and GPE had signed the statements . The court did not find that their right to legal assistance had been restricted . No complaints as regards the alleged ill - treatment had been submitted or noted down in procedural documents by DATE or GPE , or their lawyers .

Given that the applicant had retained ORG to represent him , he had been aware of the proceedings and had intentionally failed to attend , thereby showing disrespect towards the court . In the applicant \u2019s absence the court was unable to ascertain whether he wished to maintain the appeal lodged by his lawyer .

This decision was sent to the applicant \u2019s address and to PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG delivered judgment with respect to the appeals lodged by the applicant \u2019s co - accused . It found that the first - instance court had correctly assessed the allegations of GPE and GPE as regards coercion .
