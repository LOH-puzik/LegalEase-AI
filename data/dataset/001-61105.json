POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 10;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . He is currently serving a prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated theft and sentenced him to imprisonment . While in prison , on unspecified dates the applicant wrote a letter to ORG of ORG and he received a reply . Dissatisfied with that reply , on DATE the applicant sent a letter to the President of ORG , complaining about the judge who had replied to his letter . The relevant passages of the applicant 's letter read :", "\u201c ( ... ) It can not be excluded that further acts of that kind on the part of ORG of ORG would make me complain to the judicial supervision about the irresponsible clowns placed in that ORG .", "I will start by saying that any little cretin , whether he wears a gown or not , should vent his need to intimidate others by making allusions to legal responsibility [ for their acts ] on his mistress , if he has one , or on his dog , but not on me . I am not going to be afraid of any such clown who wants to intimidate me , but the truth is that my request of DATE was addressed to the court , not to some fool .", "I expect that the President of ORG will somehow convey my request to that bully and that he will , at the same time , read his reply to me ( ... )", "Not only does [ the judge ] write rubbish about my alleged request for a pardon , which my request was absolutely not , but he also intimidates me . If he is such a brilliant lawyer that he is able to reply to questions that were not asked DATE and his legal skills can be seen if the content of my letter is compared with his reply \u2013 he should find a relevant legal provision to use against me . It would not change the fact that such a limited individual , such a cretin should not take the post of a reliable lawyer who would know how to reply to a letter . A cretin he will remain and I see no reason to be afraid of any legal consequences . \u201c You know , you understand , shut up \u201d \u2013 that is all the education he has , as a fool does not need any better . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on an unspecified date , ORG instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant . On DATE the prosecuting authorities lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant with ORG . He was charged with proffering insults against a ORG authority at its headquarters or in public , an offence punishable under LAW , committed by sending a letter to the President of ORG . In this letter the applicant had insulted an unidentified judge of that court 's ORG and all judges of that court . The applicant had been questioned in connection with the offence . He had stated that he had not meant the court as a whole , but CARDINAL judge , and this in his personal , not professional , capacity . He maintained that the letter could only be regarded as an insult against a private person , but not a ORG institution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of insulting a ORG authority and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The court found that on DATE the applicant had sent a letter to the President of ORG in which he referred to all judges of ORG in an insulting and abusive manner as \u201c irresponsible clowns \u201d . Moreover , further on in the same letter , he referred in a particularly insulting manner ( \u201c w spos\u00f3b szczeg\u00f3lnie obra\u017aliwy \u201d ) to an unidentified judge of ORG , to whom he had allegedly written certain letters , which remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . The court had regard to the results of the applicant 's examination by psychiatrists who found that he could be held criminally responsible .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that it was beyond any doubt that it was the applicant who had written the impugned letter . The analysis of its content and form led to the conclusion that the applicant had acted with the firm intention of insulting ORG as a judicial authority . He had first addressed himself to the judges of that court as a group , and then focused on CARDINAL unidentified judge . Accordingly , it had to be understood that the applicant had insulted the court as the ORG authority , and the unidentified judge could be regarded as a symbol of that court .", "The court further observed that the applicant , as a citizen , had a constitutional right to criticise the ORG authorities . However , the impugned letter had largely exceeded the limits of acceptable criticism and was directly aimed at lowering the court in the public esteem .", "The court further observed that the sentence was commensurate with the applicant 's degree of guilt and with the seriousness of the offence . The assessment of the latter had been made having regard to the nature and importance of the interests protected by the criminal law provision applied in the case , i.e. by LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his officially assigned lawyer lodged appeals against this judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following a request from all of the judges of ORG to be allowed to step down , considered that , in view of fact that the offence had been directed against the judges of that court , it was in the interest of the good administration of justice and the impartiality of the court that the appeal be transferred to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the contested judgment , having examined both the appeal lodged by the applicant himself and that of his lawyer .", "The court first noted that the first - instance court had accurately established the facts of the case . The court went on to state that it shared the conclusions of the first - instance court , namely that the content and form of the letter called for the conclusion that the applicant had acted with the firm intention of insulting ORG as a ORG authority . The legal assessment of the facts of the case was correct , and the sentence imposed corresponded to the degree of the applicant 's guilt . The applicant had a long criminal record , even though he had been assessed positively by the penitentiary services , and could be held criminally responsible . The applicant 's lawyer had argued that the applicant had intended to insult a specific person , not an institution . However , in the light of the court 's other findings , this analysis was rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyer lodged a cassation appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and confirmed the contested judgment . The court referred to the grounds of appeal in which it had been argued that the conviction had been in flagrant breach of LAW in that the applicant 's acts , in the light of his submissions as to his motives , did not amount to a punishable criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . ORG first noted that the grounds of the applicant 's cassation appeal had been laconic and limited in their reasoning . Moreover , it clearly transpired therefrom that in fact the applicant 's lawyer contested the assessment of evidence and the factual findings made by the lower courts , whereas the purpose of the cassation appeal was only to bring procedural complaints to the attention of ORG . This in itself constituted a sufficient basis for dismissing the appeal as not being in compliance with the requirements laid down by the applicable procedural provisions .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court emphasised , it was worth noting that ORG in its judgment had examined all complaints submitted in the appeal against the first - instance judgment , including those concerning the assessment of evidence and the factual findings of the first - instance court . No new arguments had been submitted to ORG to show that there had been any procedural shortcomings in the proceedings . Certainly the argument that the applicant 's acts could not be regarded as a criminal offence could not be regarded as such a procedural complaint .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to state that the applicant 's abusive letter , referred to and quoted by ORG , had clearly exceeded the limits of acceptable criticism . Even if it were acknowledged that in the second part of the letter the applicant had focused on CARDINAL judge , it had to be recognised that at the beginning he had attacked all the judges of ORG . The appellate court correctly had regard thereto . It had also indicated why it considered that the applicant 's attitude could be qualified as an offence under LAW . ORG therefore dismissed the cassation appeal as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW DATE , applicable at the relevant time , read as follows :", "\u201c Anyone who insults a ORG authority at the place where it carries out its duties or in public , is liable to DATE imprisonment , to a restriction of personal liberty or a fine . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
