He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE , and then by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s house was built in DATE in GPE . Until DATE , another small building was attached to its side wall , the length of the wall that functioned as a party wall measuring QUANTITY . On the part of the side wall that was not adjoining the other building , the applicant \u2019s house had several windows , including those of the CARDINAL bedrooms , and a balcony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local development plan was amended to permit the construction of a new QUANTITY building attached to the side of the applicant \u2019s house . The owners obtained all necessary planning permissions and building permits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the construction of a new building began on the neighbouring plot , replacing the old building attached to the applicant \u2019s house , which was demolished . However , as the new building was larger , the length of the party wall shared with the applicant \u2019s house now measured QUANTITY . As a result , the house \u2019s bedroom windows were blocked by a blind wall of the new building and the balcony was destroyed .", "CARDINAL . After an enquiry by the applicant , he was informed by the municipality and the building control authorities that he had been notified of an intended amendment to the local development plan , envisaging the construction of the new building , and had not objected to it . The applicant contested this fact , arguing that his signature attesting to the fact that he had received the notification had been forged .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the new building was finished and the municipality authorised its use .", "CARDINAL . Following that and because of the damage caused to his house , the applicant and his family moved out to another home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against his ORG building permit and sought an order that the construction works be ceased . On DATE the building control authorities rejected the appeal as inadmissible . The applicant applied for judicial review to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the owners of the neighbouring plot asked ORG to authorise the preliminary execution of the building permit , stating that the suspension of the works would inflict contractual penalties and other losses on him . In a final decision issued on DATE ORG authorised the continuation of the construction works , reasoning that their interruption would entail substantial losses for the owners of the plot .", "CARDINAL . By a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for judicial review as inadmissible . It held that the applicant had no standing to appeal against the building permit , as it concerned property which did not belong to him .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant applied for the judicial review of an order of DATE of the LOC deputy mayor , whereby the amendment to the local development plan of the area envisaging the construction of the new building had been approved . The applicant sought to have the construction works ceased pending the resolution of the dispute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for a suspension order as inadmissible , reasoning that his appeal had suspended the implementation of the local development plan by virtue of law .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date CARDINAL of the owners of the neighbouring plot asked the court to authorise the preliminary implementation of the approved layout pending the outcome of the applicant \u2019s appeal . By a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the request , reasoning that a delay in implementation would entail losses for the owners of the building .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the amendment to the local development plan . It held , in the first place , that it had not been established that the applicant had been informed of the intended amendment ( a name different from his had been indicated on the notification papers ) and therefore his appeal had been submitted in time . The court noted the disagreement amongst the experts appointed by it as to whether the side of the applicant \u2019s house was officially considered a blind wall , and hence , whether the legislation governing building works had been violated . Without adjudicating on this matter , it held that the order for the amendment did not contain any reasons , which made it impossible to assess its lawfulness . In particular , it was not explained why it was necessary to amend the existing plan . Furthermore , as the applicant had not been duly notified of the amendment , he had not had the opportunity to object to it , which was another violation of the legal requirements .", "CARDINAL . Although ORG judgment was not subject to appeal , the owners of the neighbouring building tried to challenge it before ORG , which rejected their appeal as inadmissible on DATE .", "CARDINAL . From the very beginning of the construction works on the neighbouring plot the applicant submitted numerous complaints to the building control authorities , which , however , refused to intervene , pointing out that his neighbours had been issued with all necessary planning permissions and building permits and , later on , that the courts had allowed the building works to be carried out .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained to ORG , the ORG , ORG , the President of GPE , the GPE municipality and other bodies , which all refused to intervene and on most occasions referred the matter back to the building control authorities .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant brought an actio negatoria against the owners of the neighbouring building . On DATE ORG dismissed the action . However , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG reversed and allowed the claim , ordering the neighbours to demolish their building . It held , on the basis of CARDINAL expert reports , that the amendment to the local development plan had breached the applicable legislation . As a result , the newly constructed building had rendered useless CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s rooms and had had a detrimental effect on the living conditions in his house . The court held that the violation of the applicable legal provisions had been so serious that it had rendered null and void both the amendment to the local development plan and the building permit .", "CARDINAL . One of the defendants filed an appeal on points of law , pointing out that his wife had not been summoned as a party to the proceedings , although she was a co - owner .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case to ORG for fresh examination . It established that the appellant \u2019s wife had been an interested party to the proceedings and that it had been necessary to ensure the participation of all interested parties . It further found that it could be inferred from the case file that there were other owners of the building who had not been summoned to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . After the case was remitted , the applicant identified all owners of the building and notified ORG of their names and addresses . A hearing was scheduled for DATE . The ORG has not been informed of the developments in the proceedings after DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant complained to the prosecution authorities that the notification sent to him concerning the amendments to the local development plan had been signed on his behalf by an unknown person . Criminal proceedings for forgery were opened against CARDINAL of the owners of the neighbouring plot , but the investigation was subsequently directed against the applicant . On DATE he was charged with perjury , in that he had lied to the investigator when declaring that he had not himself signed the document in question . The applicant was prohibited from leaving his place of residence without permission .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant and cancelled the prohibition on leaving the town . It is unclear whether any investigation against the owner of the neighbouring plot remained underway .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( ORG \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0442\u0430 ) provides that the owner of a piece of immovable property can not carry out actions which impede , in more than the usual way , the use of neighbouring properties .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the same LAW , an owner may request the cessation of any \u201c unjustifiable activity \u201d which hinders him in the exercise of his rights . In an interpretative decision ( no . CARDINAL of DATE ) the former ORG explained that such a claim ( actio negatoria ) provided protection against unjustified interference \u2013 whether direct or indirect DATE which might prevent an owner from using his property to the fullest extent . The claim could be used to declare such interference unlawful and enjoin the persons concerned to stop it and remove its effects . ORG held , in particular , that in cases where buildings have been constructed on a neighbouring property without the necessary documents and permits or in contravention thereof , the owner was not obliged to tolerate any restrictions on his right to use and enjoy his property which such a situation might cause . Thus , the actio negatoria could be used to obtain an order to demolish a building . Lastly , ORG held that unlike decisions of the building control authorities , the ORG judgments pursuant to such claims determined with finality disputes between the aggrieved owner and the perpetrator of the interference , and could be enforced as a matter of right .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ( case no . DATE ) the former ORG of GPE , examining an actio negatoria , held that the very fact of construction in breach of the relevant rules and legal provisions amounted to an impermissible interference with the neighbour \u2019s right to property , which did not thus need to be proven any further . In judgments no . CARDINAL of DATE ( case no . DATE ) and no . CARDINAL of DATE ( case no . DATE ) ORG held in addition that an actio negatoria could be allowed even where the construction or reconstruction works in the neighbouring property had been carried out in accordance with the relevant construction permits , as in issuing them the administrative authorities had not been under an obligation to take into account the neighbour \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG allowed an actio negatoria brought by the owners of a house whose neighbours had constructed a building in contravention of the construction permit granted , thus occupying a portion of the claimants\u2019 plot and blocking the light . ORG , finding that the situation hindered the effective enjoyment of the claimants\u2019 right to use and enjoy their property , ordered the neighbours to demolish their building .", "CARDINAL . In judgments no . CARDINAL of DATE ( case no . ORG ) and no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( case no . CARDINAL ) ORG also ordered , in actions under section CARDINAL of LAW , the demolition of unlawfully constructed buildings .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE State and ORG ( ORG \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 , \u201c the ORG \u201d ) provides that the ORG and municipalities are liable for damage caused to individuals and legal persons by unlawful decisions , actions or omissions by their organs and officials , committed in the course of or in connection with the performance of an administrative activity . The liability for damages of the municipalities was introduced following legislative amendments of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The domestic courts have applied this provision in a number of cases concerning the prevention of the effective exercise of the right to use and enjoy property caused by unlawful construction works in neighbouring plots authorised by the authorities . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL ) , ORG upheld a lower court \u2019s judgment allowing such a claim against the building supervision authorities and ORG , finding that the construction works on a plot neighbouring that of the claimant , although duly authorised by the defendants , had contravened the relevant construction regulations and had , as a result , infringed the claimant \u2019s right to light . ORG pointed out that the authorities\u2019 liability was engaged even where none of their decisions related to the disputed construction works had been expressly found to be null and void ; it was sufficient that the construction works were in breach of the statutory requirements .", "CARDINAL . In another judgment , no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( case no . CARDINAL ) , ORG awarded damages to a claimant in a similar situation , pointing out that he had on numerous occasions alerted the building control authorities of the unlawfulness of the construction works on the neighbouring plot . Those authorities had not fulfilled their obligation to order the cessation of the unlawful construction works and have the ORG building demolished , which had resulted in damage to the claimant \u2019s house .", "CARDINAL . In another case ( see judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , case no . CARDINAL , the judgment has entered into force ) , ORG awarded damages to claimants whose neighbours had erected a building without the necessary construction permits . The construction had subsequently been retrospectively approved by the municipal authorities , but the approval order had been annulled by the courts . ORG took note of the fact that even following these developments the ORG building was still standing and its demolition had been neither ordered , nor undertaken , and therefore held that the municipal authorities had failed in their obligations to protect the PERSON property .", "CARDINAL . In a similar situation , ORG also awarded damages ( judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , case no . CARDINAL , the judgment has entered into force ) . In that case , the claimant \u2019s property had been earmarked for expropriation and on that basis the municipal authorities had authorised the construction of a new building in its immediate proximity . However , the intended expropriation had subsequently been abandoned , which had forced the claimant to remain in her house , whose value had already seriously depreciated and which had also been damaged by the construction works close to it ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
