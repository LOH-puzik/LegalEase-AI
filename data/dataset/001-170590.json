According to the authorities , the applicant had added a handwritten note to the record which said , \u201c We want counsel to be present during the compiling of the offence record \u201d , and modified the date on which a copy of the record had been handed over to the defence .", "CARDINAL . Up until DATE the official database had FAC as the applicant \u2019s registered residential address . It appears that before or after that date , the applicant moved from his flat ( on FAC ) to reside in his mother \u2019s flat in the same town ( on FAC ) . He notified the residence registration office about that change .", "CARDINAL . The investigator dealing with the case issued a summons ( sent to the applicant \u2019s address on FAC ) requiring his attendance at her office on DATE in order to carry out investigative measures . On DATE a police officer reported that he had not delivered the summons since nobody had answered the door at that address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed of the decision to institute criminal proceedings against him . On the same date , Investigator PERSON interviewed the applicant , who added handwritten comments to the interview record . It was mentioned in the interview record that the applicant was ( temporarily ) residing in GPE village ; the address on FAC was mentioned as his official residence ; the record also contained a note of the telephone number provided by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP Further interviews were scheduled for CARDINAL and DATE , when the applicant refused the services of a legal - aid lawyer , PERSON also refused to sign an undertaking to appear at subsequent interviews when requested by the investigator .", "CARDINAL .

A similar decision was then issued on DATE , apparently , because the decision of CARDINAL DATE had not been enforced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief officer of the investigating authority issued a decision , under LAW of the CCrP ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , requiring that measures be taken to locate the applicant . The decision read as follows :", "\u201c On several occasions the suspect was summoned for the purpose of investigative measures ... but failed to appear , without reference to any valid excuse .

Such a record \u2018 may be\u2019 drawn up ( that is to say it is not an obligation ) if there are grounds cited in LAW ...", "Article CARDINAL of the Code contains strict rules concerning arrest and detention of a suspect . Following escorting to the competent official , it is necessary to draw up , within TIME , an arrest record . It should indicate the dates and that notification of the procedural rights has been made . [ The applicant ] was present in the police station and ORG offices for DATE to clarify some details relating to the investigation of the criminal case and to take a decision concerning the pending request regarding [ the applicant \u2019s ] whereabouts . After this he was free to go .

The applicant appealed , arguing as follows . While agreeing with the court that the situation did not fall within the ambit of \u201c escorting \u201d under LAW CCrP , he insisted that the court , in substance , had denied the fact of his \u201c deprivation of liberty \u201d and had failed to cite another applicable statutory basis for it . In particular , LAW could not supply a valid basis since it only concerned escorting for identification purposes . In the applicant \u2019s view , LAW was applicable and thus the non - observance of its requirements ( namely , the drawing up of an arrest record and notification of procedural rights ) disclosed unlawfulness . The reference to TIME for drawing up the record did not imply that there had not been \u201c deprivation of liberty \u201d if a person was held for TIME , or that LAW CCrP would not apply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment in the following terms :", "\u201c The available material and testimonies do not disclose that the applicant was restricted in his right to liberty and personal security .
