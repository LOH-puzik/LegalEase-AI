FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 3", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is currently in ORG after periods in other prisons , including PERSON . He is suffering from Aids , which he says he contracted in DATE , DATE before he was sent to prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a warrant was issued for the applicant 's arrest in connection with a number of serious offences . On DATE ORG convicted him of murder , attempt , armed robbery , and the false imprisonment and kidnapping of minors aged DATE and of adults . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , of which a minimum of DATE were to be served . On DATE he received an DATE sentence from ORG for attempted escape from lawful custody and assault . On DATE ORG convicted him of false imprisonment followed by mutilation , murder and attempted armed robbery . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , with a minimum of DATE to be served .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG ordered that the sentences imposed by the CARDINAL ORG should run concurrently in part , with the overall sentence not to exceed the statutory maximum of DATE . The minimum period to be served was increased to DATE . The applicant will now become eligible for parole on DATE .", "CARDINAL . He has been held in various prisons . At the time his application was lodged , he had been in ORG since DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE it was decided to transfer him to ORG on the grounds that : \u201c This transfer will enable family ties to be maintained with his partner , as the prisoner 's condition appears to warrant \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to information supplied by the ORG , the applicant lodged an application for a pardon on medical grounds on DATE with the support of an association called LAW Up . ORG asked ORG at ORG to appoint a medical expert to report on the applicant 's condition and life expectancy , and to advise whether his condition and current or foreseeable treatment were compatible with his detention in prison or in a special facility .", "CARDINAL . The Government stated that the application was turned down on DATE , after the applicant had refused to agree to a medical examination or to allow the expert access to his records .", "CARDINAL . While in FAC the applicant made an initial application for his sentence to be suspended under LAW , a provision that had only recently been introduced .", "CARDINAL . The judge responsible for the execution of sentences ordered a medical report advising , inter alia , on the applicant 's condition , whether he was suffering from an illness that compromised his chances of survival and whether his condition was permanently incompatible with his continued detention .", "CARDINAL . The expert , PERSON , lodged his report on DATE . After stating that the applicant had refused to undergo an examination and that the report was based solely on the medical records , he noted that the infection had spread and that the applicant 's condition had deteriorated , in particular because he had refused all treatment for DATE . He added :", "\u201c His condition necessitates his total , unfailing commitment to take his medication regularly and to undergo regular biological tests to assess how he is responding to treatment and whether the illness has been stabilised . All opportunistic infection must be warded off . The promiscuous nature of the prison environment makes it a source of such infection . The current increase in the viral load means that the prognosis is very poor and , and unless the patient responds to treatment , things may deteriorate very rapidly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Dr B. also noted that mentally the applicant was opposed to and refused all medical treatment and regular monitoring . He said in conclusion :", "\u201c Mr PERSON chances ( of survival ) can be regarded as compromised . While it is neither possible , nor realistic , to predict the future , the following remarks may be made on the basis of the information in the medical records :", "Despite having had no treatment for DATE and the increase in his viral load , Mr ORG has not had any major life - threatening problems of infection requiring highly specialised care in a special facility .", "The treatment Mr PERSON is required to take is oral , simple and can be administered in a prison environment . Monitoring is the responsibility of a medical team that is aware of the problem and composed of prison doctors and specialists in infectious diseases of the highest order .", "No one can safely predict what Mr PERSON attitude will be and whether he will agree to treatment in a particular environment .", "Although I have not been able to examine PERSON , having read the voluminous file and DATE medical records and having questioned prison staff , I consider that his condition is currently compatible with continued detention . It will always be possible , if he so wishes and if his symptoms worsen , for him to be re - examined at DATE , at which point the opinion of a psychiatrist should also be sought . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following his transfer to ORG , the applicant made a fresh application to ORG on DATE for an order suspending his sentence .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE , the judge responsible for the execution of sentences requested medical reports from PERSON", "CARDINAL . In his report of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON noted :", "\u201c Mr PERSON is carrying a serious disease : Aids . The diagnosis has been confirmed by the biological analyses ( serology , viral and lymphocyte TCARDINAL count ) and by the existence of other diseases , so called communal diseases , in association with HIV .", "The disease was contracted DATE . Mr PERSON himself says that it dates from DATE and openly admits that he refused treatment until DATE .", "The prognosis , whether in the short , medium or long - term , is grim . The specific treatment is onerous and can only be administered \u2013 with difficulty because the prisoner is uncooperative \u2013 in custody or in a relatively restrictive structure . This is the crux of the matter . In view of the seriousness of Mr PERSON condition and his disorders , which may be described as severe borderline syndrome , what is the solution ? On CARDINAL point , we entirely agree with the prisoner : he must be admitted to hospital for an assessment of the Aids position and its potential evolution and a check on the associated diseases : mycosis of the digestive tract , cutaneous mycosis , neuropathy and particularly tuberculosis . Although the tuberculosis appears to have been cured , in the United States Aids patients with tuberculosis are kept in permanent quarantine , as the NORP specialists consider that they are unable to cure tuberculosis in Aids patients and that the risk of infection is too high . That concern needs to be addressed .", "All things considered , Mr PERSON is able to tolerate detention in prison provided he is kept under strict medical supervision .", "Detention in a hospital would , however , be more compatible with his condition . Beyond the short term , that is to say the assessment of the potential evolution of the diseases , the question of compatibility will need to be reviewed , it being borne in mind that , since we are dealing with diseases that are severe , infectious and fatal , continued treatment outside the current setting would be risky . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Dr F. said in conclusion :", "\u201c PERSON is receiving treatment for a confirmed case of Aids . He has also been treated for tuberculosis . These diseases , related illnesses ( mycosis , various infections , neuropathy ) and severe psychopathy require assessment and his admission to hospital .", "The treatment he is receiving in detention in PERSON is entirely appropriate , compatibility with detention is reasonable under medical supervision , but it would be more coherent for him to be treated in hospital . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his report of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON gave the following answers to questions he had been put by the judge :", "\u201c ... ORG Seriousness of the illness and prognosis", "PERSON has been infected by the Aids virus , category ORG under the GPE classification . He has had opportunistic complications that have been treated . He will shortly have been receiving treatment for DATE , starting with a bitherapy which proved ineffective after DATE followed by tritherapy , which was effective , but was suspended DATE in DATE owing to neurological complications .", "DATE he began quadritherapy in GPE but stopped taking his medication for a period of DATE .", "He resumed treatment in DATE following the reappearance of adenopathy and a genital infection , but this has produced no results as he has refused treatment since DATE . Since his transfer to PERSON , the situation has got worse and the level of TCARDINAL has decreased .", "There is a risk of death in the short to medium term .", "CARDINAL/ Treatment required", "The quadritherapy started DATE is no longer effective . The patient is due to attend ORG for medical treatment which has become more onerous as a result of his poor general health . A more thorough examination is needed and can only be performed in a special facility . There is virtually no other treatment left to offer Mr PERSON against the Aids virus , beyond the detection and treatment of other opportunistic infections , in particular , of the digestive tract ...", "CARDINAL Whether his condition is compatible with detention in prison or requires special treatment that is only available in hospital", "PERSON condition is no longer compatible with detention in prison and requires treatment that is only available in hospital .", "CARDINAL/ Whether he is suffering from a disease that compromises his chances of survival", "Yes , PERSON is suffering from a disease that compromises his chances of survival in the short to medium term .", "CARDINAL/ Information and observations that may assist the court", "If the position concerning the viral load and TCARDINAL continues to deteriorate , complications may develop ( lymphoma , pneumopathy , toxoplasmosis , ORG infection or dementia ) . The hospital assessment will afford more detailed information on the evolution of the illness . Unforeseeable intercurrent lethal complication is possible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge also ordered a psychiatric report , which stated that the applicant was not suffering from a mental disorder amounting to insanity warranting psychiatric treatment , but had presented since childhood emotional imbalance marked by personality organisation with characteristic psychopathic traits which was not incompatible with continued detention . It was further noted that the applicant remained of dangerous criminal propensity and that , owing to his refusal to receive any psychotherapeutic treatment , there was no point in offering him such treatment in detention or making it a condition of a suspended sentence , since his active participation was the only guarantee of possible success .", "CARDINAL . The Paris Regional Parole Court met on DATE . In a judgment delivered that DATE , it ordered the applicant 's sentence to be suspended on the grounds that it had been established by CARDINAL concurring expert reports that he was suffering from a disease that compromised his chances of survival and was thus eligible for a suspended sentence .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed against that judgment , which ORG quashed on DATE for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... a medical report dated DATE shows that the treatment for the diseases from which PERSON is suffering is onerous and can only be administered ' DATE with difficulty because the prisoner is uncooperative \u2013 in custody or in a relatively restrictive structure ' . The practitioner adds : ' This is the crux of the matter ' and that detention remains ' compatible with his condition ' . Another medical expert , in a report lodged on DATE , states that the treatment which PERSON must take is ' simple and can be administered in a prison environment ' .", "Lastly , the impugned decision notes that a psychiatric expert has stated that PERSON remains of ' dangerous criminal propensity and that his ' active participation ' in the treatment is the only guarantee of possible success , ' in view of the way his personality is structured ' .", "In these circumstances , it does not appear appropriate to suspend the sentence and the impugned decision must be reversed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the applicant 's lawyer was advised by a member of the ORG d'\u00c9tat and ORG whom he had contacted that , by virtue of LAW , no appeal lay against a decision of ORG , unless it could be shown that it had acted in excess of its authority , which did not appear to be the position in the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . Legislation introduced on DATE transferred responsibility for treating prisoners to the public hospital service . Medical treatment for prisoners is thus provided by medical structures within the prisons ( consultation and outpatient care units ) directly affiliated to the local public hospitals that are to be found in the vicinity of each prison ( Article NORP CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A prisoner 's state of health may be taken into account in deciding whether he or she should receive a pardon from the NORP President ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW ) or be granted parole under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Further , the Rights of Patients and Quality of the Health Service Act of DATE inserted a new LAW into LAW which enables an application to be made for suspension of sentence on medical grounds .", "CARDINAL . An Act of DATE brought issues relating to parole within the sole jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and , in particular , the judge responsible for the execution of sentences . It also created CARDINAL new bodies , ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL .
