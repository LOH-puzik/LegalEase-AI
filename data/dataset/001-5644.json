SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , a NORP national , was born in DATE and lives at GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON Aguado , of FAC .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the parties , can be summarised as follows .", "Following a road - traffic accident the applicant brought an action seeking compensation before ORG . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed his claims and gave judgment on the defendant \u2019s counterclaims , ordering Mr PERSON to pay damages . He appealed to ORG , which on DATE partly overruled the impugned judgment by dismissing both the applicant \u2019s claims and the defendant \u2019s counterclaims .", "Relying on LAW ( which guarantees the right to a fair hearing ) , the applicant brought an amparo appeal before ORG , which in a decision ( providencia ) of DATE , served on the applicant on DATE , declared that appeal inadmissible .", "On DATE ORG , noting that ORG had not within the period prescribed by LAW on ORG availed itself of its right to lodge a s\u00faplica appeal against the decision of DATE , declared that decision final . The applicant was so informed on DATE .", "Institutional Act on ORG", "\u201c CARDINAL . State Counsel \u2019s Office shall intervene in all amparo proceedings to uphold the law , the rights of citizens and the public interest protected by law . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . NORP The decision ( providencia ) referred to in the preceding paragraph ... shall be served on the appellant and on ORG . ORG Office may lodge a s\u00faplica appeal against that decision , the time - limit for so doing being DATE . The appeal shall be decided in a judgment ( auto ) . \u201d", "Under NORP law , s\u00faplica appeals , in common with similar types of remedy such as reforma or reposici\u00f3n appeals , is a form of appeal enabling a party to the proceedings ( such as a private petitioner or ORG ) to request the court which has decided the case to reconsider its judgment or decision .", "Relying on LAW , the applicant alleged that his case had not been tried fairly and within a reasonable time by the NORP courts .", "The applicant maintained that the NORP courts had not tried his case fairly and within a reasonable time . He relied on LAW .", "The ORG does not have to decide whether the facts presented by the applicant in his application disclose a prima facie violation of the LAW . That is because it considers that in the instant case the final domestic decision , within the meaning of LAW , was ORG decision of DATE , which was served on the applicant on DATE , that is to say DATE before the application was lodged . Admittedly , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE served on the applicant on DATE , ORG found that ORG had not lodged a s\u00faplica appeal against the decision dismissing the amparo appeal and declared the decision of DATE final . However , regard being had to its nature and to the conditions governing its exercise in this particular instance , notably the fact that it could only be lodged by ORG , the s\u00faplica appeal concerned here can not be regarded as a remedy within the meaning of LAW . It follows that the application must be dismissed pursuant to LAW .", "For these reasons , the ORG , unanimously ,", "Declares the application inadmissible ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
