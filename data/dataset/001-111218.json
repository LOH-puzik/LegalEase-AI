A hearing before the GPE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tinsgr\u00e4tten ) was scheduled for CARDINAL DATE but it was cancelled due to the absence of CARDINAL codefendants .", "CARDINAL .

In its judgment of DATE ( GPE ) ORG noted that , although there were no legal provisions justifying the dismissal of a criminal charge due to unreasonably lengthy proceedings , such a dismissal or declaring a case inadmissible might in some exceptional circumstances , for example if their duration ruled out a good defence , be the only effective remedy satisfying the requirements of LAW . That was , however , not so in that precedent case . In considering whether there were grounds for applying LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , ORG held that it had to be decided in PERSON whether the duration of the proceedings ( in the precedent case over DATE ) had been unreasonable .
