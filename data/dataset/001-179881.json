At the time of the events the applicants were all working as cashiers for ORG , a NORP family - owned supermarket chain .", "CARDINAL . At DATE the applicants\u2019 employer noticed some irregularities between the supermarket stock levels and what was actually sold on a DATE basis . In particular , the shop supervisor identified losses in excess of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE , ORG DATE , ORG CARDINAL in DATE , ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE and ORG CARDINAL in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to investigate and put an end to the economic losses , on DATE the employer installed surveillance cameras consisting of both visible and hidden cameras . The purpose of the visible cameras was to record possible customer thefts and they were pointed toward the entrances and exits of the supermarket . The purpose of the hidden cameras was to record and control possible employee thefts and they were zoomed in on the checkout counters , which covered the area behind the cash desk . The company gave its workers prior notice of the installation of the visible cameras . Neither they nor the company \u2019s staff committee were informed of the hidden cameras .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE all the workers suspected of theft were called to individual meetings . During those meetings the applicants admitted their involvement in the thefts in the presence of the union representative and the company \u2019s legal representative .", "CARDINAL . Hereafter and for the sake of clarity , the applicants will be referred to as the first , second , third , fourth and fifth applicants ( see the attached ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicants were dismissed on disciplinary grounds : they had been caught on video helping co - workers and customers steal items and stealing them themselves . According to their letters of dismissal , the security cameras had caught them scanning items from the grocery baskets of customers and co - workers and afterwards cancelling the purchases . Security cameras had also caught them allowing customers and co - workers to leave the store with merchandise that had not been paid for .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the first applicant brought proceedings for unfair dismissal before ORG no.CARDINAL ( hereinafter \u201c the Employment Tribunal \u201d ) . DATE the second applicant brought similar proceedings before ORG in a joint application with the third , fourth and fifth applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the framework of the proceedings both applicants objected to the use of the covert video surveillance , arguing that it had breached their right to protection of their privacy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued CARDINAL judgments ruling against the applicants , declaring both dismissals fair . The main evidence supporting the fairness of their dismissals was the recordings resulting from the covert surveillance , as well as the witness statements of co - workers dismissed for their involvement in the thefts , the shop manager , the union representative and the company \u2019s legal representative .", "CARDINAL . The Employment Tribunal found in both judgments \u2013 as regards these CARDINAL applicants in DATE that the use of covert video surveillance in the workplace without prior notice had been in accordance with LAW ) , which allowed an employer to use monitoring and surveillance measures which he or she deemed appropriate to verify that an employee was fulfilling his or her employment duties , as long as the employer respected \u201c human dignity \u201d . This had been confirmed by ORG in several judgments ( see , among other authorities , judgment CARDINAL of DATE ) . According to ORG case - law , an employer \u2019s right to adopt organisational arrangements and act as a disciplinary authority had to be weighed against an employee \u2019s fundamental right to privacy recognised under LAW . In cases where there were substantiated suspicions of theft , special circumstances justified interference with an employee \u2019s right to privacy , which was considered to be appropriate to the legitimate aim pursued , necessary and proportionate . Following this case - law , ORG , having regard to the evidence before it , found that the employer had had sufficient grounds to conclude that the applicants\u2019 conduct amounted to a \u201c breach of contractual good faith and abuse of trust \u201d and thus declared both dismissals fair in conformity with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed before ORG GPE on DATE respectively . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the court upheld both first - instance judgments , referring to ORG case - law and endorsing ORG finding that the defendant party had been authorised to carry out the covert video surveillance of the cash desks . While acknowledging that it was possible that the employer could face an administrative sanction for not informing its employees and the staff committee in advance of the installation of the cameras , that fact alone had no relevance from a constitutional point of view , since from that perspective the covert video surveillance had been justified ( in that there had been reasonable suspicions of theft ) , appropriate to the legitimate aim pursued , necessary and proportionate . Consequently , their dismissals had been justified on the same grounds as already stated by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants brought cassation appeals , which were declared inadmissible on CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively . Ultimately the applicants lodged amparo appeals with ORG , which were declared inadmissible on DATE and DATE respectively , due to the \u201c non - existence of a violation of a fundamental right \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicants were dismissed on disciplinary grounds : they had been caught on video helping co - workers and customers steal items and stealing them themselves . According to the employer , the security cameras had caught the third applicant scanning items from the grocery baskets of customers and co - workers and afterwards voiding the receipts . Security cameras had also caught her allowing customers or co - workers to leave the store with merchandise that had not been paid for . As regards the fourth and fifth applicants , security cameras had caught them stealing goods with the help of their co - workers , such as the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that they were dismissed all CARDINAL applicants signed a document called a \u201c settlement agreement \u201d ( acuerdo transaccional ) , by which they committed themselves not to bring proceedings against their employer for unfair dismissal , while the employer committed itself not to bring criminal charges against them for theft . In the meetings CARDINAL union representative and the company \u2019s legal representative were also present .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite the settlement agreements , on DATE the applicants , together with the second applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , brought proceedings for unfair dismissal before ORG . According to the applicants , the settlement agreements had to be declared void . They claimed that the consent they had given was not valid , since they had been under duress at the time they had signed the settlement agreements ( a company representative had allegedly threatened to bring criminal proceedings against them if they did not sign the agreements ) . They also argued that the evidence derived from the covert video surveillance had been obtained illegally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled against the applicants and declared the dismissals fair . It carefully analysed the settlement agreements signed by the applicants . In particular , it addressed their allegation of invalid consent , finding that there was no evidence proving the existence of any kind of duress or intention to commit a crime ( dolo ) at the time the applicants had signed the settlement agreements . The court concluded that the applicants had signed the settlement agreements freely and voluntarily with the clear purpose of avoiding criminal proceedings for the alleged thefts they had been accused of ( and to which they had already confessed ) . Further evidence as to the lack of any threat or coercion was the fact that other employees in the same situation as the applicants ( such as the first and second applicants ) had refused to sign the settlement agreements . Accordingly , the settlement agreements were declared valid under LAW and , consequently , ORG ruled against the third , fourth and fifth applicants . As the signing of the settlement agreements rendered their dismissals fair , the use and analysis of the impugned videos as evidence in the proceedings was deemed unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed before ORG GPE on DATE . On DATE it upheld the first - instance judgment and endorsed ORG finding that the settlement agreement signed by the applicants was valid . The court also analysed , for the sake of clarity , the legality of the covert video surveillance . Referring to ORG case - law , it confirmed that the defendant party had been authorised to carry out the covert video surveillance on the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants brought a joint cassation appeal , which was declared inadmissible on DATE . Ultimately , they lodged a joint amparo appeal with ORG , alleging a violation of ORG DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW . It was declared inadmissible on DATE due to the \u201c non - existence of a violation of a fundamental right \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
