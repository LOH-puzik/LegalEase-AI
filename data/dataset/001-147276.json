The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a television journalist . From DATE he was employed by the ORG television company ( ORG . ) . Following an amendment of his work contract on DATE , he was appointed for an indeterminate period . At the material time , he was chairman of ORG ( ORG ) , active within the television company .", "The applicant was in charge , as editor and presenter , of a periodical cultural programme called \u00c9jjeli mened\u00e9k ( Night Shelter ) which involved interviews with various figures of cultural life .", "CARDINAL . According to point CARDINAL of his work contract , the applicant was bound by professional confidentiality . He was obliged not to reveal any information acquired in connection to his position the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to either his employer or any other person . According to the labour contract , he also took note of the fact that a breach of this obligation would lead to the immediate termination of his employment .", "CARDINAL . Following the appointment of a new cultural director the applicant had apparently contacted the television company \u2019s president , since he had perceived the new director \u2019s conduct in modifying and cutting certain contents of \u00c9jjeli mened\u00e9k as censorship . He had received no response to his complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the editor - in - chief of ORG mened\u00e9k addressed a letter to the board of ORG . stating , amongst other things , that the appointment of the new cultural director had led to censorship of the programme by his suggesting modifications to , and the deletion of , certain contents .", "On DATE an article appeared in the online version of a NORP DATE ( ORG ) , containing the editor - in - chief \u2019s letter as well as a statement of ORG ) , inviting the board to end censorship in the television company .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant published a book entitled \u201c GPE antifasiszta \u00e9s a hungarista \u2013 Titkok a FAC \u201d ( The NORP and the NORP - Secrets from ORG ) . Each chapter of the book contained an extract from different interviews recorded in DATE , which had not been broadcast in the cultural programme , apparently on the basis of the instructions of the cultural director in question . Along with the extracts , the applicant included numerous in - house letter exchanges between the cultural director and the editor - in - chief concerning the suggested changes in the programme . Moreover , the chapters contained a short introduction or summary of the events , reflecting the applicant \u2019s personal opinion . The preface of the book said that it would contain documentary evidence of censorship exercised in the ORG television company . It called on the readers to decide whether the documents indicated the cultural director \u2019s legitimate exercise of his supervisory functions or an interference with the broadcaster \u2019s freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the television company dismissed from employment the applicant and the editor - in - chief of ORG mened\u00e9k , with immediate effect . The reason for the applicant \u2019s summary dismissal was that , by publishing the book in question , he had breached the confidentiality clause contained in his labour contract .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged his dismissal in court . He argued , inter alia , that he had received the in - house letter - exchange in connection with his position as the chairman of the trade union , in order for him to take steps against the alleged censorship at the television company , and that he had published the impugned book in that capacity .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action , stating that he had breached his obligations under point CARDINAL of his work contract by publishing information about his employer without its consent . The court also found that the applicant \u2019s position as chairman of the trade union did not exempt him from the duty of confidentiality .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the publication of the book had not in any way prejudiced his employer or any other person and that he had not acquired the published information in connection with his position but in his capacity as trade union chairman . In that position , and in representation of the interests of his colleagues , he was obliged to act against the censorship within the television company . Thus , according to the applicant , the conditions of dismissal , as stipulated in point CARDINAL of his labour contract , had not been fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the same grounds as ORG , adding that the publication of the book might have had a certain detrimental effect on the television company \u2019s reputation . Furthermore , in ORG opinion , the impugned measure had not constituted an abuse of rights on the employer \u2019s side , since the applicant had voluntarily agreed to the restriction of his freedom of expression by signing his labour contract .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pursued a petition for review before ORG . He argued that he had been unlawfully dismissed in that his conduct , namely to inform the public about censorship at the ORG television company in a book DATE which was a last - ditch option given that his efforts vis - \u00e0 - vis the management to have the matter investigated had been to no avail \u2013 should have been regarded as an exercise of his freedom of expression rather than an unlawful breach of his labour contract , especially in view of the fact that the allegation of censorship had not been refuted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found against the applicant . Referring to the applicant \u2019s submission concerning freedom of expression , it held that the scope of the case did not extend beyond the examination of the applicant \u2019s breach of his labour obligations . In the court \u2019s view , the applicant had indeed breached the contract by means of the unauthorised publication of internal documents of his former employer . The court expressly excluded from its scrutiny the question whether or not the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression justified , in the circumstances , a formal breach of his labour contract .", "This decision was served on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
