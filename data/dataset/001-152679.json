GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 - Positive obligations;Article 8-1 - Respect for private life)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was involved in an altercation with a cameraman outside his property , \u201c Gut Calenberg \u201d , during which he struck the cameraman with an umbrella . In DATE the press reported on another scuffle between the applicant and the manager of a discotheque on LOC off the NORP coast , as a result of which the applicant was convicted of assault .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the company ORG ( GPE ) ORG ( \u201c the company \u201d ) launched a DATE advertising campaign with full - page advertisements in magazines and on posters at bus stops and other busy locations showing , on the lower CARDINAL , a crumpled packet of Lucky Strike cigarettes lying on its side . The top CARDINAL read , in large lettering : \u201c Was it PERSON ? Or DATE ? \u201d At the bottom of the advertisement was the phrase \u201c Lucky Strike . Nothing else . \u201d ( \u201c Lucky Strike . Sonst nichts . \u201d ) The campaign covered CARDINAL towns and cities and CARDINAL billboards , which meant that it had a potential reach of CARDINAL people . It was also reported in the media .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked the company that had commissioned the advertisement and the advertising agency that had designed it to discontinue the campaign . The agency agreed to do so in writing , but the company refused . The applicant then made an urgent application to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted an interim injunction against any further distribution of the advertisement at issue , and confirmed the injunction on DATE . The company subsequently announced that it was discontinuing the advertisement , but refused to reimburse the costs incurred by the applicant for the official notice served on it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the company to pay him damages of MONEY ( ORG ) . The company did not respond to that request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for an order requiring the company and the advertising agency that had designed the advertisement to pay him LAW for a \u201c notional licence \u201d ( fiktive ORG ) and at least ORG CARDINAL in compensation for infringing his right to protection of personality rights , and also to reimburse the costs incurred in serving the official notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s application as regards the notional licence and costs , and dismissed it as regards compensation . It pointed out that although everyone had the right to decide whether or not to allow his or her name to be used for advertising purposes , the general right to protection of personality rights ( allgemeines PERSON ) protected a person against the unlawful use by third parties of his or her name , including in the context of advertising . ORG went on to observe that although the forenames \u201c PERSON \u201d and \u201c DATE \u201d were fairly common , the combination of the CARDINAL was not . Moreover , since entering into a relationship with Princess PERSON of GPE the applicant had become well known and the crumpled cigarette packet was a clear allusion to his scuffles . ORG explained that advertising was also protected by freedom of expression in so far as it contributed to shaping public opinion ; this applied , in its view , to the impugned advertisement . It further pointed out that both the right to freedom of expression and the right to protection of personality rights were protected under LAW and that , in principle , they deserved equal respect . Where a person was used for advertising purposes without his or her consent , the right to protection of personality rights prevailed as a general rule . ORG added that the company \u2019s argument that as a result of his scuffles , the applicant had himself caused the event to which the advertisement referred did not deprive him of protection but it did affect the degree of the interference and the level of protection of freedom of expression . In conclusion , ORG held that when balancing the competing interests , more weight was to be attached to the protection of the applicant \u2019s personality rights than to the company \u2019s right to freedom of expression regarding an advertisement which was essentially humorous in nature and pursued commercial aims .", "CARDINAL . As regards the pecuniary damage sustained , ORG pointed out that the aim of a \u201c notional licence \u201d was to ensure that anyone using someone else \u2019s personality without permission would not be in a more advantageous position than if he or she had obtained the person \u2019s consent . It explained that the cost of such a licence was determined on the basis of the amount of a fee that would have been reasonable ( angemessen ) . Having regard in particular to the applicant \u2019s high profile , the billboards and advertising media used , and the fact that the advertisement had only used the applicant \u2019s forenames , ORG assessed the pecuniary damage at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It also awarded the applicant the costs incurred in serving the official notice because they had resulted from the actions of the company and the agency .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , ORG did not award the applicant compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage on the ground that there had been no serious interference with the protection of his personality rights . It emphasised that the applicant had struck the cameraman in public and that the advertisement had simply referred back to that event . Furthermore , the fact that the advertisement was merely derisive meant that there was no unavoidable need ( unabwendbares Bed\u00fcrfnis ) to award pecuniary compensation , and the award of a notional licence should be deemed sufficient redress .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld most of ORG judgment , varying it solely as regards the order for the company to reimburse the costs incurred in serving the official notice .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed that the company and the agency had interfered with the applicant \u2019s right to his own name without his permission . In that context , it pointed out that even though the advertisement had only used the applicant \u2019s forenames , those names were well known to the general public because of the relationship between the applicant and the daughter of Prince Rainier III of GPE and the repeated press reports on the applicant \u2019s altercations in DATE and DATE . It further noted that the company had derived a pecuniary advantage from using the applicant \u2019s forenames . In cases such as the present one , where the impugned advertisement was designed to enhance the recognition and sales of a brand of cigarettes , freedom of expression generally took second place to the protection of personality rights . ORG considered that the impugned advertisement had made very little contribution , if any , to shaping public opinion , that the applicant \u2019s scuffles had been neither a political nor a societal event , and that the incidents had only been exploited for the purpose of entertaining a general public curious about the behaviour of famous people .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further pointed out that the impugned advertisement had infringed the pecuniary aspect of the right to protection of personality rights by depriving the applicant of his right to make his own choice as to whether and how his name could be used for advertising purposes . Clearly , the advertisement had not given the impression that the applicant identified with the product advertised or that he recommended it , nor was it offensive or degrading in nature , but with the sole aim of increasing sales of a brand of cigarettes it publicly mocked the applicant by suggesting that he even crumpled up cigarette packets .", "CARDINAL . As regards the cost of the notional licence , ORG pointed out that the unauthorised use of a person \u2019s name for commercial purposes was tantamount to unlawfully using a person \u2019s image and infringed the pecuniary aspect of the right to protection of personality rights . It held that in using the applicant \u2019s name without his consent the company and the agency had shown that they had attached economic importance to that name . The company and the agency were therefore under an obligation to pay the applicant the amount corresponding to the use of his name , and this obligation existed irrespective of whether the person in question would have been prepared to consent or not .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further stated that the cost of the notional licence had to be freely determined on the basis of all the relevant circumstances . It noted that the particular feature of the impugned advertisement was that it mocked the applicant , which made it unlikely that the applicant would have authorised it . However , it considered that the amount of the fees agreed between advertising companies and famous people who consented to the use their names might provide an indication for determining the cost of the notional licence . It noted in that connection that the company was CARDINAL of the largest tobacco companies in GPE and that the impugned advertisement had been part of a very successful advertising campaign which the company had launched in DATE . The advertisement in question had taken up a full page in several national magazines and also , from DATE onwards , in the form of posters at bus stops and other busy locations . Lastly , emphasising that the applicant was a well - known figure , it found that the advertising campaign had indeed attracted extensive public attention , thus justifying the award made by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal on points of law , on the grounds that the question whether the use of a famous person \u2019s name for advertising purposes was justified where the advertisement referred to an event in contemporary history which was of no , or virtually no , interest except from an entertainment perspective had not yet been determined by the case - law of ORG , and that a decision was required from that court in order to develop and maintain a standard line of authority .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( no . I ORG CARDINAL ) ORG quashed ORG judgment . It held that the applicant \u2019s claims were ill - founded because the company and the agency had not unlawfully interfered with his right to protection of personality rights or his right to his name , given that the use of his name in the impugned advertisement was covered by the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d ) . While upholding the findings of ORG as regards the existence of an interference and the possibility of granting a notional licence in accordance with the principle of unjust enrichment , ORG held that ORG had not had sufficient regard to the fact that the pecuniary components of the right to protection of personality rights and the right to one \u2019s name were only protected by ordinary law , whereas freedom of expression enjoyed protection under constitutional law .", "CARDINAL . ORG explained at the outset that the case before it related solely to interference with the pecuniary components of the rights relied upon , since the applicant \u2019s contention that the advertisement had also infringed the non - pecuniary components of his rights had already been dismissed by ORG . It pointed out that the rights to protection of personality rights were among the fundamental rights safeguarded by LAW to the extent that they protected non - pecuniary interests , but that the pecuniary components were only protected by civil law and therefore did not prevail over freedom of expression . ORG also observed that the protection conferred by LAW also covered advertising whose content contributed to shaping public opinion , while specifying that that was not only the case where the advertisement referred to a political or historical event , but also where it dealt with questions of general interest . Furthermore , reports with an entertainment purpose could also play a role in shaping public opinion , or indeed , in certain circumstances , could stimulate or influence the shaping of public opinion more effectively than strictly factual information .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the impugned advertisement provided a satirical , derisive slant on the applicant \u2019s scuffles outside his \u201c Gut Calenberg \u201d property and on LOC . The media had reported on these events , mentioning the applicant \u2019s name and publishing photographs of him , because there was a particular public interest in information about the incidents on account of the applicant \u2019s relationship with the daughter of Prince PERSON III of GPE . ORG considered that even though the company had merely alluded to the applicant \u2019s scuffles as part of its advertising campaign , it could still rely on the specific protection of freedom of expression . It held that the fact that the advertisement \u2013 by using the applicant \u2019s forenames and alluding to his propensity for picking fights \u2013 had been mainly intended to increase sales of the cigarette brand by capturing the attention of the general public did not mean , as ORG had maintained , that the right to protection of personality rights prevailed in general .", "CARDINAL . ORG continued as follows :", "\u201c In weighing up the competing interests ORG failed to take adequate account of the fact that the only issue at stake in this case was the protection of the pecuniary components of the right to protection of personality rights , such protection being based solely on civil law and not constitutional law . In the case of interference with the pecuniary components of the right to protection of personality rights because a well - known person \u2019s name has been used in an advertisement without his consent , it can not simply ( ohne weiteres ) be maintained that the person \u2019s right to protection of his personality rights will always prevail over the advertiser \u2019s right to freedom of expression . On the contrary , it might be appropriate to tolerate an interference with protection of personality rights resulting from reference to a person \u2019s name if , on the one hand , the advertisement alludes in a derisive , satirical manner to an event involving the person and forming the subject of public debate and if , on the other hand , it does not exploit the person \u2019s brand image ( Imagewert ) or advertising value ( PERSON ) by using his name , and if it does not give the impression that the person identifies with the product advertised or advocates its use ( reference to ORG judgment of DATE , no . I ZR CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the impugned advertisement had not given such an impression . It had merely served as a reminder of the applicant \u2019s scuffles for anyone who already knew about them , while anyone who had never heard of those events would have been unable to understand the play on words , especially since the incidents had not been actually mentioned but had been hinted at in a particularly clever ( pfiffig ) way . ORG therefore took the view that the advertisement had been part of the public debate on the applicant \u2019s aggressive attitude . Above and beyond the derisive , satirical allusion to the events already known to the public , it had been devoid of any offensive or seriously degrading content in relation to the applicant . Given the absence of any suggestion that the applicant identified in any way with the product advertised , there were no grounds for considering that the advertisement was disparaging towards him simply because it was promoting cigarettes . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s interest in not being mentioned in the advertisement without his consent carried less weight than the tobacco company \u2019s freedom of expression , and that in the absence of a violation of the pecuniary or non - pecuniary components of his right to protection of his personality rights , the applicant could not claim an entitlement to a notional licence or to reimbursement of the costs incurred in serving the official notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declined to accept for adjudication a constitutional complaint by the applicant ( no . DATE ) . It provided no reasons for its decision .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
