He was convicted on TIME occasions DATE and DATE , the heaviest sentences he received being those imposed in ORG on DATE ( DATE imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ) and by ORG on DATE ( life imprisonment ) . Since DATE the applicant , pursuant to an aggregation of sentences ordered on DATE by ORG of Cagliari , has been serving the sentence of life imprisonment and has at the same time been , among other things , permanently disqualified from holding public office , stripped of his civic rights for the duration of his prison sentence and removed from parental control .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL the judge responsible for the execution of sentences ( magistrato di sorveglianza ) in GPE di GPE decided that PERSON correspondence - the applicant then being in custody in ORG - should be subject to censorship under CARDINAL of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The grounds given for the decision were : the nature of the applicant 's offences ; the fact that he belonged to a special category of prisoner whose attitude was CARDINAL of total opposition to the institutions of the ORG ; his conduct ; and his rejection of prison and refusal of any cooperation with prison staff .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge responsible for the execution of sentences at ORG ordered that all the applicant 's correspondence , both incoming and outgoing , should be subject to censorship for DATE from DATE , the date on which the prisoner was notified of the decision . He considered that the reasons which had prompted his counterpart in GPE di GPE to take such a measure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) remained valid and that there was a continuing danger that the applicant would use his correspondence to commit offences or to prejudice public order or safety . At that time Mr PERSON already had CARDINAL convictions , and CARDINAL other sets of criminal proceedings were pending against him . The first of these , in ORG of Appeal , related to charges of kidnapping , manufacture , possessing and carrying explosives , aggravated destruction of property and resisting arrest ; they ended in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which became final on DATE and in which the applicant was convicted and sentenced to DATE imprisonment and permanently disqualified from holding public office . The second set of proceedings , which were pending before the Novara ORG ( pretore ) , originated in a prosecution brought following an escape by the applicant on DATE ; PERSON had been recaptured on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It is not contested that the following letters were inspected :", "( a ) a letter of CARDINAL DATE from the applicant to his lawyer ;", "( b ) a registered letter of DATE to the applicant from his lawyer ;", "( c ) a letter of DATE from the applicant to his lawyer ;", "( d ) a letter of DATE from the applicant to his lawyer ;", "( e ) a registered letter of CARDINAL DATE to the applicant from his lawyer , enclosing a form for lodging an application with the ORG ; and", "( f ) a letter of CARDINAL DATE from the applicant to his lawyer , enclosing the Commission application form signed by the applicant on DATE , each page bearing the censor 's stamp .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON made several applications challenging the monitoring of his correspondence . In particular , he lodged an application ( richiesta di riesame ) with the PERSON judge responsible for the execution of sentences to reconsider his decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The judge refused the application on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant sent a copy of the judge 's decisions to his lawyer . On DATE the lawyer sought to have the censorship of his correspondence with the applicant ended and the order of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) rescinded . Relying on Articles CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( b ) and CARDINAL of the Convention ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-b , article CARDINAL) , he argued , among other things , that the censorship was a manifest violation of the rights of the defence and could not be ordered on the basis of a similar decision taken by another judge DATE or on the basis of considerations relating to the applicant 's conduct in another prison , especially as the applicant was receiving more lenient treatment in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge responsible for the execution of sentences held that the measure in issue was wholly justified , having regard to the arguments already set out in his decision of CARDINAL DATE , to disciplinary reports on PERSON and to the fact that while in custody in ORG the applicant had been a member of a group of prisoners all of whom belonged to extreme - left - wing subversive movements . He nevertheless decided to adjourn the lawyer 's application and submit a question concerning the interpretation of the relevant law to ORG ( Direzione generale degli Istituti di prevenzione e pena ) , relating to whether the monitoring of the applicant 's correspondence with his lawyer was lawful , given that CARDINAL sets of criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending at the time . The applicant 's correspondence nevertheless continued to be monitored while a reply from the relevant authority was awaited .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the judge , in reply to a letter sent him by the defence lawyer on DATE , again confirmed his decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG replied on DATE . In its opinion , censorship of a prisoner 's correspondence , provided that all the legal requirements were satisfied , covered all his correspondence , including that with his lawyer , and could not be regarded as infringing the rights of the defence , which were guaranteed by LAW . The confidentiality of communications between a prisoner charged with a criminal offence and his lawyer was preserved through the possibility of communication during private conversations inside the prison . On DATE the judge responsible for the execution of sentences refused the lawyer 's application of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The measure in issue ended automatically on DATE , on the expiry of the period specified in the decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the special prison at ORG ) . Since DATE he has enjoyed a semi - custodial regime .", "CARDINAL . LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ( \" Law no . CARDINAL \" ) , as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , provides that power in the matter of censorship of prisoners ' correspondence vests in the judge dealing with the case - whether an investigating judge or a trial judge - up to the decision at first instance and in the judge responsible for the execution of sentences thereafter . The judge may order censorship of a prisoner 's correspondence in a reasoned decision ; this provision , however , does not specify the cases in which such a decision may be taken .", "CARDINAL . The censorship of which the applicant complains consists , in particular , in all mail being intercepted and read by either the judicial authority that has ordered the censorship or the prison governor or prison staff designated by him , and in the stamping of letters for the purpose of showing that they have been inspected . Censorship can not extend to deleting words or sentences , but the judicial authority can order that CARDINAL or more letters shall not be handed over ; in that case , the prisoner must immediately be informed of the fact . This latter measure can also be ordered temporarily by the prison governor , who must , however , notify the judicial authority of his action .", "CARDINAL . LAW forbids the seizure or any form of control of the correspondence between a prisoner and his lawyer , provided that the correspondence is recognisable as such and unless the judicial authority has well - founded reasons to believe that the correspondence constitutes the substance of the offence . Similarly , by LAW transitional provisions of LAW , the rules on the censorship of a prisoner 's correspondence that are laid down in PERSON no . CARDINAL and Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE do not apply to correspondence between the prisoner and his lawyer . It follows , among other things , that the only authority that may order censorship of that correspondence , and then solely in the case mentioned above , is the judge or court dealing with the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG has held on several occasions that the monitoring of a prisoner 's correspondence is an administrative act and has also stated that NORP law does not provide any remedies in respect of it ; in particular , censorship can not be the subject of an appeal on points of law , since it does not affect the prisoner 's personal freedom ( Court of Cassation , judgments ORG .
