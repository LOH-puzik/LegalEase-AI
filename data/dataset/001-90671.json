The ORG is represented in the proceedings by ORG ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The latter has to prove that there was no violation of the reasonable - time requirement , while the plaintiff has to prove the existence of pecuniary damage ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .

In his Address to ORG delivered on DATE , the President of ORG stated in particular that it was necessary to establish a mechanism for compensation of damage caused by violations of ORG rights to trial within a reasonable time and to the full and timely implementation of court decisions . The President stressed that the execution of court decisions was still a huge problem , which concerned all courts , including ORG . He further stated that the problem was notably due to the lack of real accountability of officials and citizens who fail to execute court decisions and that this accountability was to be established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG resumed consideration under LAW group of the ORG \u2019s judgments against GPE concerning failure to enforce or delays in the enforcement of domestic judgments ( PERSON and Others , PERSON / Del / OJ / PERSON ) .

The introduction of such a domestic remedy could also significantly reduce the ORG \u2019s workload .

In Resolution DATE ( DATE ) on implementation of judgments of ORG , adopted on DATE , ORG noted with grave concern the continuing existence in several GPE of major structural deficiencies which cause large numbers of repetitive findings of violations of the LAW and represent a serious danger to the rule of law in the GPE concerned . The ORG listed among those deficiencies some major shortcomings in the judicial organisation and procedures in GPE , including chronic non - enforcement of domestic judicial decisions delivered against the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the Resolution ) . The ORG urged the authorities of the GPE concerned , including GPE , to resolve the issues of particular importance mentioned in the ORG and to give this action top political priority .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The NORP officials\u2019 clear willingness to come to grips with the above - mentioned important problems is most welcome . The rapporteur stresses that the complexity of these issues is such as to require enhanced and concerted efforts of all actors within the NORP legal system .", "CARDINAL . Thorough reform strategies in this respect , however , still remain to be established . In view of the present problems raised in the judgments and others still to come , the rapporteur has strongly recommended to the authorities to set up a special mechanism of interagency cooperation in the implementation of ORG judgments . Constant involvement of ORG and the NORP delegation to the ORG in the implementation process is also necessary . The rapporteur is convinced that his NORP parliamentary colleagues will seriously consider his recommendation to set up a specific mechanism and procedure for parliamentary oversight to implement ORG judgments , as well as other relevant proposals made in the draft resolution .
