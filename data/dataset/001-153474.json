THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE . He is currently detained at GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has an ORG of DATE , which is within the bottom PERCENT of the general population . He has an understanding of spoken LANGUAGE equivalent to that of a six DATE child .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , the body of PERSON was found on the banks of LOC in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had spent most of DATE drinking in public with the deceased and a third man , Mr PERSON . There was evidence from witnesses that both Mr GPE and the applicant had been threatening and aggressive towards a number of individuals including the deceased . CARDINAL witness also stated that , when Mr GPE produced a knife and said he was going to kill the deceased , the applicant encouraged him to \u201c just kill him \u201d . There was also evidence that the applicant and Mr GPE asked the deceased to come out to fight with them after they had been refused admission to a public house .", "CARDINAL . The deceased was last seen alive at TIME on DATE when he , Mr GPE and the applicant were seen making their way to a park area beside LOC . A post - mortem examination of the deceased revealed that he had been extensively beaten before his death and that he had sustained a number of knife wounds including a severance of the carotid artery .", "CARDINAL . The police searched the flat where the applicant was staying and found CARDINAL sets of clothes which were heavily stained with the blood of the deceased ( CARDINAL sets of sweatshirts , a pair of ORG and pair of beige and navy tracksuit bottoms ) . The fact that CARDINAL sets of clothes were found was material to the prosecution \u2019s case that Mr PERSON was killed by CARDINAL men . CARDINAL of the items of clothing , namely the beige and navy tracksuit bottoms , had the applicant \u2019s name tag ironed on to the back of the garment . A plastic bag containing a knife was also found at the applicant \u2019s LOC . The plastic bag and the knife contained blood which matched the blood of the deceased . Medical evidence indicated that the knife was one that could have been used to inflict the wounds sustained by the deceased .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE admitted the manslaughter of PERSON and was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was arrested in GPE . He was interviewed by NORP police officers about the death of PERSON . Those interviews were videotaped . He was subsequently extradited to GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s trial , the prosecution sought to rely on the interviews which had been conducted in GPE . The applicant challenged the admissibility of those interviews , inter alia on the ground that the proper procedures for interviewing a suspect with a mental handicap had not been followed . A voir dire ( that is to say , a hearing to determine the admissibility of the contested evidence ) was held , in the course of which evidence was led from clinical psychologists and psychiatrists who had examined the applicant and watched the interview tapes . At the conclusion of the voir dire , the trial judge decided to exclude the interviews from evidence .", "CARDINAL . At the close of the prosecution case , the trial judge rejected a defence submission that there was no case to answer .", "CARDINAL . The defence then applied to the trial judge for a ruling that the applicant \u2019s mental condition made it undesirable for him to be called to give evidence . The effect of a favourable ruling would have been that the jury would not be permitted to draw an adverse inference from any failure of the applicant to give evidence in his own defence ( see CARDINAL below ) . In the course of the trial judge \u2019s consideration of that application , a second voir dire was held , in which further evidence was given by one of the clinical psychologists , PERSON . The trial judge refused to allow PERSON to give evidence concerning the conclusions he had reached from watching the interview tapes . The trial judge reasoned that , once the interview tapes were excluded from evidence , they were excluded from evidence for all purposes . The trial judge did , however , hear evidence from PERSON as to his concern that the applicant \u2019s low ORG would place him in considerable difficulty if he were to give evidence in his defence . In Dr GPE view , the applicant would be highly suggestible , he would have problems understanding questions and would find it difficult to give coherent responses .", "CARDINAL . In considering the defence application , the trial judge referred to the evidence of PERSON , consultant psychiatrist . The trial judge read out CARDINAL passages of her report , the last which was the following :", "\u201c He [ the applicant ] reports having had difficulty in comprehending court proceedings in the past as long words are used and people talk at speed . However , if account is taken of his need to have material simply phrased and to allow for adequate consultation with others to ascertain his understanding and clarify where necessary , it is my opinion that he should be capable of following proceedings and actively contributing to them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Turning to Dr GPE evidence , the trial judge noted that Dr PERSON had entered a significant reservation in relation to the applicant \u2019s ability to give evidence . PERSON had expressed doubts as to whether even in circumstances such as those referred to by PERSON the applicant could give a coherent account .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge refused the defence application , finding that he could control the manner in which questions would be asked and could ensure that no unfairness would result . In the event that the applicant chose not to give evidence the judge informed the parties that he would give an adverse inference direction to the jury .", "CARDINAL . The applicant elected not to testify but Dr PERSON was permitted to give evidence to the jury as to the applicant \u2019s vulnerability and the difficulties he would have faced .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from the applicant \u2019s failure to give evidence . The trial judge \u2019s summing up contained the following direction to the jury :", "\u201c I have said to you that the defendant has not given evidence and that is his right . He is entitled not to give evidence , to remain silent and to make the prosecution prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt . CARDINAL matters arise from his not giving evidence . The first is that you try this case according to the evidence . You will appreciate that the defendant has not given evidence at this trial to undermine , contradict or explain the evidence put before you by the prosecution . The second matter , as you heard him being told when I addressed Mr McGrory [ counsel for the applicant ] , is that the law is that you may draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to give evidence . It is for you to decide whether it is proper to hold the defendant \u2019s failure to give evidence against him when deciding whether he is guilty . On the basis of the evidence of PERSON , PERSON invites you not to hold it against the defendant that he has not given evidence before you . PERSON contradicted evidence is that the defendant has an IQ of DATE and therefore is a person of very limited intellectual ability who should be regarded as mentally handicapped . He has the ability of a DATE to understand spoken LANGUAGE . PERSON said that mentally handicapped people find giving evidence very challenging and his ability to provide a coherent and consistent account and to understand the implications of his replies is limited . PERSON said that he seems to have difficulty in functioning as an average person and has difficulty in maintaining relationships , keeping a job and performing everyday tasks such as looking after money .", "PERSON evidence about the accused and the abilities of mentally handicapped people in general about which I have just reminded you is an important factor to bear in mind , but there are others that you should bear in mind and consider as well . There is no evidence that the defendant is not fit to stand his trial ; in other words , it has not been suggested that he can not understand questions , nor has it been suggested that he can not instruct his legal advisers as to the nature of his case . It has not been suggested that he is unable to remember what happened TIME , indeed , Dr PERSON did not ask him to recall the events of that night , so you do not know from what Dr PERSON has said to what extent the defendant can explain what he did or where he went , indeed , when he was charged with Mr PERSON \u2019s death he replied , \u2018 I did n\u2019t go near him\u2019 , not , \u2018 I do n\u2019t know anything about it\u2019 , or , \u2018 I did n\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u2019 You have to consider along with many other questions you have to consider whether the answer he gave is not merely a denial of guilt , which it plainly is , but whether it implies that he knows something about the circumstances of Mr PERSON \u2019s death .", "You should also consider whether the defendant , despite his undoubted handicaps , his low IQ and limited comprehension of LANGUAGE , could have answered questions in the witness box . I say that because PERSON said in his closing remarks to you , \u2018 What chance would a man like that have in proceedings like this?\u2019 I must tell you that the defence were well aware that had the defendant given evidence the court would have ensured he was treated fairly and given every chance to put his case and in particular that questions were simply phrased and put in such a way that they did not suggest the answer to him . It is not enough that a person would find it difficult to give evidence to excuse them from giving evidence . Many people have to give evidence and find it difficult - even children as young as CARDINAL . Fortunately , we do not have that very often but it does happen sometimes . Every effort is made to simplify the proceedings and the form of questions to ensure that people like that can give evidence . If you think that because of the evidence of Dr PERSON you should not hold it against the defendant that he has not given evidence do not hold it against him , but if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence he relies on , that is , the evidence of Dr PERSON , presents no adequate explanation for his absence from the witness box then you may hold his failure to give evidence against him .", "If you consider that there is no excuse for his not giving evidence what proper inferences - in other words , what conclusions - can you draw from the defendant \u2019s decision not to give evidence before you ? You may think that the defendant would have gone into the witness box to give you an explanation or answer to the case against him . If the only sensible explanation for his decision not to give evidence is that he has no answer to the case against him , or none that could have stood up to cross - examination , then it would be open to you to hold against him his failure to give evidence . It is for you to decide whether it is fair to hold that failure against him . In considering that it might be useful for you to consider what sort of questions might the defendant have had to face if he had given evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The trial judge went on to give examples of questions that might have been asked of the defendant had he given evidence before emphasising that the jury should not find him guilty only or mainly because he had not given evidence , but that they might take it into account as some additional support for the prosecution \u2019s case and in deciding whether or not the case made on his behalf was or might be true .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted by the jury and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of DATE . He appealed against his conviction on CARDINAL grounds : ( i ) that the trial judge had erred in not allowing PERSON to give evidence concerning the conclusions he had reached from watching the interview tapes ; ( ii ) that the trial judge had erred in rejecting the applicant \u2019s submission that it was undesirable for him to be called to give evidence ; and ( iii ) that the trial judge had failed to direct the jury that they should not draw adverse inferences unless they were satisfied that there was case to answer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an application for leave to appeal was refused by a single judge of ORG in GPE . A renewed application was dismissed by the full court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the first ground of appeal , namely the exclusion of the video evidence , ORG accepted that the videotapes were admissible to demonstrate how the applicant expressed himself and to demonstrate that he was suggestible . However , the portion of the videotape on which the applicant had intended to rely did not in fact touch on suggestibility and , in any event , the applicant \u2019s suggestibility was not in dispute between the experts who had testified for the prosecution and defence . Therefore , the omission of the evidence would not have had any material effect on the trial judge \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the second ground of appeal , namely the ruling under LAW ) Order DATE , ORG considered that the trial judge had reached his conclusion in a proper and balanced manner and his conclusion was not unreasonable . ORG noted that there was competing expert evidence in the case . On the one hand , there was the evidence of PERSON , a consultant psychiatrist , whose opinion was that the applicant \u201c should be capable of following proceedings and actively contributing to them \u201d if account were taken of his need to have material simply phrased and if he was allowed adequate consultation with others to ascertain his understanding and clarify matters where necessary . On the other , PERSON , a clinical psychologist , entered a significant reservation in relation to the applicant \u2019s ability to give evidence . He did not know whether even where the procedures were simplified and the questions simply phrased , the applicant could give a coherent account of events . ORG found that there was nothing unreasonable about the manner in which the trial judge preferred the evidence of the consultant psychiatrist over that of the clinical psychologist .", "CARDINAL . For the third ground , which related to the trial judge \u2019s direction on a case to answer , ORG recognised that , in GPE and GPE , trial judges were required to direct juries that they , the jury , had to find that there was a case to answer on the prosecution evidence before drawing an adverse inference ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . By contrast , in GPE , it was left to the judge in each case to decide whether to direct the jury in this manner , depending on the strength of the prosecution case . ORG considered that , in the applicant \u2019s case , the absence of such a direction to the jury reflected the trial judge \u2019s view that this was not a case where the evidence was so weak as to require such a direction . The substantial body of evidence against the applicant supported that view . The trial was not , therefore , unfair . ORG nonetheless recommended that the specimen direction in GPE should be amended to follow the approach taken in GPE and GPE , by adding a direction that the jury should not draw an adverse inference unless they consider that the prosecution case is such that it clearly calls for an answer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked the court to certify questions of general public importance for the consideration of ORG . It refused to do so in a decision handed down on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
