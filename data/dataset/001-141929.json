NORP In DATE the applicant \u2019s wife withdrew her criminal complaint against the applicant for domestic violence .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the immigration authorities informed the applicant of their intention to expel him from NORP territory and granted him a period of grace in which to make his submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife withdrew her divorce action and from DATE the couple lived together again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the cantonal immigration authorities decided that the applicant \u2019s residence permit would not be extended and that he had to leave GPE for an indeterminate period of time . They held that over DATE , owing to the applicant \u2019s continuously accumulating debts and his failure to pay maintenance , his family had been dependent to a considerable degree on social welfare , and he had not proved that he was capable of observing public order and safety in GPE . In accordance with section QUANTITY b ) and ( d ) of LAW on the Temporary and Permanent Residence of Foreigners ( hereinafter \u201c FAC \u201d - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and section CARDINAL of its LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he could therefore be expelled . They reasoned that since DATE , when the applicant had entered GPE for the second time , he had repeatedly been convicted of offences . Furthermore , despite the immigration authorities\u2019 repeated warnings , his financial situation was serious and had continuously deteriorated . As at the date of the decision , his debts amounted to MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and the outstanding maintenance payments to CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . In addition , from DATE , he had worked as an associate of a company in the gastronomic sector without having previously applied for the necessary work permit . Although he had never paid maintenance or complied with the debt repayment agreements , he had invested capital of CHF MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) in that company . The cantonal immigration authorities therefore concluded that the applicant had not complied with the conditions previously set out by them for renewal of his residence permit . Furthermore , the fact that the applicant had resumed matrimonial life with his wife on DATE did not alter those findings , since his wife had already filed for divorce twice and there had been incidents of domestic violence in the past . The applicant had , moreover , registered his residence at the family home only after he had been informed by the immigration authorities in DATE of their intention to expel him . However , he had spent DATE and DATE in GPE and it could therefore hardly be assumed that he had actually re - established family life . The applicant \u2019s return to his country of origin \u2013 GPE \u2013 was also feasible , because he had spent most of his life there and maintained close social and family ties with that country , as evidenced by his regular visits there . Additionally , even though he claimed that his relationship with his children was close , he had not paid maintenance for them since the separation from his wife . Lastly , the children were not prevented from visiting him in GPE and the contact could be maintained at a distance . The applicant \u2019s expulsion was therefore proportionate and he was required to leave GPE by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sentenced for the second time to a suspended custodial sentence of DATE for wilful neglect of his obligation to pay maintenance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of the cantonal immigration authorities with the director of ORG the GPE of ORG ( ORG Kantons Basel - Stadt \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the director \u201d ) , who dismissed the appeal on DATE . The director established that the applicant had met the criteria for expulsion under domestic law in several respects . To begin with , the applicant had been logged in the criminal register CARDINAL times since DATE . While the majority of the sentences had been for minor offences \u2013 mainly against LAW \u2013 CARDINAL of them were serious convictions . These were : CARDINAL for domestic violence in DATE , resulting in a suspended custodial sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , and CARDINAL others for wilful negligence of his obligation to pay maintenance , warranting CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in DATE and a suspended custodial sentence of DATE in DATE . Since the applicant had thus been found guilty of imprisonable offences ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he fulfilled the criterion for expulsion as provided in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of FAC ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Secondly , despite repeated warnings by the cantonal immigration authorities , the applicant \u2019s financial situation had continuously deteriorated . In this regard the director held that , despite having had several jobs in the gastronomic sector , the applicant had repeatedly tried to start his own business and had frivolously invested money in projects with poor prospects . His debts were therefore self - imposed and , from an overall perspective , he had , continuously throughout DATE , failed to show any willingness to observe public order and to integrate into the NORP system . He therefore additionally fulfilled the condition for expulsion according to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of FAC ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and section CARDINAL of its LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . By contrast , despite still not having paid back to the ORG all the maintenance received for his family , after DATE the applicant \u2019s family had no longer been dependent on social welfare . Therefore , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) of FAC ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) no longer applied to the applicant . With regard to LAW , the director further established that the applicant \u2019s expulsion was a proportionate interference with his right to respect for family life . The applicant had maintained close ties with his home country , which he had visited on many occasions . The applicant \u2019s wife had lived in her home country until DATE and she had visited GPE , together with the children , on many occasions . Moreover , she had also accumulated debts amounting to CHF CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) and was receiving an invalidity pension . Lastly , the children were still relatively young ( the oldest daughter being DATE at the time of the decision ) and they would therefore not encounter any serious difficulties if they returned to GPE with the applicant . The public interest in expelling the applicant to GPE therefore outweighed his personal interest in remaining in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the GPE of ORG ( ORG Basel - Stadt \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , a decision that was upheld by ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on DATE . With particular regard to the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW , both courts held that , considered as a whole , his expulsion was proportionate . Even though the applicant had been living together with his wife again since DATE , his matrimonial situation had not proved to be very stable in the past . Furthermore , despite having maintained a close relationship with his children , for DATE \u2012 until DATE \u2012 he had completely neglected his obligation to pay them maintenance . Moreover , it would be possible to maintain a relationship with them at a distance without serious difficulty . The courts also found that the family would not encounter any major obstacles if they returned to GPE with the applicant . The children were still at an age where they could easily adapt to a new environment and the NORP language was their mother tongue . Furthermore , his wife had not proved to be particularly well integrated in GPE and was receiving an invalidity pension . The expulsion order against the applicant was therefore upheld .", "CARDINAL . NORP The cantonal immigration authorities gave the applicant a deadline of DATE for leaving GPE . The applicant left GPE alone .", "CARDINAL . NORP In letters of DATE and DATE , the applicant \u2019s representative informed the ORG that the applicant had been issued with a residence permit for GPE on DATE . He nevertheless wanted to maintain his application because DATE he had been obliged to live in GPE while his wife and children had remained in GPE . During this period he had not been able to support them financially but had visited them , at least once , in GPE .", "CARDINAL .
