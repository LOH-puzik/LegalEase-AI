On DATE the applicant went to the hospital , where , to his surprise , he was deprived of all his belongings and hospitalised together with persons of unsound mind with limited freedom of movement .

The Code of Civil Procedure provides for CARDINAL possibility for a person to be submitted to a psychiatric examination against his or her will . LAW of the Code deals with the proceedings intended to limit the legal capacity of a person .

Article CARDINAL provides that a judge examining an action to limit a person 's legal capacity can order the person concerned to undergo a psychiatric medical examination .

Pursuant to section CARDINAL , the court examining the application must take a decision within DATE from the date on which the application was lodged and the person concerned has the right to participate in the hearing . If the person 's condition is serious and he or she can not come to the court , the judge is obliged to hold the hearing at the hospital . The judgment issued at the end of the hearing constitutes the basis for compulsory hospitalisation .", "Section CARDINAL of the same law provides , inter alia , that a patient hospitalised in a psychiatric hospital with his consent can leave the hospital upon his or her request . On the other hand , a patient hospitalised against his or her will can leave the hospital only upon the decision of a commission of psychiatrists or on the basis of a court judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
