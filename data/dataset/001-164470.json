The applicant was born in DATE in GPE , in GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) , and lives in GPE in the GPE of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE he was arrested by the NORP police at his place of residence in GPE and taken to ORG in GPE , where he was presented with a bill of indictment according to which he represented a threat to NORP State Security . He was then allegedly taken to GPE by NORP agents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submits that he was arbitrarily detained and tortured in GPE in the LOC of ORG , from DATE to DATE , on the orders of PERSON , the then Minister of the Interior . He submits that he was subjected to the so - called \u201c roast chicken \u201d position throughout his entire detention and deprived of his basic physiological needs , particularly sleep ; he was also beaten on the soles of his feet with a baseball bat and struck all over his body with telephone cords .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that he suffers from a series of medically attested physical and psychological injuries and problems , and that a causal link between the abuse described and these injuries and problems has been considered plausible .", "CARDINAL . Following the alleged torture in GPE in DATE , the applicant fled that country in DATE and took refuge in GPE , where he applied for political asylum in DATE . The applicant has since been living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities granted the applicant political asylum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while PERSON was being treated in a NORP hospital , the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against him with ORG for GPE ( \u201c the Principal Public Prosecutor \u201d ) , for severe bodily injury , illegal confinement , insults , endangering health , coercion and abuse of authority . The applicant applied to join these proceedings as a civil party seeking damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made an order discontinuing the proceedings on the grounds that PERSON had left GPE and that the police had been unable to arrest him .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE he \u201c [ asked ] a NORP lawyer to represent him with a view to bringing civil proceedings for compensation against [ PERSON ] and GPE . On DATE the lawyer [ informed ] [ the applicant ] that this type of action had never been successful and advised him not to lodge such a claim \u201d .", "It was allegedly impossible to lodge a civil action of this sort in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a writ dated DATE , the applicant lodged a claim for damages with the GPE of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) against GPE and against PERSON He considered that he should be paid MONEY ( CHF ) , with PERCENT interest from DATE , as compensation for the non - pecuniary damage arising from the acts of torture to which he had allegedly been subjected . The applicant submitted that the conditions for reparation of non - pecuniary damage provided for by Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , applicable under LAW . CARDINAL of the ORG , were met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held before ORG ; neither of the defendants was in attendance or represented .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG declared the claim inadmissible on the ground that it lacked territorial jurisdiction . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c With regard to an action in tort based on the unlawful acts that were allegedly committed in GPE by the defendants , to the claimant \u2019s detriment , the NORP courts do not have territorial jurisdiction under international law to examine the complaint , given that the defendants are not domiciled or habitually resident in GPE , and given also that no illegal act or detrimental outcome occurred in GPE , pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL [ of LAW of DATE ( ORG ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ] . \u201d", "Under section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ( ORG ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) the NORP courts did not have jurisdiction by necessity either , given the lack of a sufficient connection between , on the one hand , the case and the facts , and , on the other , GPE . In this connection , ORG ruled as follows :", "\u201c All of the acts for whose after - effects the claimant , a NORP national , seeks compensation for non - pecuniary damage were allegedly inflicted on him , as he submits , in GPE in DATE , in the premises of ORG of the Interior , by ORG and its agents . The sole fact that the claimant applied for and received political asylum in DATE in GPE , where he has since been domiciled , does not amount , in the light of current case - law , to a sufficient connection enabling a \u201c forum of necessity \u201d to be established against the respondents in GPE and GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a writ dated DATE , the applicant appealed against that decision before ORG of GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . His appeal was rejected in a judgment of DATE . After noting that the appellant had shown that he was unable to bring a civil action in GPE , ORG considered :", "\u201c As the outcome of the present appeal depends on the immunity from jurisdiction of the defendant parties , the question of whether there exists a forum of necessity in the appellant \u2019s place of residence can , however , remain undecided . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also held that the defendants enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction , since the acts of torture had been performed in the exercise of sovereign authority ( iure imperii ) and not iure gestionis . Referring to the judgment delivered by ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . ORG , ECHR DATE ) , it further considered that there had been no violation of the applicant \u2019s right of access to a court .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an ordinary appeal with ORG , dated DATE , in which he asked ORG to rule that the courts in GPE had territorial jurisdiction and to find that the defendants did not enjoy immunity from jurisdiction . With regard to the jurisdiction of the NORP courts , he argued that the purpose of the introduction of a forum of necessity in section CARDINAL of the LDIP ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was to avoid denials of justice , especially in cases of political persecution , and that he had provided sufficient evidence that he could not reasonably bring proceedings before a foreign court . As to the immunity from jurisdiction purportedly enjoyed by GPE and PERSON , the applicant submitted that the exercise of public power did not include the option of committing international crimes such as torture . In this connection , he specified that the very definition of torture in LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of DATE ( hereafter : \u201c the Convention against Torture \u201d ; see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) ruled out any immunity .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the reasoning of which was notified to the applicant on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . Reiterating the reasoning in the first - instance judgment , ORG considered that the NORP courts did not in any event have territorial jurisdiction . The relevant passages of ORG judgment read as follows :", "\u201c QUANTITY In the absence of an ordinary forum , the problem must be addressed under section CARDINAL of the ORG , which concerns the forum of necessity ... Under the latter provision , where no forum is provided for in GPE by the ORG and where proceedings in another country prove impossible or one can not reasonable require that they be brought in that country , the NORP judicial or administrative authorities of the locality with which the case has a sufficient connection have jurisdiction .", "The application of this rule for assigning jurisdiction thus calls for CARDINAL cumulative conditions to be met : firstly , the NORP authorities do not have jurisdiction under another provision ; secondly , legal proceedings in another country are impossible or can not reasonably be required ; and , thirdly , the case in question has a sufficient connection with GPE . In the present case , the first condition is indisputably fulfilled . Fulfilment of the second condition appears more problematic , but in the light of the third condition , which merits more extensive discussion , it is not necessary to elaborate further on this question .", "CARDINAL LAW of the ORG , which must be interpreted restrictively ... represents a safety valve , intended to avoid denials of justice in the event of a negative conflict of jurisdiction .", "In this connection , ORG , in its authoritative interpretation of this provision , noted that \u201c there are cases that have such a tenuous connection with GPE that it is not appropriate to set in motion the entire judicial system in order to resolve them . However , section CARDINAL lays down an exception to this principle . The NORP authorities must assume jurisdiction even in cases where the connection with our country is very tenuous , where it is impossible to bring proceedings or to lodge an appeal abroad . It is for the claimant or the appellant to demonstrate this impossibility . Where this evidence has been adduced , jurisdiction reverts to the authority of the locality with which the case has a sufficient connection . Where there are several competing fora in GPE , it is the first authority before which an action is brought that has jurisdiction . Clearly , the impossibility of bringing and pursuing proceedings abroad can only be examined in the light of the tangible circumstances and of the possible consequences for the individual concerned in the particular case ; it will ultimately be for the court to recognise , or not , its jurisdiction \u201d ....", "Although section CARDINAL ORG may thus seem innately paradoxical insofar as proceedings for which there is no basis for connection with an ordinary forum in GPE are , ipso facto , lacking in any particular connection with this country , in such a way that determining a \u201c sufficient connection \u201d may prove challenging , and the aim pursued by DATE to prevent a formal denial of justice \u2013 is difficult to achieve , this legal provision has not in practice been without effect ; the cantonal courts in particular have recognised its applicability it in the areas of family law , inheritance and proceedings on debt - enforcement and bankruptcy ...", "Moreover , legal writers have noted that the subsidiary forum must necessarily be recognised in situations of political persecution ... In contrast , the case - law and legal writings shed scarcely any light with regard to a civil action for compensation in respect of damage resulting from crimes against humanity , life and physical integrity , committed aboard , by foreign perpetrators .", "CARDINAL . ... In the present case , however , the claimant complains of acts of torture that were allegedly committed in GPE , by NORP resident in GPE , against a NORP residing in GPE . All of the specific features of the case come back to GPE , except for the fact of residence in GPE at the relevant time . The facts of the case thus have no connection with GPE , so that the question of whether or not the link with this country is sufficient does not arise . In those circumstances , it is not possible to recognise the jurisdiction of the NORP courts , short of disregarding the clear text of [ section ] CARDINAL of the LDIP [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] . The fact that the claimant then chose to come to GPE can not change anything , since it is a fact subsequent to the events of the case and , moreover , does not form part of it .", "...", "CARDINAL . Since the absence of a sufficient connection between the facts of the case and GPE suffices to establish the NORP courts\u2019 lack of jurisdiction , the appeal must be dismissed , without it being necessary to examine the issue of immunity from jurisdiction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave its consent to the applicant \u2019s naturalisation , and this was confirmed by the town of GPE on DATE following a favourable opinion from the GPE of GPE of DATE .
