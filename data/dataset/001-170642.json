SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alena Pol\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1;Branko Lubarda;Georgios A. Serghides;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a person was murdered at a nightclub in GPE , GPE , by a lone gunman ( hereafter \u201c the DATE murder \u201d ) . The applicant , who belonged to a well - known criminal network in ORG , was arrested DATE as a suspect . He was held in pre - trial detention until DATE , with restrictions . Although released from pretrial detention on that date , he remained a suspect . On DATE he was once again arrested and subsequently detained , with restrictions , on suspicion for the DATE murder as well as inter alia another murder . The prosecution against the applicant and several other defendants was brought on DATE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the evidence against the applicant concerning the DATE murder , the prosecution , inter alia , relied on information provided by witness A. , who was working at the nightclub on TIME of the murder . PERSON told the first policeman to arrive at the crime scene that he wanted to tell another policeman , PERSON , who the perpetrator was . On DATE , PERSON arrived at the police station . However , as PERSON was not present , he told policeman PERSON instead that the applicant was the perpetrator . A. had known the applicant since an early age . A. also made it clear to C. that he would not agree to be questioned formally by the police or be heard as a witness before a court . The reason was that he feared retribution from the criminal network to which the applicant belonged . C. took note of the information and DATE repeated to policeman PERSON what he had seen on TIME of the murder . During the period from CARDINAL September CARDINAL to DATE , PERSON repeated this information to ORG and a third policeman , NORP , on CARDINAL separate occasions .", "CARDINAL . The trial at ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tt ) started at DATE and lasted for DATE . On DATE , the applicant was convicted of the DATE murder , aiding and abetting a second murder , abduction and extortion . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . Moreover , he was to remain in detention , with restrictions , until the judgment gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tt ) , which found CARDINAL of the lay judges at ORG to be biased because he was also a member of a local police commission where , among other things , the criminal case against the applicant had been discussed . For that reason , on DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment and referred the case back to the lower court for renewed proceedings . The applicant was to remain in detention , with restrictions .", "CARDINAL . The new proceedings started before a new composition of judges of ORG at DATE and lasted for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Policemen B. , C. and NORP were heard as witnesses during the trial and they concordantly testified that PERSON had told them that the applicant was the perpetrator . However , despite numerous requests , PERSON refused to relay the information at a formal police hearing or at the trial . A. nevertheless appeared as a witness at the trial and was questioned by the prosecution and the defence . He denied that he had witnessed the murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was once again convicted by ORG of the DATE murder , aiding and abetting a second murder and abduction and extortion . This time , he was also convicted of aiding and abetting a third attempted murder . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . Moreover , he was to remain in detention , with restrictions , until the judgment gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted in its judgment that the applicant had claimed that A. blamed him for the murder for reasons of revenge or loyalty . The court , however , found no indication of such motives . A. was deemed credible , and his explanation to the policemen B. , C. and NORP that he refused to testify because of fear of retribution was seen as convincing . The court also reasoned that the strength of the hearsay evidence was reduced as A. had not provided the information during a trial where cross - examination was possible . A. \u2019s identification of the perpetrator was therefore not seen as evidence decisive enough , taken by itself , to prove the guilt of the applicant . In addition to the identification , however , there was circumstantial evidence . A. had given information about the perpetrator to the victim in the extortion crime of which the applicant was also convicted . Furthermore , the applicant had no alibi and , according to connections to telecommunication masts , he was TIME away from the nightclub around the time of the murder . The applicant had called a person who stored guns TIME before the murder , stating that he was in a hurry and wanted to meet outside the applicant \u2019s home . His mobile phone had thereafter been silent for TIME , which was very unusual for him . DATE , the applicant had requested guns and ammunition , and he was able to handle guns . ORG concluded that the circumstantial evidence , considered together with ORG \u2019s identification of the perpetrator , proved that the applicant was the murderer .", "CARDINAL . Upon appeal , ORG held an oral hearing which lasted DATE . The applicant \u2019s restrictions were lifted on DATE by the court . On DATE , the court upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment as regards the applicant and he was ordered to remain in detention without restrictions until the judgment gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lower court \u2019s evidence evaluation and conclusion were shared by ORG , where video recordings of the witness testimony were shown . The appellate court further noted that the applicant \u2019s mother had called his mobile phone at the time when the applicant had claimed he was sleeping in the apartment from which his mother was calling . Moreover , the court noted that the applicant had handed over his cell phones to a friend after the murder but before he was arrested , indicating that he did not want the police to get hold of them . With regard to the case as a whole , the court remarked that several injured persons and witnesses had refused to be questioned by the police or had retracted previous statements given to the police at the trial . According to the court , it was obvious that this was because of loyalty or fear of retribution . Several witnesses were accused of perjury .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG judgment to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed neither explicitly nor implicitly to ORG against ORG decision to keep him in detention until the judgment gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( PERSON , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , reads as follows :", "\u201c After conscientious assessment of everything that has occurred , the court shall determine what has been proved in the case .", "As to the effect of certain kinds of evidence , the specific provisions thereon shall apply . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This provision reflects the principle of free submission and evaluation of evidence ( principen om DATE bevisf\u00f6ring och bevisv\u00e4rdering ) which prevails in NORP procedural law . It means that , as a main rule , there are no restrictions in law on the submission and evaluation of evidence . Thus , anything that may be of value as evidence in a case may , in principle , be presented during the main hearing . However , the circumstances under which evidence has been collected or given will have an influence on the way in which it is evaluated . The \u201c principle of best evidence \u201d ( principen om b\u00e4sta bevismedlet ) is applied ; consequently , witnesses and injured parties should normally give evidence during a court hearing , rather than the court reading the statements made during the preliminary investigation , to enable the parties to pose questions and scrutinise the statements more closely .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , according to LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , a court may dismiss evidence , inter alia , if the circumstance that a party wants to prove is without importance in the case , if the evidence is unnecessary or if it clearly would be to no effect ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
