The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was baptised in accordance with the ceremonial rite of the Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses and became an active member . On DATE he assumed the function of a preacher ( \u201c special full - time servant \u201d or \u201c regular pioneer \u201d \u2013 Sondervollzeitdiener , allgemeiner PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( LOC - kommando ) found the applicant fit to perform military service . It subsequently called him up ( ORG ) to begin his military service on DATE . That order was later revoked .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , on DATE , filed a request with the Federal Minister for ORG ( ORG ) for recognition as a conscientious objector ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the Minister for ORG recognised the applicant as a conscientious objector . Accordingly , he was exempted from the duty to perform military service but liable to perform civilian service ( Zivildienst ) .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE the applicant lived in a community of preachers ( \u201c GPE family \u201d \u2013 Bethelfamilie ) , which , in the applicant \u2019s view , is similar to a religious order ( PERSON ) and is called LAW ( ORG Sonder - vollzeitdiener der PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to commence his civilian service ( PERSON ) with ORG ( ORG ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant became a deacon ( \u201c ministerial servant \u201d \u2013 Diakon , GPE ) within ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ) against the ORG \u2019s order of DATE , also requesting the suspension of its effect . The applicant submitted that he had been living in a community of preachers since DATE and devoted all his time to religious activities . On DATE he had become a deacon and aspired to assume the function of an elder within the Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses . Referring to NORP law ( section CARDINAL ) of ORG ) and the case - law and practice of ORG ( BVerwG , DATE , PERSON . CARDINAL C CARDINAL ) , he argued that persons in a similar situation ( preachers and deacons ) were exempt from compulsory military or civilian service . Further , the applicant complained that section CARDINAL ) of LAW exempted only members of recognised religious societies performing specific services relating to worship or religious instruction from the obligation to perform civilian service , whereas he held a comparable clerical position within the GPE \u2019s Witnesses . Furthermore , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the newly introduced LAW on ORG ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber die PERSON religi\u00f6sen GPE , hereafter referred to as the \u201c CARDINAL Act \u201d ) , which had entered into force on DATE , established that recognition under LAW was only possible after DATE existence as a registered religious community . Therefore this new provision precluded any recognition during the following DATE and made LAW inapplicable until DATE . The applicant requested ORG to revoke the restriction limiting the application of section CARDINAL ) of LAW to \u201c recognised religious societies \u201d , and in the alternative to revoke the DATE requirement laid down in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint for lack of prospects of success . It further dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for his complaint to have suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant agreed with ORG that he would begin his civilian service in an institution for disabled persons on DATE , and he consequently left the community of preachers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to transmit his complaint of DATE to ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant supplemented his complaint and requested ORG to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality ( PERSON ) of the wording \u201c recognised religious societies \u201d in section CARDINAL ) of LAW . In the alternative , he requested that the provision at issue be interpreted in conformity with the principle of equality . He thus argued that , in view of his position as a deacon in the GPE \u2019s Witnesses , he should be dispensed from the obligation to perform civilian service as his position involved supporting elders by guiding the communities , carrying out clerical work in cooperation with other fellow GPE \u2019s Witnesses , giving Bible readings , speeches and commentaries during worship and offering guidance for prayers ; accordingly , his functions were equivalent to those of members of registered religious societies who provided services relating to spiritual welfare or clerical teaching after graduating in theological studies , or to those of students of theology who were preparing to assume a clerical function .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed his complaint . It noted that LAW and in particular section ORG ) had not been applied and were not to be applied by ORG in the applicant \u2019s case . Rather , ORG had to apply section CARDINAL ) of LAW , requiring recognition of a religious society as a precondition for exemption from civilian service . The provision as such raised no concerns as regards constitutionality , since its objective was not to grant an exemption from the obligation to perform civilian service to every functionary of a religious community , whether or not it was recognised . It further held that the impugned provision , on account of its explicit wording , could not be interpreted in the manner suggested by the applicant . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant ended his civilian service and , on DATE , he rejoined ORG , where he stayed until DATE . Subsequently , he left the community of preachers , continued to work as a preacher and received further clerical training .", "CARDINAL .
