On DATE ORG , without giving reasons , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings before ORG following the remittal of the case to it , the applicant lodged a motion for bias against Judge PERSON latter had been a member of the bench of ORG , which had ordered the applicant \u2019s retrospective preventive detention on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant claimed that Judge PERSON had remarked to the applicant \u2019s female defence counsel on CARDINAL DATE , immediately after the delivery of ORG judgment ordering the applicant \u2019s retrospective preventive detention , in reference to the applicant : \u201c Be careful that after he is released , you do n\u2019t find him standing in front of your door waiting to thank you . \u201d He claimed that the remark had been made in the course of a discussion between the judges and the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL lawyers in camera concerning the applicant \u2019s possible transfer to a psychiatric hospital following ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a comment of CARDINAL DATE on the applicant \u2019s motion for bias , Judge PERSON explained that he remembered having a discussion about the applicant \u2019s possible transfer to a psychiatric hospital at a later stage , after the delivery of the judgment . However , given the amount of time that had elapsed , he neither recalled the exact context in which he had allegedly made the impugned remark nor the precise contents of the discussion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the motions for bias lodged by the applicant . The court considered in particular that , even assuming that the applicant had established to the satisfaction of the court that Judge PERSON had made the remark in question , there were no objectively justified doubts as to P. \u2019s impartiality as a result thereof . Even assuming that the applicant could reasonably consider the sense of the words \u201c thank you \u201d in the above context as meaning that the applicant could commit a violent offence , it had to be noted that ORG , including Judge PERSON , had just established that the applicant still suffered from fantasies of sexual violence and that there was at that time a high risk that he would again commit serious offences against the life and sexual self - determination of others . Assuming that Judge PERSON had indeed made the remark in question , his \u201c advice \u201d had therefore constituted in substance nothing more than the application of ORG said findings to a particular case . The remark had further been made within the context of a confidential exchange between the participants in the proceedings in the absence of the applicant . Judge PERSON could have expected that the applicant \u2019s female counsel would interpret his remark in the above - mentioned manner within that context .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , Judge PERSON \u2019s remark had reflected his view as it had been on DATE of ORG judgment of DATE . It did not suggest in any way that Judge PERSON had not been ready to take an impartial decision in the present proceedings , DATE after the impugned remark and following the conclusion of a new main hearing . The fact that Judge PERSON had previously dealt with the applicant \u2019s case did not in itself render him biased .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held hearings DATE , again ordered the applicant \u2019s retrospective preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . ORG found , in particular , that , as required by Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , a comprehensive assessment of the applicant , his offence and , in addition , his development during the execution of the sentence relating to young offenders revealed that there was a high risk that the applicant , owing to specific circumstances relating to his person or his conduct , could commit the most serious crimes of violence and sexual offences , similar to the one he had been found guilty of , if released .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of section LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Having regard to the case - law of ORG and ORG , it considered that , whereas a mere \u201c accentuation of the personality \u201d was not sufficient to constitute a mental disorder within the meaning of the said LAW , such disorder did not have to be so serious as to exclude or diminish the criminal responsibility of the person concerned for the purposes of ORG LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Given that the sexual sadism the applicant suffered from was of a serious nature and had substantially affected the applicant \u2019s development since his adolescence , it amounted to a mental disorder within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG based its view on the reports of CARDINAL external psychiatric experts , PERSON and PERSON , whom it had consulted . Having regard to the findings of these experts , as well as to the findings of several experts who had previously examined the applicant since his arrest following his offence , ORG was satisfied that the applicant has had violent sexual fantasies involving the strangulation of women since DATE . He was suffering from a sexual preference disorder , namely sexual sadism , as described by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases , the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems in its current version ( ICD-CARDINAL ) ; this disorder had caused and been manifested in his brutal offence and still persisted . The therapy the applicant had undergone until DATE , in particular social therapy , had not been successful . Even though he appeared ready , in principle , to participate in further therapy , he was not currently undergoing any .", "CARDINAL . In an appeal on points of law against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant complained of the unlawfulness of his retrospective preventive detention and of the fact that the judgment had been determined with the participation of a biased judge , P.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained , in particular , that the retrospective order for his preventive detention had not complied with the prohibition on retrospective penalties under LAW and LAW , with the right to liberty and the protection of legitimate expectations in a ORG governed by the rule of law , or with LAW . He further argued that his constitutional right to a tribunal established by law had been violated because Judge PERSON had been biased against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint without giving reasons ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the order for the applicant \u2019s provisional preventive detention , the applicant was transferred from the wing for persons in preventive detention in FAC to a wing for persons in detention on remand . As a consequence , the applicant lost the privileges reserved for persons in preventive detention . In particular , there was no longer the possibility to undergo therapy . On DATE he was transferred back to and again detained in the wing for persons in preventive detention in FAC until DATE .", "CARDINAL .
