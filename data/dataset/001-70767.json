GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 14+8;Pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicants , a married couple , immigrated to GPE with their daughter , born in DATE . Their son , born in DATE , joined them in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE their request to be recognised as immigrants of NORP origin ( PERSON ) was rejected . The applicants ' request to reopen the proceedings was rejected on DATE by ORG ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) . DATE the applicants were issued with residence titles for exceptional purposes ( NORP ) which have been regularly renewed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) informed the first applicant , who had received child benefits ( GPE ) since DATE , that as from DATE the child benefits would no longer be paid following a change in legislation . The office noted that according to LAW of ORG ( GPE , see relevant domestic law below ) , as amended and in force as from DATE , a foreigner was only entitled to child benefits if in possession of a residence permit ( ORG ) or a provisional residence permit ( ORG ) . The office noted that this condition was not met in the applicants ' case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr GPE ) rejected the first applicant 's objection .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , assisted by counsel , lodged an action with ORG ( ORG ) with the aim to be granted child benefits from DATE . He claimed that he and his family had been residing in GPE since DATE and had been paying tax and social contributions . He should , therefore , continue to be entitled to the child benefits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant 's action . It confirmed that only aliens with an unlimited or a provisional residence permit were entitled to the payment of child benefits . The new legislation had only intended to grant child benefits to aliens living in GPE on a permanent basis , whereas aliens with only a limited residence title for exceptional purposes were not likely to stay . The court further pointed out that this distinction did not violate the NORP LAW as had been stated by ORG in several judgments since DATE . As to the special protection of the family provided under LAW , the court held that this did not prevent the ORG from subjecting the payment of child benefits to the type of the residence title .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , assisted by counsel , lodged an appeal with the GPE Social Court of Appeal ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the first applicant that it had referred CARDINAL pilot cases to ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) for review of LAW of ORG , and asked him whether he would agree to a suspension of his appeal proceedings until a decision had been given by ORG . On DATE ORG , having obtained the parties ' agreement , ordered the suspension of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE in the pilot cases ( CARDINAL BvL CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvL CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvL DATE ) , ORG ruled that LAW as effective from DATE until DATE was incompatible with the right to equal treatment under LAW of LAW . Accordingly , the legislator was ordered to amend the law by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court found , in particular , that the different treatment of parents who were and who were not in possession of a stable residence permit lacked sufficient justification . As the granting of child benefits related to the protection of family life under LAW , very weighty reasons would have to be put forward to justify unequal treatment . Such reasons were not apparent . In so far as the provision was aimed at limiting the granting of child benefits to those aliens who where likely to stay permanently in GPE , the criteria applied were inappropriate to reach that aim . The fact that a person was in possession of a limited residence title did not form a sufficient basis to predict the duration of his or her stay in GPE . ORG did not discern any other reasons justifying the unequal treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the first applicant 's request , ORG resumed the proceedings . On DATE ORG , with the parties ' consent , once again suspended proceedings pending the amendment of the applicable legislation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant lodged a motion with ORG ( ORG ) with the aim to be granted child benefits from DATE according to the provisions of LAW ( Einkommensteuergesetz , see relevant domestic law below ) . On DATE ORG rejected the motion . The first applicant did not lodge an appeal .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( PERSON - gesetz , ORG - PERSON , S. CARDINAL ) , as in force from DATE until DATE , provided for the payment of child benefits which are financed by ORG .", "Section CARDINAL , as far as relevant , provided as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Under the provisions of the present Act , anybody is entitled to child benefits for his or her children ... ,", "CARDINAL . NORP who has a place of residence ( PERSON ) or regular residence ( gew\u00f6hnlicher ORG ) within the scope of the present Act ,", "...", "( CARDINAL ) An alien is entitled to a benefit under LAW , if he has a residence permit or a provisional residence permit . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
