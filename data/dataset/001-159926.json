In a dispute concerning a construction project envisaged in public procurement , in DATE the applicant company brought an action in damages against a university .", "CARDINAL . NORP The President of the territorially competent ORG requested ORG ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) to reassign the case to another court of the same jurisdictional level . In the request the President provided particulars about the case to be reassigned and indicated the data and the circumstances which prevented the adjudication , within a reasonable time , of this case , deemed to be of high importance , by relying on , in particular , the case - load of judges hearing civil cases , significantly exceeding the national average .", "CARDINAL . NORP The President of the LOC examined the case - load statistics of ORG , including the volume of highly important and priority cases and the workload of judges hearing civil cases . She found that , in view of the short statutory time - limits , the adjudication of the case within a reasonable time could only be ensured by reassigning the case to another court .", "CARDINAL . By requesting information from the President of ORG , the President of the ORG also examined the case - load and the operational conditions , including staff and facilities , of ORG of ORG . On the basis of this information , the President of the ORG was satisfied that the reassignment of the case to ORG would not impose a disproportionate burden on that court .", "CARDINAL . For the sake of judicial economy as appreciated above , on DATE the President of the LOC case assigned the case to ORG ( decision no . CARDINAL . ( II.CARDINAL . ) OBHE ) , acting within the powers conferred upon her by the law .", "CARDINAL . The Zalaegerszeg High Court heard the case and dismissed the claim on DATE . That decision was confirmed by ORG on DATE , a ruling served on CARDINAL October CARDINAL . The latter \u2019s territorial competence to hear the appeal was a consequence of the case having been assigned to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE ORG issued decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on \u201c the guidelines to be observed in respect of case reassignment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE upheld the decisions of ORG and ORG in review proceedings .", "The courts held in essence that the applicant company \u2019s perception according to which the university had unlawfully backed out of the investment contract ( namely , the construction of a dormitory ) was nothing more than a misconception of the law and a tendentious interpretation of the circumstances , and that the facts of the case did not reveal any compensation liability on the respondent \u2019s side , for want of unlawfulness .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint . It counted DATE and complied with \u2013 the statutory DATE time - limit to do so from the service of the final decision in the case , i.e. from CARDINAL DATE . It claimed firstly that the domestic courts had reached their decisions in an arbitrary manner and , secondly , that it was deprived of a \u201c tribunal established by law \u201d , since by decision no . CARDINAL . ( II.CARDINAL . ) OBHE the President of the ORG had reassigned the case from the originally competent court to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The constitutional complaint was declared inadmissible on DATE ( decision no . DATE . ( ORG . CARDINAL . ) AB ) . ORG held that the case as a whole did not reveal any arbitrariness or unfairness as such . As regards the specific complaint about the reassignment , it held that this issue was severable from the main procedure . It was of the view that the DATE statutory time - limit had run , in that respect , from the very reassignment decision of QUANTITY DATE rather than from DATE as construed by the applicant DATE and for that reason this part of the motion was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted decision no . DATE . ( XII.CARDINAL . ) AB in the matter of reassignment , in pursuit of constitutional complaints originating in cases other than that of the applicant . It held that the regulations which entitled the President of the ORG to reassign cases among courts ( notably , sections CARDINAL and DATE of Act no . ORG of DATE on ORG , as in force DATE and DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been unconstitutional and in violation of LAW . According to ORG , the right for one \u2019s \u201c natural \u201d ( lawful ) judge flows from the right to have one \u2019s case examined by a court \u201c established by law \u201d and requires that a case be heard by a judge belonging to the court with competence and territorial jurisdiction and designated by the pre - established objective rules of case assignment of that court . In ORG view , the impugned regulations , which had conferred responsibility for the reassignment of cases , at least in the material period , entirely on the President of the ORG , had been in breach of those principles . Moreover , it had violated the requirement of the appearance of impartiality . ORG also held that the lack of a remedy against the decision of the President of the ORG had violated LAW , as well as LAW .", "ORG did not prescribe any particular legal consequence of this decision for the ongoing procedures concerned by re - assignment . Consequently , ORG decision did not invalidate any reassignment decisions taken previously ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
