The conviction and sentence became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the GPE police were notified of that latest conviction and sentence , and dispatched CARDINAL officers to arrest Mr PERSON with a view to sending him to prison to serve the sentence . The officers went to his house in GPE , informed him that he was due to be imprisoned , and asked him to come with them . Mr PERSON , visibly calm , asked the officers to wait for TIME , so that he could prepare his luggage . The officers waited for TIME outside the house . When they went in to arrest PERSON , they saw that he had fled . After that they went back to the police station and reported the incident to the head of the ORG police and to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The account of the circumstances surrounding Mr PERSON \u2019s death is based on the findings of the investigation carried out by the military prosecuting and investigating authorities ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG ordered the police to carry out a series of operations for the arrest of individuals with final convictions and sentences . As a result , in TIME of DATE the head of ORG assembled CARDINAL groups of officers to arrest PERSON . The first group had to check his house in GPE , the second had to check the sheep pen of an associate of his , and the third had to check Mr PERSON \u2019s country house , situated near GPE . All CARDINAL groups were armed with their service pistols . They were told that PERSON might try to escape or put up armed resistance , and instructed to use their weapons only as provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the CARDINAL groups set out to carry out their respective tasks . The first and the second group were unable to find Mr PERSON . The third group , which consisted of CARDINAL officers , CARDINAL of whom were in uniform ( one wearing a bulletproof vest ) and CARDINAL in plain clothes , arrived near Mr PERSON \u2019s country house at QUANTITY The house was surrounded by service buildings . All of those were erected on uneven terrain sloping steeply from the north - west to the south - east . The officers stopped their car in front of the gate , close to which they saw a big pile of used car tyres . They noticed that the gate was closed and started to whistle and shout . Several dogs in the yard started barking and PERSON PERSON \u2019s mother came out of CARDINAL of the service buildings . CARDINAL of the officers presented himself and told her that they were looking for her son . Then she opened the gate and held the dogs back . The officers moved towards the house , the one with the bulletproof vest walking in front , and went through another gate between several service buildings . At that point they spotted Mr PERSON on the steps outside the house , carrying an unidentified weapon . He also saw them , waved to them to go away and fired a shot , apparently in their direction . CARDINAL of the officers hid behind the service buildings and CARDINAL behind some building materials scattered around the yard . He then ran back to the car and radioed the headquarters in GPE about the incident . At CARDINAL or DATE the head of the CARDINAL officers ordered them to remain where they were and not to take further action .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after that the head of ORG directed all police teams in the town towards Mr PERSON \u2019s country house and requested assistance from the police in CARDINAL neighbouring towns , GPE and FAC . The GPE police dispatched an emergency response team consisting of CARDINAL officers , and the FAC police sent CARDINAL officers divided into CARDINAL teams . The head of the FAC police also went to the scene of the incident .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the GPE police , some of whom had armed themselves with long barrel weapons , surrounded the house and cut off all access points , waiting for the emergency response team from GPE to arrive . It seems that Mr PERSON fired several shots at them , with CARDINAL of the bullets hitting the mudguard of a police car . The police did not fire back .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after that the GPE team arrived and positioned themselves around the house . The head of the team informed the Minister of ORG of the situation . The Minister decided to dispatch the special antiterrorism squad and psychologists of ORG . The FAC police also arrived TIME . Most of them took up position around the house . A fire engine also came to the scene .", "CARDINAL . The head of the PERSON team decided to try to establish contact with Mr PERSON through relatives of his . At TIME Mr PERSON \u2019s sister was called in and asked to help the police . At the same time Mr PERSON \u2019s elder son ( the first applicant ) also arrived . He offered to take his father a mobile phone so that he could communicate more easily with the police . The head of the GPE police team refused , apparently for fear that the first applicant might be taken hostage by PERSON . Some time after that the CARDINAL officers hiding behind the service buildings managed to get out of the yard with the help of Mr PERSON \u2019s mother .", "CARDINAL . At TIME Mr PERSON \u2019s sister approached the house and brought her mother out . She spotted PERSON , who waved at her . She understood the gesture to mean that he wished to talk to somebody on the phone , and asked the police to allow her to take a mobile phone or a megaphone to PERSON . Her request was turned down with the explanation that the police were waiting for psychologists , who would try to establish contact with PERSON , to arrive .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after that CARDINAL psychologists of ORG arrived . They started gathering information about Mr PERSON \u2019s personal history , character and relations with his family , in order to decide whether his relatives might be able to exert a positive influence on him . The first applicant again asked for permission to take his father a mobile phone , but his request was turned down due to security concerns .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after that the special antiterrorism squad arrived . They gathered information about the internal structure of the house from Mr PERSON \u2019s relatives , with a view to determining safe ways of approaching the house .", "CARDINAL . Around TIME the psychologists tried to make contact with Mr PERSON from a height situated at QUANTITY from the house , using a megaphone . As communication from such a distance was difficult , at the suggestion of the first applicant they advanced to CARDINAL or QUANTITY from the house . They tried to persuade PERSON to surrender . He requested to speak with his mother and his sister , but his request was denied . He then apparently said that if anyone was to get hurt , it would be him . As the psychologists believed that the first applicant would be able to exert a positive influence on Mr PERSON , they tried to continue the negotiations with his participation until TIME As Mr PERSON did not reply for TIME , they gave up . According to the first applicant , the reason for the discontinuation of the negotiations was the fact that the megaphone \u2019s battery had run out .", "CARDINAL . Around TIME the police decided to attack the house , because they believed that Mr PERSON had prepared a secret escape route and might try to flee . The head of the anti - terrorism squad split his men into CARDINAL groups . The first , consisting of CARDINAL officers , was to attack from the northwest , from high ground , and the second from the service buildings . The first group was moving in a column , with the first officer carrying a protective shield . They fired CARDINAL smoke bombs at the house , with a view to forcing PERSON out of it . However , as the windows and the doors were covered with linoleum , cardboard and blankets , most of the smoke bombs failed to penetrate . Mr PERSON started firing at the first group , and this forced them to take cover in a ditch . The head of the squad ordered the second group to fire at the house to divert Mr PERSON \u2019s attention and PERSON PERSON fired back at them . The skirmish lasted for TIME , after which both groups of officers retreated . At TIME the GPE police , who were hiding behind the pile of tyres , were also ordered to retreat to a safe distance .", "CARDINAL . After that the police tried to resume the negotiations . A group of officers and the first applicant advanced to CARDINAL from the house and invited Mr PERSON to continue negotiating . He did not reply and the police gave the megaphone to the first applicant , who called upon his father to surrender . Again , there was no reply . At that point the police saw that as a result of the earlier attack a room on the first floor of the house had caught fire . The psychologists and the first applicant then retreated . The first applicant shouted towards the house \u201c Father , please come out unarmed and surrender , so that this whole episode can be over \u201d , but his supplication went unanswered .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the head of the antiterrorism squad ordered his men to blow up holes in the walls of the house . They used stunt grenades . According to his later statements , this led to explosions and a short skirmish . According to the first applicant , after TIME Mr PERSON did not talk or shoot back at the police , or react to their attacks in any other way .", "CARDINAL . After that the head of the antiterrorist squad informed the Minister of ORG about the latest developments . The Minister called a halt to all actions pending the arrival of the Secretary General of ORG , general PERSON , on the spot . In the meantime , police vehicles were placed on a height facing the house , so as to shed light on the scene with their headlights .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary General arrived at CARDINAL or TIME and took command of the operation . He ordered the police to blow a hole in the walls of the house . The police carried out the order . According to a later statement by the Secretary General , after the first explosion there was a second one , coming from the upper levels . As a result , the roof caught fire and quickly burned down . Apparently several unsuccessful attempts were then made to enter the house , but it is unclear in what exactly they consisted . Meanwhile , an individual who had worked on the house and who had heard about the incident on the radio came to the police and told them that Mr PERSON had warned him that the house was booby - trapped .", "CARDINAL . Around TIME , on the orders of the Secretary General , a border police unit was called in to monitor the house and its surroundings with nightvision devices . The monitoring continued until TIME .", "CARDINAL . Later , following a discussion with other senior officers , the Secretary General ordered the police to use a rocket propelled grenade launcher , in order to diffuse any possible booby traps and speed up the search of the house . The launcher was brought at TIME on DATE , and given to the antiterrorism squad . CARDINAL TIME an officer of the squad fired CARDINAL rocket propelled grenades at the lower parts of the house and a room on the first floor , which made a big breach in the wall . It was decided to await daylight to attack .", "CARDINAL . DATE TIME the police formed a thick cordon around the house . They started entering the house and checking the ground and the first floor . When they reached the attic floor , using a fireladder , they saw the legs of Mr PERSON \u2019s charred body . The operation was then terminated , the house was sealed off , and the incident was reported to the military prosecuting authorities .", "CARDINAL . DATE , DATE , ORG opened an investigation into the above events . An investigator carried out an inspection of the scene of the incident and took photographs .", "CARDINAL . DATE , DATE , a doctor from the forensic ward of the PERSON hospital performed an autopsy on Mr PERSON \u2019s body . He noted the following :", "\u201c The body is split in CARDINAL and the vertebral column is severed at the fifth or the sixth vertebra . The body is as a whole charred . The configuration of the skull is intact . The hair is missing . There are remains of charred soft tissue on the calvaria and the face . The lower jaw is broken at the level of the right ramus mandibulae , with broken fragments and teeth . The skull bones are crumbly , charred . The configuration of the brain is intact , as if it has been parched . The brain tissue is not damaged and there are no haematomas in the cranial cavity . The skin at the neck is charred . Part of it , near the trachea and right part of the neck , is missing , which allows one to see the charred underlying neck muscles . The upper third of the thorax is preserved , but the soft tissue is fully charred . The lungs and the heart are still connected to their holders ; they have shrunk , they are parched and dry with charred surfaces and hard to cut . The surrounding tissue of the section has no visible structure . The liver , shrunk and charred , reduced in size and parched , lies beneath . The vertebral column is segmented at the level of the fifth or the sixth vertebra , and what remains of it , including the lumbar part , has charred vertebrae covered with remains of charred tissue . CARDINAL of the abdominal wall are missing . The pelvis , including the wings of the iliums , the ischium and the pubic bone , is broken into pieces . The symphysis is separated . Parts of the intestines , charred , and remains of fatty tissue were found inside the pelvic cavity . Limbs : the right arm is strongly flexed at the elbow joint ; the bones in the joint are apart . The wrist is flexed and the fist is clenched . A safetyloop from a hand grenade was found on the third finger , between the first and the second phalanges . The skin and the muscles of the hand are charred . The palm and CARDINAL of the forearm of the left hand are missing , and the remains have an uneven edge and are strongly flexed at the elbow joint . The soft tissue is charred . The skin and the muscles on the entire surface of the right thigh are charred . The skin on the front surface of the knee and on the front surface of the upper CARDINAL of the shank is preserved . The soft tissue on the back surface of the shank is charred to the bone , and the back surface of the heel is burned . The foot is encased in a [ militarytype ] shoe . One can see the remains of trousers and of woollen socks . The skin and the muscles of the left leg and of the thigh are charred . The left shank has been affected in the same way as the right one , with a [ militarytype ] shoe and a charred sock on . There are greyish metal pellets driven into the tissue and the bones of the pelvis area . CARDINAL such pellets were taken out of the left ilium and given to the investigator . We made Xrays of the body in the autopsy room ... On the images one can see ovalshaped foreign bodies with similar diameters driven into the tissue , mostly in the pelvis and the thorax . One can see a metal safetyloop attached to the third finger of the right hand . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the authorities interviewed all officers who had taken part in the operation : thirtynine officers from ORG , CARDINAL officers from ORG , CARDINAL officers from ORG , thirtyone officers from the special antiterrorism squad , CARDINAL border police officers , CARDINAL psychologists from ORG , and the Secretary General of ORG . They also interviewed the applicants and other eyewitnesses , and commissioned a number of expert reports .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator in charge of the case proposed that the prosecuting authorities discontinue the investigation . On DATE the ORG agreed to the proposal . It said that the investigation had categorically established that Mr PERSON \u2019s death had been due to the explosion of a hand grenade which he had himself detonated close to his body . No officers were responsible for that . The actions of the police had fully complied with the applicable rules and had been the only actions possible under the circumstances , in view of the resistance put up by PERSON and the fact that he had fired at them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought judicial review of the discontinuance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private , set the discontinuance aside and referred the case back for additional investigation . It noted that the investigation had failed to establish the exact time of PERSON death , which had prevented the prosecuting authorities from assessing fully the lawfulness of the actions of the police , including the use of explosives , smoke bombs and a grenade launcher . It went on to say that the prosecuting authorities had failed to analyse the evidence properly and give reasons why they believed that all actions of the police had been lawful . In particular , they had failed to give any reasons why they considered that the actions of the police after CARDINAL or TIME on DATE , including the firing of CARDINAL rocket propelled grenades , had been warranted , especially in view of the fact that the evidence showed that after that time Mr PERSON had not resisted or fired at the police . Lastly , it could not be categorically concluded that Mr PERSON \u2019s death had been caused by a hand grenade which he had had activated himself ; a number of other explosive devices had been used by the police .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , on DATE ORG sent the case back to the investigator , instructing him to ( a ) ask ballistics experts to identify all explosive devices which had been used , explain their mode of operation , and express their opinion on whether the smoke bombs fired at the house had been capable of creating a concentration of gases sufficient to cause the death of PERSON ; ( b ) seek the opinion of forensic and ballistics experts on the exact time of PERSON PERSON \u2019s death , on the origin of the metal fragments found in his body , and on whether the death had resulted from a hand grenade ; ( c ) interview again the participants in the operation and ask them why it had been deemed necessary to use a grenade launcher and other explosive devices at a time when PERSON had no longer been showing any signs of resistance ; ( d ) establish whether boobytraps had indeed been planted in or around the house ; and ( e ) identify the officers who had caused damage to the house and ascertain whether their actions had amounted to a criminal offence . It went on to note that Mr PERSON \u2019s heirs had not been given an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the materials in the case file , which had been a serious breach of the rules of procedure .", "CARDINAL . The investigator asked several experts to draw up the reports requested by the prosecuting authorities .", "CARDINAL . In a report drawn up on DATE an expert said that no devices which could be described as boobytraps had been found in PERSON PERSON \u2019s house or yard . CARDINAL fully operational defensive hand grenades had been found inside the house .", "CARDINAL . In their report , drawn up on DATE , the ballistics experts described the characteristics of the weapons and ammunition used during the operation or found on the spot ( PERSON assault rifle and ammunition for it , antitank rocket propelled grenades , teargas grenades , small wallblasting explosives , a defensive hand grenade ) , and said that the wall of the house had been demolished by the antitank rocket propelled grenades fired during the operation . They also said that from the materials in the case file it appeared that no teargas grenades had fallen inside the house , and that the concentration of any such gas in the room where PERSON PERSON had been standing had not been high enough to kill him .", "CARDINAL . The combined forensic and ballistics expert report , drawn up by a forensic doctor , an army weapons specialist and an expert in automatic weapons , became ready on DATE . It said that the complete charring of PERSON body prevented a medical determination of the time of his death . The explosive device which had killed him had been very close to his body at the moment of detonation , with the result that the body had suffered the impact of all components of the explosion : the detonation , the gases , parts of the explosive , soot , parts of the device \u2019s casing and fragments of it . Mr PERSON \u2019s body had been destroyed and had sustained deep burns , to the point of charring , and multiple wounds from the device \u2019s casing and filling . The metal fragments found inside the body showed that the device was a hand grenade , of the type used in the NORP army , consisting of a metal casing and , underneath it , plastic shells containing QUANTITY to CARDINAL pellets . All of those had impacted on Mr PERSON \u2019s body . The mechanism of the grenade and the force needed to pull its lever were such as to prevent accidental detonation , including detonation resulting from the closeby detonation of another device , which meant that Mr PERSON had been fully conscious of his actions when activating the grenade . He had thus blown himself up , as could be seen from the safetypin loop found on the third finger of his right hand . However , it was probable that the charring of his body was due to a secondary fire in the room , and had occurred after his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again decided to discontinue the investigation . It set out its findings of fact and the conclusions of the expert reports , and reasoned as follows :", "\u201c ... The initial steps taken by officers of ORG with a view to [ Mr ] PERSON \u2019s localisation and arrest were lawful . When he used firearms against them , they duly reported that to their superiors . They , in turn , lawfully decided to use firearms as a means of last resort , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of ORG [ DATE ] . As [ Mr ] PERSON refused to obey their order to surrender and continued to fire at them , it was lawful to bring in the antiterrorism squad . This was in line with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the [ Act ] and based on a decision of the Minister of ORG . The police were confronted with an individual who had committed numerous criminal acts and had numerous convictions and who , during an operation for his arrest to enforce a sentence ... , put up armed resistance . This was established on the basis of the statements made by the officers and by [ Mr ] PERSON \u2019s relatives . The fact that he fired upon the police is also confirmed by the bullet - hole in the left mudguard of [ a police car ] and the asbestos cement sheets placed outside the house .", "The steps taken by the officers of the [ antiterrorism ] squad after their arrival were also lawful . They were faced with an urgent special operation which required fast appraisal of the situation and decisionmaking . Their decisions were taken on the basis of the situation described above . After [ Mr ] PERSON failed to heed the advice of his relatives and the psychologists to turn himself in , it was lawful and in line with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the [ Act ] and regulations CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) to resort to the use of pyrotechnical devices and explosives . CARDINAL of the walls of the ground floor of the house was blown up with a view to storming it and making a passage to the inside . However , in view of the explanations of [ the individual who had worked on the house ] about booby traps in various unknown locations in and around the house and the darkness , the attack was postponed . It was only at that point that a decision was taken to use antitank grenades , in line with regulation ORG ) . The purpose was to diffuse any explosive devices and clear a passage for the storming party , which was supposed to attack in the morning . As a result of the firing of those grenades , part of the ground floor of the building was destroyed . When the goal had been achieved , the firing stopped . The attack began in TIME of DATE in order to protect the health and the lives of the police officers . Then they found the body of [ Mr ] PERSON .", "In this case , there was overt resistance by [ Mr ] PERSON and refusal to obey police orders . Also , before using weapons the police officers and the members of the antiterrorism squad considered the specific situation , the nature of [ Mr PERSON \u2019s ] act and [ his ] personality . They took all necessary safety measures and discontinued the use of weapons immediately after achieving their goal \u2013 opening a breach for the storming party .", "The actions of the officers would be criminal only if they were socially dangerous , committed with mens rea , and punishable ... The lack of any of those characteristics makes their actions not criminal . By LAW , it is not criminal to cause damage to a person who has committed an offence in order to effect his arrest and prevent him from committing further offences , if there is no other way to carry out the arrest and if the necessary and lawful measures are not exceeded . This equally fully applies to the house used by [ Mr ] PERSON as a shelter . Since there was no other way of entering it , it became necessary to demolish part of it . The available evidence shows that the actions of the police were not socially dangerous , but socially necessary , and , indeed , the only ones possible under the relevant provisions of ORG [ DATE ] and the regulations . Therefore , there has been no criminal offence . All exculpating circumstances under LAW are in place . ...", "Moreover , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG [ DATE ] , the identities of the members of the special antiterrorism squad are to be kept secret , which means that they can not be held criminally liable .", "The investigation categorically and unequivocally found that [ Mr ] PERSON \u2019s death was due to his blowing himself up with an offensive hand grenade which he detonated close to his body . No officers are responsible for that . No other offences committed by the officers in connection with the performance of their duties were established . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought judicial review of the discontinuance . They argued that not enough evidence had been gathered on the time and the causes of Mr PERSON \u2019s death , and that only experts in pathology would be able to give an informed opinion on those points . It was also hard to believe that Mr PERSON had blown himself up with a hand grenade . He was a righthander and the grenade safetyloop was found on a finger of his right hand , whereas it was highly unusual for someone to draw the safetyloop of a hand grenade with his strong hand and hold the grenade itself with his weak hand . The investigation had not done enough to elucidate that paradox , which was central to its conclusions . It was also incomprehensible how the experts , none of whom was a psychologist , were able to give an opinion about Mr PERSON \u2019s state of mind before his death . No explanation was provided about the type of explosives used at TIME on DATE to blow up the hole in the wall of the house . This seriously weakened the prosecutor \u2019s conclusion that the metal pellets found in PERSON body were from a hand grenade . After TIME on DATE the police were not acting in selfdefence because Mr PERSON had not fired any shots at them after that time . They clearly overstepped the limits set by LAW and did not try to contact him or arrest him without using force after that time . The conclusion that a grenade launcher was needed to diffuse possible booby traps could not withstand scrutiny . No such traps were found , and it was absurd to believe that trained police officers could suppose that such traps had been laid around a house whose yard was used by PERSON , his family and domestic animals . The police apparently only resorted to using a grenade launcher to speed up the operation . It was also telling that the names of the officers who ordered the use of a launcher were not mentioned in the prosecutor \u2019s decision . Lastly , the applicants pointed out that this ORG \u2019s caselaw under LAW required that there should be an effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private , decided to uphold the discontinuance in the following terms :", "\u201c ... After fully checking the materials in the case file , the court comes to the only possible conclusion , namely , that the decision to discontinue the proceedings was correct , wellfounded and lawful .", "The investigation was objective , all - inclusive and comprehensive . The investigating and the prosecuting authorities have taken all necessary steps to establish the truth . All circumstances surrounding the main fact \u2013 the cause of [ Mr ] PERSON \u2019s death DATE have been examined . The authorities have not committed serious breaches of the rules of procedure . The remitting of the case for additional investigation was a major factor in that respect . The prosecutor \u2019s conclusions are correct , wellfounded , not internally inconsistent , accurate and fully correspond to the evidence and the facts . To come to them , the prosecutor , along with an assessment of the available materials , has taken into account the constant caselaw of ORG and academic studies of criminal law .", "The prosecutor \u2019s conclusion that the proceedings should be discontinued corresponds to the totality of the evidence , which has been precisely analysed and assessed . The court finds that the prosecutor was right to conclude that the police were acting in a situation falling under LAW [ of LAW ] . They were aiming to arrest an individual who had committed an offence , and who had been convicted and sentenced by means of a final decision . He refused to obey their orders and put up fierce armed resistance . His actions consisted in an attack against the police that seriously endangered their lives . This leads to the incontestable and unequivocal conclusion that the police officers were acting in pursuance of their duties and that their actions were correct , lawful and adequate in a situation which was extreme , critical and gravely dangerous for their health and lives .", "The court fully shares the remaining conclusions of the prosecutor ... which it considers correct and accurate .", "On that basis , the court finds that the arguments raised in the application [ for judicial review ] are groundless and illfounded . Firstly , the arguments ... that the \u2018 prosecutor \u2019s findings about the time of death are unconvincing and solely based on the conclusions of the medical expert \u2019s PERSON ... are groundless . If the [ applicants\u2019 lawyers ] had bothered to acquaint themselves with [ the ] evidence ... , they would not have reached those conclusions . The prosecutor \u2019s findings about the causes and the time of [ Mr ] PERSON \u2019s death were based not only on the conclusions of the medical expert \u2019s report and the complex ballistics and medical experts\u2019 report , but also on the statements of all eyewitnesses . The lawyers should be aware that a fact , namely the time and the causes of death , can be established through all types of evidence allowed under the rules of criminal procedure , not solely expert reports . Since the PERSON conclusion , whose accuracy the court does not doubt , is supported by an abundance of other evidence , including eyewitness statements , the court finds this fact to be unequivocally established ... For that reason , the court finds that the time and the cause of [ Mr ] PERSON \u2019s death have been unequivocally established , and that this has been accurately described in the prosecutor \u2019s decision . The court therefore finds the [ applicants\u2019 ] arguments in that connection unfounded and not corresponding to the evidence in the case . For the same reasons , the court finds no force in the [ applicants\u2019 ] arguments relating to the lack of clarity of the prosecutor \u2019s decision about the type of expert report to be ordered by the investigator . The court reiterates that if the [ applicants\u2019 lawyers ] had read the complex medical and ballistics report , they would have understood this alleged lack of clarity ...", "The [ applicants\u2019 ] assertion relating to the \u2018 ORG and the \u2018 weak\u2019 hand of [ Mr PERSON ] is also groundless and lacking legal logic . The safetyloop from the detonator of a grenade , the specific dismemberment of the body in the middle ( near the stomach and the groins ) , and the remains of a defensive grenade ( pellets and fragments ) in the body lead to the only possible conclusion that [ Mr PERSON ] blew himself up in the way described in detail by the prosecutor ... This unequivocally proves that the grenade was not thrown , as asserted by the [ applicants ] , because if that were the case there would be no pieces of a detonated grenade on the body of [ Mr ] PERSON . The court finds whether [ Mr ] PERSON was right or lefthanded irrelevant and for this reason shall not engage in further discussion on that point .", "The complex medical and ballistics experts\u2019 report gave a conclusion about [ Mr ] ORG \u2019s psychological state at the time of his \u2018 self - detonation\u2019 , which the court finds accurate and corresponding to the evidence analysed by the experts . It is necessary to note that the \u2018 psychological\u2019 state of [ Mr ] PERSON has been analysed and assessed by the experts in the context of the grenade \u2019s specificity as a type of weapon , the particularities of its construction and the manner in which it needs to be handled and detonated . On that basis , the court finds no force in the [ applicants\u2019 ] argument concerning the mandatory participation of a psychologist in the elucidation of the above fact .", "The [ applicants\u2019 ] assertion that there is no explanation about types of explosives used again shows that [ their lawyers ] have not acquainted themselves with all the evidence . The court finds it illfounded and unsupported by any arguments .
