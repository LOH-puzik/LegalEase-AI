It held that a mere declaration by the applicant company in its founding memorandum of association was insufficient to enable it to become the successor of another company .

As to the merits of the case , the ORG upheld the finding that the applicant company was not entitled to claim succession to ORG \u201c LOC \u201d because there had been no decision on the latter 's conversion , and the applicant company itself had been created as a new entity and not as a result of any reorganisation of an existing legal person .
