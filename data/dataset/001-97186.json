On DATE , an association of model boat builders from ORG organised an international competition of radio - controlled model boats in the adjacent part of the same lake . The organisers of the CARDINAL events had arranged between themselves that no model boats would be on the lake QUANTITY when the triathlon competition was to take place .", "After TIME and prior to the start of the triathlon competition the applicant \u2019s son had a swim in the lake . A model boat belonging to a participant from GPE suddenly changed its trajectory after having touched a buoy demarcating the race circuit . It hit the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s head and spine . After his body was brought to shore by divers , a physician established that the applicant \u2019s son had suffered fatal head injuries .", "Later the same day police officers drew up reports on the accident and on the examination carried out on the spot . They further photographed the victim and drew up a record concerning the identification of the body . The police retained the model boat which had apparently hit the applicant \u2019s son and heard what its owner had to say . His replies were interpreted by the director of the model boat competition . A written report by the doctor who had examined the corpse was prepared on DATE . Several objects belonging to the victim were given to the applicant .", "On DATE the police in ORG appointed a forensic expert with a view to determining the cause of death of the applicant \u2019s son .", "On DATE the police concluded that there were no grounds for a criminal prosecution of the NORP owner of the boat . The responsibility for safety of the event lay with the club which had organised the competition . The boat owner could not be held responsible for the fact that a swimmer , who was not supposed to be in the area of the competition , had entered the raceway .", "The boat owner was allowed to return to GPE , but the police kept the model boat for the purpose of an examination by experts .", "In a preliminary report of CARDINAL DATE the forensic institute which had carried out an autopsy of the victim \u2019s corpse concluded that the fatal injury had been inflicted by an object which had fractured the victim \u2019s skull , concussed his cerebral tissue and caused bleeding in the brain chambers .", "DATE police officers interviewed QUANTITY persons with a view to establishing the relevant facts .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant consulted the police file and copies of several documents included in it were given to him .", "On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that the police had acted erroneously in that , inter alia , they had failed to accuse the owner of the model boat of an offence and to carry out an alcohol test on him . The applicant further expressed the view that the police had disregarded attempts by the organisers of the model boat race to distort the account of the events .", "In a letter of DATE a public prosecutor pointed out that , at that time , it had not been clearly shown whether the criminal liability for the accident lay with the NORP participant , the organisers or whether it was attributable to the behaviour of the applicant \u2019s son .", "On DATE the applicant complained to GPE ORG that the police had attempted to manipulate the investigation with a view to concealing the real cause of his son \u2019s death . On DATE GPE ORG replied to the applicant that his allegation was unsubstantiated .", "According to a forensic report submitted to the police on DATE , the applicant \u2019s son had drowned after a serious injury to the skull during a sporting activity performed in water . The injuries were so serious that death could not have been avoided , even if there had been immediate medical assistance .", "On DATE ORG of ORG informed the applicant that the police investigation had been supervised by a public prosecutor and that his complaint about misconduct of the policemen concerned was unsubstantiated .", "DATE police officers questioned CARDINAL people . On DATE a public prosecutor heard the director and an organiser of the triathlon competition .", "In a letter of DATE a public prosecutor instructed ORG of ORG to accuse the director of the model boats competition of having caused damage to another \u2019s health . The letter stated that all documents submitted by the applicant should be included in the file .", "On DATE ORG in GPE informed the applicant , in reply to his complaint , that the public prosecutor dealing with the case had concluded that the organisers of the model boat race had not complied with the statutory security measures , as a result of which his son had been fatally injured .", "On DATE a police investigator accused the director of the model boats competition of having caused injury to another \u2019s health . The director was accused of failing to take appropriate measures with a view to protecting the lives and health of other persons .", "In the course of DATE the investigator obtained information about the accused from several authorities and institutions .", "The investigator examined the accused from TIME to TIME on DATE . She heard the applicant from TIME on DATE . The applicant stated that he wished to join the proceedings as a civil party claiming compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "On DATE the director of the triathlon race was examined for TIME . Another person involved in organising the triathlon race was heard as a witness on DATE . Between CARDINAL DATE and DATE the investigator heard CARDINAL other witnesses .", "On DATE ORG dismissed a complaint by the accused against the decision to start criminal proceedings against him .", "DATE and DATE the police investigator examined CARDINAL witnesses .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant submitted his claim for damages as an injured party .", "In a report of DATE the police investigator indicated that the investigation could not be concluded within DATE as , inter alia , the public prosecutor supervising the proceedings had concluded that there was a need to hear the NORP competitor as a witness . For that purpose a request for legal assistance was to be sent quickly to the NORP authorities .", "Following his request of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant consulted the entire investigation file on DATE .", "On DATE the Bratislava III ORG submitted to ORG a translation of the request for legal assistance in obtaining a statement from the NORP boat owner . Subsequently the request was transmitted to the NORP authorities .", "In DATE and in DATE the investigator obtained further information about the accused .", "The NORP authorities heard the owner of the model boat in GPE on DATE . GPE ORG received their reply on CARDINAL DATE . A NORP translation of the statement was submitted to the police investigator on DATE .", "In his statement the model boat owner explained that , because of an obstacle , he had had to change the trajectory of his model when passing around a buoy demarcating the race area . After that , the model had come to a standstill . The competitor expressed the view that the race area had not been sufficiently secured . The organisers had warned visitors and requested them to abstain from swimming in the lake or approaching its shore . However , several persons had disregarded that warning . The witness further stated that he had drunk no alcoholic beverage before the race . There had been several kiosks around the lake where such beverages were being sold . Nobody had moved the buoys after the accident .", "During the course of the investigation the applicant complained of shortcomings to public prosecutors at several levels and to ORG . He alleged that the policemen involved had committed an offence and that no effective investigation had been carried out into the case .", "In particular , the applicant contended that the police had failed to inform him of his rights and about the procedure after the incident had occurred ; had not checked whether the persons involved had consumed alcohol ; had refused to record the applicant \u2019s statement ; that the first statement of the NORP participant had not been interpreted by an authorised interpreter , and that photographs had neither been taken nor drawings made of the scene of the incident . The failure to carry out an appropriate investigation at the outset had been , according to the applicant , the result of undue influence of members of a political party then in government who had acted as patrons of the model boat race .", "The applicant also maintained that the organisers of the race and divers involved had manipulated the scene of the accident , and complained that the model boat owner had not been prosecuted .", "The applicant \u2019s complaints were examined by several police and public prosecution authorities but they were dismissed as being wholly unsubstantiated . However , a public prosecutor of ORG admitted , in DATE , that the police had proceeded erroneously in that they had let the director of the competition interpret the NORP participant \u2019s statement on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant examined the police file concerning the case and obtained copies of the relevant documents . According to the record of the examination , the applicant declared that he had no proposals for further action to be taken within the preliminary proceedings", "On DATE a public prosecutor charged the director of the model boats race with causing injury to another \u2019s health before GPE ORG .", "ORG held hearings on DATE and DATE , and CARDINAL and DATE . On the last - mentioned date it convicted the accused of causing injury to health . It imposed an DATE prison sentence on him , conditionally suspended for DATE .", "At the main hearing the court heard the accused and the applicant , as well as CARDINAL witnesses . The statements of CARDINAL other persons were read out . The court also had regard to extensive documentary evidence including forensic reports .", "In his statement , the applicant affirmed that the area of the model boat race had not been duly secured . He accused the organisers of having manipulated the buoys after the incident . The applicant further referred to the NORP participant \u2019s statement according to which alcoholic beverages had been served at the place of the competition .", "ORG established that the accused , in his capacity as director of the model boat race , had acted negligently in that he had not taken appropriate measures , as required by sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , with a view to preventing injury to other persons present . In particular , the model boat race had continued despite the fact that there had been swimmers in the lake . Safety barriers had not been arranged in an appropriate manner in order to ensure that visitors were kept separate from the competition area .", "The applicant claimed CARDINAL NORP korunas ( SKK ) in compensation for damage from the accused . ORG found that the applicant had incontestably suffered damage of SKK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It awarded that sum to the applicant and referred him , with the remainder of his claim , to a civil court .", "The accused appealed , claiming that he had committed no offence .", "At the hearing before the appellate court , the applicant requested that the first - instance decision on his claim for damages be upheld .", "On DATE ORG varied the first - instance judgment , reducing the sentence to DATE imprisonment conditionally suspended for DATE . ORG held , in particular , that the sentence originally imposed was excessively severe as , inter alia , the accused was not the only person who was responsible for the accident . The appellate court expressed the view that other persons who had given authorisation for the CARDINAL events to be held concurrently without ensuring that appropriate safety measures were taken also bore responsibility for the accident .", "ORG further quashed the first - instance decision on the applicant \u2019s claim for damages . The appellate court noted that the sum awarded to the applicant had not been sufficiently specified and , more importantly , it was not clear whether the accused was liable for damage under the provisions of civil law or labour law . The determination of that issue depended on the legal status of the model builders\u2019 club of which the accused was a member . If the club was a part of ORG , that association was liable for the damage . In such a case the question arose as to whether ORG was not also liable . The appellate court held that the determination of those issues was beyond the scope of the criminal proceedings and that the applicant should bring his claim for damages before a civil court .", "The judgment became final on DATE . It was served on the applicant on DATE .", "In DATE the applicant sought assistance from ORG with a view to obtaining compensation for damage which he had suffered .", "In a letter of DATE a lawyer of that ORG informed the applicant that the model boat competition had been organised by the club from ORG , which was a legal person . In accordance with LAW , that club was liable for damage resulting from the criminal offence committed by its president when organising the competition . The applicant \u2019s claim against the latter had not interrupted the running of the statutory limitation period , which had therefore expired on DATE .", "The view was further expressed in the letter that , for similar reasons , the applicant \u2019s right to claim compensation for non - pecuniary damage under LAW had also lapsed on DATE .", "It was therefore no longer possible for the applicant to claim compensation before the civil courts .", "Since DATE the applicant has been treated as an outpatient for psychological trauma suffered as a result of his son \u2019s death .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s contract of employment was terminated . The applicant submitted that , as a result of the mental problems which he had been experiencing , he was no longer able to carry out his job .", "The Government contested that argument . Relying on the relevant document , they argued that the applicant \u2019s contract had been terminated for redundancy .", "In DATE the applicant was found to be fully disabled , CARDINAL of the reasons being his mental disorder .", "In DATE a physician confirmed that the applicant continued to suffer from severe depression . For that reason an expert commission confirmed , in DATE , that the applicant was still disabled .", "At the relevant time Law no .
