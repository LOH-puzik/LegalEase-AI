The applicant was born in DATE and is currently serving a prison sentence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an investigation was opened in respect of the applicant on suspicion of murder . He was remanded in custody during the investigation from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following his release from custody , the applicant became unavailable to the NORP authorities , and on DATE ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u GPE ) , as the competent trial court , ordered his trial in absentia .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him in absentia to MONEY imprisonment . The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge responsible for the execution of sentences at ORG ordered that the applicant should start to serve his prison sentence . Given that at the time the applicant was still at large , the judge ordered that a warrant be issued for his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the arrest warrant , the applicant was arrested in GPE and on DATE he was extradited to GPE , where he immediately started to serve his prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . DATE following his extradition , the applicant requested ORG to reopen the proceedings conducted in his absence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He relied on LAW , which provided for the automatic reopening of proceedings conducted in absentia at the request of the convicted person .", "CARDINAL . A CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request for reopening of the proceedings on CARDINAL DATE . The decision became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the applicant \u2019s prison sentence on the ground that the reopening of the proceedings had been granted and that therefore the execution of the sentence had to be stayed , as required under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the GPE State Attorney \u2019s ORG ( GPE dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u PERSON ) had requested ORG to order that the applicant be remanded in custody under LAW ) of LAW ( risk of absconding ) pending the retrial .", "CARDINAL . In connection with that request , on DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG heard the applicant and his lawyer . They argued , in particular , that the applicant had not sought to avoid trial and that his detention should be replaced by the application of a less restrictive measure , such as bail , which could be effected by the seizure of his mother \u2019s house and of documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the request of ORG and ordered the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention under LAW ) of LAW ( risk of absconding ) . The relevant part of the decision reads :", "\u201c Having considered the [ available ] evidence , this panel has found that the accused PERSON received an indictment [ from the competent prosecutor ] on DATE ... , that the GPE - baranja ORG informed ORG that the accused PERSON was absent from his place of residence [ in GPE ] as he had gone away in DATE and was [ at the time ] allegedly in GPE , as stated by his mother . Furthermore , it was established that the accused PERSON had been found guilty by the above - mentioned final judgment of ORG of the offence of murder ... for which he had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment . It was also established that the accused PERSON ... had been arrested [ in GPE and GPE ] because a sentence - execution judge of this court ordered that he should start to serve his prison sentence , and therefore the objection that the general conditions for ordering detention under LAW have not been met is unfounded . The final judgment adopted in the criminal proceedings conducted in the absence of the accused , by which he was found guilty on charges of murder and sentenced to DATE imprisonment , represents a reasonable suspicion that the accused PERSON committed the offence of murder ... The fact that he fled , given that the order for his pre - trial detention and the arrest warrant remained futile and there was no possibility for the police to bring him [ before the court ] for a hearing , and that he was arrested only on the basis of [ an arrest warrant ] for the execution of the prison term to which he had been sentenced , suggests the existence of grounds for ordering pre - trial detention under LAW ) of LAW ; that is to say , special grounds justifying a risk that , if at large , the accused might abscond and thus hinder the proper conduct of these criminal proceedings .", "...", "As already stated above , the accused PERSON received the mentioned indictment by which he is charged with murder ... It follows [ from the case file ] that he was also detained . This suggests that the accused knew that the criminal proceedings at issue had been pending against him and that he had been charged with a serious criminal offence . He [ nevertheless ] left his residence and the territory of GPE and was arrested on the territory of a country where he did not have residence , namely GPE , while he himself stated that he had residence in GPE . All these circumstances as well suggest that there is a risk that the accused might again abscond and thereby hinder the termination of the reopened proceedings at issue .", "In addition , as the panel of this court has found that the conditions for ordering detention in respect of the accused PERSON under LAW ) of LAW have been met , [ it considers that ] the measure of detention is necessary in order to avert the risk of absconding , which could not be achieved by bail or the alternative measures suggested by the accused and his defence lawyer . This is particularly true given the circumstances and severity of the offence at issue , and the fact that [ the accused ] is also a national of GPE and that he himself stated that he had no residence in GPE , which means that he could very easily leave the territory of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) , arguing that the indictment had not been served on him but on his brother , who had been a minor at the time , and that he had left GPE for personal reasons . He offered his NORP and NORP passports and his mother \u2019s house in GPE as bail to guarantee that he would not abscond . The applicant also contended that the decision of ORG lacked the relevant reasoning concerning the possibility of his conditional release .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded on DATE . The relevant part of the decision reads :", "\u201c Contrary to the appeal arguments , ORG as the second - instance court finds that the first - instance court correctly established that the defendant should be remanded in custody under LAW ) of LAW .", "Reasonable suspicion that the defendant committed the offence [ of murder ] follows from the final judgment by which he was found guilty and sentenced to DATE imprisonment , which had been adopted after a trial in absentia and in respect of which a retrial was granted . The general requirement for detention has therefore been met .", "Furthermore , it should be noted that the defendant , although aware that criminal proceedings were pending against him ( he was questioned by an investigating judge , he was detained from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , and he received the indictment ) , left the territory of GPE and thereby became unavailable during the proceedings conducted before ORG . He was arrested only after a sentence - execution judge issued an order for his arrest for the execution of the prison sentence , and [ the arrest ] was effected on the basis of an international arrest warrant in GPE , although he stated that his residence was in GPE .", "All these circumstances , in the view of ORG as the second - instance court , suggest that there is a fear that the defendant , who is also a national of GPE , if at large , could abscond and thereby hinder the course of the criminal proceedings . This in particular follows from his previous behaviour , the fact that he was unavailable to the judicial authorities for DATE and that he is again being tried for a serious criminal offence for which he had been found guilty in absentia and sentenced to DATE imprisonment ...", "The appeal arguments of the defendant that he did not know that the criminal proceedings at issue were pending as he had not received the indictment are unfounded because the material from the case file suggests the opposite . The case file contains signed delivery notices which demonstrate that he duly received the indictment . He was also questioned before an investigating judge concerning the offence of which he was later found guilty , and for which he had also spent some time in pre - trial detention . There is therefore no doubt that he knew about the criminal proceedings pending against him .", "Moreover , the appellant is wrong in contending that a fundamental procedural omission occurred in that the impugned decision is not sufficiently reasoned in respect of the possibility of applying bail or some other alternative measure . The first - instance court provided sufficient and clear reasons for considering it necessary to order pre - trial detention under LAW ) of LAW and why the same purpose could not be achieved by bail or any other alternative measure ; and this second - instance court fully endorses those reasons . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again requested that his pre - trial detention be replaced by bail or an alternative less restrictive measure . At the hearing held on DATE he reiterated his request .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request on DATE and extended his detention under LAW ) of LAW ( risk of absconding ) , reiterating its previous reasoning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a retrial , ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction in absentia , finding him guilty of the offence of murder and sentencing him to DATE imprisonment . It was also decided on DATE that the applicant should remain in detention pending a final judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment to ORG . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment and remitted the case to ORG for re - examination on the grounds of the existence of procedural flaws .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention under LAW ) of LAW ( risk of absconding ) , reiterating its previous reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) , challenging the decision on his pre - trial detention . He argued in particular , his detention was disproportionate and should be replaced by bail or an alternative less restrictive preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint as ill - founded , endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts . That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having reheard the case , ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction in absentia , finding him guilty of the offence of murder and sentencing him to DATE imprisonment . The applicant was remanded in custody pending a final judgment .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE and it thereby became final . On DATE the applicant challenged it before ORG and the proceedings before that court are still pending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
