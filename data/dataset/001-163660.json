The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant cohabited with another man in a homosexual relationship from DATE until the latter \u2019s death on DATE . During that period they lived together in an apartment belonging to the applicant \u2019s partner . When his partner died , the sister and only heir of the applicant \u2019s partner gave the applicant , because of the relationship he had had with her brother , an apartment that had belonged to the applicant \u2019s late partner and in which the couple had spent their holidays together since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed social security allowances as a surviving spouse , under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , arguing that he had cohabited with his deceased partner for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Instituto Nacional de la Seguridad Social , hereafter referred to as \u201c LOC \u201d ) refused to grant the applicant a survivor \u2019s pension on the ground that since he had not been married to the deceased person , he could not legally be considered as his surviving spouse for the purposes of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG . That decision was formally served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Law no . CARDINAL amending the provisions of LAW with respect to the right to enter into marriage was passed . DATE it entered into force . This law legalised same - sex marriage in GPE . In accordance with its first additional provision all legal and regulatory provisions making reference to marriage should be understood thereafter as applicable to all marriages irrespective of the sex of its members ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an administrative complaint against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . This complaint was dismissed by the ORG on DATE . The ORG noted that there was no provision in the legislation in force that allowed , for the purposes of social security rights , the person who had been cohabiting with the deceased to gain the status of a widower .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged that decision before ORG no . CARDINAL ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled for the applicant . ORG firstly outlined that the facts of the case had to be assessed in the light of the newly enacted PERSON no . PERSON , which was already in force and deemed constitutional by the tribunal . As to the merits , ORG observed that the issue at stake was whether the applicant , as the surviving partner of a same - sex relationship that ended ( following his partner \u2019s death ) before the entry into force of PERSON no . DATE , had the right to a survivor \u2019s pension . ORG then reiterated that , according to the well - established domestic case - law , surviving partners of unmarried couples were not entitled to a survivor \u2019s pension under section CARDINAL of ORG , marriage being a constitutive element to access any such social - security benefit ; that the applicant had been prevented from marrying his partner because same - sex marriage had not been recognised in domestic law at the time his partner died ; that the social security administration had relied on the fact that the couple had not married to refuse the applicant a survivor \u2019s pension ; and that it was evident that after the entry into force of PERSON no . PERSON , surviving spouses of same - sex marriages were entitled to survivors\u2019 pensions on the same footing as survivors of different - sex marriages .", "CARDINAL . ORG was of the view that the solution to the legal issue raised by the applicant \u2019s case depended on whether it could be inferred from PERSON no . CARDINAL that ORG \u2019s intention had been that surviving partners of same - sex couples who had been prevented from marrying under the former legislation could access a survivor \u2019s pension on a similar footing to same - sex couples who could marry after the entering into force of that LAW . ORG drew attention in this regard to the provisions and the explanatory memorandum of PERSON no . PERSON to contend that this new legislation had a very strong egalitarian purpose , and that from the date it entered into force , that is to say DATE , all legal provisions concerning marriage should be interpreted on the basis of the first additional provision of PERSON no . CARDINAL as applying fully to same - sex marriage ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG held in this regard that :", "\u201c This is a wide - ranging provision which affects all the other provisions of the legal system making reference to marriage . From now onwards all references to marriage established in the law shall be understood as applying also to marriage celebrated CARDINAL persons of the same sex . Accordingly , whoever shall be called to interpret or apply any marriage - related provision should do so in egalitarian terms without taking into consideration whether the spouses are of the same or different sex \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG further recalled that additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE amending the provisions of LAW pertaining to marriage and the procedure to be followed for cases of annulment , judicial separation and divorce , recognised the right to obtain a survivor \u2019s pension for individuals who had been prevented from marrying a person who later died by the legislation in force until then , provided that he or she had cohabited in a relationship similar to marriage with the deceased person and that the deceased had died before PERSON no . CARDINAL entered into force .", "CARDINAL . ORG stressed that such a provision was included in order to provide a solution for those cohabiting couples consisting of a man and a woman who could not have married under the legislation in force until that time , and thus did not qualify for a survivor \u2019s pension , because CARDINAL or even both of them had still been married to another person whom they had been prevented from divorcing , divorce having been legally impossible in GPE until the passing of PERSON no . CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s circumstances were \u201c fully comparable \u201d to those outlined in additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL in so far as :", "\u201c - the claimant could not marry his partner because the legislation then in force prevented him from doing so ;", "- the claimant had shared a marital life with his partner until the latter \u2019s death ;", "- the latter \u2019s death had taken place before the entry into force of PERSON no . CARDINAL \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG acknowledged , however , that whereas PERSON no . CARDINAL was aimed at protecting the rights of those cohabiting heterosexual couples who were prevented from marrying because divorce was prohibited at the time , PERSON no . PERSON was aimed at protecting the rights of those who could not marry on account of their sexual orientation , and that this distinction was the main impediment to the recognition of the applicant \u2019s right to a survivor \u2019s pension .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered nonetheless that treating these CARDINAL groups differently would not be in harmony with the strong egalitarian intention expressed by ORG with the passing of PERSON no . PERSON and that , accordingly , additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL was applicable to the applicant by force of additional provision no . CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL . ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c Therefore , the interpretation that in my opinion better fits the legislature \u2019s intention is the following :", "- If the first additional provision of PERSON no . PERSON sets out that provisions making reference to marriage shall apply irrespective of the sex of the spouses ,", "- And CARDINAL of [ these provisions ] , currently in force to provide access to a survivor \u2019s pension , is additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL .", "- The only method to apply it in a way which is consistent with the egalitarian intention of the legislature is to do so irrespective of the sexual orientation of the members of the cohabiting couple .", "- In order to ensure that sexual orientation does not constitute discriminatory grounds in the application of additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL , the right thereby recognised shall currently be interpreted as providing a solution to factual situations such as the one in the instant case in which the impediment to access to a survivor \u2019s pension is no other than the sexual orientation [ of the claimant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the administration \u2019s submission that in the area of social security benefits the governing principle was that of non - retroactivity of laws and that according to the law in force at the time the applicant \u2019s partner died the former did not qualify for a survivor \u2019s pension because they were not married , ORG was of the view that this general principle was not absolute and that it did not apply where there was a specific rule giving retroactive effect to laws more favourable to the citizens , as is true of the instant case . Thus , additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG should be read in the light of the first additional provision of PERSON no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to the degree of retroactivity that should be given to additional provision CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL in the applicant \u2019s case , ORG relied on the constitutive effects of PERSON no . PERSON which created new rights and was effective only from the date it entered into force . Accordingly , ORG recognised the applicant \u2019s right to be awarded a survivor \u2019s pension with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The LOC and the ORG General of ORG appealed ( recurso de suplicaci\u00f3n ) against that judgment to ORG ( Tribunal Superior de Justicia ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the appeal and reversed the first - instance judgment . The court found that the legislature had not intended PERSON no . PERSON to cover same - sex partnerships which had been ended by the death of CARDINAL of the partners before said law had entered into force and that the lack of protection of these unions could not be considered discriminatory in the light of Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . For the court , it was only as from the entry into force of PERSON no . CARDINAL that marriage between same - sex couples was recognised and that this law affected other rights for those persons who would wish to marry thereafter . Hence , the court was of the view that PERSON no . PERSON had no retroactive effects , except as otherwise expressly provided , which was not the case at hand .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court further stated that even though PERSON no . PERSON had been inspired by the constitutional principle of equality , prior legislation preventing same - sex marriage could not be deemed unconstitutional as contrary to either any constitutional principle or to the right not to be discriminated against . The court referred to constitutional case - law dating from DATE according to which the requisite of heterosexuality for the purposes of marriage was fully constitutional and that it was within the margin of appreciation of the public authorities to treat heterosexual marriages more favourably than homosexual partnerships . In this connection , the court maintained that despite the reference in the preamble of PERSON no . PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to the discriminatory treatment to which homosexuals had traditionally been subjected on account of their sexual orientation , the aim of ORG in passing that law was merely to respond to a new social reality and award homosexuals the right to marry , but not to protect same - sex partnerships which had already ended before its enactment .", "CARDINAL . The court referred to constitutional case - law according to which a difference in legal treatment of individuals due to subsequent changes in the law does not necessarily entail discrimination , even if those persons could be said to be in similar circumstances . Given the complexity that a change in legislation might involve , it was for ORG to establish the characteristics of the legal transition , either by introducing retroactivity clauses or by restricting the application of the new legislation to circumstances arising after its entry into force .", "CARDINAL . The court noted in this regard that PERSON no . PERSON had not included any provision concerning same - sex partnerships which had already ended at the time of its entry into force and that it strictly concerned same - sex couples still in existence at that time and who would be willing to enter into marriage . The court considered that the difference between the situations before and after the passing of PERSON no . PERSON was essentially an expression of the principle of succession of laws without constitutional implications as regards the right not to be discriminated against .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicability to the present case of additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL , ORG found that this provision was not applicable to the applicant \u2019s case for CARDINAL main reasons . Firstly , that provision could not be considered as among the provisions to which the first additional provision of PERSON no . CARDINAL referred . Additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) was , as ORG had established , of a provisional or transitory nature and had been envisaged for those specific cases in which CARDINAL of the partners had died before the entry into force of Law no . CARDINAL . It had not been intended to govern future situations . Secondly , that provision had been envisaged for a totally different situation from that of the applicant . Additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL was aimed at guaranteeing a survivor \u2019s pension to those heterosexuals who had been prevented from marrying their out - of wedlock partner because divorce had not been legal at the time of the latter \u2019s death . The inability to remarry for those affected by additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL was based on the fact that divorce was not permitted at the time . The institution of marriage was open to them in their capacity as heterosexuals . On the contrary , same - sex couples were absolutely prevented from marrying before PERSON no . PERSON since the institution of marriage was until then restricted to heterosexual couples .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court contended that the applicant could never have fulfilled the more uxorio marital cohabitation requirement established by additional provision no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/ DATE of , because only those who were in principle eligible for marriage but had been prevented from marrying for whatever reason could qualify for de facto marital cohabitation . The applicant and his partner could have never cohabited \u201c as if married \u201d before the entry into force of Law no . CARDINAL , because before then they were ineligible for marriage as they were both male .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law seeking harmonisation of the case - law ( recurso de casaci\u00f3n para la unificaci\u00f3n de doctrina ) . In a decision of DATE , ORG ) declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that the decision produced for purposes of comparison , specifically a judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE , was not relevant . That decision was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Relying on Articles CARDINAL ( principle of equality and prohibition of discrimination ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( right to effective judicial protection ) , the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , served on CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the appeal inadmissible on the grounds that the applicant had failed to substantiate the special constitutional relevance of his complaints ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
