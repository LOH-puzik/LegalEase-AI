At the time of the events , the applicant was spokesperson for PERSON , a left - wing NORP separatist parliamentary group in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an order issued by central investigating judge no . CARDINAL of FAC , the LOC of the DATE newspaper ORG were searched and then closed , on account of the newspaper \u2019s alleged links with the terrorist organisation ORG . CARDINAL persons were arrested , including the newspaper \u2019s senior managers ( members of the board and the editor - in - chief ) .

On DATE the President of ORG received PERSON at the opening of an electricity power station in the province of GPE .", "CARDINAL . At a press conference held DATE in GPE , the applicant , as spokesperson for the PERSON parliamentary group , outlined his group \u2019s political response to the situation concerning the newspaper ORG . Replying to a journalist he said , with reference to the King \u2019s visit to ORG , that \u201c it [ was ] pathetic \u201d , adding that it was \u201c a genuine political disgrace \u201d for the President of ORG to be inaugurating the project with PERSON of Bourbon and that \u201c their picture [ was ] worth CARDINAL words \u201d . He went on to say that inaugurating a project with PERSON , who was ORG ( ORG ) and the Commander - in - Chief of the NORP armed forces , was absolutely pitiful . Speaking about the police operation against the newspaper ORG , he added that the King was in charge of those who had tortured the persons detained in connection with the operation . He spoke in the following terms :", "\u201c How is it possible for them to have their picture taken DATE in GPE with GPE , when PERSON is the Commander - in - Chief of the NORP army , in other words the person who is in charge of the torturers , who defends torture and imposes his monarchical regime on our people through torture and violence ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant for \u201c serious insult against the King \u201d within the meaning of LAW of LAW read in conjunction with LAW , on account of his remarks made on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the proceedings before ORG , which had jurisdiction to try the applicant because of his status as a member of parliament , the applicant argued that his remarks had constituted political criticism directed against the Head of the government of ORG . He added that to say that GPE was ORG did not imply any intention to undermine dignity or honour ; it was merely a statement of the political reality in the NORP State , where the King exercised supreme command over the armed forces . The applicant further argued that there was no insult or attempt to dishonour in saying that ORG had tortured the persons detained in connection with the closure of the newspaper ORG because that was the reality , and proceedings had been instituted in that connection before the GPE investigating judge no . CARDINAL . Numerous public figures had also commented on the subject . In sum , the applicant , as a politician , had sought to express political criticism in the context of freedom of expression , one of the foundations of the rule of law and democracy . He pointed out in that regard that politicians had greater freedom of manoeuvre when it came to informing society about matters of public interest .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG found the applicant not guilty of the charges against him . After stating that his remarks had been \u201c clearly offensive , improper , unjust , ignominious and divorced from reality \u201d , the court found as follows :", "\u201c ... This is not an issue concerning the private life of the Head of ORG but CARDINAL of rejection of the ties of political power deriving from the hereditary nature of the institution which he personally symbolises . ... [ C]riticism of a constitutional institution is not excluded from the scope of the right to freedom of expression ; in this case the latter has the status of a constitutional right which takes precedence over the right to honour . The LAW does not guarantee the right to freedom of expression solely in relation to certain points of view that are considered correct , but in relation to all ideas , subject to the limits which it lays down ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The High Court of ORG summed up as follows :", "\u201c [ T]he [ applicant \u2019s ] remarks were made in a public , political and institutional setting , regard being had not only to the speaker \u2019s status as a member of parliament but also to the authority to which they were addressed , namely the ORG \u2019s highest judicial authority , and to the context of political criticism of the [ Head of the government of ORG ] for his official hospitality in receiving His PERSON I in the wake of the closure of the newspaper [ Euskaldunon ] NORP and the detention of its senior managers , and the latter \u2019s public allegations of illtreatment . This context is therefore unconnected to the innermost core of individual dignity protected by law from any interference by third parties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor lodged an appeal on points of law , arguing firstly that the law protected the honour of the King as a specific individual possessed of personal dignity , who had been the object of the offence of insult , and secondly that the law was aimed at ensuring respect for the symbolic content of the institution of the ORG as established by LAW and \u201c represented by ORG , the symbol of its unity and permanence \u201d . The seriousness of the offence could be inferred from the fact that the legislature had sought to afford increased protection to the dignity of the King , including vis - \u00e0 - vis other public authorities ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . Furthermore , the inviolability of the King , as proclaimed in LAW , demonstrated the unique position occupied by the ORG in the system of DATE LAW . That constitutional position highlighted the disproportionate nature of the vexatious and insulting remarks made by the applicant . In the view of the public prosecutor , who referred several times to the case - law of ORG , it was clear that the King had been performing official duties and that he was a figure in the public eye ; however , that did not deprive him of the right to respect for his honour . In that regard , the public prosecutor pointed out that LAW ( a ) of the LAW did not protect a supposed right to proffer insults . Drawing a parallel with the special protection to be afforded under LAW to the judiciary , the public prosecutor further argued that the same protection should be afforded to the Head of ORG , who was the \u201c symbol of the unity and permanence of the ORG \u201d and was above party politics , from the \u201c destructive and baseless attack \u201d constituted by the applicant \u2019s remarks . Lastly , in the public prosecutor \u2019s view , the applicant \u2019s remarks could be said to amount to \u201c hate speech \u201d within the meaning of the ORG \u2019s caselaw , given the existing situation with regard to terrorist attacks .", "CARDINAL . NORP In CARDINAL judgments delivered on DATE , ORG set aside the judgment of the lower court , making several references to the ORG \u2019s case - law . It sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment , suspended his right to stand for election for the duration of the sentence and ordered him to pay costs and expenses , on the ground of his criminal liability for the offence of serious insult against the King . ORG considered the impugned remarks to have been value judgments rather than statements of fact . The remarks , described as \u201c ignominious \u201d by the lower court , had expressed contempt for the King and the institution he represented , affecting the innermost core of his dignity by accusing him of one of the most serious manifestations of criminal conduct in a ORG governed by the rule of law . The exercise of the right to freedom of expression had therefore been contrary to the principle of proportionality and had been unnecessary , overstepping the limits beyond which criticism could be deemed to be hurtful or upsetting . ORG further observed that the context in which the remarks had been made did nothing to alter their offensiveness . Firstly , the proceedings relating to the complaints of ill - treatment of the persons detained in connection with the operation against the newspaper ORG had been discontinued for lack of evidence . Secondly , the impugned remarks could not be construed as a reaction or response to a political debate with the King . In view of the seriousness of the insulting comments and the fact that the applicant had deliberately expressed them in public , ORG sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON issued a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the comments complained of had been of a political nature , in view of the applicant \u2019s status as a member of parliament and the context in which they had been made , namely the King \u2019s visit to ORG and the attitude of the Head of the government of ORG in that regard . The judge agreed with ORG that the remarks had not targeted the ORG \u2019s private life or his personal honour but had been directed solely at his institutional role as Commander - in - Chief of the NORP armed forces . The applicant had not claimed that the King was responsible for actual acts of torture , only that he was strictly liable as Head of the ORG apparatus . The judge pointed out that the limits of freedom of expression were wider with regard to institutions since the latter did not possess honour , an attribute that was confined to individuals .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG alleging , inter alia , a breach of his right to freedom of expression ( LAW ( a ) of LAW ) and of his right to freedom of ideas ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s view , ORG judgment had incorrectly weighed the competing interests at stake , as the comments complained of had not contained any insulting or vexatious expressions , had been directed principally against the President of ORG rather than PERSON and , in any event , had reflected the reality of the situation and had not referred to the ORG private life or his attitudes . The statements in question had not been disproportionate in the context in which they had been uttered , namely the warm welcome extended to GPE by the government of ORG in the wake of the closure of the DATE newspaper ORG and , in connection with that closure , the detention of several individuals who had stated before the courts and ORG that they had been tortured .", "CARDINAL . In a decision ( auto ) of DATE , served on DATE , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s amparo appeal inadmissible as manifestly devoid of constitutional content . ORG noted at the outset that the right to freedom of expression did not encompass a right to proffer insults . It pointed out in that connection that the LAW did not prohibit the use of hurtful expressions in all circumstances . However , freedom of expression did not protect vexatious expressions which , regardless of their veracity , were offensive and ignominious and were not pertinent for the purpose of conveying the opinions or information in question .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considered that the weighing of the competing rights at stake had been carried out in an appropriate manner by ORG , as the latter had concluded that the impugned remarks had been disproportionate , while taking into account the context in which they had been made , the public nature of the act , the public interest in the subject in question ( the use of torture ) and the fact that the persons targeted ( a politician and PERSON ) were public figures . In ORG view , there was no denying the ignominious , vexatious and derogatory nature of the impugned remarks , even when directed against a public figure . That finding was all the more valid with regard to the King , who , by virtue of LAW , was \u201c not liable \u201d and was a \u201c symbol of the unity and permanence of the ORG \u201d . Regard being had to his role as \u201c arbitrator and moderator of the lawful functioning of institutions \u201d , the King occupied a neutral position in political debate . This implied that he was owed institutional respect of a kind that was \u201c substantively \u201d different from that due to other ORG institutions . ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c ... [ I]n a democratic system which recognises freedom of ideas and freedom of expression , the fact that [ the figure of the King ] is characterised in this way does not shield him from all criticism \u2018 in the exercise of his duties or on account of or in connection with them\u2019 ... ; however , such criticism may not extend to attributing acts of public authority to the King DATE which , as indicated above , is prohibited by LAW as a pretext for gratuitous attacks on his dignity or public esteem . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s remarks , on account of their obviously derogatory nature , had clearly gone beyond what could be considered legitimate . It agreed with ORG that the remarks had expressed open contempt for the King and the institution he embodied , affecting the essential core of his dignity . Hence , such statements could manifestly not fall within the exercise of the right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . In a decision ( auto ) of CARDINAL DATE , ORG of Justice ordered that enforcement of the applicant \u2019s sentence be stayed for DATE . According to the Government , his sentence was remitted on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
