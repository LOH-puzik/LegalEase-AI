For the meeting of ORG ( PERSON ) of DATE , PERSON , the official dealing with financial matters at the material time , prepared a motion inviting ORG to nominate specific persons to the corporation 's supervisory board .", "CARDINAL . He retracted this motion before the meeting as , at the request of PERSON PERSON , Regional Governor ( PERSON ) of PERSON , he had received a legal expert opinion issued by the expert PERSON According to this opinion , GPE had no right to nominate the members of the ORG supervisory board as the members had to be elected . The representative of GPE could propose candidates and exercise the voting right in the general meeting of the KELAG without a prior decision by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON had further informed Mr GPE that ORG dealing with constitutional matters at ORG had approved this way of proceeding . Mr PERSON further commissioned an expert opinion by ORG .

NORP This expert opinion came to the conclusion that the election of the supervisory board of the KELAG by the Regional Governor without a previous decision by ORG was not in accordance with federal constitutional law , regional constitutional law and ORG Rules of Procedure . The opinion finally mentioned the possibility of impeachment of members of ORG before ORG by majority vote of ORG ) under LAW ( Bundes - Verfassungsgesetz ) for having culpably breached the law . ORG decision in impeachment proceedings consisted of either the exoneration of the official in question or a finding against him or her which implied dismissal of the person from office . The possibility for ORG to limit its judgment in the event of minor infringements to a finding that there has been a breach of the law would not exist in the present case as impeachment had to be filed under LAW CARDINAL lit d which did not provide for this alternative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company published an article on its front page of \u201c Der Standard \u201d which read as follows :", "\u201c PERSON has breached the LAW", "According to an expert opinion commissioned by the SP\u00d6 at FAC , the Regional Governor PERSON has committed a ' breach of law ' when appointing the supervisory board of the ORG . His handling of ORG Rules of Procedure would be ' illicit , illegal and unconstitutional ' . The ORG [ ORG ] nevertheless does not want to support an impeachment . It invites PERSON to correct the KELAG decisions concerning the personnel , which the ORG [ ORG ] categorical refuses : ' We refuse to be blackmailed ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article continued on page CARDINAL under the same heading with the subtitle : \u201c Expert opinion of professor in GPE accuses the Regional Governor of deliberate misguidance \u201d . It stated as follows :", "\u201c The NORP Regional Governor , PERSON , by acting on his own when appointing the members of the ORG supervisory board , has clearly committed a ' breach of the laws and LAW . This is the conclusion reached by A.S [ name in full ] , professor at ORG , in his expert opinion on constitutional matters which had been commissioned by the NORP SP\u00d6 . PERSON , by acting on his own authority , has violated ORG and has , thus , breached the law and LAW . The expert opinion mentions as an aggravating factor that PERSON has ' deliberately mislead ORG and ignored LAW and ORG Rules of Procedure ' . According to the expert opinion it is therefore possible to institute impeachment proceedings against PERSON . If ORG convicted PERSON , he would be threatened with dismissal from office . The ORG leader PERSON has now given Mr PERSON an ultimatum : either the supervisory board should be appointed afresh by ORG as a whole or there should be a tripartite agreement on transforming PERSON into a holding company . Otherwise , the ORG would institute impeachment proceedings against Mr PERSON before the elections to ORG . Mr PERSON also called on the \u00d6VP not to ' cover up ' Mr PERSON 's breach of the law . In ORG the ORG reacted vehemently to the report . The leader of the ORG 's parliamentary group , PERSON , announced that a second opinion would be commissioned . Mr PERSON himself could not hide his anxiety . He leaned back in a relaxed fashion only when the leader of the ORG 's parliamentary group , PERSON , made clear that the ORG would not support his impeachment . Although the ORG intends to await the findings of an ' independent ' expert opinion , PERSON nonetheless hinted at the party 's strategy : ' Not punishment but rectification of PERSON 's breach of the law . ' In so doing , he both foiled his colleague PERSON and confirmed the viewpoint that there is a ' tacit coalition ' between the ORG and the ORG . '", "CARDINAL . The article was followed by a further text in a small box headed \u201c [ The ] LAW stands above stock corporation law \u201d ( LAW steht \u00fcber FAC ) . This text explained that PERSON had prepared an act of Government ( PERSON ) which Mr PERSON had , however , retracted as being an \u201c error \u201d . The expert opinion had found that this conduct amounted to deliberate misguidance of ORG . The article further stated that the expert GPE did not accept Mr PERSON 's reference to stock corporation law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON instituted proceedings for forfeiture ( GPE ) of the article and publication of the judgment under LAW of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the article at issue , by stating that Mr PERSON had deliberately mislead ORG and had acted in breach of ORG Rule of Procedure and LAW , fulfilled the elements of the offence of defamation ( \u00fcble GPE ) under LAW ) . It , therefore , ordered the applicant company to black out the impugned statements in the issues still to be disseminated and the publication of the judgment under sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW . It further ordered the applicant company to pay the costs of Mr PERSON 's counsel .", "CARDINAL . At the trial the court heard the counsel of the applicant company , Mr PERSON and PERSON GPE . It dismissed the applicant company 's request to hear all other members of ORG as being irrelevant for the proceedings at issue .", "CARDINAL . The court considered the statements that Mr PERSON had breached the LAW , had deliberately mislead ORG and had acted in breach of the law as statements of fact for which the applicant company had failed to supply sufficient proof . The court noted that there was , in particular , nothing to indicate that Mr PERSON had deliberately misled ORG which , in itself , was a sufficient reason for the ordered forfeiture . The fact whether or not Mr PERSON had acted in breach of the LAW was a matter which had to be decided by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed against this judgment . It submitted inter alia that the statements at issue were value judgments , based on the facts established by the expert opinion of the professor of ORG , and contributed to the discussion of a question of public interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , having the expert opinion of PERSON before it as evidence , dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It noted that the expert opinion had to be considered as an admissible legal assessment of uncontested facts . The article at issue had , however , not simply reproduced the opinion given by the expert but had used it for an independent attack on PERSON reputation . The court noted in this regard that the article had not placed the expert opinion in its context , namely that of a legal dispute , but had presented it as an irrevocable verdict on PERSON . The court referred in particular to the wording of the article 's headings . It further noted that the article had not published any comment of PERSON and had not mentioned the existence of the opinion issued by the other expert Q. Furthermore , the article contained statements which were not supported by the expert opinion , namely that Mr PERSON had deliberately misled ORG and the reference to the possible impeachment of PERSON PERSON . The court noted in the latter regard that the expert opinion had merely mentioned the abstract possibility of impeachment of a member of ORG who , in the opinion of the majority of the members of ORG , had culpably breached the law . The court finally noted that ORG order to black out the impugned statements did not replace but complemented an order of forfeiture of the relevant issues . This judgment was served on the applicant company 's counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON brought injunction proceedings under LAW ( ORG ) against the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) , referring to the judgments of the courts in the proceedings under LAW , granted the injunction and ordered the applicant to revoke the statements that Mr PERSON , by appointing the members of the ORG supervisory board , had deliberately misled ORG and had acted in breach of ORG rules of procedure and LAW . It further ordered the applicant company to pay the costs of Mr PERSON 's counsel .", "CARDINAL . The court dismissed the applicant company 's argument that it could not be held responsible for the shortcomings of the article at issue since that article had been written by a journalist who was not trained in law . The journalist had relied on press releases prepared by ORG which summarised the expert opinion incorrectly . The court found that the applicant company had not complied with its obligation of journalistic diligence as it had failed to consult the available expert opinion .", "CARDINAL .
