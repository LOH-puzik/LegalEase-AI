Prosecution counsel recalls that defence counsel did not raise strong objections to the approach which the judge indicated he intended to pursue , namely to recall the jury and give clear directions on their duty to return a verdict on the basis of the evidence alone . However , defence counsel seems to recall that he did in fact ask the trial judge to discharge the jury in the circumstances , but his application was refused . Defence counsel based his recollection on the grounds of appeal and advice on appeal which he drafted shortly after the trial on DATE . However , neither of these documents suggests that defence counsel made an express request to the judge to discharge the jury . Under point CARDINAL of his grounds of appeal , defence counsel concluded :", "\" It is submitted that , in the circumstances aforesaid , some enquiries should have taken place with a view to acceding to the request of the jury that one of their numbers be discharged . \"", "In the accompanying advice on appeal , defence counsel stated :", "\" It seems to me that it is at least arguable that the trial judge should have enquired further into the matter with a view to acceding to the request that the jury were making . \"", "CARDINAL .

Do you understand that ? I am certainly not going to discharge any member of the jury because he or she may wish [ me ] to do so because they dislike certain overtones in the conversation .

The judge further directed the jury as follows :", "\" Members of the jury , each of you has taken an oath to reach a true verdict according to the evidence . Remember that is the oath you took DATE . Not one of you must be false to that oath . You do have a duty , not only as individuals but collectively as a jury .

Your task is to pool that experience and wisdom . You must do that by giving your views and listening to the views of other people . Of necessity there will be discussion ...

He submitted that in the circumstances the trial judge had wrongly failed to make any enquiry into the note with a view to determining whether CARDINAL of the members of the jury should be discharged on the grounds of racial prejudice and that this failure gave rise to a material irregularity at the trial ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Leave to appeal was refused by the single judge on DATE . He stated that :", "\" The learned judge dealt with the novel and delicate situation presented by the jury note with tact and sensitivity .
