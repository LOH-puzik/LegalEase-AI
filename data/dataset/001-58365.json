On DATE the applicants blew a hunting horn and engaged in hallooing with the intention of disrupting the activities of the PERSON . A complaint was made to the PERSON magistrates that the applicants should be required to enter into a recognisance with or without sureties to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to the Justices of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour in the sum of MONEY for DATE on DATE . They appealed to ORG , which heard their appeals on DATE at GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG , comprising a ORG judge and CARDINAL magistrates , found that the applicants had not committed any breach of the peace and that their conduct had not been likely to occasion a breach of the peace . It found the following facts :", "\u201c ( a ) On DATE , PERSON , a joint Master of PERSON , saw the [ applicants ] in the environs of ORG , and heard the sound of a hunting horn being blown from that position . Later , at CARDINAL p.m. , he saw the [ applicants\u2019 ] car on LOC and again heard the sound of a hunting horn being blown . On that occasion he also heard [ the second applicant ] hallooing . Some hounds were drawn towards the [ applicants ] , and hunt staff had to be deployed to recover them .", "( b ) At TIME , a solitary hound ran out of PERSON \u2019s PERSON along FAC . It suddenly , and for no apparent reason , ran across the road and was killed by a lorry travelling in the direction of ORG .", "( c ) At TIME , [ the first applicant ] stated to a police constable that he had been blowing a hunting horn , but nowhere near where the hound was killed . The police officer seized the hunting horn .", "( d ) Iwerne Hill is QUANTITY from where the hound was killed , and , at the time of its death , it was travelling away from the hunt and away from LOC .", "( e ) On their own admissions each [ applicant ] was a hunt saboteur . [ The first applicant ] admitted that he had blown the horn and [ the second applicant ] that she shouted at hounds . Their object was to distract hounds from hunting and killing foxes .", "( f ) An expert , a Mr A. Downes , told us that he had observed hunts for DATE and had frequently seen hounds running loose on the road away from the main pack . In his opinion , this caused danger to hounds and to other users of the road . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the basis of these facts , ORG was of the following opinion :", "\u201c ( a ) The [ applicants\u2019 ] behaviour had been a deliberate attempt to interfere with the PERSON and to take hounds out of the control of the huntsman and the whippersin .", "( b ) That in this respect the actions of the [ applicants ] were unlawful , and had exposed hounds to danger .", "( c ) That there had been no violence or threats of violence on this occasion , so that it could not be said that any breach of the peace had been committed or threatened .", "( d ) That the [ applicants ] would repeat their behaviour unless it were checked by the sanction of a bind over .", "( e ) That the [ applicants\u2019 ] conduct had been contra bonos mores .", "( f ) That NORP v. PERSON [ see below ] was distinguishable in that it related to the power of arrest for breach of the peace , which could only be exercised if there was violence or the immediate likelihood of violence .", "( g ) That the power to bind over \u2018 to keep the peace and be of good ORG was wider than the power of arrest and could be exercised whenever it was proved either that there had been a breach of the peace or that there had been behaviour contra bonos mores , since a breach of the peace is ex hypothesi contra bonos mores , and the words \u2018 to keep the NORP added nothing to what was required of the defendant by the words \u2018 to be of good ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court noted that neither ORG report on binding over nor LAW was part of domestic law .", "CARDINAL . The ORG judge agreed to state a case to ORG , but legal aid for the case stated was refused on DATE . The ORG appeals against the decisions were dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Breach of the peace DATE which does not constitute a criminal offence ( NORP v. GPE ORG , ex parte ORG Commissioner [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) DATE is a common - law concept of great antiquity . However , as Lord PERSON , giving judgment in ORG in the case of NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Queen \u2019s Bench Reports CARDINAL ) , remarked in DATE :", "\u201c A comprehensive definition of the term \u2018 breach of the peace\u2019 has very rarely been formulated \u2026 \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "He continued :", "\u201c We are emboldened to say that there is likely to be a breach of the peace whenever harm is actually done or is likely to be done to a person or in his presence to his property or a person is in fear of being so harmed through an assault , an affray , a riot , unlawful assembly or other disturbance . \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . In a subsequent case before ORG ( PERSON v. Director of Public Prosecutions [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , Mr Justice PERSON followed ORG in holding that there must be a risk of violence before there could be a breach of the peace . However , it was not essential that the violence be perpetrated by the defendant , as long as it was established that the natural consequence of his behaviour would be to provoke violence in others :", "\u201c The conduct in question does not itself have to be disorderly or a breach of the criminal law . It is sufficient if its natural consequence would , if persisted in , be to provoke others to violence , and so some actual danger to the peace is established . \u201d ( p. DATE )", "CARDINAL . In PERSON and PERSON v. Director of Public Prosecutions ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Justice of ORG ) , Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c \u2026 the court would surely not find a [ breach of the peace ] proved if any violence likely to have been provoked on the part of others would be not merely unlawful but wholly unreasonable \u2013 as of course , it would be if the defendant \u2019s conduct was not merely lawful but such as in no material way interfered with the other \u2019s rights . A fortiori , if the defendant was properly exercising his own basic rights , whether of assembly , demonstration or free speech . \u201d ( p. CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . Behaviour contra ORG mores has been described as \u201c conduct which has the property of being wrong rather than right in the judgment of the majority of contemporary fellow citizens \u201d ( per Lord Justice PERSON in ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON , ex parte PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) ORG rejected the view that a person could not be bound over to be of good behaviour when there was no reason to apprehend a breach of the peace . As in the case of binding over to keep the peace , there had to be some reason to believe that there might be a repetition of the conduct complained of before an order to be of good behaviour could be made .", "CARDINAL .

If an order is made but breached within the specified time period , the person bound over forfeits the sum of the recognisance . A binding - over order is not a criminal conviction ( NORP v. GPE Quarter Sessions , ex parte ORG Commissioner [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The power of a GPE court on the complaint of any person to adjudge any other person to enter into a recognisance , with or without sureties , to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour towards the complainant shall be exercised by order on complaint .", "\u2026", "( CARDINAL ) If any person ordered by a GPE court under subsection ( CARDINAL ) above to enter into a recognisance , with or without sureties , to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour fails to comply with the order , the court may commit him to custody for a period not exceeding DATE or until he sooner complies with the order . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition to the statutory procedure , magistrates have powers to bind over at common law and under LAW . These powers allow magistrates , at any stage in proceedings before them , to bind over any participant in the proceedings if they consider that the conduct of the person concerned is such that there might be a breach of the peace or that his or her behaviour has been contra DATE . It is not open to the justices to attach specific conditions to a binding - over order ( PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Chief Constable of GPE [ DATE ] Criminal Law Review DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . An order of the magistrates to require a person to enter into a recognisance to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour can be appealed either to ORG or ORG .

Because an order binding someone to be of good behaviour is made in such wide terms , it fails to give sufficient indication to the person bound over of the conduct which he or she must avoid in order to be safe from coercive sanctions \u2026", "\u2026", "CARDINAL NORP We are satisfied that there are substantial objections of principle to the retention of binding over to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour . These objections are , in summary , that the conduct which can be the ground for a bindingover order is too vaguely defined ; that binding - over orders when made are in terms which are too vague and are therefore potentially oppressive ; that the power to imprison someone if he or she refuses to consent to be bound over is anomalous ; that orders which restrain a subject \u2019s freedom can be made without the discharge of the criminal , or indeed any clearly defined , burden of proof ; and that witnesses , complainants or even acquitted defendants can be bound over without adequate prior information of any charge or complaint against them . \u201d ( Law Commission Report no .
