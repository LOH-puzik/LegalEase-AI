The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively . The first applicant lives in GPE , GPE , while the second applicant lives in PERSON , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON filed a real estate claim against the applicants with ORG in ORG . The value of the dispute ( vrednost spora ) stated by the plaintiff was CARDINAL \u201c old dinars \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following a remittal and a redenomination of the NORP currency , on DATE ORG ruled in favour of the applicants and noted that the value of the dispute was now CARDINAL \u201c new dinars \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following CARDINAL remittals , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , ORG twice ruled in favour of the applicants , and on both occasions reaffirmed that the value of the dispute was MONEY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the appeal filed by the plaintiff and , in so doing , ruled partly in his favour .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , who were represented by legal counsel , thereafter filed an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , however , rejected this appeal , stating that the applicants were not entitled to lodge it given that the value of the dispute in question was QUANTITY , the applicable statutory threshold . In particular , the court acknowledged that the parties had agreed , on DATE , that the value of the dispute should be MONEY , but observed that there was no separate ORG decision to this effect in the case file . Therefore , the relevant amount was the MONEY , as stated in the plaintiff \u2019s original claim , which was clearly less than the MONEY threshold under the relevant civil procedure rules ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) . Lastly , implicitly relying on its Opinion of CARDINAL DATE , ORG noted that the Government \u2019s Decree of DATE had provided that until DATE both old and new dinars would be valid legal tender based on the ratio that CARDINAL new dinar was worth MONEY . The \u201c plaintiff \u201d himself , however , had \u201c not amended the value of the dispute in new dinars \u201d by DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were served with ORG decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) is \u201c not admissible \u201d in pecuniary lawsuits where the value of the dispute , as indicated by the plaintiff in his or her claim , does \u201c not exceed CARDINAL ... [ new ] dinars \u201d , this threshold having been introduced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , Article CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that , should the value of the dispute stated by the plaintiff be \u201c obviously too high or too low \u201d , the court itself shall resolve the issue . This must be done , at the latest , at the preliminary hearing or , if one is not held , before the beginning of the main hearing at first instance .", "CARDINAL .

Lastly , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL provide , inter alia , that the ORG shall , should it accept an appeal on points of law lodged by CARDINAL of the parties concerned , have the power to overturn the impugned judgment or quash it and order a retrial before the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG opined that where an appeal on points of law would have been available according to the rules in force at the time when the civil claim had been brought , but where , following the redenomination , the value of the dispute in question clearly remained below the threshold of MONEY , an appeal on points of law could not be filed . If the parties , however , agreed to amend the value of their dispute so as to raise it above the said threshold by DATE , at the latest , an appeal on points of law would be admissible ( NORP shvatanje utvr\u0111eno na sednici PERSON odeljenja ORG od CARDINAL .
