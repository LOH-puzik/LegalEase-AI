He was also the chairman of the bank \u2019s supervisory board .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted under LAW ( tax evasion ) by ORG in connection with the activities of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant responded to the investigator \u2019s calls to testify as a witness within the framework of the above - mentioned criminal proceedings and participated in various investigative steps .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , on DATE the applicant was questioned by the investigator and on DATE a confrontation was carried out between the applicant and another witness .", "CARDINAL .

Again on DATE , the prosecutor requested the judge to apply the preventive measure of remand in custody ( h\u0259bs q\u0259timkan t\u0259dbiri ) in respect of the applicant . The prosecutor gave as the reasons for requesting that measure the seriousness of the applicant \u2019s alleged criminal acts and the possibility of his absconding from and obstructing the investigation .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before the court , the applicant and his lawyer submitted that the applicant had never absconded from or obstructed the investigation . They also submitted that the applicant \u2019s failure to comply with some of the requests to assist with the investigation had been due to his state of health , because he had been sick at the time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge , relying on the official charges brought against the applicant and the prosecutor \u2019s request for the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody , ordered the applicant \u2019s detention for a period of DATE . The judge reasoned the necessity for this measure as follows :", "\u201c Taking into account that PERSON has committed a serious crime , the possibility of his absconding from the investigation and illegally influencing persons participating in the criminal proceedings , obstructing the normal functioning of the investigation by hiding or falsification of the items necessary for the prosecution , and that there are sufficient grounds [ that he might ] fail to comply with calls to attend the investigation without any good reason , or flee from criminal responsibility by other means , ... the preventive measure of remand in custody should be applied in respect of PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG decision of DATE , complaining of a lack of evidence that he had committed a criminal offence and lack of justification for the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody . He noted , in particular , that he had always collaborated with the investigating authority before his arrest and that the court had not taken into consideration his family status , state of health or other personal circumstances . The applicant also noted that it would be impossible for him to hide or falsify any document relating to the case , because all the relevant documents had been taken from his office by the investigating authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , finding that the detention order was justified . The relevant part of the court \u2019s decision reads as follows :", "\u201c After having examined the arguments of the appeal , heard the lawyer \u2019s submissions in support of the appeal and the prosecutor \u2019s submissions against it , the panel of the court considers that the court \u2019s decision of DATE should remain unchanged as it is lawful and justified \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the investigator requested from the Deputy Prosecutor General an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention , because although a number of statements had been obtained and a financial audit of ORG had been conducted by ORG and ORG , more time was needed to complete the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General submitted a request to the court for the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention period until DATE . The relevant part of the prosecutor \u2019s request reads as follows :", "\u201c The records of the documented audit carried out in this case must be obtained , depending on the conclusions of the audit , certain witnesses must be questioned , confrontations must be conducted , if necessary , accounting and handwriting analyses must be carried out , relevant steps must be taken for the reimbursement of the damage caused , PERSON must be charged with additional offences in connection with the above - mentioned points , and following the end of these investigative actions , it must be determined which other persons in the circle have committed crimes , and the issue of their responsibility must be decided .", "In order to carry out the said investigative actions , DATE are needed .

Thus , because of the complexity of the criminal case and the need for DATE for the carrying out of the above - mentioned investigative actions , the period of remand in custody in respect of ORG must be extended until DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge at ORG , relying on the prosecutor \u2019s request , extended the length of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody by DATE , until DATE . The court decision , which is almost identical in wording to the prosecutor \u2019s request , reasoned the necessity for the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention as follows :", "\u201c The records of the documented audit carried out in this case must be obtained , certain witnesses , depending on the conclusions of the audit , must be questioned , confrontations must be conducted , if necessary , accounting and handwriting analyses must be carried out , relevant steps must be taken for the reimbursement of the damage caused , PERSON must be charged with additional offences in connection with the above - mentioned points , and following the end of these investigative actions , it must be determined which other persons in the circle have committed crimes , and the issue of their responsibility must be decided .", "The period of remand in custody in respect of PERSON ... ends on DATE .

The hearing of DATE on the extension of the detention period was held in the applicant \u2019s absence , but in the presence of the investigator . According to the record of the hearing , the applicant was represented by his lawyer ( PERSON ) and the latter took the floor and stated that he had no objections to the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the record of ORG hearing of DATE was made available to ORG , he made written comments on the record , stating that false information was included in it , as he had not participated in that hearing and had not pronounced in favour of the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention . On DATE he lodged a request with the judge of ORG for the rectification of the record of the hearing of DATE . He submitted , in particular , that he had not been informed of the date and place of that hearing and that he had not participated in it . He argued that the record of the hearing had been falsified .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , it appears from the transcripts of phone conversations of DATE between PERSON and a court clerk , between PERSON and the investigator in charge of the case , and between PERSON and ORG judge who ordered the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention , that ORG did not participate in the hearing , as all the above - mentioned persons confirmed it in their phone conversation with PERSON In particular , although the judge acknowledged in the phone conversation that there had been a mistake in the record of the hearing concerning the lawyer \u2019s presence at the hearing , in the same conversation he also refused to officially rectify the record .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the same ORG judge rejected PERSON \u2019s rectification request , holding that the lawyer had participated in the hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG decision of DATE concerning the extension of his detention . The applicant complained that he had not been taken to the court for the hearing and that his lawyer had not been informed of the date and place of the hearing . He further submitted that there was no justification for the extension of his detention period and that the first - instance court had failed to substantiate its decision . On DATE he lodged additional submissions in support of his appeal , reiterating his previous complaints and asking the court to deliver a special ruling with regard to the judge of ORG in connection with the falsification of the record of the hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG left unchanged ORG decision on the extension of the detention period , finding no reason for quashing it . As to the justification for the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention , the appellate court stated as follows :", "\u201c The investigating authority considers it necessary that the records of the documented audit carried out in this case must be obtained , some witnesses , depending on the conclusions of the audit , must be questioned , confrontations must be conducted , if necessary , accounting and handwriting analyses must be carried out , relevant steps must be taken for the reimbursement of the damage caused , PERSON must be charged with additional offences in connection with the above - mentioned points , and following the end of these investigative actions , it must be determined which other persons in the circle have committed crimes , and the issue of their responsibility must be decided .", "At the stage of the carrying out of the said procedural actions , it is not appropriate to release PERSON from pre - trial detention .", "The panel of the court considers that the judge of the first - instance court took into account the seriousness of the crime attributed to ORG , the possibility of him influencing persons participating in the criminal proceedings if released , as well as obstructing the normal functioning of the investigation or the court proceedings by hiding or falsification of items necessary for the prosecution , and correctly extended the period of his detention . The decision is lawful and justified . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appellate court did not examine the applicant \u2019s specific complaints concerning his and his lawyer \u2019s absence from the hearing of DATE or the alleged falsification of the record of the above - mentioned hearing .", "CARDINAL . The hearing of DATE before ORG was held in the absence of the applicant , but in the presence of the prosecutor and the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL lawyers .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor in charge of the case filed the indictment with ORG .
