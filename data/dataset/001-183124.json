After going missing on CARDINAL DATE , PERSON was found dead near the local ORG road , close to the town of PERSON , on TIME CARDINAL DATE . He had been repeatedly stabbed and cut with a knife and then run over by a car . The police were called to the scene , as were the district state prosecutor and the duty investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . NORP On examining the crime scene , X \u2019s mobile telephone was found in his car . The incoming and outgoing calls and the text messages sent to and from GPE \u2019s telephone number were checked by police officers at the scene . It appeared from the telephone records that on CARDINAL November CARDINAL X had communicated only with a person using a certain telephone number , from which a message of an explicitly sexual nature had also been sent to X. After the telephone directory was checked it was established , presumably by the police , that the telephone in question belonged to a woman who happened to be the applicant \u2019s grandmother , with whom , as established on the basis of the official records , the applicant lived . Furthermore , having been informed that ORG \u2019s mobile telephone had been found , the district state prosecutor requested the duty investigating judge to order the S company \u2013 the mobile network operator in question \u2013 to produce records of telephone calls made and text messages sent from the telephone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( DATE ) the investigating judge of ORG issued an order for a search of PERSON \u2019s home and ordered the S company to provide data concerning communication undertaken via X \u2019s mobile telephone . The S company on DATE submitted to ORG a disk containing X \u2019s telephone records .", "CARDINAL . On TIME CARDINAL DATE the police stopped the applicant \u2019s car and subjected him to a so - called \u201c security check \u201d ( varnostni pregled ) , finding a knife ( allegedly bearing traces of what could be blood ) and a mobile telephone in the applicant \u2019s pocket . After examining his telephone they established that he had used the aforementioned telephone number from which the aforementioned calls had been made and the aforementioned message sent to X. They seized these objects and arrested the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( DATE ) , relying mostly on information found in X \u2019s and the applicant \u2019s telephones pointing to a link between X and the applicant , the investigating judge issued a search order in respect of the applicant \u2019s home and the cars he was using . The state prosecutor furthermore requested that a court order for the obtaining of the applicant \u2019s comprehensive telephone records be issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge issued an order that the M company \u2013 a mobile network operator \u2013 provide data concerning the applicant \u2019s mobile telephone record . The M company provided a disk containing the requested data on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the course of the preliminary inquiry , the investigating judge ordered a post - mortem examination of X , a DNA analysis and a comparison of biological traces found on the applicant \u2019s clothes and other objects seized during the home search with those found on X \u2019s body . She also ordered a medical examination of the applicant with a view to establishing any injuries .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , represented by counsel , was heard on DATE and was subsequently detained on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge opened a judicial criminal investigation against the applicant in respect of the criminal offence of aggravated murder . She , inter alia : ordered that a reconstruction be carried out at the crime scene ; appointed a psychiatrist and a psychologist to examine the applicant and prepare opinions ; ordered forensic experts in vehicle science and car crash investigations to prepare reports on specific aspects of the case ; and again ordered that the M company and the S company provide traffic data relating to X \u2019s and the applicant \u2019s telephones . She also examined a number of witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was , at his request , heard by the investigating judge , to whom he admitted to running over X , but submitted that this had merely been an accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the state prosecutor filed an indictment for aggravated murder against the applicant , alleging that he had killed X by stabbing him CARDINAL times and cutting him CARDINAL times on his head , neck , chest and other parts of the body and running over him in his car .", "CARDINAL . Following his unsuccessful objection to the indictment , the applicant was put on trial for aggravated murder . A number of hearings were held at which witnesses , experts and evidentiary material were examined and various expert reports ordered and subsequently read out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to DATE in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after an appeal by the applicant , quashed the first - instance judgment , finding that the lower court had failed to clarify the facts surrounding a possible shoe imprint on the victim \u2019s back , which could have indicated the presence of a third person at the scene of the crime . The case was remitted to ORG for fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . In the retrial proceedings , several hearings were held and the applicant lodged an application for the exclusion of all evidence from ( i ) the records of the crime - scene investigation until ( ii ) the records of the last hearing in the first set of proceedings , on the grounds that that evidence had allegedly been tainted by the unlawful examinations of his and X \u2019s telephones . He argued that the examinations of his and X \u2019s telephones had violated his and PERSON \u2019s rights under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and that the relevant court orders had been issued DATE too late . He also requested that the police officers who had subjected him to a security check ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and arrested him be examined in this connection . Both requests were refused by the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant for the aggravated murder of X and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . In view of ( i ) the expert opinions regarding the shoe traces on X \u2019s back which had led to the conclusion that the presence of another person at the crime scene prior to X \u2019s death could not be excluded , and ( ii ) the fact that the knife with which X had been stabbed and cut had not been found , ORG held that there was insufficient proof that the applicant had stabbed and cut X. However , the court found on the basis of the forensic medical evidence that X had still been alive before he had been run over by the car and that the injuries to X \u2019s chest , spine and aorta , which had been the direct cause of his death , had been caused by the applicant having intentionally run him over with his car . It further found it proven on the basis of the evidence at the scene \u2013 such as ( i ) a piece of rubber tube belonging to the applicant \u2019s car , ( ii ) the applicant \u2019s biological traces found on PERSON \u2019s body , ( iii ) X \u2019s biological traces found on , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s clothing ( which was blood - stained ) and on the outside of the applicant \u2019s car \u2013 that the applicant had been beyond doubt at the crime scene and had had contact with X. Referring , in particular , to the findings of the experts in vehicle science , who had performed reconstructions at the scene testing the applicant \u2019s versions of events , the court discounted the possibility that the applicant had run over X by accident . The court furthermore found that the applicant and PERSON had known each other , which was confirmed by the applicant \u2019s statements as well as by telephone records and witness testimony . Lastly , the court referred to the telephone records , together with other evidence such as medical evidence and X \u2019s petrol bill , when elaborating on the time of death , finding that it had undoubtedly occurred on DATE probably sometime after TIME , when the last ( missed ) call from X \u2019s telephone had been recorded on the applicant \u2019s telephone .", "CARDINAL . As regards the procedural decisions taken during the proceedings the court gave the following explanation :", "- It refused a request lodged by the applicant for access to the police notes on the examination of his telephone because it would have been unlawful to include in the file evidence obtained without a court order .", "- In view of the foregoing conclusion that the examination of the applicant \u2019s telephone could have not been admitted to the file , the court refused as unnecessary a request by the applicant for the examination of the officers who had seized the applicant \u2019s telephone ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "- As regards the exclusion of evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the court explained that the applicant had become a subject of investigation following the examination of the data in GPE \u2019s telephone , which had not interfered with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It further noted that the examination of the applicant \u2019s telephone had amounted to a violation of the said provision but carried no evidentiary weight , as at that point the police had already obtained the necessary information from ORG telephone . In addition , the court noted that the results of this examination had not been included in the file and had not been relied on by the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed , complaining , inter alia , that the judgment had violated his defence rights . In particular , he alleged that the district court should have excluded all evidence from the file because it had been based on the police \u2019s examinations of ORG and his own mobile telephone without the necessary court order . He further stated as follows :", "\u201c It is irrelevant that the police , by [ their ] unlawful interference with [ X ] \u2019s mobile telephone , did not directly violate the appellant \u2019s right under LAW [ \u201c Privacy of correspondence and other means of communication \u201d ] , because the fact remains that the police obtained that evidence ( data from [ X ] \u2019s mobile telephone ) without a court order \u2013 that is to say unlawfully . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant moreover argued that the examination of X \u2019s telephone alone had not adduced enough evidence to arrest the applicant and that that had been possible only after the applicant \u2019s telephone had been examined . Thus , in his view , the impugned judgment should not have concluded that the examination of his telephone had had insignificant evidentiary value .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal in part and reduced his sentence to DATE in prison . The court agreed with the applicant that the act of which he had been convicted \u2013 that is to say running over X with his car \u2013 did not in itself constitute murder with aggravating factors ( that is to say aggravated murder ) , as the firstinstance court had not proved that X had sustained severe physical pain or psychological suffering . However , all the other applicant \u2019s complaints , including the CARDINAL regarding the unlawful examinations of his and GPE \u2019s mobile telephones , were dismissed .", "CARDINAL . As regards the examination of PERSON \u2019s telephone the higher court found that , regardless of whether the police officers had examined X \u2019s telephone before the issuance of the court order , what was crucial was that they had received the court order for the telephone records to be produced before they had identified and located the applicant . Therefore , the examination of X \u2019s mobile telephone , which had constituted an urgent step in the police inquiry , had not been conducted in violation of his constitutionally guaranteed right to protection of the privacy of communication . As regards the examination of the applicant \u2019s mobile telephone , the higher court agreed with the lower court that \u201c the examination of the applicant \u2019s telephone [ had been ] ... unconstitutional , but this violation had not been important in the evidentiary sense \u201d . The higher court also upheld the lower court \u2019s decision not to obtain from the police their notes on the examination of the applicant \u2019s telephone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , complaining of , inter alia , the allegedly unlawful examinations of ORG and the applicant \u2019s telephones and reiterating the arguments he had put forward in his appeal ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . In particular , he argued that the police had obtained crucial evidence \u2013 that is to say the message with explicitly sexual content \u2013 when examining PERSON \u2019s telephone without having a court order to do so , and that his arrest had been based on a subsequent unlawful examination of his telephone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . Firstly , as regards the police examination of X \u2019s mobile telephone , ORG pointed out that the applicant had not even argued that the examination of PERSON \u2019s telephone had directly violated his own right to privacy . While not excluding the possibility that the examination of a deceased \u2019s person \u2019s telephone might impinge upon the most intimate spheres of his or her dignity , it considered that in the case at hand it had not interfered with X \u2019s right to privacy , as personality rights ceased at death . Neither had , in ORG view , the applicant \u2019s own constitutionally guaranteed privacy rights been interfered with , as the examination had not revealed his identity . Moreover , the district state prosecutor and the duty investigating judge had been present at the scene of the crime when the police had discovered the telephone in GPE \u2019s car , and the applicant had been arrested only after the court order for the examination of PERSON \u2019s telephone had been issued . ORG concluded that the police \u2019s examination of X \u2019s mobile telephone had not interfered with the applicant \u2019s right to privacy and that the impugned examination had not been causally related to the incriminating evidence .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , with regard to the police \u2019s examination of the applicant \u2019s mobile telephone , ORG noted that it had been undertaken without a court order and referred to ORG finding that the examination had been unconstitutional . However , in ORG view , the information on whether the text message with sexual content had been sent from the applicant \u2019s telephone would have inevitably been discovered , either ( i ) by means of a simple call to the number from which the message had been sent , ( ii ) by checking the applicant \u2019s telephone \u2019s ORG card ( for which , in ORG view , no court order would have been necessary ) , or ( iii ) on the basis of a court order , which had in point of fact later been issued . In view of this conclusion , ORG considered that , regardless of the fact that the police had examined the applicant \u2019s telephone without a court order , the identification of the applicant \u2019s mobile telephone number as the one from which the text message in question had been sent did not constitute inadmissible evidence that should have been excluded from the case file .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint , reiterating the allegations made in his previous appeals . Relying on LAW ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) the applicant argued that the examinations of his and X \u2019s telephone had been unlawful and that the examination of his telephone had violated the aforementioned provision , as well as LAW . Relying on LAW ( again , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant argued that the lower courts should have excluded the evidence obtained unlawfully . In particular , as regards the examination of PERSON \u2019s telephone , the applicant argued that he \u201c had not sought redress for the violation of X \u2019s right to privacy ( mental integrity ) and freedom of communication as he had not been entitled to do so [ ... but rather ] had exclusively pointed out that the violation had occurred and the [ trial ] court had based its decision [ to convict the applicant ] on the consequences of that violation ... \u201d In this connection he , referring to X \u2019s \u201c right to piety \u201d ( pravica do pietete ) , disputed ORG view that PERSON \u2019s right to privacy had ceased with his death and pointed out that a court order had been nevertheless subsequently issued . With regard to ORG finding that the evidence in question would have been inevitably discovered , the applicant argued that the domestic law contained a strict rule requiring the exclusion of all evidence obtained by means violating human rights ( \u201c the domestic exclusionary rule \u201d ) . He furthermore argued that there had been a violation of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) of the LAW because the first - instance court refused to obtain from the police their notes on the examination of his telephone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for consideration , pursuant to section DATE ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
