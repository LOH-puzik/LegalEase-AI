This included allegations to the effect that the latter were defective individuals and potential fifth colonists .", "On DATE ORG appointed a ORG ( krigsbarnutvlaget ) to review whether it was desirable to deport the war children and their mothers to GPE and , in any event , what special measures could be taken to integrate the children as ordinary citizens in GPE .", "The ORG 's report , which was completed in DATE , advised against deportation and recommended the launching of an extensive and carefully prepared information campaign in order to influence public opinion to become favourable towards the war children and to extend that concept to cover not only those children whose fathers were NORP but also those whose fathers were of other foreign nationalities .", "According to information supplied by the ORG , the authorities concluded that in the circumstances at the time such a campaign was neither necessary nor desirable . In this connection the ORG referred to TIME Sixth ORG in DATE , according to which the NORP representative , and secretary - general of ORG , Mr PERSON , stated :", "\u201c The authorities have accepted the consequences of the fact that under NORP law the children are NORP citizens with the same legal position as other children .

ORG also proposed a special FAC . None of these measures were implemented , as it was found that the children were quite quickly absorbed by society . Most were taken in by relatives or put up for adoption . It has not been necessary in the interests of either the children or their mothers to take special protective measures . \u201d", "According to the applicants , the authorities were responsible for having actively and passively contributed to war children having been treated as \u201c free for all \u201d . This failure had occurred despite the authorities ' having been aware , as it emerged from ORG report , of widespread public opinion that the war children were potential fifth colonists , mentally retarded and carriers of poor genes . As a result , a number of war children had been placed in psychiatric institutions without adequate prior expert assessment .

Love and care were totally lacking in the foster home , where she was told that she was ugly , bad , stupid and had heinous genes . She was regularly locked up in a utility room near the hall to wait for her foster father to come home and hit her . On some occasions , in order to prevent her from escaping , she was attached by a dog chain . She was spanked extensively both at home and at school . Once during a geography lesson she was asked to stand up so that the whole class could see what a \u201c NORP kid \u201d ( tyskerunge ) looked like . When she was DATE a dentist purposely drilled her gum . At the age of DATE or ten some alcoholics in her neighbourhood marked a swastika with a nail on her forehead and verbally abused her .

She was washed with scalding hot water , being told by the headmistress that this was the best and only way of cleaning \u201c NORP children \u201d with greasy hair . The children 's home deprived her of her liberty and prevented her from having normal social contacts as she was never allowed to receive visits from friends .", "Throughout primary school she was placed in a class for children needing special attention . Due to lack of knowledge , she did not manage to complete secondary modern school . She was regularly exposed to violence . During DATE a teacher sexually abused her . This was witnessed by the whole class and led to the teacher 's dismissal . When she married at DATE the priest stated that he thought she should be sterilised . In DATE she started to receive a disability pension .", "The fifth applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE . He stayed in a children 's home DATE . As a DATE he was returned to his mother . He went to ordinary primary school before he was placed in a special school for retarded persons , which he completed . It is clear that he should never have been sent to such a school and that the reason for sending him there was his status as a war child . In connection with a medical examination he was subjected to brain - washing by a psychiatrist together with other men who surrounded him in a circle . They told him what a scum of the earth he was and that he should not seek to multiply ; otherwise he would go to hell . He should never assert himself , or else he would be killed . He was raped by CARDINAL of the men .", "The fifth applicant was rejected by his stepfather 's family and was harassed by the latter 's children .

In DATE he was transferred to ORG , where he stayed until DATE when he was placed in an institution named PERSON at PERSON . After having spent periods at different homes under the mental healthcare services in GPE he returned to ORG in DATE , where he stayed until DATE .", "He submits that no expert assessment had been made as to the propriety of his being committed to these various institutions . His being wrongly placed had been a consequence of the authorities ' decision to transfer the children at FAC to PERSON . He was not exposed to any physical abuse , but the fact that he had been considered mentally retarded and had lived together with persons so considered during his entire upbringing had marked him considerably and constituted a great burden for him , substantially reducing his quality of life . He regularly had nightmares and has been suicidal . In DATE he was granted ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in ex gratia compensation ( billighetserstating ) from the ORG for having received a deficient education .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants instituted proceedings before ORG ( tingrett ) . They argued that because of their origin they had been the victims of violations of LAW , DATE and DATE of the Convention . They considered that ORG was responsible for the violations , inter alia because public officials had expressed attitudes towards the war children which had contributed to people adopting a negative perception of them , which in turn had led to infringements having been committed against the children . The ORG had failed to take any action to prevent the abuse , amongst others the measures recommended by ORG . The first CARDINAL applicants sought ( CARDINAL ) a ruling to the effect that the ORG was responsible for violations of their fundamental human rights and ( CARDINAL ) ordering the ORG to pay each of them compensation in an amount not exceeding ORG CARDINAL .", "ORG gave a decision and a judgment ( kjennelse og dom ) on DATE with a common reasoning . It observed from the outset that not only did the parties disagree about the manner of resolution of the legal disputes but they also disagreed on what questions ORG should determine . It found that item ( CARDINAL ) of the first CARDINAL applicants ' requests could reasonably be viewed as CARDINAL for a declaratory judgment ( fastsettelsesdom ) , whereas item ( CARDINAL ) ought to be understood as a compensation claim .", "ORG considered that the ORG could not be held liable for any actions or omissions referable to the period DATE and the entry into force of the LAW in DATE . Moreover , the various instances of abuse of which the first CARDINAL applicants complained could not be considered a continuing situation either for the purposes of national law ( criminal or tort ) or the Convention . In this regard ORG stressed that it had to be demonstrated in each individual case , as the applicants had attempted to do , that he or she had been the victim of specific violations . The individual plaintiff 's claims ought to be considered individually , and thus it was not decisive whether other war children had or had not been victims of violation over a shorter or longer period . Then ORG went on :", "\u201c The violations to which [ first CARDINAL applicants ] have referred , concern very different offences . They concern different forms of violation \u2013 passivity on the part of the Government , statements from public individuals , serious crimes such as rape , and harassment by private individuals . Moreover , the violations have taken place over a period of DATE . These are factors that militate strongly against an ongoing situation as this term is defined in compensation and criminal law .", "This being so , in ORG opinion , it can not be assumed that we are dealing with a single ongoing situation , in the sense that abuses committed in DATE are not time - barred as long as the victim can DATE be subjected to a violation of a quite different character . As regards the relationship to the ORG , it is the individual abuses against which the ORG protects the citizens . \u201d", "ORG considered that item CARDINAL of the first CARDINAL applicants ' request was time - barred under LAW relating to LAW ( Lov om foreldelse av fordringer nr . CARDINAL of DATE , hereinafter referred to as \u201c LAW CARDINAL \u201d ) , according to which a compensation claim for non - pecuniary damage was time - barred DATE after the injured person had become or ought to have become aware of the damage and the identity of the person responsible or , in any event , DATE after the impugned act or other circumstances giving rise to liability . In addition , a CARDINAL-year rule which was in force until DATE was applicable . ORG was of the view that all of the first CARDINAL applicants ' claims must have been time - barred under the CARDINAL-year rule , which meant that the claims were time - barred at the latest in DATE , DATE after the youngest plaintiff turned DATE . As regards the fifth applicant , he had alleged that the abuse occurred in DATE , DATE before the entry into force of the Convention . ORG added that , due to the long lapse of time , it was impossible to prove the alleged violations ; no witnesses or documentary evidence could be adduced . Therefore the limitation of the claims did not just have a formal reason but also a substantive one .", "As regards item CARDINAL of the first CARDINAL applicants ' requests , ORG considered that they did not have an actual legal interest for the purposes of LAW . In reaching this conclusion ORG had regard inter alia to its finding that the first CARDINAL applicants ' compensation claims were time - barred ; that the main criticism against the ORG , namely its failure to take certain measures in the Post War period , fell outside what could be made the subject of a review of the merits of the case ; that the first CARDINAL applicants ' interest in having historical truths ascertained by the judiciary could hardly be achieved given the very great number of war children compared to the number - CARDINAL - of litigants in the proceedings .", "Nor did ORG find that making a declaratory judgment in the first CARDINAL applicants ' case was warranted by other reasons . In cases concerning , as here , allegations of violations of human rights , this would depend on the character of the violation , whether the proceedings had been instituted within a reasonable time , whether other possible remedies had been exhausted ; the importance of the case for the victim and the jurisprudential value of the ruling . However , in this case the central points of the first CARDINAL applicants ' complaint against the ORG fell outside the temporal scope of the LAW ; the possibilities of the judiciary to review policy choices were very limited ; the pecuniary claims were time - barred ; the applicants had had the opportunity to have their complaints of violations of the LAW examined by the courts ; the case concerned mainly circumstances DATE back in time ; no information had been submitted to the effect that similar proceedings had been instituted in other countries nor that the treatment of war children had been worse in GPE than in other countries , a question to be assessed by researchers ; in order for the CARDINAL out of CARDINAL litigants to succeed in the proceedings it would be necessary to provide documentary evidence beyond the first CARDINAL applicants ' own statements ; as was undisputed by them , the alleged violations were not capable of being proved , whereas criminal liability required proof beyond reasonable doubt and civil liability for misplacement and malpractice in respect of the children raised complicated questions .", "In view of the above , ORG found it difficult to see how the first CARDINAL applicants could benefit from further judicial review of the case . The parties were in agreement that the matter had not come to an end . In the view of ORG , it would be best for all the parties involved to leave these issues to historians and politicians , not lawyers .", "ORG dismissed ( avviste ) the case by a decision ( kjennelse ) in so far as item CARDINAL of the first CARDINAL applicants ' requests were concerned and rejected the claim against the ORG by a judgment ( dom ) with respect to item CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants had been granted free legal aid in the proceedings and the ORG had made no request for costs .", "The first group of CARDINAL applicants then appealed to ORG against ORG decision and judgment .", "On DATE the first group of applicants withdrew their appeal against the dismissal by ORG of item CARDINAL and reformulated their appeal against its judgment regarding item CARDINAL . As a result , the former part of the case was discontinued by ORG in a separate decision , whereas the proceedings concerning the latter part were focused on the limitation issue .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG , sitting with CARDINAL professional judges and CARDINAL lay judges , unanimously upheld ORG judgment , observing inter alia :", "\u201c [ The first CARDINAL applicants ] argue that their claims in the case are based on Convention violation , and are not claims in damages law in the normal sense . ORG can not see that there is any basis for this argument . GPE 's accession to ORG did not entail an obligation to incorporate the LAW into NORP law ; the ORG mandated NORP authorities , through legislation and otherwise , to safeguard these rights and ensure that they were not interfered with unless authorised under the ORG . [ The first CARDINAL applicants ] have argued that for DATE since the Second World War their human rights have been seriously violated , in part through acts of persons for whom the Government must be seen as directly liable , in part because the authorities had failed to protect the war children and safeguard their rights . The High Court bases its consideration of the time - barring on this claim , without needing to take a position on its merits . [ The first CARDINAL applicants ] argue that these acts and omissions on the part of the authorities have caused them damage of both pecuniary and non - pecuniary nature . The claim advanced here by [ The first CARDINAL applicants ] regarding financial compensation for such injury is , in ORG view , a compensation claim , as this expression is used for example in LAW DATE and section CARDINAL of LAW . ....", "[ The first CARDINAL applicants ' ] argument that claims for reparation for breach of human rights are not a damages claim in the normal sense can not therefore succeed . The same applies to the argument that there were previously no statutory powers for the claim under NORP law , but that such powers were not created until the ORG was made part of NORP law in DATE . In this connection it is not necessary to discuss the detailed content of and development of the ORG 's employer liability , the ORG 's non - statutory objective liability and general liability for negligence in relation to public activities in DATE that have elapsed since the Second World War . It follows from the presumption principle that the NORP compensation law must be presumed to be , and to have been , in conformity with our obligations under international law , so that the claims for damages could have been raised before LAW entered into force , possibly in reliance on the rules of the LAW and the case law of ORG .", "It must further be regarded as reliable law that the provisions of the Convention are not an impediment to the individual countries ' operating with limitation periods also in areas that are embraced by the ORG 's rules . Such time - barring rules are deemed not to be in conflict with LAW , on the right to have one 's civil rights determined by a court , see ORG judgment in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The time - barring rules must not be such as to make this right in reality illusory , for example by being unreasonably short . In the PERSON case ORG found that it was not incompatible with the LAW that a person 's right to bring a civil action for damages for having being sexually abused as a child lapsed DATE after that person came of age . It is stated in paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment [ ... ] : ' .... Article CARDINAL does not necessarily require that GPE fulfil the positive obligation to secure respect for private life by the provision of unlimited civil remedies in circumstances where criminal law sanctions are in operation . ' As the High Court points out below , [ the first CARDINAL applicants ' ] claims must be regarded as time - barred under the DATE rule of LAW . The High Court finds it clear that a limitation period of such duration is not incompatible with the LAW . A corresponding view of the power of the state to operate with civil - law time - barring rules follows from the ORG 's decision in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( ( dec . ) no . DATE ) with references . Here it was not deemed to give rise to a violation of LAW that the right to bring an action for damages against a physician in connection with a breast operation was limited . Both ORG have also noted that there is a ' limitation period ' also as regards the right to bring cases before the ORG itself , namely the DATE time - limit in former LAW and the current LAW , a time - limit that is applied strictly , see the PERSON decision .", "It follows from the PERSON and PERSON rulings that it is not incompatible with LAW [ ... ] or LAW [ ... ] , for the GPE to operate with limitation rules for civil compensation claims . Nor have ORG any general duty to pay damages to those subjected to abuse from private persons , see ORG decision in PERSON v. GPE ( ( dec . ) no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . It must follow from this that , also when a damages claim is brought directly against a ORG , it can be limited under national rules without impediment from the ORG , even if the claim concerns loss and injury in areas covered by the LAW . It is also reliable law that damages claims against public authorities are time - barred under LAW , and that the rule applies regardless of the ground for liability , see ORG ' Foreldelsesloven ' ( LAW ) ( DATE ) p. CARDINAL .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , compensation claims , including claims made outside contractual relations in respect of non - pecuniary damage , are time - barred DATE after the damaging act or other circumstances giving rise to liability had ceased . The alleged ground for liability on the part of the ORG was [ ... ] that the authorities had not carried out the necessary measures in order to secure the war children 's human rights . As regards failures to act , the starting point for limitation is the time when the duty to act has ceased [ ... ] . Such a duty for the ORG to act should in the view of ORG have ceased at least when the [ The first CARDINAL applicants ] reached the age of maturity , which in the case of the youngest of them was in DATE . After this point in time there could not have been any duty for the authorities to launch an information- or attitude building campaign for persons who were born from a NORP father and a NORP mother in connection with the War , or to carry out other measures for the protection of their human rights . This can not be altered by the fact that the [ first CARDINAL applicants ] have encountered abusive attitudes and speech because of their background even as adults . In this connection there is no basis for the [ first CARDINAL applicants ' ] argument that the ground for liability consists of a continuing situation which has not ceased . That the effects of the damaging acts are durable and arise late does not mean that DATE time - limit does not start to run . ORG adds that , as pointed out by ORG , the considerations which underlie the limitation rules apply fully in cases such as the present , where there would otherwise be question of adjudicating occurrences and causal events dating DATE back in time .", "The DATE rule in section QUANTITY of LAW was new when the LAW entered into force on DATE . It has later been amended , without it having any importance here . It follows from the transitional provision in DATE that the [ first CARDINAL applicants ' ] possible claims against the ORG were time - barred at the latest in DATE . The proceedings against the ORG were instituted in DATE . ORG judgment must be upheld .

On the one hand there were a number of findings that indicated that many of the war children had worse living conditions than others of the same age . The mortality during the period from DATE until present was clearly higher among the war children . The mortality related to suicide was higher , as was that caused by heart and blood illnesses . A number of war children had become disability pensioners at a relatively young age . On the whole it suggested that a considerable proportion had health problems and , as a result , a lower quality of life . The divorce rate was clearly higher among the female war children than others . Fewer had higher education , the average income level was lower , and wealth was clearly less .", "On the other hand there were several similarities between the war children and other persons of the same age , such as the frequency of marriage , the divorce rate among men and the frequency of parenthood . Many war children appeared to have had a life as ordinary people : they had an ordinary education , an average income , acceptable accommodation , were married and had children .", "As regards the position of war children and their mothers under NORP law on citizenship and maintenance support , the Government submitted to the ORG inter alia what is stated here below .", "In order to avoid dual citizenships it followed from section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE that a NORP citizen would loose his / her citizenship if he / she gained another citizenship . The exemption to the rule was if he / she still lived in GPE . The general state of law in LOC prior to the Second World War was that a wife would be accorded her husband 's citizenship after marriage . After the war it was deemed as offensive to the general sense of justice if NORP women , married to NORP , who therefore had become NORP citizens , should retain their NORP citizenship if they still lived in GPE . The aim of the DATE decree , transformed into state law in DATE , was to make it possible for the Government to send the spouses , both being NORP ( or NORP ) citizens out of GPE . Other countries had parallel legislation at the time .", "Most of the amendments ( in DATE and DATE ) to LAW only applied to children of NORP mothers married to NORP nationals . Since most of the war children were born outside wedlock , they were not within the scope of this legislation . The same was the case as regards the LAW on financial aid to mothers . This LAW only applied to children of married women who had lost their NORP citizenship and did not discriminate against war children born outside wedlock . No acts were passed in the period after the war which would entail a clear discrimination of war children born outside of wedlock .", "By DATE , mothers and children who had been deprived of their NORP citizenship because the mother had married a NORP national could reacquire their lost citizenship .", "As from DATE , benefits for war children who in effect had fallen outside the DATE legislation because they were not NORP citizens could be sought under PERSON Insurance Act and LAW , adopted in DATE . Pursuant to these Acts , the ORG was to advance child alimony to all children , including children with NORP fathers .

The liability does not comprise damage or injury caused by the fact that the employee has exceeded the reasonable limits of his duties , considering the nature and range of the activity and the character of the work or function .", "For the purpose of these provisions , the term ' employer ' means the public authorities and anybody who employs a person in his service , whether for gainful activity or not .", "For the purpose of these provisions , the term \u201c employee \u201d means anybody who performs work or functions in the service of an employer . The term ' employee ' includes ' ombudsmann ' in public service , officers and privates in military service and other persons performing compulsory service for public authorities , and inmates , patients and the like who take part in work in the prison authority 's establishments , in health institutions etc . \u201d", "Under this provision , the ORG , as an employer , can be held liable irrespective of whether it has acted with negligence . Furthermore , the employee / employees do not have to be identified and the employer can be held liable if the cumulative acts of its employees fulfil the criteria laid down in section CARDINAL - CARDINAL .", "Prior to LAW , an individual could hold the ORG responsible for acts of its employees under general principles of law , developed in particular in judicial jurisprudence . LAW was aimed at codifying those principles .", "According to the Government , the ORG , like private individuals , could also be held liable for damage caused by negligence , under the general principles on the law of tort . This could arise in relation to a variety of activities , including notably decision making and the exercise of its different supervision and control functions .", "Financial claims , including claims for damages , may be lost through limitation . LAW of DATE section CARDINAL regulates the limitation period for claims for damages . The relevant parts of the section read :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Claims for damages or redress shall be subject to a limitation period of DATE from the date on which the injured party obtained , or should have himself acquired , necessary knowledge of the damage and the person responsible .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the limitation period shall be DATE after the commission of the tort or other ground for liability ceased . ... \u201d", "Until DATE section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) also contained DATE limitation rule , which read :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the limitation period shall be at DATE from the date on which the damage occurred , or DATE after the commission of the tort or other ground for liability ceased . .... \u201d", "Even if an individual war child can not prove that he / she fulfils the legal criteria for obtaining damages from an individual or the ORG , he / she can apply for ex gratia compensation ( billighetserstatning ) from the ORG with respect to injury suffered , either due to the acts or omissions of public authorities or for instance criminal acts by individuals . This is meant to be the last resort to obtain damages when a person has suffered harm or distress . It is sufficient that the application describes the circumstances that form the basis for the claim , and if possible document these with for instance a doctor 's or psychologist 's certificate , testimony from family , friends or others that have knowledge of the applicant 's situation etc . In particular if the events occurred quite some time back , as would be the case in relation to many war children , there are no strict requirements as to the evidence for the acts / omissions that form the basis for the claim . Furthermore , the relevant ORG has an obligation to look into and examine the case . The arrangement of ex gratia compensation is not subject to any statutes of limitation .", "Whether the claim for compensation is granted is based on a test of reasonableness . It is in particular relevant if the public authorities can be blamed for the harm . It is sufficient that a public body is to blame ; the identification of the wrongdoer among the public official is not a condition . Even where the authorities were not to be blamed , compensation has been awarded , inter alia in cases of personal injury due to criminal acts committed before the Regulation concerning criminal injuries compensation ( forskrift om voldsoffererstatning ) was passed on DATE .", "The amount of compensation awarded ex - gratia is based on an assessment of reasonableness . It does not attempt to cover all economic losses . The committee set to determine applications for ex - gratia compensation , composed by CARDINAL former ORG Judge and CARDINAL members of ORG , may award up to ORG CARDINAL CARDINAL ( in DATE ) . Cases where it is deemed necessary to award a higher amount or which are of a specific political nature are to be assessed by ORG .", "On DATE new rules for ex gratia compensation for war children entered into force and new guidelines were published . As a result , the possibility for war children of obtaining such compensation was expanded ; for example , injury caused by bullying was included in the guidelines . The more serious types of infringements against war children were already covered by the existing guidelines , such as sexual assault , wrongful placement in an institution , inadequate schooling and reproachable conduct on the part of employees in the child protection services , within or outside the orphanage . In such cases , compensation is awarded if the circumstances are made sufficiently probable and if they have caused particular suffering , loss etc for the war child . The fact that the individual is a war child does not in itself qualify for compensation .", "It has been accepted that bullying may be particularly hard to prove after a long time . Thus , for war children ORG accepted a special arrangement , whereby up to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL may be awarded on the basis of a credible personal statement . If there is documentation of more serious damage due to bullying , a higher amount may be awarded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
