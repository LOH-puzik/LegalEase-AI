The investigating judge ordered the applicant \u2019s detention but the applicant remained at large .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appeared before the investigating judge of ORG on DATE . He was questioned and remanded in custody on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE State Attorney \u2019s ORG ( GPE dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u GPE ) indicted the applicant in ORG , alleging that on DATE he had put at risk the life and limb of others and that on DATE he had attempted to murder QUANTITY persons .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON assumed responsibility for the applicant \u2019s case as the president of a trial panel of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG , composed of Judges D.T. , ORG and ORG , extended the applicant \u2019s detention on the grounds provided for under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( risk of reoffending ) . The relevant part of the decision reads :", "\u201c ... the accused is indicted under count CARDINAL , namely that on DATE in the flat of his partner PERSON he fired CARDINAL shots from a gun at a wall , irrespective of the fact that FAC and GPE . were present in the same room and that he was aware that the bullets could ricochet from the wall and hurt any of the persons present . Under count one , he is indicted on the ground that on DATE in a nightclub , after a verbal dispute with GPE , he fired several times from a gun and then fired all the remaining bullets from the gun at GPE and GPE ... with the aim of murdering them , and GPE \u2019s life was saved by medical intervention .", "The above shows the accused \u2019s brutality , determination , high degree of criminal resolve and obvious propensity towards such criminal behaviour , all of which , in the opinion of this court , continues to justify the extension of his detention because of the fear that [ if at large ] he would commit a further criminal offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG found that the maximum statutory period of the applicant \u2019s detention had expired and ordered that he be released from detention . Judge PERSON was a member of that panel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vice - President of ORG of the Zagreb County Court reassigned the applicant \u2019s case to Judge PERSON because in the meantime Judge PERSON had become a judge of ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a trial panel of ORG , presided over by Judge PERSON , found the applicant guilty of the attempted murder of CARDINAL persons and dismissed the charge of putting at risk the life and limb of others on the ground that the prosecution had withdrawn that charge . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE State Attorney \u2019s ORG lodged an appeal with ORG against ORG judgment , seeking a more severe sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against ORG judgment with ORG on DATE , complaining of a number of substantive and procedural flaws , and notably that Judge PERSON had not been impartial . The applicant contended that by being a member of a panel which had extended his pre - trial detention , Judge PERSON had already formed his opinion about the charges against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , ORG , acting under LAW , forwarded the parties\u2019 appeals and ORG case file to ORG ( PERSON odvjetni\u0161tvo PERSON ) for their examination and opinion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the State Attorney \u2019s Office of GPE submitted an opinion to ORG on both appeals , however , this opinion was not communicated to the defence . The opinion reads :", "\u201c Please find enclosed ORG case file no . K-CARDINAL/CARDINAL concerning the criminal proceedings against the accused PERSON , charged with the offences under LAW in conjunction with LAW , which was forwarded [ to ORG ] after the [ GPE ] ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG and the accused \u2019s lawyer had submitted their appeals ...", "As to the appeal lodged by the [ GPE ] ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG concerning the sentence , we consider that it was correctly pointed out that the [ first - instance ] court sentenced [ the applicant ] to a rather lenient sentence of imprisonment which appears absolutely inappropriate in view of the circumstances of the offence and his personality ... It was correctly pointed out that certain aggravating factors had been significantly underestimated , namely the grave consequences for [ the health of ] GPE and the other victims . Furthermore , the [ first - instance ] court failed to take into account the accused \u2019s attitude towards the victims and the damage caused by the offences , as well as his lack of any remorse for or apology to the victims . This all should be taken into account in the sentencing procedure and should eventually lead to a more severe sentence as requested by the [ GPE ] ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG .", "As to the appeal lodged by the defence , it is to be noted that there has been no fundamental miscarriage of justice in the proceedings , within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ... of LAW , concerning the impartiality of the trial judge , who [ allegedly ] should have been excluded from the case . In his submission the appellant refers to the case - law of ORG and ORG concerning the exclusion of a judge who presides over a trial panel , having already decided on the accused \u2019s detention at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings . The case - law of ORG impartiality is presumed until there is proof to the contrary and since in the case at issue there are no objective circumstances which could raise doubts as to the impartiality of the judge who presided over the trial panel , such case - law is not applicable to the present case .", "As to the [ complaint alleging ] substantive flaws in that no reference was made to the Articles of the amended LAW , it is to be noted that LAW was not amended as regards LAW and that the court in the present case correctly applied the relevant provision ...", "As to the factual findings [ of the first - instance court ] , we consider that all the relevant facts have been sufficiently and comprehensibly established . The [ first - instance court ] based its findings on the report drawn up by the ballistics expert PERSON and , after the assessment of the relevant witness statements , it set out in detail its conclusion that the accused had caused the conflict . Therefore , the argument of self - defence raised in the appeal is not correct because , under the relevant case - law , the person who first drew a gun can not invoke the defence of self - defence . We also find that sufficient reasons have been given as to the existence of all the elements of the offence , as regards the victims GPE and PERSON , as the accused \u2019s mens rea . The exact place from which he shot the gun was also established without any doubt .", "As to the fact that the victim \u2013 a policeman [ by profession ] \u2013 also had a gun , we consider that this has no bearing on the factual findings set out in the [ first - instance ] judgment . This is because no bullets fired from the [ victim \u2019s ] gun were found in the nightclub , but CARDINAL unfired bullet . Therefore , the appellant \u2019s argument that the victim fired his gun is unsupported by the personal and physical evidence . In this connection it is also to be noted that all the relevant facts , other than the statements of the victims and the other witnesses unrelated to the accused PERSON , are supported by a CARDINALD reconstruction [ of the crime scene ] and the report of the ballistics expert M.", "Against the above background we propose that the appeal by ORG be allowed and the appeal lodged by the defence be dismissed as ill - founded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the parties that a public hearing would be held on DATE . The applicant \u2019s defence lawyer , who had represented him throughout the proceedings , was invited to attend but it was expressly stated that the applicant , who in the meantime had been remanded in pre - trial detention until the judgment became final , was not to attend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a public hearing in the presence of the applicant \u2019s defence lawyer and the Deputy ORG Attorney of GPE ( PERSON dr\u017eavnog odvjetnika PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . At the appeal hearing the applicant \u2019s defence lawyer reiterated the arguments set out in his appeal and the Deputy State Attorney of GPE endorsed the arguments set out in the opinion of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The relevant part of the summary record of the appeal hearing reads :", "\u201c With the permission of the President , the ... defendant gave the necessary explanations for his submissions , in particular : The defence counsel reiterated the appeal submissions .", "The Deputy ORG Attorney of GPE stated that he endorsed the proposal submitted under LAW , ...", "After that , at TIME , the President decided that the part of the session at which the parties were allowed to be present had concluded and that the decision which the panel would adopt in the course of the session would be made available to all interested parties by means of the delivery of a certified copy of the decision through the first - instance court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a judgment in which it upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and increased his sentence to DATE imprisonment . The relevant part of the judgment reads :", "\u201c The Deputy ORG Attorney of GPE , after consulting the case file ... in a reasoned opinion of DATE ... asked for the appeal lodged by ORG to be allowed and the appeal lodged by the accused to be dismissed .", "...", "The accused PERSON , in his appeal ... asked to be invited together with his defence lawyer ... to the hearing before the appeal court . The request as regards the defence lawyer has been complied with ... , whereas the appeal court has not found it useful to have the accused brought from pre - trial detention ...", "...", "The mere fact that the president of the trial panel had ruled on the appellant \u2019s pre - trial detention is not a reason for excluding that judge from the trial ... Since the appellant failed to substantiate any circumstances which could raise doubts as to the impartiality of the president of the trial panel , his argument appears ill - founded .", "...", "The appeal lodged by the ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG concerning the sentence is well founded ...", "The first - instance court ... treated as mitigating circumstances the appellant \u2019s decent behaviour in court , his relative youth , his lack of previous convictions , the fact that he was unemployed , had no assets and was a father of CARDINAL minor children , CARDINAL of whom was seriously disabled , and the fact that he was charged with attempting to commit criminal offences . His exceptional determination and criminal resolve , as manifested in committing CARDINAL criminal offences putting life and limb at risk , were assessed as aggravating circumstances .", "Contrary to the criminal offences committed to the detriment of GPE and PERSON , where no harm occurred \u2013 which is an additional mitigating factor that , together with other mitigating factors , could have led to the application of the rules on applying a more lenient penalty \u2013 the criminal offence committed to the detriment of GPE resulted in grave consequences since he sustained serious and life - endangering wounds to his vital organs in DATE and at the peak of his career , which was then interrupted by long - term treatment and rehabilitation , although he had not contributed in any significant manner [ to the situation ] , which amounts to an additional aggravating factor . The [ appellant \u2019s ] behaviour after the commission of the criminal offences , as rightly pointed out in the appeal lodged by ORG , namely that he escaped to another country , together with the lack of any remorse or apology to the victims , amount to additional aggravating circumstances which indicate that the rules on imposing a more lenient penalty should not have been applied in respect of that criminal offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) , arguing that his right to a fair trial had been violated , inter alia , because of the lack of impartiality of Judge PERSON ; because the submissions of the Deputy State Attorney of GPE to ORG had not been communicated to him ; and because ORG had not examined him prior to increasing his sentence .", "CARDINAL .
