In judgment CARDINALB_CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ( published under the number ORG CARDINAL I CARDINAL ) , which was notified to the applicant on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "ORG found that the requirement for prisoners to work was not in itself in breach of human rights , and specifically of LAW ( point CARDINAL of the reasoning ) .", "Hence , the purpose of compulsory work in the context of the execution of custodial sentences and measures was to develop , maintain or promote prisoners\u2019 capacity to resume working life after their release . In ORG view , the requirement to work contributed to the execution of sentences and fostered appropriate social behaviour and the capacity to avoid reoffending . It was also designed to occupy prisoners , lend structure to their DATE lives and maintain order in the institution ( point CARDINAL ) .", "ORG added that , as prisoners got older , greater emphasis was placed on the obligation to provide them with the necessary support ( necessary support principle ) and on reducing the negative impact of detention ( principle of least possible harm ) . In the case of prisoners over DATE , the requirement to work served the purpose of avoiding the harmful effects of detention , for instance the isolation of persons who had reached retirement age , and preventing mental and physical deterioration . The work had to be tailored to the prisoner \u2019s abilities , training and interests , and it was therefore necessary to avoid placing an excessive burden on prisoners over DATE . Lastly , in the case of persons who were less physically and mentally able , the occupation could take the form of therapeutic activity ( point CARDINAL ) .", "ORG further held that ORG was designed to guarantee a living income to persons who were no longer able to work because of their age . However , work performed in connection with the execution of a custodial sentence or measure was not comparable to an employment contract on the competitive labour market , but rather should be regarded as an occupation within a closed system . ORG therefore held that the rules governing persons of pensionable age did not apply to prisoners ( point CARDINAL ) .", "ORG also found that an occupation carried out on a voluntary basis was not apt to fulfil the aims pursued by the requirement to work in prison ( point CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["4"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["4-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
