She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer of the law firm PERSON , ORG practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON ORG , ORG , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In a questionnaire dated DATE ORG informed the applicant that she was suspected of having damaged Mr PERSON \u2019s car on CARDINAL or DATE . The police informed her that she was free to make a statement on this accusation in writing or to remain silent .", "On DATE ORG received the questionnaire completed by the applicant , in which she stated that she did not admit the crime she was suspected of . She wrote that she did not wish to make a statement herself and that she left it to her lawyer to deal with the matter . She went on claiming that she considered the behaviour of Mr W. to be an act of revenge on her .", "In a letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer ORG notified ORG that he represented the applicant and requested to grant him access to the case file . Although he stated in this letter that a power of attorney was enclosed , the letter did not contain this document .", "On DATE the public prosecutor applied to ORG to issue a penal order against the applicant .", "In a letter dated DATE addressed to ORG the applicant \u2019s lawyer PERSON repeated his request to inspect the case file .", "On DATE ORG issued a penal order ( PERSON ) against the applicant in a summary procedure . The applicant was convicted of damage to property and sentenced to a fine of CARDINAL Deutschmarks per day for DATE .", "On DATE counsel PERSON \u2019s letter recalling his motion to be granted access to the case file reached ORG .", "On DATE the penal order was served on the applicant by way of a notice in her letter - box to collect a letter deposited at ORG , as the postman had not found anyone at the applicant \u2019s home . The applicant did not collect this letter . The applicant \u2019s counsel was not sent a copy of the penal order .", "On DATE the penal order became final , since no objection had been lodged by the applicant within the DATE time - limit under the relevant provisions of LAW ( Strafproze\u00dfordnung \u2013 see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) .", "On DATE ORG issued a payment order ( GPE ) against the applicant in respect of the fine .", "On DATE ORG ordered the imprisonment of the applicant for default of payment of the fine ( GPE ) . The order was served on the applicant on DATE , again by way of a notice in her letter - box to collect a letter deposited at ORG . The applicant also did not collect this letter .", "On DATE ORG issued a warrant to bring the applicant before the competent authority ( PERSON ) . The warrant contained a reference to the date and filenumber of the penal order , to the offence the applicant was convicted of and to the amount of the fine .", "On DATE an officer of the police station which had been instructed to execute this warrant phoned the applicant , informed her of the warrant and requested her to come to the police station . The applicant did so and was informed by a police officer about the warrant and the existence of the underlying penal order . In the following discussion the applicant denied having damaged the car of Mr W. , her former partner . She paid the fine in order to prevent the execution of the warrant .", "In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , which reached ORG on DATE , the applicant \u2019s new lawyer , who has represented the applicant since then , requested ORG to grant him access to the case file . He stated that he had been informed by the applicant of the measures taken to enforce a sentence without her having received a penal order or a judgment .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s new lawyer access to the case file . The file reached the lawyer on DATE .", "By a letter dated DATE , which reached ORG on DATE , the applicant \u2019s new lawyer lodged an objection against the penal order after having inspected the case file . At the same time , he submitted an application for reinstatement of the proceedings ( Wiedereinsetzung in den vorigen Stand ) with respect to the DATE timelimit for lodging the objection . He argued that it was not the applicant \u2019s fault that she did not comply with this time - limit . She had not received the penal order . Since she had instructed a counsel , she was confident that services would be effected on her lawyer , and that she did not have to attend to the observance of any time - limits herself .", "On DATE ( decision served on DATE ) ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for reinstatement as inadmissible . Consequently , it dismissed her objection against the penal order as inadmissible . It found that the request for reinstatement was filed out of time . According to the court , the applicant was informed of the content of the penal order when she came to the police station on DATE . Neither she nor her new counsel applied for reinstatement of the proceedings within the DATE time - limit running from DATE . The court found that , in any event , the application for reinstatement of the proceedings was ill - founded . It was not credible that the applicant had neither received the penal order nor any of the other documents served on her , because the address to which the documents had been sent was correct . Therefore , it was the applicant \u2019s fault that she did not comply with the timelimit to lodge an objection against the penal order .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal ( sofortige Beschwerde ) against the decision of ORG . She stated that in DATE several letters to her or her neighbours did not reach their addressees . She claimed in particular that , even assuming that the notification of the penal order was valid , it was contrary to her right to a fair trial and to be heard that ORG had neither granted her lawyer access to the case file nor informed him that it had issued a penal order . She therefore had to be granted reinstatement . She disputed that she had been informed of the contents of the penal order by the police on DATE . In fact , the competent police office was unable to explain to the applicant \u2019s lawyer who had called him on DATE why the applicant had to pay a fine . Therefore , the time - limit of DATE to apply for reinstatement of the proceedings did not start running before the applicant \u2019s counsel had inspected the case files and was consequently observed .", "On DATE ( decision served on DATE ) ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . She claimed that her right to be heard had been violated by ORG by not granting access to the case file to her lawyer , not hearing her via counsel before issuing the penal order , not informing the latter that a penal order had been issued and not granting reinstatement of the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG , without giving reasons , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "By a letter dated DATE , which was posted on DATE , the applicant sent her first submissions to the ORG . In these she set out the object of her application , including the underlying facts and her complaints , and enclosed copies of all relevant court decisions . The completed application form dated DATE , in which the applicant referred to her first submissions , reached ORG .", "Sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ( GPE ) provide for the imposition of a penal order , without a trial , in cases concerning minor offences . ORG may lodge a motion to ORG to issue a penal order , setting out the offence the accused is charged with and fixing the sentence . The judge must issue the penal order if there are no grounds for refusing it , that is , if he has no objections to deciding without a trial hearing , agrees with the legal assessment of the case and does not wish to impose a different sentence . The written penal order must contain a reference to the fact that the penal order should be final , binding and enforceable if the accused fails to lodge a written objection with ORG or have such an objection taken down in writing at the court \u2019s registry within DATE of service .", "If the objection reaches the court within the prescribed time - limit , normal trial proceedings are instituted , and ORG conducts a hearing . If the accused was prevented from complying with the time - limit through no fault of his own , a motion to have the proceedings reinstated may be brought . According to Sections DATE of the Code of Criminal Procedure this motion must reach ORG within DATE from the cessation of the impediment due to which the objection could not be lodged in time . The facts justifying the motion shall be substantiated at the time the motion is filed or during the proceedings concerning the motion .", "Pursuant to Section CARDINAL of LAW the service of documents is governed by Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( Zivilproze\u00dfordnung ) . If a document can not be served personally , it may be deposited , inter alia , at the local post office . In that case a written notice of deposit must be left at the recipient \u2019s address in the manner customary for ordinary letters .", "Section CARDINALa of LAW provides that if a decision is served on the accused , the defence counsel must be informed thereof at the same time and must be provided with a copy of this decision , even if there is no written power of attorney in the case file .", "The defence counsel \u2019s right of access to the case file is governed by Section CARDINAL of LAW . A defence counsel is entitled to consult the case file as a whole as soon as the preliminary investigation has been terminated and , in principle , also during the preliminary investigation , if the purpose of the investigation is not endangered thereby . During the preliminary investigation , it is for ORG to decide whether or not to grant access to the file ; thereafter it is for the president of the trial court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
