DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Snejana Botoucharova", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG , and their Co - agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant spent his childhood , youth and part of his adult life in GPE , where he was educated within the field of business economics . He arrived in GPE on DATE at DATE CARDINAL . He married a NORP citizen on DATE and CARDINAL children were born out of marriage in DATE and DATE , respectively . The applicant , who speaks LANGUAGE , was employed in a computer firm . The spouses separated in DATE , and with the applicant \u2019s consent the mother was granted custody of the children . The applicant regularly had access to the children . On DATE the spouses divorced .", "In the meantime , on DATE the applicant was arrested and charged pursuant to LAW with drug offences and an armed bank robbery .", "The drug offences were allegedly committed during the period from DATE and related to CARDINAL ecstasy pills , QUANTITY of amphetamine and QUANTITY of cocaine .", "As regards the bank robbery committed on DATE , the applicant was allegedly the instigator who , at the relevant time being DATE , had persuaded CARDINAL younger men , respectively CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , to participate . The CARDINAL youngest men entered the bank with a sawn - off sporting gun and the third acted as the chauffeur , while the applicant awaited them all at an appointed place . The proceeds in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) , equal to MONEY ( ORG ) , were split equally between them . The applicant pleaded guilty to the charges and was accordingly found guilty on DATE by ORG . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and expelled from GPE with a life - long ban on his return . As regards the expulsion order , ORG took into account the nature and seriousness of the crime committed , the applicant \u2019s age when he entered GPE , the fact that he was separated and had CARDINAL children in GPE , and that his parents and CARDINAL brothers lived in GPE . The court found that a decision to expel the applicant would not contravene the principle of proportionality .", "On appeal , the judgment was upheld on DATE by the High ORG ) , which stated as follows :", "\u201c Having regard to the character of the offences and the information concerning [ the applicant \u2019s ] role in the robbery and its planning [ ORG ] confirms the sentence as fixed by ORG .", "Furthermore , for the reasons set out by ORG , [ ORG ] agrees with the expulsion order . Having made an overall assessment , which included [ the applicant \u2019s ] ties to his home country , [ the applicant \u2019s ] relationship with his children can not imply that the expulsion is contrary to the principle of proportionality . \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s request to be granted leave to appeal against the judgment to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) was refused on DATE .", "Having been released on parole , with DATE remaining of his sentence , the applicant left GPE on DATE .", "The applicant submitted that while incarcerated in GPE he had telephone contact with his children DATE and that subsequent to his expulsion they have been in DATE telephone contact .", "The relevant provisions of LAW applicable at the time read as follows :", "CARDINAL . Any person who , in contravention of the legislation on euphoriant drugs , supplies such drugs to a considerable number of persons , or in return for a large payment , or in any other particularly aggravating circumstances , shall be liable to imprisonment for any term not DATE . If the supply relates to a considerable quantity of a particularly dangerous or harmful drug , or if the supply of such drug has otherwise been of a particularly dangerous nature , the penalty may be increased to imprisonment for any term not exceeding DATE .", "CARDINAL . Similar punishment shall apply to any person who , in contravention of the legislation on euphoriant drugs , imports , exports , buys , distributes , receives , produces , manufactures or possesses such drugs with the intention to supply them as mentioned in subsection CARDINAL , above .", "CARDINAL . Any person who , for the purpose of obtaining for himself or for others an unlawful gain , by violence or threat of immediate application of such ,", "( i ) takes or extorts from any other person a tangible object belonging to another person ; or ...", "With regard to the level of punitive measures the Government submitted the following information , which was not disputed by the applicant :", "In GPE DATE of imprisonment is a very severe sentence . According to ORG , DATE ( ORG , report no . CARDINAL , p.CARDINAL ) , while the NORP countries had CARDINAL prisoners per CARDINAL CARDINAL inhabitants on average in DATE , the figure for GPE was DATE . The reason for this low number of prisoners is an extensive use of fines and other types of non - custodial sentences . According to figures from the yearbook on crime statistics from GPE ( PERSON ) in DATE , out of the total number of convictions for penal - code - offences , CARDINAL were fines , CARDINAL per cent were suspended sentences and other non - custodial sentences , leaving CARDINAL of the sentences to be unsuspended prison sentences .", "The low prison rate is also a result of short prison terms . In DATE , the average length of prison sentences imposed for penal - code - offences was CARDINAL DATE , and only MONEY of all prison sentences were longer than DATE . Looking at the even longer prison terms from DATE , MONEY \u2014 corresponding to CARDINAL prison sentences \u2014 exceeded DATE . Most of the long prison sentences are imposed for homicide and drug offences . As for armed robbery of a non - aggravated nature ( section FAC , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ) , a study has revealed that the average length of all prison sentences imposed from DATE was DATE if the person had no prior criminal record , but had committed other offences which were included in the sentence . In DATE the average length of all prison sentences for non - aggravated bank robbery was DATE . However , most bank robbery cases involve offenders with a prior criminal record .", "As for supplying drugs , the length of the prison sentence is closely related to the quantity and the kind of drugs in question . Drug dealing with ecstasy , amphetamine and cocaine does not normally result in heavy measures as , for instance , heroine does . To give an example , a person charged with the sale of QUANTITY ecstasy pills would most likely face a CARDINAL to QUANTITY months\u2019", "The relevant provisions of LAW ( GPE ) applicable at the time read as follows :", "CARDINAL .
