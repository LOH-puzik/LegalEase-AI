The domestic courts justified the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention in its initial phase by the existence of strong evidence against him and the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed , as well as by the need to secure the proper course of the proceedings . During that time , an autopsy , a number of unspecified biological tests and an inspection of the crime scene were carried out . At the later stage of the applicant \u2019s detention , the authorities referred to the severity of the sentence likely to be imposed on him . In addition , they emphasised that the investigation could not be completed for reasons beyond the prosecutor \u2019s control , namely delays in obtaining expert reports and in viewing the applicant \u2019s testimony recorded on video tape .", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW of DATE Criminal Procedure ( \u201c the Code \u201d ) , which entered into force on DATE , a party to criminal proceedings can lodge a cassation appeal with ORG against any final decision of an appellate court which had terminated criminal proceedings . The cassation appeal has to be lodged and signed by an advocate , on pain of being declared inadmissible . The relevant part of LAW provides :", "\u201c A cassation appeal may be lodged only on the grounds referred to in LAW [ these include a number of procedural irregularities , such as , for instance , incorrect composition of the trial court ; lack of legal assistance in cases where such assistance was compulsory ; breach of the rules governing jurisdiction in criminal matters ; trying a person in absentia in cases where his presence was obligatory and thus depriving him of an opportunity to defend himself , etc . ] or on the ground of another flagrant breach of law provided that the judicial decision in question was affected as a result of that breach .

Pursuant to LAW , a cassation appeal has to be lodged with the appellate court competent to carry out an initial examination of its admissibility within DATE from the date of service of the judgment of the appellate court with its written grounds on the party or , if the party has been represented , on his or her lawyer .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the LAW , an accused may appoint a lawyer to represent him or her in criminal proceedings .

A new decision on legal aid has to be made if the convicted person wishes to institute further proceedings in order to lodge a cassation appeal with ORG . The relevant part of LAW of the LAW provides :", "\u201c A defence counsel appointed under the legalaid scheme in the cassation proceedings ... shall prepare and sign a cassation appeal ... or shall inform the court , in writing , that he or she has not found any grounds for lodging a cassation appeal ...

In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( V ORG CARDINAL , OSNKW CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG stated that cassation proceedings had a special character in that the judgment essentially became final after it had been upheld by the appellate court . Bearing in mind the special character of these proceedings , the court was of the view that at this stage the mere fact that the convicted person was granted legal aid was sufficient to ensure an effective exercise of his or her defence rights . It was the lawyer \u2019s task to analyse the case and establish whether there were grounds on which to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the appellate court . If the lawyer was of the opinion that there were no grounds on which to do so , there was no legal basis in LAW that would either oblige the lawyer to prepare such an appeal against his or her better judgment , or oblige the court to assign another lawyer to prepare such an appeal in the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that the refusal of a legalaid lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal did not constitute a valid ground for granting retrospective leave to lodge such an appeal by another lawyer out of time ( V ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of DATE . ORG observed that the court could only assign a new legal - aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success . If this were not the case , a court was not obliged to assign a new legal - aid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal ( III KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG changed its previous position concerning the date from which the timelimit for lodging of a cassation appeal started to run ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It examined a particular situation where a legal - aid lawyer had refused to represent a convicted person for the purposes of cassation proceedings , finding that a cassation appeal would offer no prospects of success . It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the time - limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer \u2019s refusal and not on DATE when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself . It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with the legal - aid lawyer \u2019s refusal had a right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for an effective lodging of a cassation appeal ( III KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG reiterated its position in a decision of DATE and in a number of similar decisions given in DATE . It observed that there had been certain discrepancies in the judicial practice as to the manner in which the time - limit in such situations was calculated , but the strand of the case - law launched by the decision given in DATE was both dominant and correct , and also accepted by doctrine as providing to the defendants adequate procedural guarantees of access to ORG within a reasonable time - frame ( II KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
