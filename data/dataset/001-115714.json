The applicants are natives of , or descendants of natives of LOC , sometimes referred to as \u201c Ilois \u201d or \u201c NORP \u201d . They are resident largely in GPE , the GPE and GPE . Letters of authority have been received from CARDINAL applicants and are contained in the file . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The Chagos Islands are in the middle of LOC , comprising CARDINAL main island groups ( LOC the largest with a land area of QUANTITY , GPE of about QUANTITY km\u00b2 and ORG of TIME ) and consisting of CARDINAL islands in total . Since DATE they have been part of a colony of GPE . Until DATE they were administered as part of ORG , which is QUANTITY to the south - south - west .", "CARDINAL . According to materials in the file , the first visitors to the islands were NORP , NORP and NORP in DATE . There were at that time no human inhabitants . The first settlers , probably LANGUAGE , began coconut ( copra ) plantations , which were to be the basis of the islands\u2019 economy for the future . The islands passed to NORP rule from DATE . At the beginning of DATE there was a floating population of CARDINAL families of NORP , NORP and NORP origin , although most regarded themselves as permanent residents . The copra production company provided living quarters but the ORG people as they were known generally preferred to build their own thatched cottages . There was no electricity , sanitation or other infrastructure . The men and women who worked on the plantations received a monetary wage but the chief payment was barter . Copra workers also fished and most families had small kitchen gardens and reared chickens and ducks . During DATE which followed there was movement of workers between the islands and GPE and the GPE under contract to the plantation company , while there were other inhabitants who had been born on the island and whose families went back several generations . By DATE the islands\u2019 population was in decline , due to low wages , monotonous work , the lack of facilities and the great distance from GPE and the GPE , while the plantations were suffering from a lack of investment . In DATE , when ORG acquired the plantations , the settlement population was a very small community of CARDINAL , settled on the CARDINAL main islands . No one had lived on the outer islands for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE discussions started between ORG and GPE over the establishment of NORP defence facilities in the region . It was envisaged from the beginning that any inhabitants would be transferred or resettled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the NORP LOC ( BIOT ) Order in Council ( SI CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) established a new colony , which included LOC and other islands formerly part of ORG and of the GPE . The order created the office of the Commissioner of ORG and bestowed on him the power to \u201c make laws for the peace , order and good government of the Territory \u201d . Those inhabitants of ORG who had been citizens of GPE by virtue of their birth or connection with the islands when they were part of GPE retained their citizenship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , GPE and ORG agreed that the latter should have use of the islands of ORG for defence purposes for an indefinite period with provision for a review in DATE . ORG acquired the land and interests held by the plantation company that owned most of the property on the islands . Internal documents indicated that it was considered expedient to treat the islands as having no \" permanent population \" with a view to avoiding difficulties with ORG as regards , inter alia , obligations under LAW to protect the population and foster independence . The company continued to run the plantations under a lease until GPE needed vacant possession . After obtaining congressional approval , ORG gave notice that LOC would be required in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The evacuation of the islands was effected DATE . Some islanders were prevented from returning after visits elsewhere , others were transferred either to GPE or to the GPE . For a while some islanders were given alternative accommodation on outlying islands . In DATE , the GPE construction teams arrived on LOC . Houses were demolished . No force was used but the islanders were told that the company was closing down its activities and that unless they accepted transportation elsewhere , they would be left without supplies .", "CARDINAL . In the various bodies of ORG where the matter was discussed , ORG claimed that the population had consisted of migrant workers , that their position had been fully protected and that they had been consulted in the process .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG Commissioner enacted the Immigration Ordinance DATE , No . CARDINAL of DATE which made it unlawful , and a criminal offence , for anyone to enter or remain in the territory without a permit .", "CARDINAL . The islanders suffered miserable conditions on being uprooted , having lost their homes and livelihoods . In DATE , GPE paid MONEY ( GBP ) to the newly independent Government of GPE to assist with the costs of resettlement . This sum was distributed , with interest , by the GPE authorities in DATE after discussions on how best to use the money . The islanders rejected a proposed resettlement plan in favour of a cash distribution to CARDINAL families . No compensation was paid to the evacuees on the GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , PERSON , a NORP , brought a case in ORG in GPE concerning the expulsions ( \u201c the GPE case \u201d ) . In DATE , the ORG made an open offer to settle the claims of all the islanders . In DATE , a settlement was reached in which the ORG agreed to pay ORG CARDINAL to ORG , which in turn agreed to put in land to the value of ORG CARDINAL . A trust fund ( \u201c the Fund \u201d ) was set up by ORG and DATE payment was made to CARDINAL NORP in GPE of GBP CARDINAL each . ORG provided some low cost housing . Nothing was paid to the NORP on the GPE , who numbered CARDINAL and who apparently played no part in the negotiations . The applicants later claimed that they were unaware that the settlement involved any renunciation of their rights to return to their homeland . On the receipt of the last tranche of money , all but CARDINAL of the identified islanders or the descendants who refused , had signed or thumbprinted renunciation forms in LANGUAGE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , PERSON , a Chagos Islander , brought an action in GPE , challenging the validity of the DATE Immigration Ordinance which had the effect of excluding the islanders from ORG ( \u201c FAC case \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG in its judgment noted inter alia that none of the islanders owned any land or held any right to permanent use of the land , which was held by the ORG . It went on however to find that the LAW was ultra vires the DATE Order , since the power to make legislation for \" peace , order and good government \" did not permit legislation to exclude the population from the territory . It issued a declaration that the GPE was invalid . There was no appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Foreign Secretary announced that they were examining the feasibility of resettlement of the islanders and that they intended to issue a new immigration ordinance which would allow them to return to the outer islands while observing their treaty obligations with GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Commissioner of ORG revoked the DATE Immigration Ordinance and made ORG , which largely repeated the provisions of the previous ordinance but contained a new section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) which provided that restrictions on entry or residence should ( with the exception of LOC ) not apply to anyone who was GPE by virtue of connection with ORG . Entry to PERSON remained subject to permit .", "CARDINAL . Despite the lifting of the immigration bar , none of the islanders went to live in the islands . A few made visits to outer islands to tend family graves or see their former homes , such visits being funded by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , islanders ( a total of CARDINAL claimants ) commenced group litigation against the Attorney - General , to secure compensation for past and continuing wrongs and to seek a declaration of their right to return to PERSON ( \u201c the NORP case \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr Justice PERSON struck out the action on the grounds that the claim to more compensation after the settlement in the GPE case was an abuse of process , that the facts did not give rise to any arguable causes of action in private law and in any event all the claims were statute - barred . He rejected arguments that LAW did not apply as the applicants had been subject to a disability ( for instance , impoverishment or being outside the jurisdiction ) and considered that there had been no deliberate concealment of facts relevant to the individual causes of action which could affect the calculation of the time - limit . He also accepted the defendant \u2019s arguments that the islanders who had accepted money from the ORG and signed a form renouncing further claims would be in abuse if they continued the proceedings . He held that it was generally known in GPE at the time that LAW was final and did not consider that they had reasonable prospects of showing that the Government had acted in a morally culpable manner leading to an oppressive transaction from which the claimants should be relieved . The islanders had had at the time legal representation or access to legal representation . He also found that the GPE NORP knew the same relevant facts at the same time as their counterparts in GPE . The islanders had owned no immovable property nor owned their houses . Even if any property rights had existed , he noted that these would have been extinguished DATE after events by operation of section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused permission to appeal . While it was accepted that there were arguments of disability and unconscionability , nonetheless from DATE onwards those circumstances no longer applied . Nor had the applicants succeeded in showing any deliberate concealment since that time . It rejected the arguments of the islanders that the renunciation forms could not be relied on by the Government as they were unable to compromise or renounce their fundamental rights . It concluded :", "\" This judgment brings to an end the quest of the displaced inhabitants of LOC and their descendants for legal redress against the state directly responsible for expelling them from their homeland . They have not gone without compensation , but what they have received has done little to repair the wrecking of families and communities , to restore their self - respect or to make amends for the underhand official conduct now publicly revealed by the documentary record . Their claim in this action has been not only for damages but for declarations seeking their right to return . The causes of action , however , are geared to the recovery of damages and no separate claims to declaratory relief have been developed before us . It may not be too late to make return possible , but such an outcome is a function of economic resources and political will , not adjudication . \"", "CARDINAL . Newspaper articles appeared in GPE suggesting that the NORP and their supporters were planning some form of direct action by landings on the island . As later described in domestic court judgments , the participants had varying aims ; for CARDINAL group known as ORG it was part of an anti - NORP campaign to close the base at LOC . Others did not want the base closed as it might offer employment but since permanent resettlement on the islands was not practicable without substantial investment , the landings , even if they led to temporary camps , would largely be gestures in furtherance of respective political aims , designed to attract publicity and embarrass ORG and GPE . Contacts with GPE authorities made it clear that their view was that any attempt to resettle any of the islands would severely compromise PERSON security , and have a deleterious impact on military operations . To them LOC was a vital and indispensable platform for global GPE military operations , as demonstrated by its important role in Operations Enduring Freedom and NORP Freedom as well as its continuing role in the Global War on Terrorism ; in particular it had unique and exceptional security from armed attack , intelligence collection , surveillance and monitoring and electronic jamming .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the BIOT ( LAW Order DATE was issued . It declared that no person had the right of abode in the territory or the right to enter it except as authorised . The same day there passed into law the BIOT ( Immigration ) Order CARDINAL , repealing the CARDINAL Ordinance . This prohibited anyone from entering the territory without a permit from the immigration officer ( members of the armed forces , public officers and contractors working on the NORP base were exempt or deemed to hold a permit ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government issued a statement announcing the abandonment of the feasibility study into resettlement . It stated that the report by independent experts had concluded that :", "\" whilst it may be feasible to resettle the islands in the short - term , the costs of maintaining long - term inhabitation are likely to be prohibitive . Even in the short - term , natural events such as periodic flooding from storms and seismic activity are likely to make life difficult for a resettled population ... Human interference within the atolls , however well managed , is likely to exacerbate stress on the marine and terrestrial environment and will accelerate the effects of global warming . Thus resettlement is likely to become less feasible over time . \"", "CARDINAL . With reference to climate change the report was quoted as stating that \" the main issue facing a resettled population on the low - lying islands will be flooding events , which are likely to increase in periodicity and intensity and will not only threaten infrastructure , but also the freshwater aquifers and agricultural production . Severe events may even threaten life . \" It also highlighted the implications on such low - lying islands of the predicted increase in global sea levels .", "CARDINAL . The statement concluded that anything other than short - term resettlement on a purely subsistence basis would be highly precarious and involve expensive underwriting by the Government for an open - ended period , probably permanently . Accordingly , the Government considered that there was no further purpose in pursuing the study and it would be impossible to promote or even permit resettlement to take place . It was for this reason that the Orders in Council were issued to restore full immigration control over all the islands in ORG , making it clear that no person had the right of abode in the territory or unrestricted access to it .", "CARDINAL . Much of the area had meanwhile apparently been declared an Environmental Zone , with ORG and Strict Nature Reserves .", "CARDINAL . One of the applicants , PERSON , instituted judicial review proceedings seeking to challenge the DATE Orders barring their return to the islands as unlawful ( the \u201c LAW case \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG upheld his claims , finding that the provisions of the Orders were invalid as not being in the interests of the NORP . The Secretary of ORG for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs appealed , claiming that legislation precluded any attack on the validity of colonial orders in council and that the orders as a sovereign act of the ORG were only challengeable on ground of incompatibility with imperial legislation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal , finding that the prerogative power of colonial governance enjoyed no generic immunity from judicial review and that the permanent exclusion of an entire population from its homeland for reasons unconnected with their collective well - being could not have the character of a valid act of governance . Lord Justice PERSON considered that while resettlement would be difficult if not impossible without capital expenditure , it had not been suggested on either side that GPE was under any obligation to fund it . It was the bolting of the door to the ORG home , not the failure to provide transport there or to refurbish it which was in issue . Indeed the ORG had rights as a landowner which were capable of answering any attempt to resettle there .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG obtained leave to appeal to ORG . In its judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the appeal by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . The majority considered that there had been no legitimate expectation that the islanders would be allowed to resettle on the islands . LAW had no application to ORG , as the declaration made in respect of GPE lapsed when it became independent . There was no basis for holding that the prerogative power of the ORG was limited to acts in the interests of the inhabitants and there was nothing irrational about the orders . Seen in the context of the present day , rather than DATE , any right of abode of the islanders was purely symbolic . None had gone to live on the islands in DATE when the DATE ordinance had been in force . The islanders\u2019 way of life had been irreparably destroyed and the practicalities were such that they would be unable to exercise any right to live on the outer islands without financial support which the Government were not willing to provide . Any attempt to exercise the right of abode by setting up some camp on the islands would be a symbol or gesture aimed at putting pressure on the Government . Thus , when considering the rights in issue in the case , which had to be weighed against the defence and diplomatic interests of the state , it was essentially about the right to protest in a particular way and it was not unreasonable of the Government to seek to avoid an unauthorised settlement on the islands which could be used as a means of exerting pressure to compel it to fund a resettlement . Funding had been the subtext of the case .", "CARDINAL . Lord GPE , in the minority , considered that legal precedent negated the existence of a prerogative power to exile an indigenous population from its homeland . The orders were also irrational in the sense that there was no good reason for making them , the security arguments being weak and vague . The argument that the islanders were deprived of a right of little practical value provided no justification , since the right was of intangible value and the smaller its practical value the less reason to take it away . Additionally , in his view , the orders contradicted a clear representation by the Secretary of ORG in his statement of CARDINAL DATE , from which the Government could not resile without compelling reason , which had not been shown ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
