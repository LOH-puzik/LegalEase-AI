He also argued that the applicant \u2019s fingerprint had been secured in the absence of an expert and that the police had sought an expert examination ex post facto . He maintained that expert report PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been unclear and imprecise because it had contained no information as to the manner and circumstances under which that fingerprint had been secured . Furthermore , it would have been impossible for the applicant to manipulate the packages with CARDINAL finger . He further argued that no fingerprints had been found on the padlock and the cellar where the drugs had been found .", "CARDINAL . He also challenged the expert examination of the substance found in the packages , arguing that the latter had been too small to contain compacted material in the quantity indicated in the expert report ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In this connection he argued that it had not been established the place and person who had determined the quantity of the substance . He also submitted that the expert examinations had been carried out in his absence . Furthermore , he challenged whether the substance found had been pure heroin . In this connection he also stated :", "\u201c I think that the problem [ arising from ] the practice that the prosecuting body also carries out expert examinations means that the evidence [ obtained thereby ] is not impartial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court convicted the applicant , who had a previous criminal record ( suspended prison sentence for an act of violence ) , of drug trafficking and sentenced him to CARDINAL - and - a - half years\u2019 imprisonment .

The expert examination confirmed that the fingerprint , which had been found and secured during the on - site examination , corresponded to the accused \u2019s right middle finger ...", "The court examined the arguments presented by the defense .... , but it finds that they are unsubstantiated because the court established ... that the written evidence , notably the record concerning the search of home and other LOC had been drawn up in lawful procedure in the presence of CARDINAL witnesses and on the basis of a search warrant issued earlier . The attending witnesses are neighbours who were present there by accident and whom [ the applicant \u2019s father ] knew .

Accordingly it is irrelevant that the drugs were found in the cellar belonging to a third person .", "The court examined the statement produced by [ the applicant \u2019s father ] according to which the police officers had pushed his son against the metal sheet where drugs had been put and that , in order not to fall down , he had touched ( the packages ) but it gave no weight because the responsible police officers acted in compliance with their official duty and after they had found the drugs they photographed him next to ( the packages ) . There was no reason for them to push the accused or to secure evidence with the use of force .

He reiterated his complaints regarding the quality and reliability of the fingerprint expert evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In this connection he complained about the trial court \u2019s failure to examine the police officers who had secured his fingerprint in his absence , as well as the experts who had drawn up report S\u041a-CARDINAL/CARDINAL and requested that they be examined . He further argued that the trial court could not have validly based its judgment on those expert examinations since they had been carried out by the Bureau , a body that operated within ORG , which had set in motion the criminal proceedings against him . Accordingly , the examinations had been biased . He also sought to have alternative expert examinations conducted . That concerned both the fingerprint expert evidence , which according to him , had been the sole evidence linking him with the drugs , as well as the expert examination of the substance . As to the latter examination , he reiterated his complaints raised in the concluding remarks ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also requested that the court examines the neighbours ( providing their names and addresses ) who had attended the search regarding his allegations that his fingerprint found on CARDINAL of the packages had been the result of an argument which he had had in the cellar with the police after he had refused to comply with their order to touch the packages .", "CARDINAL .
