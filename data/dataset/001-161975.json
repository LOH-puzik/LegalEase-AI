She is the cousin of PERSON , who was shot dead by police officers on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL suicide bombers detonated explosions on the GPE transport network . CARDINAL of the suicide bombers were on underground trains and CARDINAL was on a bus . CARDINAL people , including the CARDINAL suicide bombers , were killed in the attack and many more were injured .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) initiated a major police investigation to establish the identities of persons involved in or otherwise connected with the explosions . Available intelligence indicated that terrorists were actively planning a further attack within DATE and the threat level posed to GPE from international terrorism was raised from LAW to Level CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , precisely DATE after the first bombings , CARDINAL explosive devices were discovered in rucksacks left on CARDINAL underground trains and on CARDINAL bus . As it was feared that the failed bombers would regroup TIME and attempt to detonate further explosions , the ORG immediately launched an operation to find them ( Operation THESEUS CARDINAL ) . This operation was led , as ORG , by Police Commander PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE Commander PERSON was informed that intelligence had identified PERSON as a suspect in the failed bombings of DATE . Both PERSON and another suspect were thought to be living in an apartment at CARDINAL FAC , GPE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE Commander PERSON decided to mount surveillance operations at both FAC and another GPE address . The overall aim of the operation at CARDINAL FAC was to establish whether the suspects were present in the apartment and to arrest them safely if they came out . Commander PERSON \u2019s strategy for this operation was not recorded ; however , it would appear to have been to control the premises at FAC through covert surveillance , to follow persons leaving the LOC until it was felt safe to challenge them , and then to stop them . In order to implement this strategy his plan was that a surveillance team from SOCARDINAL ( Special Branch ) should be in attendance at FAC . They were to be supported by a unit from ORG , a ORG branch of the ORG . The unit from ORG consisted of highly trained Special Firearms Officers ( \u201c SFOs \u201d ) who were usually deployed on pre - planned operations . Although some surveillance officers were armed for their own protection and that of the public , their training did not enable them to be used as a resource to arrest armed suspects . ORG would normally undertake this task , although armed officers from SOCARDINAL could be used for this purpose as a last resort .", "CARDINAL . The Crown Prosecution Service ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) Review Note later found that if Commander PERSON \u2019s strategy had been followed ( notably , had the team from ORG been deployed in time to support the surveillance teams at FAC ) , events would not have unfolded as they did .", "CARDINAL . Commander PERSON appointed Commander PERSON as the Designated Senior Officer ( \u201c DSO \u201d ) in charge who was to be responsible for achieving the ORG CARDINAL strategy safely . As such , she had responsibility for the operation at CARDINAL FAC on DATE . She was based in Control Room CARDINAL , where she was supported by ORG , an experienced ORG from ORG who was acting as her tactical adviser .", "CARDINAL . Detective Chief Inspector C ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) was appointed as Silver Commander for the operation at FAC . Although a Silver Commander would normally have ultimate responsibility for the management of an incident and deployment of firearms resources , on this occasion the DSO retained this responsibility and ORG operated as the ORG \u2019s ground commander . ORG was supported by and accompanied on the ground by Trojan CARDINAL , who , like Trojan CARDINAL , was an experienced FAC from ORG who was acting as a tactical adviser . PERSON was in charge of the ORG team to be deployed and he was in direct contact with ORG .", "CARDINAL . Detective Superintendent PERSON ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the Senior Investigating Officer for the investigation into the identity of the persons responsible for the bombings on DATE , was also appointed as a Silver Commander .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE a surveillance team from SOCARDINAL was called out . No request was made at this stage for a unit from ORG .", "CARDINAL . By TIME CARDINAL surveillance teams from SOCARDINAL had been deployed to FAC address to control the LOC and to follow anyone coming out of the apartments . CARDINAL FAC was accessed by the same doorway as CARDINAL FAC and the surveillance teams were stationed in an observation van which had a view of that doorway .", "CARDINAL . The Anti - Terrorist Branch of the ORG ( \u201c SOCARDINAL \u201d ) deployed CARDINAL officers to assist with any arrest and to gain intelligence . ORG was the link between ORG and SOCARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . At TIME Commander PERSON held a briefing during which the firearms strategy was outlined . PERSON was present at the briefing together with the Silver Commanders for the surveillance operations at FAC and the second GPE address . The PERSON arrived at TIME ; however , Commander PERSON spoke to her after the briefing to ensure she had all the information and assistance she needed .", "CARDINAL . As they had not been called out earlier ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , SFOs from ORG were allocated to the operation when they reported for duty . At TIME PERSON CARDINAL briefed the SFOs . The briefing was not recorded but he appears to have told the team that they \u201c may be required to use unusual tactics because of the environment they were in and that they should think about this \u201d . When asked for clarification PERSON CARDINAL added that , in relation to a critical shot , the instruction would come directly from the DSO . However , if they were deployed to intercept a subject and there was an opportunity to challenge but the subject was non - compliant , a critical shot could be taken . The ORG later found that this briefing \u201c stoked the [ SFOs ] fears that they would meet suicide bombers and that they may have to shoot such people \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following the briefing the unit from ORG travelled to a police station at FAC , which was QUANTITY from FAC . They stopped off for petrol on the way . Upon arrival they received a further briefing from ORG , which commenced at TIME The briefing was not recorded but it appears that ORG confirmed the terrorists had the capacity to attach a device to themselves that would be difficult to detect . He described the individuals involved in the bombings as being \u201c deadly and determined \u201d and \u201c up for it \u201d . The ORG later criticised this briefing as unbalanced as ORG had failed to caution the SFOs that not everyone they would stop leaving FAC would be a suicide bomber and that they should not overreact in the heat of the moment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The team from PERSON was not deployed on the ground until after TIME", "CARDINAL . PERSON was a NORP national who lived at CARDINAL FAC . At TIME he left his apartment building through the common doorway in order to go to work . An officer in the surveillance van saw Mr PERSON , described him and suggested \u201c it would be worth someone else having a look \u201d . However , as the unit from ORG had not yet reached FAC it was not possible to stop PERSON at this stage ( as per the strategy outlined at paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Instead , he was followed by the surveillance officers .", "CARDINAL . On leaving FAC Mr de Menezes walked a short distance to a bus stop and got on a bus heading towards FAC . The ORG on the bus did not capture the entire journey due to vibrations but PERSON was recorded as being on the bus by TIME At this point the surveillance team described him as \u201c a good possible likeness \u201d to PERSON . By CARDINAL a.m. the description had changed to \u201c not identical \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At TIME got off the bus . He was then seen using his mobile phone before running back to the bus and reboarding .", "CARDINAL . There are conflicting accounts of whether a positive identification was made of PERSON as the suspect at this stage . It appears from ORG of ORG ( the \u201c ORG DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) that those on the ground had not been able to identify PERSON as PERSON . The fact that FAC refers to him at each entry as being an \u201c U / I [ unidentified ] male \u201d lends some support to this position . Nevertheless , those in Control Room CARDINAL appear to have believed that a positive identification of PERSON had been made .", "CARDINAL . At around the time that PERSON reboarded the bus the unit from ORG began to make its way towards ORG . The ORG team leader later told the ORG that he heard over the radio that \u201c it was definitely our man and that he was nervous and twitchy \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the surveillance teams were asked to give a percentage indication of the likelihood that Mr PERSON was the suspect and they replied that it was \u201c impossible [ to do so ] but thought that it was [ the ] suspect \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON got off the bus at GPE and walked towards GPE underground station . There were several surveillance officers in the vicinity and their leader offered to stop Mr PERSON before he entered the station . The ORG initially ordered that they perform the stop , having been informed that the unit from ORG was not yet in a position to intervene . However , almost immediately thereafter she was informed that the unit was on hand . As a consequence , she countermanded her original order and instructed the SFOs to stop PERSON . By this time Mr de PERSON was already in the underground station . PERSON CARDINAL relayed the order to the SFOs , informing them that \u201c they want us to stop the subject getting on the tube \u201d . The SFOs were told that they were going to Code Red , which meant that they were to have ultimate control of the situation and that an armed interception was imminent .", "CARDINAL . The ORG at the station shows PERSON entering the station at TIME wearing a thin denim jacket , a T - shirt and denim jeans , walking calmly and not carrying anything . He went down an escalator and onto a platform . There is no ORG recording of the lower end of the escalator or of the platform : the relevant tapes , when seized by the ORG , were blank . The ORG and the ORG later found that this was because a cable had been damaged during recent refurbishment works .", "CARDINAL . At TIME a number of SFOs entered GPE underground station and ran down the escalators . At TIME they followed Mr de PERSON onto the platform . Eyewitness accounts as to what exactly happened next are conflicting and some of the witnesses gave accounts which it is now known could not have been accurate . However , it would appear from the accounts quoted in the ORG that : Mr PERSON went into the third coach of a stationary train and sat down ; CARDINAL of the surveillance officers shouted to the SFOs that PERSON was there ; PERSON stood up , arms down ; he was pushed back onto his seat and pinned down by CARDINAL police officers ; according to CARDINAL witness his hand may have moved towards the left hand side of his trouser waistband ; and CARDINAL SFOs ( PERSON and PERSON ) shot PERSON several times and killed him .", "CARDINAL . Within DATE of the shooting , after it had become apparent that Mr de PERSON had not been involved in the attempted terror attacks on CARDINAL DATE , the Commissioner of ORG , the Prime Minister and the Secretary of ORG expressed their profound regret at his death . A representative of the ORG travelled to meet his family in GPE and apologised directly to them on behalf of the police . An ex gratia payment was agreed upon to ensure that the family \u2019s financial needs were met . They were encouraged to take independent legal advice from a solicitor in GPE and they were advised that their legal costs in doing so would be met .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE and ORG Regulations CARDINAL required a police shooting to be referred to the ORG . However , following the shooting of PERSON the Commissioner of ORG wrote to ORG to inform it that he had decided not to refer the matter to the ORG at that time .", "CARDINAL . As it was not immediately clear that PERSON had not been connected to the attempted bombings , the Anti - Terrorist Branch initially retained primary control of the scene of the shooting . During this time ORG ( \u201c DPS \u201d ) , an independent section of the ORG which had been notified of the shooting at TIME on DATE , ensured the integrity of the scene , interviewed witnesses , and completed forensic retrieval .", "CARDINAL . After the shooting PERSON and PERSON had been taken to a police station . At TIME , having taken legal advice , they indicated that they would not be making statements at that time . Instead , they made their statements together at TIME DATE , after they had been told that PERSON was not connected to the attempted bombings . Some of the details they initially provided have since been either proved false or called into doubt . For example , they initially indicated that PERSON had been wearing a bulky jacket ( ORG footage showed him wearing a light denim jacket ) and that the officers from ORG had shouted \u201c armed police \u201d when they boarded the train ( the ORG considered such an action to be \u201c illogical \u201d when confronting a possible suicide bomber ) .", "CARDINAL . An officer from SOCARDINAL had seized the surveillance log at TIME on DATE . However , at TIME DATE it was handed back to the officers from the unit . Around this time an amendment appears to have been made to an entry ; the words \u201c a split second view of his face . I believe it was [ the suspect ] \u201d appear to have been altered to read \u201c I believe it was NOT [ the suspect ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the Anti - Terrorist Branch formally handed over control of the scene to the ORG as they were satisfied that Mr PERSON was not connected to the attempted bombings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a post - mortem examination took place and recorded the cause of death as \u201c multiple gunshot wounds to the head . The cause of death is severe disruption to the brain \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG formally referred the investigation to the ORG , whose investigation began on DATE when the ORG provided it with the relevant material in its possession . Because of the seriousness of DATE and the public interest in DATE the matter , the ORG determined that it would use its own staff to carry out the investigation . It was overseen by ORG personally and the investigating team possessed all the powers and privileges of a police constable carrying out an investigation .", "CARDINAL . The purpose of the investigation was to advise the ORG of any criminal offence that might have been committed ; to provide it with the evidence necessary to come to a decision about any prosecution ; to enable the \u201c responsible authorities \u201d of the officers concerned ( the ORG and ORG , or \u201c MPA \u201d ) to consider what disciplinary or other action they might need to take ; to inform the Secretary of ORG for ORG of the circumstances of Mr de Menezes\u2019 death ; and to assist the coroner in relation to any inquest .", "CARDINAL . In particular , the investigation by the ORG was to examine :", "a ) the information that led to the surveillance of the apartments at FAC ;", "b ) the command structure of the operation , including details of the numbers and types of specialist officers deployed and the tactics available to them ;", "c ) the qualification and training of those involved and their suitability to carry out their role ;", "d ) details of the briefing given to the officers involved and any description or photograph of any suspect made available ;", "e ) whether or not the operation was designated as a \u201c ORG \u201d operation ( the national strategy for dealing with suspected suicide bombers which permitted the use of lethal force if absolutely necessary ) and the policy , operational tactics and authority levels of \u201c ORG \u201d ;", "f ) the details of the mobile surveillance operation from FAC to GPE underground station ;", "g ) the details of police action once PERSON had reached ORG underground station ;", "h ) whether or not the policy and operational authorities of \u201c ORG \u201d were followed and were effective ; and", "i ) whether \u201c ORG \u201d was compliant with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was also to report on the actions and statements of the ORG from the time of the incident to the formal handover of the investigation to the ORG to ensure that the ORG investigation met its obligations under LAW .", "DATE . During the course of the investigation CARDINAL witness statements were taken from police , forensic experts and civilian witnesses and CARDINAL exhibits were collected . The family of PERSON , together with their legal representatives , were given regular detailed verbal briefings on the progress of the investigation and eventually on its conclusions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG investigating team submitted a report to the ORG indicating , inter alia , that certain officers might have committed criminal or disciplinary offences . The ORG therefore wrote to the ORG and to the ORG about the officers concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG was completed and submitted to the ORG . On DATE the legal representatives of Mr PERSON were briefed on the ORG investigation and report . ORG personnel also offered to travel to GPE to brief any member of his family residing there . On DATE the ORG submitted its recommendations to the ORG , ORG , Her ORG and to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The report considered all the witness statements and outlined in detail the events of DATE and the investigative steps which followed the shooting . In particular , it examined the actions and responsibility of the Commanders , their advisers and all the frontline SFOs and surveillance officers . While it accepted that the death of PERSON was not the result of any deliberate act designed to endanger the life of any innocent third party , it nevertheless concluded that :", "\u201c CARDINAL There can be no doubt that on the morning of DATE a combination of circumstances between TIME and ORG led to the killing of an entirely innocent man . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to this \u201c combination of circumstances \u201d , it identified a number of failings .", "CARDINAL . First , it criticised the briefings given by ORG and LAW :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL There is no doubt that the briefings provided by [ ORG and LAW ] included a comprehensive update on the intelligence including the links DATE and DATE and the possibility that the firearms officers may have to confront one of the terrorists who had survived the suicide bombings DATE . What the briefing for [ SOCARDINAL ] , and indeed the other teams , did not include was any rider about the circumstances in which the ORG policy could be used . That policy was CARDINAL option available to ORG for dealing with suspected terrorists and suicide bombers . The [ SOCARDINAL ] officers were not told that it should only be used as a matter of last resort when they were sure of the identity of the person in relation to whom the policy was to be applied . That should have been included in the briefing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Secondly , it criticised the failure to implement Commander PERSON \u2019s strategy by deploying the unit from ORG to ORG earlier :", "\u201c CARDINAL The management of the operation between CARDINAL:CARDINALhrs and CARDINAL:CARDINALhrs should have involved giving practical effect to the strategy devised by Commander MCDOWALL so that appropriate resources were in place at ORG from the earliest possible time . Commander PERSON was in charge of the operation following her briefing from Commander MCDOWALL . The policy , which is described at paragraphs PERSON and CARDINAL , was , in essence , CARDINAL of containment , stop and arrest . What occurred between CARDINAL:CARDINALhrs and CARDINAL:CARDINALhrs was a failure of that policy . Between CARDINAL:CARDINALhrs and CARDINAL:CARDINALhrs there was no adequate effort to put in place police resources at ORG that would have enabled ORG to give effect to the policy . During TIME there was a series of briefings . None of the CARDINAL people who left the flats before Mr DATE left were stopped in accordance with the strategy and when he left he was simply followed while ineffective attempts were made during the course of TIME to determine whether he was [ the suspect ] . If appropriate resources had been in place there would have been the opportunity to stop Mr DATE MENEZES during the course of his TIME walk from GPE ROAD before catching the bus in LOC .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL Detective Chief Inspector C , the Silver Commander , was effectively the ground commander with responsibility for SOCARDINAL , SOCARDINAL and [ SOCARDINAL ] officers . However owing to the fact that he was still with SOCARDINAL and [ SOCARDINAL ] at PERSON when Mr DATE left ORG , and stationary at FAC when DATE was identified as the suspect at BRIXTON , ORG was always playing \u2018 Catch up\u2019 in respect of the operation .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL ... evidence from the ORG at ORG underground station reveals that the [ SOCARDINAL ] officers did not enter the station until TIME after PERSON ORG ORG had passed though the ticket barriers .", "CARDINAL While TIME is a very short time period , the delay in [ SOCARDINAL ] getting to the scene and the failure to get a positive identification had enabled a person , believed to be a possible suspect for attempting to detonate a bomb on the underground system DATE before , to get on the same bus twice and enter an underground station . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , the report was critical of the delay in handing the investigation to the ORG :", "\u201c CARDINAL The pressures under which ORG were operating following the events of DATE and DATE are self - evident . However , the fact that the independent body established by an Act of ORG to investigate complaints and serious incidents involving the police , and which has independently investigated every fatal police shooting since DATE , was now to be excluded from the scene , is a major concern for an independent investigation , and should never occur again .", "CARDINAL The fact that there was such concern over the problems with the ORG tapes at ORG and the fact that the hard drives on the train were missing highlights the problem . This issue could have been resolved a lot earlier had they been under the control of the ORG .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL The failure to allow the ORG access has also been highlighted by the fact that the surveillance log DATE has been altered .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL Had the ORG been involved at the commencement of the investigation , the surveillance log would not have been released for amendments to be made . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the ORG found that high vibrations had interfered with the recording of most of the bus journey , the hard drive on the train had not been replaced on the relevant day , and the recording equipment in the station had been broken during prior refurbishments . Consequently , it concluded that there was \u201c no evidence of a cover - up to withhold this evidence from the investigation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , CARDINAL expert witnesses who examined the surveillance log could not agree either that it had been altered or , if it had been , who might have altered it .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report also identified a number of individuals whom the ORG might consider prosecuting .", "CARDINAL . As to the shooting of PERSON after he had been tackled on the train , the ORG noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL The actions of PERSON and PERSON should be considered in light of the DATE \u2019s events and those of DATE . At the briefing , they were supplied with a full briefing on the capabilities of the terror suspects . During the operation they had heard the man being followed was being identified as CARDINAL of the suspects from DATE attempted bombings . On arrival at PERSON , [ SOCARDINAL ] went to ORG , authorising a firearms intervention , following an order from the DSO to stop the man from entering the station and tube train .", "CARDINAL They had seen \u2018 Ivor\u2019 [ a surveillance officer from SOCARDINAL ] point at the suspect , who they saw get off his seat . \u2018 Ivor\u2019 then grabbed the man and forced him back to the seats . Both officers state they believed they had to act immediately to prevent loss of life to the people on the train .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL ORG and CARDINAL clearly believed they were acting in self - defence , and had the right in law to use the force they did . The [ ORG ] may wish to consider whether the actions of PERSON and PERSON amount to murder in the context of their justification for the shooting of Mr DATE and having regard to the fact that there were explanations given for the shooting at that time which did not accord with the accounts given TIME later .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL ... [ The ORG ] ... may also wish to consider whether they were grossly negligent to come to the conclusion that they were confronting a suicide bomber . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the role of the DSO , the ORG stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL The order given by Commander PERSON was to stop the suspect getting onto the underground station and subsequently the underground train . When interviewed she was asked to explain the word \u2018 Stop\u2019 and her response was that \u2018 Stop\u2019 is a common word in policing terms and it was meant as \u2018 stop and PERSON . This opinion is supported by ORG and LAW and DATE .", "CARDINAL However , the way the order was received by [ ORG ] must be considered . Following a full briefing , many of the [ SOCARDINAL ] officers have described that they believed that they would have to confront a suicide bomber . The [ SOCARDINAL ] officers have stated that they believed the man being followed on the bus had been identified as CARDINAL of the suspects for the failed bombings on DATE . They had been in a situation of trying to \u2018 Catch up\u2019 with the surveillance team since their briefing had finished . And as they approached PERSON underground station they hear that the suspect had entered the underground station and they received an order to stop him getting on the underground train . I do not believe that the use of the word \u2018 Stop\u2019 can be related to normal policing duties . With the mind - set of the [ SOCARDINAL ] officers believing that a suicide bomber had entered the underground station , to receive such an order to stop him from DSO can not be related to normal duties . They had not had the benefit of a rider to their briefing of the sort to which I refer at paragraph TIME . If they had received such a briefing they might have been more cautious in the way they approached and dealt with Mr DATE .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL I [ Senior Investigator PERSON ] comment at paragraph CARDINAL on the consequences of the surveillance team having failed to adequately identify the person they were following . However , that team had spent TIME following and staying with Mr DATE and attempting to identify him . That provided Commander PERSON with a TIME opportunity to act in accordance with the operation strategy . There was no attempt to do so .", "CARDINAL The SOCARDINAL officers who were following Mr DATE had been authorised to carry firearms for their personal protection and the protection of the public . In the context of the events of DATE and DATE when , respectively , there had been a successful detonation and an attempted detonation of bombs on buses it was a failure of the management of the operation to permit Mr DATE to get on the bus at FAC . If he had been a suicide bomber that event could have been catastrophic . Therefore the failure to use SOCARDINAL to stop him getting back on the bus in BRIXTON is an even more inexplicable failure to apply the strategy .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL [ The DSO ] has endorsed that she was the person in command .", "The [ ORG ] may wish to consider whether the manner in which this operation was commanded , the failures to have resources properly deployed and the absence of any other tactical options could be considered to be grossly negligent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the \u201c identification \u201d of PERSON as the suspect , the ORG noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... PERSON [ the head of the surveillance teams ] did not communicate that some of his team thought that the subject was not [ the suspect ] .

As the ORG did not consider that LAW , Trojan CARDINAL and ORG had been in a position to influence the outcome of events , it was of the opinion that they could not be held responsible .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the possible alteration of the surveillance log ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , the ORG did not find sufficient evidence against any individual to suggest that criminal proceedings might be appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted that in the course of its investigation grave concerns had been raised about the effectiveness of the police response on DATE . These concerns were not only that an entirely innocent member of the public had been killed in error but also that the police response might not have been adequate to stop a terrorist who was intent on causing harm . It therefore made a number of detailed operational recommendations .", "CARDINAL . The ORG underlined CARDINAL operational concerns about the use of firearms : the substantial delay between the time the unit from ORG was requested and when it was deployed , and the lack of clarity about the command to \u201c stop \u201d the suspect given the likely mind - set of the SFOs . It also made detailed recommendations on command and control issues in firearms operations , including the need to clarify the roles and responsibilities within the chain of command ; to establish a clear and common understanding of the circumstances surrounding future operations ; and , given the failure to implement Commander PERSON \u2019s strategy to ensure the deployment of the unit from ORG in time , to put in place better communications channels .", "DATE . In respect of the surveillance operations , the ORG expressed concern that the surveillance team , the SFOs , and those in command were not used to working together and were not sufficiently familiar with each other \u2019s working practices ; that CARDINAL surveillance officers believed the person being followed was not the suspect and that this was not communicated to the DSO ; and that the surveillance log had been altered .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the post - incident management , the ORG repeated its concern about the delay in handing the scene and the investigation to it , and about the fact that PERSON and PERSON had been allowed to return to their own base , refresh themselves , confer and write up their notes together .", "CARDINAL . As regards the communications infrastructure , the ORG was concerned that key briefings and strategic and tactical decisions were not recorded and furthermore that the command and control of the incident was inevitably lost when the unit from ORG entered the underground . Concerns were also expressed that the existing ORG and the \u201c ORG \u201d policy were patently insufficient to deal with the current terrorist threat .", "CARDINAL . The ORG FAC was not made public until DATE as publication was delayed pending the criminal trial of ORG \u201d ) ( see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the MPA referred a complaint to the ORG about the ORG \u2019s handling of public statements following the shooting of Mr de PERSON .

The ORG had the power to recommend or direct the ORG to bring disciplinary proceedings against individuals .

The decision letter , in so far as relevant , provided as follows :", "\u201c In the circumstances of this case , if the prosecution could prove that [ the SFOs ] were not acting in self defence ( either of themselves or others ) then they would be charged with murder . The order was given that PERSON was to be stopped from getting on the train . Although officers in the control room intended that PERSON should be arrested outside the station , the [ ORG team ] were not in place to make such an arrest , nor was this intention made explicit to the [ SFOs ] who were being sent down to the train . All the available evidence suggests that they believed that PERSON had been identified as a suicide bomber , that they had been directed to stop him from blowing up the train and that they had to shoot him to prevent that ....", "The burden would be on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that these CARDINAL officers did not honestly and genuinely believe that they were facing a lethal threat and so I looked to see if there was sufficient evidence to disprove that they had such an honest and genuine belief . Both officers stated that PERSON was wearing a \u2018 ORG jacket when they saw him but in fact PERSON was wearing a simple denim jacket . I therefore took this into account as it could indicate that the officers had lied . However even if I could prove that the officers had lied , rather than simply being mistaken , this alone would not be enough to commence a prosecution for murder as there could be other reasons for an officer to lie . I also considered their explanations of PERSON movements when they approached him , to see if there was evidence that they had fabricated those accounts to justify their actions . Both refer to PERSON getting up and advancing towards them with his hands down by his side before he was tackled by a surveillance officer and forced back into the seat . The [ SFOs ] then shot PERSON . I had to consider whether the prosecution could argue that the restraint meant that no bomb could be detonated and that the firearms ORG actions were unlawful . However I must bear in mind that this happened in TIME and there is some independent evidence that supports the ORG accounts that they feared PERSON might detonate a bomb . A witness sitting opposite PERSON said \u2018 I got the impression that he was reaching to the left hand side of his trouser waistband.\u2019 ...", "As I can not prove the officers did not act in genuine self - defence , I can not charge them with murder or any other offence of assault , including manslaughter .", "There is some disagreement between officers and the members of the public as to whether any warning was given that armed police were approaching the train . In a situation such as this , where a warning to a suspected bomber could be fatal for officers and the public , no warning should be given . However some police officers say that they did hear a call of \u2018 armed police\u2019 before the shooting and although passengers did hear officers shouting as they ran down the stairs , none of them heard the words \u2018 armed police.\u2019 Both of the [ SFOs ] say that they shouted \u2018 armed police\u2019 immediately before they fired but whether they did , and if so , whether it was intended as a warning to PERSON or to others in the carriage is unclear . There is no doubt that some police officers did shout something before any shots were fired .... Unless I could prove that officers had lied ... to mislead any investigation , I could not prosecute them for attempting to pervert the course of justice .", "Next I carefully examined the roles of those police officers concerned in planning the surveillance and stop and those who carried it out . ... there were a number of people involved and there is no doubt that messages were misinterpreted with tragic consequences . I have considered whether any errors or other conduct by individuals could be categorised as criminal . In this I have applied the law on gross negligence manslaughter , misconduct in public office and the [ DATE ] Act . Even where I found that individuals had made mistakes , I found insufficient evidence that those mistakes were so bad that they could be described as criminal . As criminal proceedings are to be brought against the [ ORG ] , I can not provide you with a detailed account of the conduct of those individuals , as that conduct will form part of the prosecution case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . More detailed reasons were provided in a CARDINAL - page Review Note dated DATE as well as in a Final Review Note of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the investigation by the ORG , the Review Note stated that :", "\u201c I am satisfied that the investigation has complied with LAW and the procedural requirements that flow from it . The ORG is clearly independent of ORG and the investigation has not been limited to the actual shooting on the train but has examined the whole of the operation . I have had a number of discussions with senior investigators at the ORG who have assisted me with any queries I have raised . I am therefore satisfied that I have sufficient material before me to reach a decision on the criminal liability of those officers involved in the operation that led to the death of PERSON and the Commissioner as corporation sole . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG drew attention to CARDINAL particular evidential difficulty :", "\u201c Perhaps the most significant problem in understanding what occurred is that there is an almost complete absence of any worthwhile contemporaneous records and the accounts from the participants vary significantly on all the crucial aspects . It is at times impossible to say with any certainty what was said , by whom , to whom and when . There is also the issue that some accounts were made in the knowledge that something terrible had gone wrong . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the witness statements taken from the passengers on the train , ORG indicated that there were inevitable inconsistencies in their recollections of events with the consequence that \u201c the accounts do not match either among themselves or with those of the police \u201d . For example , some of the witnesses confused Mr PERSON with \u201c PERSON , CARDINAL of the surveillance officers .", "CARDINAL . With regard to PERSON and PERSON , the Review Note reiterated that there was insufficient evidence to persuade a jury that they did not genuinely believe they were acting in self - defence . It noted that , if they did hold a genuine belief , then the actions they took in shooting dead a \u201c suicide bomber \u201d would be reasonable and would not be unlawful .", "CARDINAL . As for Commander PERSON , the Review Note stated that there was no evidence against her to sustain a charge of murder as she did not order any officer to open fire . The prosecutor was , however , satisfied that there was evidence her actions and direction and failure to plan fell below the standard of a reasonable officer in her position and , as such , a breach of the duty of care and causation could be shown . Nevertheless , he considered that there was \u201c nowhere near enough \u201d evidence to persuade a jury that her conduct was so bad as to justify a charge of gross negligence manslaughter . He also considered the possibility of prosecuting Commander PERSON for offences under sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW , but , having applied the relevant criteria , found that the prosecution of her or of any of the other individual officers under these provisions would not be in accordance with ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the Review Note the prosecutor identified PERSON CARDINAL as the officer most closely connected with the death of PERSON . In particular , he had failed to dispatch firearms cover to FAC , he gave the briefing that stoked the SFOs fears that they would meet suicide bombers and that they might have to shoot them , and , finally , he should have known that once the SFOs were away from the armed response vehicle and were to engage with a potential suicide bomber the overwhelming likelihood was that they would shoot . However , he could not be prosecuted for murder as he did not direct the officers to fire and his actions were not \u201c bad \u201d enough to satisfy the test for gross negligence manslaughter .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , the prosecutor considered that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute PERSON , ORG or the surveillance teams for gross negligence manslaughter .", "CARDINAL . The Review Note considered the alleged alteration of the log ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , but found that it had been examined by CARDINAL experts who did not agree to the required standard either that there had been alterations or , if there had been , who might have made them . Therefore , as it could not be proved that the relevant entry was a forgery , let alone who might have forged it , there was no basis for a prosecution for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .", "CARDINAL . It also indicated that there was no evidence the police or anyone else had tampered with the recording equipment on the bus , at the station or on the train . Although there were gaps in the recordings at all CARDINAL locations , the ORG investigation had revealed that high vibrations had interfered with the recording of most of the bus journey , the hard drive on the train had not been replaced on the relevant day , and the recording equipment in the station had been broken during prior refurbishments .", "CARDINAL . The Review Note explained in greater detail the decision to prosecute the ORG . The prosecutor indicated that :", "\u201c In my view , this operation was badly handled from the moment it passed from Commander [ McDowall ] . It resulted in an innocent man being shot dead in the most horrific manner . ORG were under tremendous pressure and were doing their best to protect the public from suicide bombers . These are factors that I take into account but these do not detract from the failure to carry out [ Commander PERSON \u2019s ] strategy which would have best protected Mr PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued :", "\u201c In my view , the lack of planning led to the death of PERSON and , as such , constituted an offence under section CARDINAL of the [ CARDINAL Act ] . I believe that if such a charge is preferred , we can prove the case on the evidence already available but a decision not to prosecute individuals will enable the ORG to seek further evidence to strengthen the case , from those individuals who are at present declining to . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The only defence open would be CARDINAL of \u201c reasonable practicability \u201d and it was", "\u201c difficult to see how the police could argue the lack of reasonable practicability in ensuring the safety of [ Mr PERSON ] . If this came to a contested trial , the police would probably have to call a number of officers ... who were interviewed as suspects . Their failures in the planning would then be highlighted \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review of the decision not to prosecute any individual police officer for criminal offences , which she argued was incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . In particular , the applicant argued that the threshold evidential test in the ORG Prosecutors\u2019 Code ( \u201c the Code \u201d ) , which prevented a prosecution unless a jury properly directed was likely to convict ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was not compatible with LAW . She also submitted that LAW required the courts to undertake a more intensive review of a prosecutor \u2019s decision than that provided for in NORP v. Director of Public Prosecutions , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL QB CARDINAL , in which ORG stated that it would accord great weight to the judgment of experienced prosecutors and , as such , a prosecutorial decision would be lawful if it was taken in accordance with the LAW and was a decision reasonably open to the prosecutor on the material before him ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a ORG of the High Court granted permission to apply for judicial review but dismissed the substantive application .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the compatibility of the Code with LAW , the court found that this ORG \u2019s jurisprudence did not determine any particular evidential test to be applied when deciding whether or not there should be a prosecution . The test set out in the LAW was therefore compatible with the obligation under LAW to put in place effective criminal law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person , backed up by law enforcement machinery for the prevention , suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions . Bringing prosecutions which were likely to fail , even if they could survive a dismissal application and a submission of no case to answer , would have profound consequences for all parties concerned . Furthermore , if the threshold was lowered in cases where lethal force was employed by ORG agents , it was likely that a significant proportion of prosecutions would fail because the evidence was lacking . If this were to happen , public confidence in both law enforcement agencies and in the ORG would be undermined .", "CARDINAL . The court also held that LAW did not require a change to the established position regarding judicial review of a decision not to prosecute . The \u201c careful scrutiny \u201d review required in GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXII was compatible both with the test outlined in the PERSON case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and with the domestic courts\u2019 general approach to cases involving fundamental human rights .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , applying the PERSON test , the court found that the decision of the ORG was in accordance with the LAW and was one which was reasonably open to it . The decision was taken by a very senior and highly experienced prosecutor and it was reviewed by the head of the ORG and by independent counsel . It was lengthy , careful , thorough , clear and detailed and the ORG had applied the correct test to each individual considered ; namely , \u201c whether there was sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction , or , in other words , whether a jury was more likely to convict than not to convict \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Although it was not necessary for the court to go so far , it also indicated that it saw \u201c no reason to disagree with the decision \u201d . Consequently , it concluded that the ORG \u2019s decision was lawful and dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge to it . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused by the court and , on DATE , by ORG itself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court also rejected an application by the ORG to have the charges under LAW dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal trial of the ORG commenced . A total of CARDINAL witnesses were called to give evidence during the course of the trial , including Commander PERSON and Commander PERSON . The prosecution argued that the ORG was guilty of the following :", "a ) Commander PERSON \u2019s strategy had not been communicated adequately to the officers who took over the running of the operations on DATE , the surveillance officers or the SFOs ;", "b ) Commander PERSON \u2019s strategy for controlling the premises was not adequately planned for or carried out ;", "c ) the Control Room officers , the SFOs and the surveillance officers had a confused and inconsistent understanding of the strategy for FAC ;", "d ) officers had not been deployed to stop and question persons emerging from the FAC LOC , including PERSON ;", "e ) the SFOs were not in attendance at FAC when Mr de PERSON emerged from the common doorway ;", "f ) there was no contingency plan for dealing with persons who emerged from the apartment building before the firearms officers arrived ;", "g ) persons emerging from FAC had not been stopped and questioned ;", "h ) a safe and appropriate area where those leaving FAC could be stopped and questioned had not been identified ;", "i ) the briefings given to the SFOs were inaccurate , unbalanced , and provided the SFOs with inadequate and inaccurate information about the operation , including the operation at FAC ;", "j ) the information concerning the identification of PERSON , his clothing , demeanour and likely level of threat , was not properly or accurately assessed or disseminated to officers and , in particular , to the SFOs ;", "k ) doubts about the correctness of the identification of PERSON as the suspect were not communicated to the control room ;", "l ) the control room officers failed to satisfy themselves that a positive identification of PERSON as the suspect had been made by the surveillance officers ;", "m ) the SFOs had not been deployed at relevant locations in time to prevent PERSON from getting on the bus and entering GPE underground station ;", "n ) the SFOs failed to satisfy themselves that a positive identification of PERSON as the suspect had been made by the surveillance officers ;", "o ) NORP effective steps were not taken to stop underground trains or buses so as to minimise the risk to the travelling public ;", "p ) Mr de Menezes was permitted to get on a bus twice and to enter GPE underground station despite being suspected of being a suicide bomber and despite having emerged from an address linked to a suspected suicide bomber ;", "q ) a clear and timely order that PERSON be stopped or arrested before he entered GPE underground station had not been given ;", "r ) accurate information had not been given to the DSO about the location of the SFOs when she was deciding whether the SFOs or officers from ORG should stop PERSON ; and", "s ) the risk inherent in effecting the arrest of PERSON by armed officers had not been minimised , whether in relation to the location , timing or manner of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the jury returned a verdict , finding the ORG guilty of breaching sections CARDINAL of LAW ( see CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The jury also attached a rider to its verdict to the effect that Commander PERSON bore no \u201c personal culpability \u201d for the impugned events . This rider was endorsed by the trial judge . The ORG was fined GBP CARDINAL and ordered to pay costs of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . After the trial , the ORG decided not to issue a recommendation for the senior officers to face disciplinary proceedings . In particular , it had regard to the jury \u2019s rider that no blame should attach to Commander PERSON , who was the most senior officer .", "CARDINAL . The inquest , which had been adjourned pending the trial of the ORG , commenced on DATE . In the course of the inquest CARDINAL witnesses were called , including Commander PERSON , Commander PERSON , PERSON , Trojan CARDINAL , PERSON and PERSON . The family of PERSON were represented at the hearing at the ORG \u2019s expense and were able to cross - examine witnesses and make submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the coroner delivered a written Ruling on what , if any , verdicts should be left to the jury . The options available to him were lawful killing , unlawful killing and an open verdict . However , the coroner was not permitted to leave a verdict to a jury if it fell foul of the test used to determine a submission of \u201c no case to answer \u201d ; namely , if there was no evidence to support it or the evidence was so weak , vague or inconsistent with other evidence that , taken at its highest , a jury properly directed could not properly return that verdict ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The coroner therefore considered the verdicts to be left to the jury separately as regards certain police officers .", "CARDINAL . NORP The coroner found that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... There is no doubt that the officers intended to kill PERSON when they fired . Therefore , if their contention that [ they ] were acting lawfully in defence of themselves or others could be disproved , they would have committed ... the offence of murder .", "CARDINAL . There is agreement between all Interested Persons as to what test I should apply in determining whether the officers acted lawfully in defence of themselves and others :", "( i ) Did the officer honestly and genuinely believe that it was necessary for him to use force in defence of himself and/or others ? This is a question of subjective belief . Even if the belief was mistaken , and even if the mistake was unreasonable , the defence can still run . The reasonableness of the belief is only relevant in helping the jury to decide whether the belief was honestly held .", "( ii ) If the officer did hold the belief , did he use no more force than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances as he believed existed at the time ? This is an objective test , but it is applied realistically . Where a person faces a threat , the ORG will not judge with too precise a measure the degree of force he uses ... It is also significant for present purposes that a person under threat is not required to wait passively for the blow to fall . A pre - emptive strike can be justified by the circumstances .", "... ... ...", "CARDINAL . The legal test is no different when the person facing the threat is a police officer or a soldier . However , as PERSON said in PERSON at paragraph CARDINAL , the tribunal is entitled to take account of the person \u2019s training when applying the CARDINAL limbs of the test to the facts of the given case . The same must apply to specific briefings as well as general training . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It was accepted by the parties that the SFOs honestly believed that the man in front of them in the carriage was PERSON , the person who was strongly suspected of having attempted to explode a bomb on the underground DATE . However , the coroner rejected the submission on behalf of the de Menezes\u2019 family that the officers did not honestly believe that PERSON represented an imminent threat . He therefore found that the jury could not properly conclude to the criminal standard of proof that the CARDINAL officers did not honestly believe that PERSON represented a mortal threat to those around them . In reaching that conclusion , he stated that :", "\u201c DATE . If the officers honestly believed that PERSON represented a mortal threat to themselves and those around them , it could not be said that they used more force than was reasonably necessary ... An argument was made ... to the effect that [ one of the officers ] used excessive force because he fired too many times ... In my judgment , it has no merit . The events took place in TIME , and one can not fairly say that some of the shots to the head constituted reasonable force and some did not . In any event , the officers had been trained to fire until the threat was neutralised . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The coroner therefore declined to leave to the jury the option of returning a verdict of unlawful killing in relation to the actions of PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The coroner then considered whether the senior officers could safely be found to have committed manslaughter by reason of having caused death by gross negligence . It was accepted by all parties that this offence had to be proved against a particular officer ; the failings of a number of persons could not be aggregated . CARDINAL elements had to be proved in order to establish that the offence had been committed : the defendant must have owed a duty of care to the victim , the defendant must have breached that duty , the breach must have caused the death ( namely , made a more than minimal causal contribution to the death ) , and the breach must be characterised as \u201c gross \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the duty of care , the coroner concluded that", "\u201c DATE . ... a police officer can owe a duty of care in directing other police officers to perform an armed interception . The content of the duty here would be to take reasonable care to ensure that such an interception took place in such a location and at such a time as to minimise , so far as reasonably practicable , the risk of unnecessary injury to the subject of the intervention , to the officers concerned and to others in the immediate vicinity . In this case the duty would not arise before the point at which firearms officers were ordered to move through with a view to performing an interception . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In relation to Commander PERSON , there were CARDINAL alleged breaches of a duty of care : that he should have set a strategic plan to ensure that suspects were stopped between leaving the LOC and reaching the public transport system ; that he did not ensure that the unit from ORG was deployed sooner ; and that he had failed to keep himself informed and to ensure that his orders were being followed . In respect of each of these allegations the coroner did not accept that Commander PERSON had owed any duty of care to Mr PERSON . However , even if a breach of duty could be established , the coroner did not accept that it had led to Mr de Menezes\u2019 death .", "CARDINAL . There were CARDINAL allegations against Commander PERSON :", "\u201c DATE . ... First , ... that [ she ] failed to ensure that the block on FAC was kept under careful surveillance control and that tactics were employed to ensure that all suspects could be identified and stopped before reaching a bus stop . As it happens , the nearest bus stop was on FAC , CARDINAL minutes\u2019 walk from the block . The first obstacle [ to this ] argument is the difficulty of constructing a positive duty of care at that stage to stop PERSON close to his home . In my judgment , no such duty could exist . Even if it could , I consider that it would not have been practicable to implement this as a fixed and inflexible tactical plan ... In any event , the surveillance control was good : PERSON was kept continually under surveillance but the covert status of the operation near FAC was maintained . The failure to stop him at an earlier stage was based on an inability of officers to say whether he was identifiable with the suspect . Therefore , his death was not caused by any failure of surveillance control at FAC .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , it is alleged that [ the DSO ] failed to keep herself informed of where surveillance and firearms officers were as PERSON was travelling from LOC towards GPE . Again , I do not think that a police officer owes a duty to a person under surveillance to ensure that he is informed of the movements of other officers , at least before any intervention is immediately in prospect . If there were such a duty , it would only be to keep oneself reasonably well - informed , since it would not be practicable to keep note of the precise position of every officer and car . The thrust of the evidence is that [ the DSO ] did keep herself reasonably well - informed . She was aware , through the surveillance monitor in the control room , that surveillance officers were following PERSON and of what they were saying . In any event , as [ counsel for the family of PERSON ] accepts , nothing could have been done to stop PERSON between his getting on the bus at ORG and his alighting at GPE . [ The DSO ] had [ the SFOs ] at the proper holding point at the time she wanted to deploy them . In TIME before she ordered the intervention , she was relying upon information from [ her tactical adviser ] as to the position and readiness of the [ SFOs ] . In my judgment , she was entitled to rely upon that information . In all those circumstances , any failure on her part to keep herself informed was not causative of the fatal events in the carriage .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , it is submitted ... that [ the DSO ] failed to exercise proper judgment in her decisions in TIME , after PERSON left the bus at GPE . In my judgment , she probably did owe a duty of care to him at this stage in making decisions and giving directions for an armed stop . However , she can not fairly be said to have breached that duty . When she became aware that the subject of surveillance had left the bus , she ordered the [ SFOs ] to perform an armed stop . Upon hearing that they were not in a position to make the stop , she instructed the surveillance officers to do so . That order can not be characterised as negligent . If there were any slight delay in giving the order , that can probably be explained by the need to take thought before ordering a suspected suicide bomber to be stopped by officers who were not trained for such situations . Once she was told that the [ SFOs ] were in position , she countermanded the earlier order . It might be possible to say that she made the wrong decision at that point , given where PERSON was known to be , but these were fast - moving events and her decision can not be described as negligent . [ It was submitted ] that using [ SFOs ] gave rise to a particular risk that lethal force would be used . However , there were obvious advantages to using officers who had the training and experience to perform armed interventions in a public place . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to this officer , the coroner stated as follows :", "\u201c DATE . The first charge against [ LAW ] is that , upon arriving at ORG at TIME , he failed to take steps to expedite the despatch of [ the unit from ORG ] to the FAC area . For the reasons already given , I do not consider that he would have owed a duty of care to PERSON in this regard . In any event , when he started work , all the critical decisions had been taken in relation to the [ SFOs ] deployments . It would probably not have been safe or sensible to try to expedite the deployments at that stage . As explained in paragraph CARDINAL above , I do not think it can be established to the necessary standard of proof that any delay in deploying firearms teams was causally relevant to the death of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The second allegation is that he failed to devise a tactical plan to ensure that any suspect coming out of the block was stopped before reaching a bus stop . This is , in essence , the same as one of the allegations made against [ the DSO ] . For the reasons I have given in paragraph DATE , this argument fails at every stage .", "CARDINAL . The third point made in criticism of [ Trojan CARDINAL ] is that he failed to pass on to [ the DSO ] accurate information about the position of the [ SFOs ] in TIME after it became apparent that PERSON was leaving the bus . However , [ LAW ] was reliant for his information on the tactical adviser who was with the team on the ground , \u2018 PERSON CARDINAL\u2019 . That officer initially told [ Trojan CARDINAL ] that his team were \u2018 not in GPE because they were behind the wrong bus . [ LAW ] duly passed on that information . Even if it were incorrect , it is difficult to criticise him for passing it on . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP If , contrary to all of the above , any of the allegations were made out , the coroner concluded that none approached the level of gross or criminal negligence .", "CARDINAL . In light of the above , the coroner decided not to leave the potential short - form verdict of unlawful killing to the jury in respect of the senior officers and instead left them to decide between a verdict of lawful killing and an open verdict .", "CARDINAL . NORP The coroner also included in his Ruling a list of proposed questions which would be left to the jury and which required responses of \u201c yes \u201d , \u201d no \u201d , or \u201d can not decide \u201d . Having heard the parties\u2019 submissions , on DATE he finalised the list of questions to include questions of fact concerning the events in the train carriage and questions concerning the factors which had contributed to Mr de Menezes\u2019 death . However , he refused to leave \u201c open questions \u201d to the jury inviting them to add any other factors which they regarded as causally relevant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr de Menezes\u2019 mother had sought leave to apply for judicial review of the coroner \u2019s decision to exclude both the verdict of unlawful killing and certain narrative verdict questions . At the hearing , she pursued the second point only because by that date the coroner had started summing up and had already indicated the verdicts which were to be left to the jury .", "CARDINAL . The claimant argued that the coroner had been obliged to ensure that the jury members were permitted to resolve the disputed factual issues at the heart of the case and were able properly to determine by what means and in what circumstances PERSON had come by his death . The question of how he came by his death went far beyond determining whether to return a verdict of lawful killing or an open verdict . The coroner \u2019s approach had precluded the jury from commenting on whether or not they regarded any particular failings by the police as serious and , if so , how serious \u2013 and how important in terms of accountability \u2013 these failings were . As such , the jury \u2019s findings were at best likely to beg more questions and at worst be confusing or meaningless . The claimant therefore wished to put additional narrative verdict questions to the jury once the coroner \u2019s summing up was finished .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON refused leave to apply for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . First , he found that the existing verdicts and questions satisfied the statutory obligation under section CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) to enable the jury members to ascertain by what means and in what circumstances Mr de PERSON had come by his death . Furthermore , the inquiry required by the coroner of the jury in this case was significantly more demanding than that sought from , and given by , the jury in both PERSON v. the GPE no . PERSON , PERSON CARDINALII and PERSON and Others v. the GPE DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , and in those cases this ORG had found that the procedural obligations under LAW had been met .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the judge observed that the claimant had not pointed to any case decided domestically or in this ORG which held that specific questions were required to be asked of a jury over and above asking \u201c by what means and in what circumstances \u201d the deceased had died .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , as the coroner had a discretion \u201c to decide how best in the particular case to elicit the jury \u2019s conclusion on the central issue or issues \u201d , the judge considered that the only grounds for interfering with it would probably be ORG grounds ; namely , that the coroner \u2019s decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable coroner would have done the same .", "CARDINAL . Fourthly , the judge found that there was a risk that if the jury members were required to answer the additional questions proposed by the claimant they would be acting in contravention of Rule PERSON ) of LAW by expressing opinions on matters other than those on which they were entitled to comment and , in particular , by appearing to determine questions of criminal or civil liability .", "CARDINAL . Fifthly , he considered that the proposed questions would expose the jury to a risk of making contradictory and conflicting findings .", "CARDINAL . Sixthly , the judge found that the claimant had failed to show , even arguably , that there were strong grounds for disturbing the decision of the coroner .", "CARDINAL . The claimant \u2019s grounds relating to the short - form verdicts were adjourned generally with liberty to both parties to apply to restore . The claimant subsequently agreed that no further action would be taken in relation to these grounds because , inter alia , even if the judicial review was successful the only remedy for the family would be for the court to order a fresh inquest and the claimant did not \u201c see any great benefit in re - hearing all the evidence to enable a different jury to come to a verdict , particularly bearing in mind the very high cost of holding such an inquest \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the jury returned an \u201c open verdict \u201d . In answering the questions left to them the jury found as follows :", "a ) that PERSON did not shout \u201c armed police \u201d ;", "b ) that while PERSON did stand up before being grabbed in a bear hug by one of the surveillance officers , he did not move towards the SFOs ;", "c ) that the general difficulty in identifying the man under surveillance in the time available and the innocent behaviour of PERSON ( which may have increased suspicion ) were not contributory factors to his death ;", "d ) that the following were contributory factors to his death : the failure to obtain and provide to surveillance officers better photographic images of the failed bomber PERSON ; the fact that the views of the surveillance officers regarding the identification of the suspect were not accurately communicated to the command team and the SFOs ; the failure by police to ensure that Mr PERSON was stopped before he reached public transport ; the fact that the position of the cars containing the SFOs was not accurately known by the command team as the ORG teams were approaching GPE underground station ; the shortcomings in the communications system between various police teams on the ground ; and a failure to conclude at the time that surveillance officers could have been used to carry out the stop on Mr PERSON at GPE underground station ; and", "e ) it was not clear whether the pressure on police after the suicide attacks in DATE was a contributory factor to Mr de Menezes\u2019 death .", "CARDINAL . After the verdict the coroner delivered a report as he was required to do under LAW of LAW . In the report he identified ORG systems and practices which gave rise to concern and the risk that other deaths might arise in the future . He further identified action which should be taken to prevent the occurrence or continuance of such circumstances or to eliminate or reduce the risk of death created by such circumstances . The coroner also reviewed material indicating which remedial steps had already been taken to develop police practice since the events of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the report the coroner expressed concerns about the command structure employed by the police on DATE and observed that the ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) manual on the police use of firearms and the command structure should be reviewed . He also made specific recommendations about the role of the DSO , who was responsible for ordering any intentional shot that might be required in anti - terrorist operations .", "CARDINAL . The coroner also reported on the communication problems that the jury found had contributed to the death of PERSON . He recommended that changes should be made to the systems and methods of communication to ensure that there was better information available to enable accurate identification to be made and communicated and to ensure that appropriately trained police officers were available to deal with possible terrorist threats on the basis of as much up - to - date information as possible .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the coroner made recommendations about the recording of briefing and control room activity and recommended that the practice of police witnesses conferring before recording their accounts of events should cease .", "CARDINAL . Following the inquest , further meetings and exchanges of correspondence took place between the ORG and Mr de Menezes\u2019 family . On DATE the family asked the ORG to review the decision not to prosecute in light of new evidence which had emerged at the inquest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG confirmed by letter that there remained insufficient evidence to prosecute any individual .", "CARDINAL . Mr de Menezes\u2019 family did not apply for leave to seek judicial review of this decision , considering that there would be no prospect of success in light of the previous judicial review action . The factual matrix had not significantly changed : the claim would have been on similar grounds to the previous claim for review and was therefore bound to fail .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the Chairman of the ORG rejected the family \u2019s request to review its decision not to initiate disciplinary proceedings as no new evidence had emerged during the inquest to justify bringing disciplinary charges against any individual officer .", "CARDINAL . He noted that the trial of the ORG and the inquest had confirmed the conclusion of the ORG that PERSON was killed because of mistakes that could and should have been avoided . Indeed , the trial of the ORG , the coroner \u2019s report , the ORG recommendations , Her ORG , the ORG and the ORG had all recognised the organisational failings that led to his death . Major efforts had been made to rectify these organisational failings and it was necessary to take them into account when judging the individual culpability of the officers concerned . Every independent judicial , prosecuting and disciplinary authority which had considered the conduct of the officers had concluded that individual criminal or disciplinary charges were not merited .", "CARDINAL . In respect of PERSON and PERSON , there was insufficient evidence to undermine their claim that they honestly believed they were dealing with a suicide bomber or to warrant proceedings based on the disciplinary offences of using excessive force or abusing authority . The officers had had at best TIME to assess whether to shoot to kill and given the overall scene of confusion , coupled with the stress of the circumstances , it was not possible to conclude that the mistakes which were made were deliberate or negligent .", "CARDINAL . With regard to Commander PERSON , the ORG concluded that it was not likely that any tribunal would find that failings which occurred after he set his strategy were due to negligence on his part .", "CARDINAL . As for Commander PERSON , the ORG had regard to the criminal jury \u2019s unambiguous conclusion that she had no personal culpability , especially as no evidence had emerged at the inquest which would cause a disciplinary tribunal to ignore this finding .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considered that there was no evidence that might cause a tribunal to accept the jury \u2019s rider in respect of Commander PERSON but not in respect of PERSON or DCI C.", "CARDINAL . In respect of \u201c PERSON , the ORG accepted that the degree of doubt as to the identity of PERSON was not communicated sufficiently clearly by the surveillance team . However , the ORG concluded that this was the result of technical as well as personal shortcomings , the speed and stress of the circumstances and the lack of an unambiguous communications process .", "CARDINAL . A civil action in damages was brought by the family of Mr de PERSON ( including the applicant ) against the Commissioner of Police of the LOC . This was settled by way of mediation during DATE of DATE . The settlement was on a confidential basis .", "CARDINAL . Following the death of Mr PERSON the ORG took a number of steps to improve its methods of command and control in counter - terrorism operations . In particular , a common command model was introduced for planned firearms operations , a smaller team , or \u201c cadre \u201d of firearms commanders was formed , a new cadre of ORG officers was created to deal with high - risk counter - terrorism operations and a new ACPO Firearms Manual was published .", "CARDINAL . In addition , a ORG was formed to provide consistency of training , procedure and professional practice and to create a platform for increased inter - operability ( that is , how different units and personnel work together operationally ) with other departments and national units . There has been a structured rotation of teams between counter - terrorism and crime operations to familiarise personnel in both types of operation .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , a new counter - terrorism control room came into operation and steps were taken to clarify the roles and responsibilities of control room staff and to provide them with high quality training . Operational delivery of a new secure photo - imaging system for transmitting images of suspects and other data has also taken place . Audio recording is now available in the control room , which is activated when dealing with any suicide bombing threat , and a new and evolving covert airwave communication system has been introduced to ensure effective radio communications are available throughout the GPE underground system as well as above ground .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to ORG guidance issued in DATE , the practice of officers writing up their notes together after an incident has ceased in cases where police officers have discharged firearms . Internal instructions drawn up in consultation with the ORG and DPS have since extended this change of practice to officers involved in other ( non - shooting ) death and serious injury cases ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
