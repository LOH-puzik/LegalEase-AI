MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr Cecil Pace and Mr PERSON , are CARDINAL NORP nationals who were born respectively in DATE and DATE and live in GPE ( GPE ) . They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , CARDINAL lawyers practising in GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are principal shareholders of ORG ( hereinafter , the \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "On DATE the licence of ORG was temporarily suspended . Pursuant to LAW of LAW DATE and after consultation with ORG , ORG appointed a controller and charged him to assume all the powers of ORG and of the shareholders of ORG . The controller was requested to take care of the assets and liabilities of ORG and of its associated companies with a view to safeguarding the rights and interests of the depositors , creditors and shareholders and to liquidate the assets for eventual distribution .", "DATE the applicants filed several lawsuits before ORG ( FAC ) against the controller , alleging that he was responsible for mismanagement and that his behaviour had been abusive and illegal . They claimed that the assets of ORG were being dissipated or sold for a derisory price , that debts were not being collected and recovered , that inventories were not being made and that proper documentation of the transactions was not being kept .", "Several sittings took place before ORG and evidence started to be collected .", "While the proceedings were pending , Act ORG of DATE ( Controlled Companies Act \u2013 Chapter CARDINAL of the Laws of Malta ) was enacted . It created a body called \u201c ORG \u201d . All the lawsuits and claims made by the applicants and pending before ORG were transferred to this body , which had become competent to hear and determine them .", "ORG was to be composed of CARDINAL members , a Chairman and CARDINAL experts in banking or financial services appointed by ORG . The duration of their office , which would have been established in the Minister \u2019s letter of appointment , could not exceed DATE . An Appeal on points of law before ORG was available against the decisions of ORG .", "According to LAW ORG of DATE no action lay against the controller , ORG or the Government for anything which had been done in accordance with the provisions of the LAW from the date of the appointment of the controller .", "Under LAW ORG of DATE the controller had the power of striking off the names of a bank and of its associated companies from the register of companies . He could also decide to deliver documents to the registrar . These documents were to be destroyed after DATE .", "In DATE the applicants introduced a claim ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction . They alleged that the changes introduced by LAW of DATE were specifically aimed at depriving them of the possibility of having a fair trail .", "The applicants submitted that , in view of its nature and composition , ORG could not be regarded as an impartial and independent tribunal .", "In a judgment delivered on an unspecified date , ORG dismissed the ORG claim . It found that there had been no violation of LAW , since this provision did not require a body such as ORG to have the same level of independence and impartiality as a \u201c tribunal \u201d .", "ORG held that ORG was objectively independent as its decisions were not based on directives issued by any authority . Furthermore , it was free from subjection to any other party . The fact that the members of ORG were appointed for DATE with a possibility of reappointment at the expiry of their term of office did not mean that they would not enjoy sufficient guarantees against outside pressures .", "The applicants appealed to ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the ORG appeal and confirmed ORG judgment . It noted that LAW referred to a court or other authority instituted by law , while the Convention referred to an \u201c impartial tribunal \u201d . Thus , civil rights might be determined by both these institutions .", "In ORG view , there were no doubts as to the personal impartiality of the members of the board . As to the ORG argument that a lack of objective impartiality could be inferred from the fact that the members of the board were nominated by ORG , who was the defendant in the lawsuits they had introduced , ORG observed that the law applied equally to everybody and that the authority who appointed the board was of little relevance . In any case , the manner of appointment of the Chairman and of the members of ORG did not raise any objectively justified doubts as to their impartiality and independence , as they had no relationship of employment or dependence with ORG . The board was allowed to make its decisions freely and independently of any pressure or influence . Its members could not be arbitrarily dismissed . ORG also held that Act XVII of DATE guaranteed a fair trial .", "In the meantime , the applicants had introduced another claim ( no . GPE ) before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction . They submitted that since the decisions of ORG were final in so far as they determined points of fact , the previous existing benefit of double examination had been lost . Furthermore , in view of the retroactive immunity granted by LAW XVII of DATE to the controller , to ORG and to the Government , nobody could be held legally responsible for the dissipation of their assets and negligent and illegal behaviour in administrating their financial interests . Therefore , even if their lawsuits were well - founded , the applicants could not obtain a judgment against the defendants or enforce it . In addition , they submitted that LAW ORG of DATE also provided for the removal of a company \u2019s name from the register of companies , which entailed the archiving and destruction of the company \u2019s files . This could result in the obliteration of evidence which the applicants might need to use .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared that Act XVII of DATE had breached the applicants\u2019 right to continue their pending cases within a reasonable time and to have an effective remedy before a national authority . Therefore , it held that the lawsuits instituted by the applicants before the entry into force of this LAW should be decided by ORG in accordance with the pre - existing rules , and not by ORG .", "ORG held that it was not competent to decide upon the alleged legal immunity of the controller . It also rejected the ORG complaint regarding the destruction of the documents as ordinary remedies were available to avoid such actions being taken .", "The Attorney General appealed to ORG . The applicants lodged a cross appeal .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG confirmed ORG decision in so far as it concerned the finding of a violation of the applicants\u2019 right to a trial within a reasonable time .", "It observed that in its previous judgment of DATE , it had held that ORG had the necessary requirements of independence and impartiality . However , this did not mean that a transfer of cases from ORG to the board would have been licit and legal , especially since it might have diminished the rights and remedies enjoyed by the parties .", "In particular , under LAW of DATE the parties were not entitled to an appeal on points of fact ( as guaranteed by the previous rules ) , but could only challenge the points of law decided by ORG before ORG . Therefore , the parties had lost pendente lite the right to a full appeal . This constituted a violation of LAW", "ORG furthermore held that it was legitimate to grant immunity to the controller and to ORG . However , LAW could not be interpreted as conferring a general immunity . As no one could be considered to be above the law , the controller could have been protected against judicial actions only in so far as he had acted in good faith . He would still be liable if it was proved that he had acted in bad faith .", "As to the powers given to the controller by LAW ORG of DATE , ORG observed that under domestic law the applicants could have made use of other ordinary remedies in order to obtain the production of any relevant document . It had not been shown that the applicants had been illegally denied this right .", "In a fax of DATE , the applicants informed the ORG that they had not introduced any lawsuit after DATE . The lawsuits filed against the controller of ORG and against ORG before DATE were suspended awaiting the outcome of the applicants\u2019 constitutional claims . They were resumed after the delivery of ORG judgment of DATE and were , on DATE , still pending .", "The composition and the method of appointment of ORG are described in LAW ORG of DATE , which reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) For the purpose of this LAW there shall be constituted a ORG to be styled ORG which shall consist of a Chairman and CARDINAL other members appointed by the Minister .", "( CARDINAL ) The members of the ORG shall , before entering upon their office , take before the Attorney General the oath to examine and decide any matter referred to them with equity and impartiality .", "( CARDINAL ) The Chairman shall be an advocate with a minimum of CARDINAL years\u2019 legal practice .", "( CARDINAL ) The CARDINAL other members mentioned in sub article ( CARDINAL ) shall be persons who in the opinion of the Minister , possess the necessary expertise and experience in banking or financial services .", "( CARDINAL ) The members of the ORG shall be appointed for such period that the minister may establish in the letter of appointment , which period shall not exceed DATE , and may only be removed by the Minister on the advice of ORG on the grounds of proved inability to perform the functions of their office whether arising from infirmity of body or mind or any other cause , or proved misbehaviour . \u201d", "According to LAW ,", "\u201c The decisions of the ORG shall be final except with respect to points of law decided by ORG from which an appeal shall lie to ORG . \u201d", "Under LAW of DATE , ORG is required to appoint a controller in order to manage the assets and interests of a company whose licence has been restricted or revoked .", "The controller is granted an immunity under LAW , which reads as follows :", "\u201c No action shall lie against the ORG , ORG or the Government for anything done under the authority of this LAW or of LAW and this article shall apply from the date of appointment of the PERSON even if that date happens to be before DATE of the coming into force of this LAW . \u201d", "The controller \u2019s power to strike off names of companies from the register of companies is provided for by LAW , according to which :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The ORG shall also , in accordance with LAW or any other provision of any other law substituting the said Ordinance , deliver to the Registrar for registration by him a notice of such approval , and the Registrar shall thereupon strike the name of the company or partnership off the register .", "( CARDINAL ) The ORG shall , together with the aforesaid notice , deliver the books and other documents of the company to the Registrar , who shall keep them for DATE from the date at which the name of the company or partnership was struck off the register . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
