On DATE the Investigating Judge at ORG ( PERSON ) issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant on suspicion of having committed fraud and falsification of documents . The suspicion related to the applicant \u2019s business activities , and in particular CARDINAL real estate investment projects . ORG issued a search warrant ordering a house search at the LOC of FAC , a private company ( GPE beschr\u00e4nkter PERSON ) for which the applicant acted as general manager . The seizure of documents relating to the real estate investment projects was also ordered . That same day the warrant , search and seizure were executed , the latter in the presence of the Investigating Judge . Later in the day the Investigating Judge questioned the applicant and ordered his detention on remand as he found that there existed a danger of the applicant absconding and collusion . As regards the risk of collusion , the Investigating Judge found that there was the danger that the applicant would attempt to influence the employees of the NORP company and to remove documents which had not been found at the house search .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested his release from detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG , after an oral hearing in the presence of the applicant , his defence counsel and ORG , dismissed his request . ORG found that no danger of absconding existed . However , the danger of collusion continued to exist as the applicant might try to influence witnesses not yet heard and to remove any traces of the offence . There was also a danger of his committing further offences . On DATE the applicant appealed . At an unspecified date also ORG appealed , arguing that detention on remand should also be based on the risk of the applicant absconding .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG ordered that the applicant \u2019s contacts with his defence counsel should take place under the surveillance of the court because of the existence of a danger of collusion . The Investigating Judge found that this measure was necessary because co - suspects were still at large , several witnesses had not yet been heard and there was a risk that the applicant could influence them . The Investigating Judge stated that the validity of this order would expire at the latest when the DATE statutory time - limit for detention on remand based on the risk of collusion would end . The applicant appealed against this decision . He submitted that he did not oppose this measure in principle , however , the measure constituted an unnecessary limitation on his defence rights and the Investigating Judge had failed to order this measure within DATE as prescribed by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG search warrant and the order for surveillance of the applicant \u2019s contacts with his defence counsel . As regards the complaint about the surveillance of the applicant \u2019s contacts with counsel , ORG found the Investigating Judge \u2019s decision to be correct . This order did not involve any criticism of counsel or any reproach of conduct contrary to law or the disciplinary rules of the members of the bar , but merely had the purpose of preventing any contact whatsoever with third persons in order not to endanger the success of the criminal investigation . The present case concerned the complicated business relations of the LAW and several other companies managed by the applicant , and the flow of money between them . Further witnesses could only be identified after all the documents seized had been examined and the applicant was to be prevented from influencing them . Furthermore , the decision had been taken within the time limit prescribed by LAW of LAW . ORG also found the applicant \u2019s complaint that he did not have sufficient access to his case - file unfounded . The Investigating Judge had granted access to the file to the official receiver of the ORG company and the applicant \u2019s defence counsel , the latter also being given the possibility to make copies of the documents in the file . The applicant \u2019s counsel visited him repeatedly and could have given him copies if he so wished . Moreover , when questioned by ORG , the applicant was informed of the contents of the file and about the statements of witnesses already heard .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG filed a bill of indictment against the applicant charging him with aggravated fraud .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial against the applicant started before ORG . It lasted until DATE . In the course of the trial ORG heard DATE witnesses , some of them repeatedly on the applicant \u2019s request . Furthermore CARDINAL experts on book - keeping , building and construction matters , real estate assessment , medicine and psychiatry were heard . The applicant frequently requested that the trial be adjourned for lengthy periods and , towards the end of the trial , requested that the trial be repeated or that the case be remitted to the Investigating Judge . On DATE the court convicted the applicant of aggravated fraud and sentenced him to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment .

CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , ORG at ORG supervises all measures taken by ORG in the course of preliminary investigations .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON \u00a7 CARDINAL a person remanded in custody may meet his defence counsel in the absence of ORG . However , if detention on remand has been ordered on the ground of a danger of collusion , the Investigating Judge may , during DATE of the detention , be present when the remand prisoner meets his defence counsel . If due to specific circumstances a danger exists that contact with defence counsel may interfere with evidence , the Investigating Judge may order the extension of such surveillance until the bill of indictment is served . Surveillance of contact with defence counsel may only be exercised as long as the detention on remand is based on a danger of collusion ( ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL , a person may be held in detention on remand if he is seriously suspected of having committed a criminal offence and if there is a risk of his absconding , of collusion , or that the person might commit further offences .

ORG may , however , extend detention if so requested by the Investigating Judge or ORG , and if the difficulty or the scope of the investigation makes it necessary . In such cases the maximum duration of detention is DATE where the measure is based on a risk of collusion alone , and DATE if the term of imprisonment which the suspect risks is DATE or more , for the other grounds .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , it is open to the suspect to apply for release at any time . Such an application and any appeal against a decision ordering detention on remand must be examined by ORG at a private hearing in the presence of the accused or his defence counsel . According to S. CARDINAL , there is a further appeal against decisions of ORG to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( d ) \u00a7 CARDINAL a plea of nullity may be rejected by ORG after deliberations in private if the court unanimously finds that the complaint should be dismissed as being manifestly ill - founded without any need for further deliberations ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4", "6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-b"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
