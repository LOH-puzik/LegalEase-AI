THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national of NORP origin , born in DATE and , at the time of introduction of the application , he was detained in the GPE for expulsion purposes . He is represented before the ORG by Ms G.E.M. Later , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant and CARDINAL others left GPE by truck . The applicant arrived in the GPE on DATE and , on DATE , pursued his journey to GPE , where his brother was residing and where he wished to apply for asylum .", "On DATE , the applicant was apprehended by the NORP authorities and handed over to the GPE authorities , who placed him in detention in accordance with LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) in order to verify his identity , nationality and residence title . On DATE , after the applicant had filed a request for asylum or a residence permit on humanitarian grounds , he was subsequently placed in GPE detention ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) pending the determination of his asylum request , in accordance with LAW ( c ) of LAW .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch against the measure of his placement in GPE detention and requested his immediate release .", "On DATE , the applicant was interviewed by an official of ORG in relation to the grounds for his asylum request .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE in the course of which the applicant was represented by a lawyer , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against his placement in GPE detention . It held that there were sufficient grounds to justify the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention . In this respect it noted that , at the time of his placement in detention and to date , the applicant did not have a valid residence title , valid identity documents or sufficient means of existence . At the time of his apprehension , the applicant had further been in the possession of a false NORP identity card and he had only applied for asylum after having been handed over by the NORP authorities to the NORP authorities whereas he could have made such an application during his stay in the GPE prior to his departure to GPE . In these circumstances , ORG held that there were sufficient grounds to conclude that there were reasons to believe that the applicant would seek to find ways of avoiding his expulsion and that therefore he had rightly not been transferred to an ordinary asylum seekers centre .", "ORG further held that the fact that the applicant had applied for asylum did not imply that there were no longer any prospects for his expulsion . This would only be the case if it was highly likely that his request for asylum would be granted . However , this did not appear to be the case . Noting that the applicant had been heard in relation with his request for asylum on DATE , that the court had been informed that a decision was expected at short notice and that , pursuant to LAW , a placement in GPE detention ends where a request for asylum is not decided upon within DATE , ORG found that there were as yet realistic prospects for the applicant \u2019s expulsion and that the authorities were sufficiently diligent in their activities aimed at his expulsion . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention was in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and , after having weighed all interests involved , could reasonably be regarded as justified .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request for asylum or a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and ordered his expulsion from the GPE . The applicant was , consequently , placed in GPE detention for the purposes of his expulsion in accordance with LAW ( a ) of LAW .", "At some unspecified point in time , the applicant filed an appeal against the decision of DATE with ORG sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch . He further applied to ORG for an injunction on his expulsion pending the appeal proceedings . As he had been placed in GPE detention he was not required , like asylum seekers not placed in such detention , first to file an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) with the ORG Secretary of ORG before filing an appeal with ORG .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a second appeal with ORG sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch against the measure of his placement in GPE detention and he requested that he be released immediately .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE in the course of which the applicant was represented by a lawyer , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s second appeal against his placement in GPE detention . Noting that the lawfulness of this placement had already been determined in its decision of DATE , it limited its examination to the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s continued placement in GPE detention .", "It held that the fact that the applicant had applied for an injunction on his expulsion did not , as such , affect the lawfulness of his placement in GPE detention , since DATE pending the determination of this request \u2013 it could not be said that there were no prospects for his expulsion . This would only be the case where it was highly likely that an injunction would be granted . This had , however , not appeared to be the case .", "Noting that the ORG Secretary had requested ORG on DATE to give priority to the applicant \u2019s request for an injunction , ORG stated on this point that it assumed that the request for an injunction would be dealt with in the near future . Noting further that the question whether the applicant could be expelled to GPE with a second NORP identity card submitted by him was in the process of being examined , ORG held that there remained realistic prospects for the applicant \u2019s expulsion and considered that it could not be held that the authorities were insufficiently diligent in their activities aimed at the applicant \u2019s expulsion . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention was in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and , after having weighed all interests involved , could reasonably be regarded as justified .", "On DATE and without providing further details , the applicant informed the ORG that his request for asylum had been unsuccessful and that , on DATE , he had been released from GPE detention on the basis of a temporary suspension of the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin .", "LAW , insofar as relevant , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the interests of public order , public policy or national security so require , the following categories of aliens may be detained :", "a. aliens whose expulsion has been ordered ;", "b. aliens in respect of whom there are serious ground to believe that their expulsion will be ordered ;", "c. aliens who are not allowed to reside in the GPE by virtue of any of the provisions contained in ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL < of LAW > , pending the decision on an application for a residence permit , a permanent residence permit or leave to enter as refugees .", "CARDINAL . An alien shall not be detained when , and detention shall be terminated as soon as , he intimates that he wishes to leave the GPE and is in fact in a position to do so .", "CARDINAL . Detention for the reasons set out in the first sentence of paragraph CARDINAL and for the categories referred to under b. or c. of that paragraph shall not be of longer duration than DATE .", "... \u201d", "An alien whose expulsion has been ordered can , in principle , remain in GPE detention for an unlimited period of time . The lawfulness of a placement in GPE detention can , however , be challenged before ORG . Where ORG finds that there are no prospects for expulsion within a reasonable time , it can order that the measure of placement in GPE detention be terminated .", "It has been established in the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) of ORG that the interest of an alien to be released from GPE detention increases with the passage of time . Where a placement in GPE detention exceeds a period of DATE , it is generally held that the alien \u2019s interest in being released is greater than the interest to keep him in detention for the purposes of expulsion . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , this point in time may also be reached before or after DATE have passed . It may be later where the alien frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality and it may be earlier where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his control .", "Although no appeal lies against a decision by ORG in proceedings concerning requests for release from detention for expulsion purposes , an appeal to ORG ( Gerechtshof ) is available in relation to a decision taken in the context of such proceedings on a request for compensation for the time spent in detention for expulsion purposes . Furthermore , an appeal may be admitted in which the complaint is made that in the decision challenged a fundamental principle of law has been disrespected ( cf . ORG , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , nr . CARDINAL )", "There is no time - limit for the filing of an appeal against a decision of placement in GPE detention and in principle a person placed in GPE detention may file as many appeals against this decision as he sees fit . When the lawfulness of a decision of placement in GPE detention has been determined for a first time , the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in GPE detention as from DATE last judicial decision taken on this point ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
