On DATE the applicant was sterilised while hospitalised at ORG in Pre\u0161ov ( now known as ORG and ORG in LOC Hospital \u201d ) , which came under the management of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The procedure was carried out during the delivery of the applicant \u2019s second child via Caesarean section . The applicant \u2019s first delivery had also been via Caesarean section . The sterilisation of the applicant entailed tubal ligation by the ORG method , which consists of severing and sealing the Fallopian tubes in order to prevent fertilisation .", "CARDINAL . During her pregnancy the applicant did not have any regular checkups . She visited her general practitioner only once .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was admitted to the gynaecology and obstetrics department of ORG on DATE shortly before TIME She came to the hospital in pain resulting from the progress of labour . On arrival the applicant was informed that the delivery would be via Caesarean section .", "CARDINAL . The delivery was documented in a written record indicating details of the labour and birth at regular intervals . The first entry in the record was at CARDINAL a.m. The applicant was subsequently monitored by ORG ( cardiotocography ) ; the last ORG entry was at TIME", "CARDINAL . According to the delivery record , after TIME , when labour was well established , the applicant requested sterilisation . That request is entered directly in the delivery record with the typed words \u201c Patient requests sterilisation \u201d . Below this is the shaky signature of the applicant . The signature was in an unsteady hand and the applicant \u2019s maiden name , which she used at the time , is split into CARDINAL words .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that , after she had been in labour for TIME and was in pain , the medical personnel of ORG had asked her whether she wanted to have more children . The applicant responded in the affirmative but was told by the medical personnel that if she had CARDINAL more child , either she or the baby would die . The applicant started to cry and as she was convinced that her next pregnancy would be fatal , she told the medical personnel \u201c Do what you want to do \u201d . She was then asked to sign the delivery record under the note indicating that she had requested sterilisation . The applicant did not understand the term sterilisation and she signed the form out of fear that there would otherwise be fatal consequences . As she was in the last stage of labour , her recognition and cognitive abilities were influenced by labour and pain .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant was put under anaesthesia , after which the delivery was completed via Caesarean section . In view of the state of the applicant \u2019s reproductive organs the CARDINAL doctors involved asked the head physician for an opinion as to whether they should perform a hysterectomy or a sterilisation . They subsequently performed tubal ligation on the applicant . The procedure ended at TIME and the applicant came round from the anaesthetic TIME later .", "CARDINAL .

She was prevented from using the same bathrooms and toilets as women who were not of GPE origin .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has suffered serious medical and psychological aftereffects from the sterilisation procedure . Hence , at DATE and DATE she displayed the symptoms of a false pregnancy . She believed that she was pregnant and exhibited all the signs of pregnancy . However , the ultrasound examination revealed that she was not pregnant . Subsequently , in DATE , she was treated by a psychiatrist in NORP . According to the latter \u2019s statement , the applicant continues to suffer as the result of her infertility .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has also been ostracised by the GPE community . Her husband , the father of her children , left her several times owing to her infertility . In DATE the applicant and her husband divorced . The applicant maintained that her infertility was CARDINAL of the reasons for their separation .", "CARDINAL . A written statement by the Director of ORG dated DATE indicates that the applicant \u2019s first delivery in DATE ended with a Caesarean section as the size of the applicant \u2019s pelvis excluded a normal delivery . Prior to the delivery the applicant had attended a pre - natal care centre only twice , at the beginning of her pregnancy . After the delivery she was placed in a post - delivery room with sanitary equipment where she received medical care . On DATE she left the hospital without ORG consent and returned TIME later with sepsis caused by inflammation of the uterus . After CARDINAL days\u2019 hospitalisation during which she received intensive treatment with antibiotics the applicant and her child were discharged from the hospital . The applicant was advised to visit a gynaecologist regularly but failed to do so .", "CARDINAL . During her second pregnancy , the applicant visited the pre - natal care centre only once , in the initial stages . At the time of the second delivery , owing to pain which the applicant experienced in the lower part of her uterus ( where she had been operated on during her first delivery ) and in view of the size of her pelvis , doctors indicated that a Caesarean section would be needed . They were of the view that there was a risk of rupture of the uterus . After they had explained to her the situation and the risks inherent in a possible third pregnancy , the applicant , who was fully aware of what was happening , signed the sterilisation request .", "CARDINAL . In a different statement dated DATE the Director of ORG denied deliberate and organised segregation of GPE women and the existence of so called \u201c Gypsy rooms \u201d . In practice , GPE women were frequently accommodated together at their own request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the publication by ORG and Soul : Forced and Coercive Sterilisation and Other Assaults on ORG in GPE \u201d ( \u201c the Body and Soul Report \u201d ) , the Section for Human Rights and Minorities of the Government Office initiated a criminal investigation into the allegedly unlawful sterilisation of several different GPE women .", "CARDINAL . The criminal investigation was conducted within ORG of ORG in GPE by ORG . Several decisions were issued by the investigator , public prosecutors at several levels and ORG . The proceedings were ultimately discontinued on the ground that no offence had been committed in the context of the sterilisation of women of GPE ethnic origin ( further details are set out in GPE , GPE and GPE v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not initiate any individual criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after the release of the Body and Soul Report , the applicant learned that a tubal ligation was not life - saving surgery as alleged by the medical personnel of ORG and that the patient \u2019s full and informed consent to such a procedure was required . For this reason , she unsuccessfully tried to review her medical records . She was allowed access to her medical file with her lawyer in DATE following a judicial order to that effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim with the ORG under Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , seeking protection of her personal rights . She submitted that the sterilisation performed on her had been carried out in violation of NORP legislation and international human rights standards including Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE of the Convention . The applicant argued that she had not been duly informed about the procedure as such , its consequences and alternative solutions . She requested an apology for the procedure and claimed compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings ORG considered documentary evidence and obtained a number of statements from the applicant as well as from the medical personnel of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the applicant described the circumstances in which she had given birth in ORG and how she had been asked to sign the relevant entry in the record . She also stated that the father of her children had left her for DATE owing to her infertility and that they had experienced problems in their relationship for that reason . She outlined the health problems which she was experiencing .", "CARDINAL . Doctor \u010c. of ORG , who had performed the procedure on the applicant , stated that he did not specifically remember the applicant or the circumstances of her hospitalisation . His statement was based on the information in the applicant \u2019s medical file . He alleged that the applicant had been fully informed about her medical condition and the progress of the labour TIME prior to the delivery . The information about the need for sterilisation had been conveyed to her by the head doctor of the gynaecology and obstetrics ward , as well as the second doctor who had participated in the surgery , and also by the anaesthetist . The sterilisation had been carried out at the applicant \u2019s request as a medical necessity . A possible third pregnancy could have been risky for the applicant unless she was monitored regularly during the pregnancy . Doctor PERSON stated that the sterilisation of the applicant had not been life - saving surgery .", "CARDINAL . Doctor PERSON , head doctor of the gynaecology and obstetrics ward of ORG , stated that he fully agreed with the testimony of Doctor \u010c. Doctor PERSON did not specifically recall the case of the applicant either . He assumed that her case was the same as other similar cases . He had not been present during the delivery and the sterilisation of the applicant but had been told about her case by other doctors . He described the sterilisation procedure as governed by the relevant law . In the case of the applicant , there had been no time to convene any committee as she had come to the hospital a very short time before delivery .", "CARDINAL . Doctor PERSON further stated that , after he had designated his colleagues PERSON and ORG to perform the surgery , he had also asked them to find out whether the patient would agree to sterilisation , and to have her consent confirmed by a signature . Even if a patient refused to give written consent to sterilisation , it could be carried out under LAW , which permitted such a move in the case of danger to a person \u2019s life .", "CARDINAL . In the civil proceedings , the applicant also submitted a psychologist \u2019s assessment of her mental capacity dated DATE . It indicated that her intellectual capacity was very low , on the verge of mental retardation , but that her thinking was well developed in relation to practical issues . The psychologist concluded that communication with the applicant needed to be adapted to her mental and language skills . No mental illness was detected that would prevent the applicant from making decisions concerning her life and assuming responsibility for matters related to her life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the action . It held that the procedure had been performed only after the medical personnel had obtained the applicant \u2019s signature . It admitted that the applicant \u2019s signature on the delivery record had been obtained shortly before the Caesarean section was performed , when the applicant had been in \u201c a supine position \u201d . The procedure had been performed on medical grounds . It had been necessary owing to the applicant \u2019s poor medical condition . The medical personnel had proceeded in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . The fact that the procedure had not been approved earlier by a sterilisation committee amounted only to a failure to meet the formal requirements ; it could not have interfered with the applicant \u2019s personal integrity as protected by Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW . No violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under the LAW had been established .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s situation was not irreversible as there was a possibility of in vitro fertilisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . She maintained that she had been sterilised without her full and informed consent in a situation where she had not been able to understand fully the nature and consequences of the procedure . There were gaps and inconsistencies in the statements of the medical personnel and the medical file contained no record of her having been duly informed about the procedure , its irreversible character and the alternative methods . In violation of the legislation in force the sterilisation had not been approved by a sterilisation committee . A tubal ligation could not be considered as life - saving surgery . The applicant relied on documents issued by international medical organisations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the firstinstance judgment . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s sterilisation had been performed in accordance with the legislation in force and that it had been required by her medical condition .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court referred to the statements by the physicians involved and held that there had been a risk of rupture of the applicant \u2019s uterus . The applicant had requested sterilisation after she had been duly informed of her state of health . The procedure had complied with the relevant provisions of the CARDINAL Sterilisation Regulation . The decision as to whether or not sterilisation was required lay in such circumstances with the head physician . Prior approval by a sterilisation committee was required only where sterilisation was to be carried out on healthy reproductive organs . However , this had not been the case with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . With reference to her sterilisation and the ordinary courts\u2019 conclusions in the above - mentioned civil proceedings , she submitted that she had been subjected to sterilisation in ORG without her informed consent and that she had been unable to obtain redress as a result of the conduct and decision of ORG . She alleged that the latter had thereby breached her constitutional rights and freedoms prohibiting discrimination and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , her right to protection from unjustified interference with her private and family life and her right to protection of her family , as well as her rights under LAW , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL of ORG . The applicant requested that ORG quash ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint as being manifestly ill - founded ( for further details see the decision on the admissibility of the present application of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant referred to a number of publications pointing to a history of forced sterilisation of GPE women which had originated under the NORP regime in GPE in DATE and which she believed had influenced her own sterilisation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the applicant submitted that ORG DATE Sterilisation Regulation had been used to encourage the sterilisation of GPE women . According to a DATE document by LAW , a NORP dissident group , a programme had been launched in GPE offering financial incentives for GPE women to be sterilised because of earlier unsuccessful government efforts \u201c to control the highly unhealthy NORP population through family planning and contraception . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant further maintained that in LOC PERCENT of the sterilisation operations performed from DATE had been on GPE women , who represented PERCENT of the population of the district . Another study found that in DATE PERCENT of sterilised women in eastern GPE ( the region where the applicant resides ) were GPE ; by DATE , this figure had risen to PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a report by ORG noted that many GPE women were not fully aware of the irreversible nature of the procedure and were forced into it because of their poor economic situation or pressure from the authorities .", "CARDINAL . According to other reports , in DATE nurses working in NORP refugee reception centres informed researchers from ORG that they had noticed unusually high rates of gynaecological procedures such as sterilisation and removal of ovaries among female GPE asylumseekers from eastern GPE . All the reports cited identified ORG as CARDINAL of the hospitals where such sterilisation practices were applied .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that health care in GPE was provided to all women equally . Statistical data based on the ethnic origin of patients were generally not gathered as this was considered to be contrary to ORG human rights .", "CARDINAL . Following the publication of the Body and Soul Report the Ministry of Health established a group of experts with a view to investigating allegedly unlawful sterilisations and segregation of GPE women .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s report of CARDINAL DATE , submitted to the parliamentary committee on human rights , nationalities and the status of women , indicated that the medical records of CARDINAL women who had been sterilised and those of QUANTITY women who had given birth by means of Caesarean section during DATE had been reviewed .", "CARDINAL . The rate of sterilisation of women in GPE amounted to PERCENT of women of reproductive age . In other NORP countries that rate was PERCENT . The low rate of sterilisation in GPE was mainly due to the fact that the procedure was not widely used as a method of contraception .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of official statistical data concerning the ethnic origin of inhabitants , the expert group could assess only indirectly the position regarding women of GPE ethnic origin . In those regions where it was possible to indirectly assess the proportion of women of GPE ethnic origin , the frequency of sterilisation and Caesarean section in the GPE population was significantly lower than among the rest of the population . The frequency of sterilisations was statistically insignificantly higher in the LOC and ORG regions than in other regions of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The group concluded that in the hospitals investigated by its members no genocide or segregation of the GPE population had occurred . All cases of sterilisation had been based on medical indications . Certain shortcomings in health care and non - compliance with the regulations on sterilisation ( such as failure to observe the administrative procedure ) had been identified in several cases . However , they affected the whole population equally regardless of ORG ethnic origin . Hospitals in which administrative errors had been discovered had adopted measures with a view to eliminating them .", "CARDINAL . In none of the hospitals visited by the expert group did there exist separate rooms for GPE women ; all patients received treatment within the same hospital facilities . Owing to the situation existing during DATE , medical personnel and individuals were not on an equal footing with regard to responsibility for maintaining and improving ORG state of health . This was reflected , in particular , in limited individual rights and responsibilities in matters of health care . Measures had been recommended to ensure that individuals received the necessary information to enable them to give informed consent to their treatment or refuse it . Individual requests for medical intervention were to be made in a legally valid manner permitting the persons concerned to express their own free will after receiving the appropriate information .", "CARDINAL . The measures recommended in the report consisted in the amendment of the legal rules on sterilisation with a view to ensuring compliance with , inter alia , ORG , which GPE had ratified . The report also contained a set of recommendations regarding the education of medical staff , focusing on \u201c cultural differences in regions with an increased concentration of GPE communities \u201d . In order to educate the GPE population in the area of health care , ORG in GPE was to establish , in cooperation with ORG , a network of health care assistants who would receive special training and operate in GPE settlements .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing the Government indicated that it was open to women allegedly affected by malpractice in the context of sterilisation to claim compensation before the civil courts . According to the information available to the Government , there were CARDINAL sets of proceedings of that kind pending before the NORP courts . CARDINAL other sets of proceedings had ended in a final decision . In CARDINAL of them the claimants had been successful .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , natural persons have the right to protection of their personal rights ( personal integrity ) , in particular their life and health , civil and human dignity , privacy , name and personal characteristics .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , natural persons have the right to request that unjustified infringements of their personal rights be ended and that the consequences of such infringements be erased . They also have the right to appropriate just satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that , in cases where the satisfaction obtained under LAW is insufficient , in particular because the injured party \u2019s dignity or social standing has been significantly diminished , he or she is also entitled to financial compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) and applicable at the relevant time , contained guidelines governing sterilisation in medical practice .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL permitted sterilisation in a medical institution either at the request of the person concerned or with that person \u2019s consent where , inter alia , the procedure was necessary according to the rules of medical science for the treatment of a person \u2019s reproductive organs which were affected by disease ( section CARDINAL(a ) ) , or where the pregnancy or birth would seriously threaten the life or health of a woman whose reproductive organs were healthy ( section CARDINAL(b ) ) .", "CARDINAL .

In view of the difficulties encountered during the investigations , and limitations surrounding them , initiated by the Government , it is unlikely that they will shed full light on the sterilizations practices .", "CARDINAL . However , on the basis of the information contained in the reports referred to above , and that obtained during the visit , it can reasonably be assumed that sterilizations have taken place , particularly in eastern GPE , without informed consent .", "CARDINAL . The information available to the Commissioner does not suggest that an active or organized Government policy of improper sterilizations has existed ( at least since the end of the communist regime ) . However , ORG has , in the view of the Commissioner , an objective responsibility in the matter for failing to put in place adequate legislation and for failing to exercise appropriate supervision of sterilization practices although allegations of improper sterilizations have been made throughout the DATE \u2019s and DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The involuntary sterilisation of GPE women", "...", "Development of the situation and measures taken", "CARDINAL . The allegations of forced and coerced sterilizations of GPE women in GPE were considered as a possible grave violation of human rights and therefore taken very seriously by ORG . A considerable effort was devoted to their thorough examination . In addition to a criminal investigation , a professional medical inspection of healthcare establishments was organised and an expert opinion of ORG of ORG in GPE requested . It was not confirmed that ORG would have supported an organized discriminatory ORG policy . Legislative and practical measures were taken by the ORG in order to eliminate the administrative shortcomings identified in the course of inquires and to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future .", "CARDINAL . LAW , which came into effect on DATE , sought to deal with these issues by including sections on sterilisation , informed consent and access to medical records . The law was elaborated in accordance with ORG , and among other things , eliminates the deficiencies in legislation found in the course of the investigations . The law , inter alia , guarantees informed consent and requires health care professionals to provide information to patients before , for example , undergoing sterilisation . It also requires a DATE waiting period after informed consent is given . In addition , the new law addresses the problem many individuals face in accessing their medical records . The law explicitly allows authorisation by the patient to another person , through a power of attorney , to view and photocopy their files .", "CARDINAL . Women allegedly harmed by sterilisation have the right to turn to the NORP courts with a request for compensation and it is the view of the NORP authorities that the existing legal framework offers them sufficient possibilities to seek compensation . Some of the cases have been concluded by rejecting the complaint or by halting proceedings . In other cases , court proceedings are still underway .", "Conclusions", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner welcomes the coming into force of LAW , and its provisions on informed consent and access to medical records . These were crucial issues which the Commissioner had addressed in his Recommendation to the NORP authorities , and he is pleased to see that the new law has explicitly addressed these problem areas .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner notes with regret that the NORP authorities have not yet established an independent commission to provide compensation or an apology to the victims . While victims may seek redress through the court system , in these types of cases , litigation has its practical shortcomings . These include the difficult and costly nature of obtaining legal counsel , particularly , for GPE women living in marginalised communities , and the extremely high evidential standards .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner again encourages the authorities to consider creating an independent commission that might , on the examination of each case , provide effective and rapid non - judicial redress . Such redress would be given to individual applicants , who could show that appropriate procedures were not followed , without there necessarily having been intent or criminal negligence on the part of individual medical staff , but because of systemic shortcomings in the procedures permitted , and that in their particular case , sterilisation was without informed consent . Such a Commission might allow for alleged cases to be examined thoroughly , but with fewer formalities and less cost for applicants , than judicial proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

ORG is of the opinion that the possibility of sterilisations of GPE women without their full and informed consent necessitates immediate , extensive and thorough investigation . It seems clear to ORG that in such investigations , attention should be focused not on whether a signed form can be produced , but on whether the women involved were fully informed of what they were signing and the actual implications of sterilisation . ...", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG also recommends that , prior to and notwithstanding the outcome of the investigation , more adequate safeguards should be put in place to forestall any further problems or lack of certainty in this area . In fact , the authorities have acknowledged there remains at present , at the legal level , some anomalies between the law in force and specific regulations issued previously . Clear , detailed and coherent regulations and instructions should thus be issued immediately to ensure that all sterilisations are being carried out in accordance with best medical knowledge , practice and procedures , including the provision of full and comprehensible information to patients about the interventions proposed to them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its next periodic report ( fourth monitoring cycle ) on GPE , published on CARDINAL DATE , ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG notes with concern that the problems as regards investigations into allegations of sterilisations of GPE women without their full and informed consent noted in its third report remained . The authorities continued to investigate these allegations under the crime of genocide rather than , for example , under the crimes of assault or of inflicting grievous bodily harm . The angle under which these allegations were investigated thus rendered proof of a crime having been committed virtually impossible and the possibility for redress through the courts almost null . The investigations also reportedly continued to focus on the issue of consent forms being signed rather than on whether full prior information was provided . Due to these flaws , in most cases , the courts decided that the allegations were unproven . ORG wishes to stress that at the very least , the authorities should secure legal aid to victims so that they can seek compensation through civil law .", "CARDINAL . Some legislative measures have been taken to provide better legal safeguards against the practice . LAW has been amended to include the crime of \u201c illegal sterilisation \u201d and it provides for a DATE waiting period from the time the patient has given her consent before the sterilisation is carried out . LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . on ORG which entered into force on DATE provides that sterilisation can only be performed following a written request and informed written consent from a person who has been previously informed and is fully legally responsible for him / herself , or from a person who legally represents them and can provide their informed consent , or on the basis of a court decision based on a request by a legal representative . The patient information session preceding consent must be carried out according to the law and must include information on alternative methods of contraception and family planning , possible changes in life circumstances which led to the request for sterilisation , the medical consequences of sterilisation and the possibility that the sterilisation may fail .", "CARDINAL . While welcoming these legislative developments , ORG regrets that due to the above - mentioned problems in the investigations of allegations of sterilisations of GPE women without their full and informed consent , no redress has been possible for the majority of women involved .", "CARDINAL .
