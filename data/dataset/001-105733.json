His words were punctuated by bursts of applause , especially when he directly criticised the party leadership . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The story was picked up by Mr PERSON in the DATE edition of ORG . In an article headed \u201c Night of the short knives \u201d , he reported :", "\u201c ... Shortly after the rally the BNP March PERSON bulletin came out with the claim that [ NORP ] and [ NORP ] had turned up at Roberts\u2019 house and stolen the money collected at the meeting ... The party claims that the police have been informed about the alleged theft .", "The story doing the rounds is that [ NORP ] and [ NORP ] initially went to collect the \u00a3 CARDINAL booking fee for the meeting room , which PERSON had forgotten to pay in his rapid exit from the pub , but seeing all the money it appears that temptation got the better of them and they took the lot . \u201d", "CARDINAL . D. and NORP responded to the allegations in the DATE and DATE editions of Spearhead , setting out their version of the events of DATE and denying the allegations of forced entry and attempted theft of the collection money .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , Mr PERSON wrote a further article for ORG in his regular column called \u201c News from the sewers \u201d . The article was headed \u201c ORG on \u201d and , in so far as material , reported as follows :", "\u201c ... the ORG \u2019s DATE bulletin accused CARDINAL members of stealing the collection from the meeting . The story that was put around was that [ NORP ] and [ NORP ] ... stole the money from the house of PERSON , the GPE and GPE organiser .

[ NORP ] and [ NORP ] recently issued a long open letter attacking PERSON [ the leader of the BNP ] and his supporters , including PERSON .

After PERSON angrily returned the money , the letter alleges , he and his brother PERSON threatened to \u2018 kneecap , torture and PERSON [ D. ] , [ NORP ] and their respective families .", "The letter complains that the PERSON leadership described PERSON as a self - made millionaire who was leaving the City to devote his time and fortune to the ORG , but he turned out to be a disappointment . \u2018 It was now quite obvious that a little village somewhere , was missing its ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants commenced libel proceedings against ORG and Mr PERSON on DATE in respect of the article of DATE . The defendants raised CARDINAL defences to the claim : justification ( that the facts reported were true ) and qualified privilege ( that there was a public interest in the reporting and that the statements had been made without malice \u2013 see PERSON at paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In particular , the defendants relied upon the \u201c reportage \u201d variant of the qualified privilege defence , set out in the case of ORG , which permits journalists to repeat allegations that have already been published without verifying the accuracy of the allegations in certain circumstances ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE and DATE a single judge sitting in the ORG heard a preliminary issue on the question of qualified privilege . In his judgment of CARDINAL DATE , he explained the general background as follows :", "\u201c ... The ORG regularly places candidates before the electorate , both in GPE and elsewhere , and that in itself could be said to render the allegations and crossallegations ( especially of apparent criminality ) as of \u2018 significant interest\u2019 , but it is also relevant to have in mind that there was in or DATE , when the article was published ... \u2018 heightened public interest in the BNP\u2019 . This was in large measure because Mr PERSON , who had taken over the leadership from Mr PERSON in DATE , had been given a high media profile in the course of presenting the party and its policies to the electorate .", "My attention was drawn , in particular , to an article published in DATE in the ORG journal ORG ... [ which ] attracted a certain amount of media attention . Moreover , following success in local elections in GPE in DATE , the ORG had begun to put up more candidates in elections . Because of this high profile , people were naturally taking a greater interest in the party and also in policy and doctrinal divisions among its activists . A focus of particular interest was the split CARDINAL factions generally identified , respectively , with PERSON and PERSON ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He summarised the various articles published in the NORP , PERSON and ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It was against this background that the Defendants reported the [ D./R. ] denial of the allegation of criminality , to which they had already given currency in the DATE issue . It is clear to me that readers of the words complained of would be well aware of Mr Gable \u2019s antipathy to the ORG and that he was merely reporting the conflicting positions rather than taking sides with either . They could hardly conclude that he had been present as an eye - witness and would , therefore , realise that he was not in a position to espouse CARDINAL version or the other . What would be of interest to the reader would be the fact that the allegations and cross - allegations of criminal offences were being made by ORG factions against each other , and \u2018 not necessarily [ their ] truth or falsity\u2019 ... It seems to me that these were allegations they were entitled to know about , in the context of a party presenting itself before the electorate of GPE , and especially so since the allegations against PERSON [ D. ] and [ R. ] had already been reported . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Referring to the relevant criteria for establishing the defence of qualified privilege set out by Lord PERSON of GPE in ORG judgment of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the judge noted that the allegations were serious and that there was a legitimate general public interest in the subject matter . While no steps had been taken to verify the information , this was not fatal in a reportage case where the fact of the allegations being made was the important element of the story . The judge further observed that the source was less significant in a reportage case , as it was not the reliability of either side which mattered but rather the nature of the quarrel . He commented that there was no urgency about the matter , that no investigation into the allegations had been conducted and that no comment was sought from the applicants . However , he noted that both claimants had in any case accepted that they would never have discussed political matters with anyone from LOC and , in light of the long history of Mr PERSON \u2019s interaction with the ORG , he considered that the failure to make an approach to the applicants was reasonable . Finally , he considered it obvious to readers that each of the factions was denying impropriety and accusing the other and noted that Mr PERSON was merely reporting the accusations and not \u201c adopting \u201d them . He concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . There is a duty ... upon political commentators generally ... to cover the goingson in political parties , including disputes , fully and impartially . There is a corresponding legitimate interest in the public , and especially those who have a vote , to have such information available . More specifically , ORG having covered the allegations against PERSON [ D. ] and [ NORP ] in its DATE issue , it would also be incumbent on it to cover their denials ...", "CARDINAL . In all the circumstances , I have no hesitation in upholding the privilege defence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He accordingly dismissed the ORG claim .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied for leave to appeal to ORG . Leave was refused on the papers by a single judge of ORG on DATE , who endorsed the approach taken by ORG judge , observing that :", "\u201c [ The judge \u2019s ] approach , which would undoubtedly be taken by this court too , is that libel litigation is not the conduct of political vendettas by other means . The article was a gratified report by the ORG \u2019s enemies of a venal falling out between some of its leading members and ex - members . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the renewed hearing for leave on DATE , leave was granted by CARDINAL ORG judges .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was heard on CARDINAL DATE before CARDINAL judges of ORG , including the judge who had initially refused leave to appeal on the papers . The applicants wished their counsel to apply for the judge who had refused leave to appeal to withdraw from the case . However , they were advised against this course of action by their counsel on the grounds that a judge would not allow his political opinions to influence his judgment and in any case such an application risked antagonising the judge in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG handed down its judgment dismissing the appeal .", "CARDINAL . As to the scope of the appeal , the judge who delivered the leading judgment of the court noted that in light of the pleaded defence of reportage , which had only recently been introduced to the jurisdiction through GPE , the appeal gave the court the opportunity to explore the nature and extent of that defence and its place in the libel law landscape . Following an examination of domestic and GPE authorities , the judge summarised the position as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]he journalist has a good defence to a claim for libel if what he publishes , even without an attempt to verify its truth , amounts to reportage , the best description of which gleaned from these cases is that it is the neutral reporting without adoption or embellishment or subscribing to any belief in its truth of attributed allegations of both sides of a political and possibly some other kind of dispute ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge considered that the following matters had to be taken into account when examining whether there was a defence on the ground of reportage :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The information must be in the public interest .", "( CARDINAL ) ... the publisher will not normally be protected unless he has taken reasonable steps to verify the truth and accuracy of what is published ... This is where reportage parts company with PERSON . In a true case of reportage there is no need to take steps to ensure the accuracy of the published information .", "( CARDINAL ) ... To qualify as reportage the report , judging the thrust of it as a whole , must have the effect of reporting , not the truth of the statements , but the fact that they were made ...", "( CARDINAL ) NORP Since the test is to establish the effect of the article as a whole , it is for the judge to rule upon it in a way analogous to a ruling on meaning ...", "( CARDINAL ) This protection will be lost if the journalist adopts the report and makes it his own or if he fails to report the story in a fair , disinterested and neutral way ...", "( CARDINAL ) To justify the attack on the claimant \u2019s reputation the publication must always meet the standards of responsible journalism as that concept has developed from PERSON , the burden being on the defendants ...", "( CARDINAL ) The seriousness of the allegation ... is obviously relevant for the harm it does to reputation if the charges are untrue . Ordinarily it makes verification all the more important ...", "( CARDINAL) The relevant factors properly applied will embrace the significance of the protagonists in public life and there is no need for insistence as pre - conditions for reportage on the defendant being a responsible prominent person or the claimant being a public figure ...", "( CARDINAL ) The urgency is relevant ... in the sense that fine editorial judgments taken as the presses are about to roll may command a more sympathetic review than decisions to publish with the luxury of time to reflect and public interest can wane with the passage of time ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the facts of the case , the judge considered that the DATE article covered a subject of legitimate public interest . He further found that the allegations were made in the context of reportage and were not adopted by the respondents as their own , thus absolving the respondents from verifying the truth of the allegations . While the allegations were serious , the thrust of the article related to the disagreement as to who should take charge of the collection money and not whether one or the other of the protagonists had stolen it . The judge was of the view that the public were entitled to know that the ORG was divided by this dispute . He observed that the source of the information was attributed and , given that the truth of the information was not being asserted , the reliability of the source was of little significance . In this regard , he noted that Mr PERSON had made some inquiries of other sources in order to establish that the dispute was real . Although no comment was sought from the applicants , this was understandable in light of the history between them and Mr Gable . While the tone was somewhat sarcastic , it was nonetheless as neutral and disinterested as any ORG article on the ORG could be . He concluded that the impugned article constituted a piece of responsible journalism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants wrote to the judge who had initially refused leave to appeal on the papers and who had been a member of ORG bench which heard the appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) accusing him of bias . They referred to the fact that he had refused leave to appeal in the case on the papers ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in a manner which , they considered , indicated his hostility towards their case . They further complained that following the appeal hearing but prior to the delivery of the judgment , the judge had attended a conference on extreme speech and democracy , at which persons hostile to the BNP and acquainted with Mr PERSON had been present . They asked for confirmation of whether the judge was a subscriber to ORG . The director of ORG responded on DATE denying that there was any lack of impartiality and explaining that no political issues had been considered by ORG in the decision , which concerned solely the development of libel law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants wrote to ORG judge who had delivered the leading judgment in their case , referring to the fact that the judge who had initially refused leave to appeal had formerly been a member of ORG and alleging that as a consequence he was \u201c diametrically opposed to the BNP \u201d . They referred again to the fact that the judge had attended a conference on extreme speech and pressed for a response as to whether he subscribed to ORG . In a subsequent letter dated DATE , the applicants wrote again to the judge who had delivered the leading judgment to reiterate their complaint of bias , having discovered that Mr Gable had stood as a parliamentary candidate for ORG at the time when the judge who had refused leave on the papers was a member of that party . They concluded that PERSON and the judge were therefore personally acquainted with one another .", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently applied for leave to appeal the decision of ORG . In their grounds of appeal dated DATE , they contested ORG decision regarding the defence of reportage . They did not challenge the impartiality of the judge in the appeal proceedings . They were refused leave to appeal by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The defence of qualified privilege was examined by ORG in ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL . In the context of his opinion , Lord PERSON listed CARDINAL factors relevant to whether a publication could avail itself of a qualified privilege defence to libel proceedings , noting that the factors set out were illustrative only . The relevant factors he identified were :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The seriousness of the allegation ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The nature of the information , and the extent to which the subject - matter is a matter of public concern .", "CARDINAL . NORP The source of the information ...", "CARDINAL .

Whether comment was sought from the plaintiff ... An approach to the plaintiff will not always be necessary .", "CARDINAL . Whether the article contained the gist of the plaintiff \u2019s side of the story .", "CARDINAL . The tone of the article . A newspaper can raise queries or call for an investigation . It need not adopt allegations as statements of fact .", "CARDINAL . The circumstances of the publication , including the timing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. HH ORG ( GPE ) Ltd [ DATE ] EWCA Civ DATE , the claimant , a member of a dissident party in GPE , sued the defendant newspaper , which supported the NORP government , for reporting a dispute between the claimant and A.M. , another member of his political party . The impugned report stated that A.M. had told the defendant \u2019s journalist that the claimant had spread malicious rumours about him ( A.M. ) and had said that A.M. \u2019s mother had procured women to have sexual intercourse with him at his home . At the liability hearing it was common ground that A.M. had made that allegation to the journalist and that it was in fact untrue . The newspaper published the allegation without verifying the information and the claimant was only contacted and asked for his comments on the allegations the following day .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that in a libel case , verification of a third party \u2019s allegation would ordinarily be appropriate and perhaps even essential before the defence of qualified privilege could be relied upon . However , the public was entitled to be informed of a political dispute which was being fully , fairly and disinterestedly reported without having to wait for the publisher , following an attempt at verification , to commit himself to CARDINAL side or the other . Lord Justice PERSON ( as he then was ) noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... To my mind [ the newspaper ] was entitled in this case to publish without attempting verification . Indeed in the present context verification could even be thought inconsistent with the objective reporting of the dispute ...", "CARDINAL . I am not , of course , saying that verification ( or at least an attempt at verification ) of a third party \u2019s allegations will not ordinarily be appropriate and perhaps even essential ...", "CARDINAL .
