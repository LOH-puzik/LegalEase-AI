THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in FAC , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant was served by the Inland Revenue with a Notice pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , which , inter alia , required the applicant to provide a certified statement of his assets and liabilities as at DATE .", "On DATE , when the applicant had failed to comply , he was summonsed to appear before ORG . The summons warned him that failure to comply with the notice rendered him liable to a penalty not exceeding QUANTITY ( ORG ) pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . ( The penalty had in fact been increased to GBP CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE , the applicant still having failed to comply was presented with a \u201c Hansard Warning . \u201d This involved the reading out to him of the reply of the Chancellor of the ORG to a Parliamentary question on DATE . This outlined the practice of ORG in cases of fraud indicating that it might accept a money settlement instead of instituting criminal proceedings and that its decision as to whether to accept a settlement or institute criminal proceedings would take into account whether the taxpayer had inter alia given full facilities for investigation into his affairs .", "On or about CARDINAL DATE , the applicant delivered to ORG a schedule of his assets as at DATE as required by the notice .", "The applicant was later charged with CARDINAL counts of cheating the public revenue of income tax and corporation tax . Count CARDINAL specified :", "\u201c STATEMENT OF OFFENCE", "Cheating Her Majesty the Queen and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue , contrary to common law .", "PARTICULARS OF OFFENCE", "[ The applicant ] on or about CARDINAL DATE with intent to defraud ... cheated Her Majesty the Queen and ORG of public revenue , namely , income tax , by delivering ... to an Inspector of Taxes a schedule of assets as at DATE in respect of his assets and the assets of his minor children which was false , misleading and deceptive in that it omitted to disclose divers assets which were owned by him . Particulars of the omitted assets are \u2013 his beneficial interest in shares issued by off - shore companies , his beneficial interest in properties held in the names of off - shore companies and his beneficial interest in bank accounts held in GPE and in GPE in the names of off - shore companies . \u201d", "The applicant was convicted of all counts on DATE . On DATE , he was sentenced to CARDINAL concurrent terms of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a confiscation order made in the sum of MONEY ( GBP ) . This sum was calculated as being the lesser of the CARDINAL sums , namely the amount of benefit from the offences ( GBP CARDINAL ) and the applicant \u2019s total realisable assets ( GBP CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed his appeal against conviction and on DATE , dismissed his appeal against sentence . In relation to the applicant \u2019s argument that he remained liable to pay the outstanding unpaid tax , it noted the undertaking given by ORG on DATE that it would not pursue the applicant for pre - existing tax liabilities out of any income which he might acquire in future .", "On DATE , ORG , reversing an earlier refusal , allowed his petition for leave to appeal from ORG on a number of points and also permitted him to raise a new point relating to LAW as concerned his conviction on count CARDINAL .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed his appeal . Lord PERSON giving judgment noted the applicant \u2019s arguments under the LAW in which he relied in particular upon the cases of ORG v. GPE and PERSON v. the GPE , that the prosecution case against him breached his right to a fair trial as he had been compelled under threat of penalty to incriminate himself by providing the schedule of assets and found as follows :", "\u201c ... the present case is one which relates to the obligation of a citizen to pay taxes and to his duty not to cheat the Revenue . It is self evident that payment of taxes fixed by the legislature is essential for the functioning of any democratic state . It is also self - evident that to ensure the due payment of taxes the ORG must have power to require its citizens to inform it of the amount of their DATE income and to have sanctions available to enforce the provision of that information ... \u201d", "He proceeded to review the tax legislation which required taxpayers to make tax returns .", "\u201c It is clearly permissible for a ORG to enact such provisions and there could be no substance in an argument that there is a violation of LAW if the revenue prosecuted a citizen for cheating the revenue by furnishing a standard tax return containing false information . Similarly , in the present case , viewed against that background that the ORG , for the purpose of collecting tax , is entitled to require a citizen to inform it of his income and to enforce penalties for failure to do so , the section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) notice requiring information can not constitute a violation of the right against self - incrimination . The present case is therefore clearly distinguishable from ORG on that ground ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
