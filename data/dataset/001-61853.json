The applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG ( ORG ) allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal in part , granting her an injunction against any further publication of the photos that had appeared in ORG magazine ( issue no .

Unlawful interference with the protection of that privacy could therefore be made out if photos were published that had been taken secretly and/or by catching unawares a person who had retired to such a place . That was the position here , where the applicant and her male companion had withdrawn to the far end of a restaurant courtyard with the clear aim of being out of the public eye .", "However , ORG dismissed the remainder of her appeal on the ground that , as a figure of contemporary society \u201c par excellence \u201d , the applicant had to tolerate the publication of photos in which she appeared in a public place even if they were photos of scenes from her daily life and not photos showing her exercising her official functions . The public had a legitimate interest in knowing where the applicant was staying and how she behaved in public .", "CARDINAL .

The provisions of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON [ GPE \u2013 Copyright Act ] on which the civil courts based their decisions in the present case are , however , compatible with LAW .", "Under LAW of LAW , general personality rights are guaranteed only within the framework of the constitutional order .

Pictures relating to contemporary society are excluded from that rule under section PERSON ) of the PERSON ... Under section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON , however , that exception does not apply where the dissemination interferes with a legitimate interest of the person represented . The protection by degrees under these rules ensures that they take account of the need to protect the person being represented as well as the community \u2019s desire to be informed and the interest of the media which satisfy that desire . That much has already been established by ORG ...", "...", "( b ) In the instant case regard must be had , in interpreting and applying sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON , not only to general personality rights , but also to the freedom of the press guaranteed by LAW , second sentence , of LAW in so far as the provisions in question also affect those freedoms .", "...", "The fact that the press fulfils the function of forming public opinion does not exclude entertainment from the functional guarantee under LAW . The formation of opinions and entertainment are not opposites . Entertainment also plays a role in the formation of opinions . It can sometimes even stimulate or influence the formation of opinions more than purely factual information . Moreover , there is a growing tendency in the media to do away with the distinction between information and entertainment both as regards press coverage generally and individual contributions , and to disseminate information in the form of entertainment or mix it with entertainment ( \u2018 infotainment\u2019 ) . Consequently , many readers obtain information they consider to be important or interesting from entertaining coverage ...", "Nor can mere entertainment be denied any role in the formation of opinions . That would amount to unilaterally presuming that entertainment merely satisfies a desire for amusement , relaxation , escapism or diversion . Entertainment can also convey images of reality and propose subjects for debate that spark off a process of discussion and assimilation relating to philosophies of life , values and behaviour models . In that respect , it fulfils important social functions ... When measured against the aim of protecting press freedom , entertainment in the press is neither negligible nor entirely worthless and therefore falls within the scope of application of fundamental rights ...", "The same is true of information about people . Personalisation is an important journalistic means of attracting attention . Very often it is this which first arouses interest in a problem and stimulates a desire for factual information . Similarly , interest in a particular event or situation is usually stimulated by personalised accounts . Additionally , celebrities embody certain moral values and lifestyles . Many people base their choice of lifestyle on their example . They become points of crystallisation for adoption or rejection and act as examples or counter - examples . This is what explains the public interest in the various ups and downs occurring in their lives .", "As regards politicians , this public interest has always been deemed to be legitimate from the point of view of transparency and democratic control . Nor can it in principle be disputed that it exists in respect of other public figures . To that extent it is the function of the press to show people in situations that are not limited to specific functions or events and this also falls within the sphere of protection of press freedom . It is only when a balancing exercise has to be done between competing personality rights that an issue arises as to whether matters of essential interest for the public are involved and treated seriously and objectively or whether private matters , designed merely to satisfy the public \u2019s curiosity , are being disseminated ...", "( c ) NORP The decision of ORG largely stands up to an examination of its compatibility with the constitutional rules .", "( aa ) ORG can not be criticised under constitutional law for assessing the conditions of application [ Tatbestandsvoraussetzungen ] of section PERSON ) no . CARDINAL of the PERSON according to the criterion of the community \u2019s interest in being informed and deciding on that basis that the photos showing the appellant outside her representative function in the Principality of GPE were lawful .", "Under section PERSON ) no . CARDINAL of the PERSON , the publication of pictures portraying an aspect of contemporary society are exempted from the obligation to obtain the consent of the person concerned within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the PERSON . Judging from the drafting history of the LAW ... and from the meaning and purpose of the words used , the provision in question takes into consideration the community \u2019s interest in being informed and the freedom of the press . Accordingly , the interpretation of this element [ Tatbestandsmerkmal ] must take account of the interests of the public . Pictures of people who are of no significance in contemporary society should not be made freely accessible to the public : they require the prior consent of the person concerned . The other element that is affected by fundamental rights , that of a \u2018 legitimate interest\u2019 for the purposes of section FAC ) of the PERSON , concerns DATE and this must be stressed at the outset \u2013 figures of contemporary society and can not therefore take sufficient account of the interests of the freedom of the press if these have previously been neglected when the circle of the persons concerned was defined .", "It is in keeping with the importance and scope of the freedom of the press , and not unreasonably restrictive of the protection of personality rights , that the concept of contemporary society referred to in section PERSON ) no . CARDINAL of the PERSON should not only cover , in accordance with a definition given by the courts , events of historical or political significance , but be defined on the basis of the public interest in being informed ... The kernel of press freedom and the free formation of opinions requires the press to have , within legal limits , sufficient margin of manoeuvre to allow it to decide , in accordance with its publishing criteria , what the public interest demands , and the process of forming opinion to establish what amounts to a matter of public interest . As has been stated , entertaining coverage is no exception to these principles .", "Nor should ORG be criticised for including in the \u2018 domain of contemporary society\u2019 , within the meaning of section PERSON ) no . CARDINAL of the PERSON , pictures of people who have not only aroused public interest at a certain point on the occasion of a particular historical event but who , on account of their status and importance , attract the public \u2019s attention in general and not just on the odd occasion . Account should also be taken in this regard of the fact that , compared to the situation at the time LAW was passed , increased importance is given DATE to illustrated information . The concept of a \u2018 figure of contemporary society \u201c par excellence \u201d \u2019 [ \u2018 ORG Person der GPE ] , often employed in this respect in the case - law and legal theory , does not conclusively derive from statute or LAW . If , as was done by ORG and ORG , it is interpreted as a shortened expression designating people whose image is deemed by the public to be worthy of respect out of consideration for the people concerned , it is irreproachable from the point of view of constitutional law at least as long as a balancing exercise is carried out between the public \u2019s interest in being informed and the legitimate interests of the person concerned .", "General personality rights do not require publications that are not subject to prior consent to be limited to pictures of figures of contemporary society in the exercise of their function in society . Very often the public interest aroused by such figures does not relate exclusively to the exercise of their function in the strict sense . It can , on the contrary , by virtue of the particular function and its impact , extend to information about the way in which these figures behave generally \u2013 that is , also outside their function \u2013 in public . The public has a legitimate interest in being allowed to judge whether the personal behaviour of the individuals in question , who are often regarded as idols or role models , convincingly tallies with their behaviour on their official engagements .", "If , on the other hand , the right to publish pictures of people considered to be figures of contemporary society were to be limited to their official functions , insufficient account would be taken of the public interest properly aroused by such figures and this would , moreover , favour a selective presentation that would deprive the public of certain necessary judgmental possibilities in respect of figures of socio - political life , having regard to the function of role model of such figures and the influence they exert . The press is not , however , allowed to use every picture of figures of contemporary society . On the contrary , section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON gives the courts adequate opportunity to apply the protective provisions of LAW read in conjunction with LAW ...", "( bb ) In theory the criteria established by ORG for interpreting the concept of \u2018 legitimate interest\u2019 used in section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON are irreproachable from the point of view of constitutional law .", "According to the decision being appealed , the privacy meriting protection that must also be afforded to \u2018 figures of contemporary society \u201c par excellence \u201d \u2019 presupposes that they have retired to a secluded place with the objectively recognisable aim of being alone and where , confident of being alone , they behave in a manner in which they would not behave in public . ORG accepted that there had been a breach of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON where this type of picture was taken secretly or by catching the person unawares .", "The criterion of a secluded place takes account of the aim , pursued by the general right to protection of personality rights , of allowing the individual a sphere , including outside the home , in which he does not feel himself to be the subject of permanent public attention \u2013 and relieves him of the obligation of behaving accordingly DATE and in which he can relax and enjoy some peace and quiet . This criterion does not excessively restrict press freedom because it does not impose a blanket ban on pictures of the DATE or private life of figures of contemporary society , but allows them to be shown where they have appeared in public . In the event of an overriding public interest in being informed , the freedom of the press can even , in accordance with that case - law authority , be given priority over the protection of the private sphere ...", "ORG properly held that it is legitimate to draw conclusions from the behaviour adopted in a given situation by an individual who is clearly in a secluded spot . However , the protection against dissemination of photos taken in that context does not only apply where the individual behaves in a manner in which he would not behave in public . On the contrary , the development of the personality can not be properly protected unless , irrespective of his behaviour , the individual has a space in which he can relax without having to tolerate the presence of photographers or cameramen . That is not in issue here , however , since , according to the findings on which ORG based its decision , the first of the conditions to which protection of private life is subject has not been met .", "Lastly , there is nothing unconstitutional , when balancing the public interest in being informed against the protection of private life , in attaching importance to the method used to obtain the information in question ... It is doubtful , however , that the mere fact of photographing the person secretly or catching them unawares can be deemed to infringe their privacy outside the home . Having regard to the function attributed to that privacy under constitutional law and to the fact that it is usually impossible to determine from a photo whether the person has been photographed secretly or caught unawares , the existence of unlawful interference with that privacy can not in any case be made out merely because the photo was taken in those conditions . As , however , ORG has already established in respect of the photographs in question that the appellant was not in a secluded place , the doubts expressed above have no bearing on the review of its decision .", "( cc ) However , the constitutional requirements have not been satisfied in so far as the decisions of which the appellant complains did not take account of the fact that the right to protection of personality rights of persons in the appellant \u2019s situation is strengthened by LAW those ORG intimate relations with their children .", "( dd ) The following conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing considerations with regard to the photographs in question :", "The decision of ORG can not be criticised under constitutional law regarding the photos of the appellant at a market , doing her shopping at a market accompanied by her bodyguard or dining with a male companion at a well - attended restaurant . The first CARDINAL cases concerned an open location frequented by the general public . The third case admittedly concerned a well - circumscribed location , spatially speaking , but CARDINAL in which the appellant was exposed to the other people present . It is for this reason , moreover , that ORG deemed it legitimate to ban photos showing the appellant in a restaurant garden , which were the subject of the decision being appealed but are not the subject of the constitutional appeal . The presence of the appellant and her companion there presented all the features of seclusion . The fact that the photographs in question were evidently taken from a distance shows that the appellant could legitimately have assumed that she was not exposed to public view .", "Nor can the decision being appealed be criticised regarding the photos of the appellant alone on horseback or riding a bicycle . In ORG view , the appellant had not been in a secluded place , but in a public one . That finding can not attract criticism under constitutional law . The appellant herself describes the photos in question as belonging to the intimacy of her private sphere merely because they manifest her desire to be alone . In accordance with the criteria set out above , the mere desire of the person concerned is not relevant in any way .", "The CARDINAL photos of the appellant with her children require a fresh examination , however , in the light of the constitutional rules set out above . We can not rule out the possibility that the review that needs to be carried out in the light of the relevant criteria will lead to a different result for CARDINAL or other or all the photos . The decision must therefore be set aside in that respect and remitted to ORG for a fresh decision .", "( d ) The decisions of ORG and ORG resulted in a violation of fundamental rights by limiting to the home the privacy protected by LAW read in conjunction with LAW in accordance , moreover , with a rationale that was in keeping with the case - law at the time . The decisions in question do not need to be set aside , however , since the violation complained of has been remedied in part by ORG and the remainder of the case remitted to that court .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
