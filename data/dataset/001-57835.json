THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6", "JUDGES": "John Freeland;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a GPE national born on CARDINAL DATE . At the time of the events now under examination , he was DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from a youth custody centre after serving a custodial sentence for rape .", "DATE , on DATE , the applicant was again arrested on suspicion of attempted rape . Following his arrest , he admitted the crime to the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was brought before Judge PERSON , juvenile judge ( kinderrechter ) at ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) , who sat in the capacity of investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) . The applicant was assisted by his lawyer . The private association which was the applicant \u2019s legal guardian was represented by CARDINAL social workers .", "The applicant again confessed .", "On an application by ORG ( officier van justitie ) , Juvenile Judge PERSON ordered the applicant to be placed in initial detention on remand ( bewaring ) . He also ordered a preliminary investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) with a view to having a psychiatric report drawn up . Neither the applicant nor his lawyer objected .", "CARDINAL . Again on an application by ORG , Juvenile Judge PERSON , sitting in the capacity of review chamber ( raadkamer ) , made an order for the applicant \u2019s extended detention on remand ( gevangenhouding ) on CARDINAL DATE . He prolonged this order twice on the occasion of periodic reviews , on DATE and DATE . At no time did either the applicant or his lawyer raise any objection .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the preliminary investigation , the applicant underwent a psychiatric examination . The resultant psychiatric report recommended that , if the charge were to be proven , the applicant should be sent to an institution for psychiatric treatment ( inrichting voor buitengewone behandeling ) , pursuant to LAW ) , but not punished .", "The defence , fearing that the applicant \u2019s initial confession had been obtained under duress , requested that the CARDINAL police officers who had taken down his initial statement following his arrest be questioned as witnesses . Juvenile Judge PERSON referred the matter to Judge PERSON , Vice - President of ORG and substitute juvenile judge . Judge PERSON questioned the CARDINAL police officers on CARDINAL and DATE . The results were such that the defence did not ask for them to be heard again at the trial .", "The preliminary investigation in the present case consisted only of the questioning of the said witnesses and the above - mentioned psychiatric examination .", "CARDINAL . The applicant received a summons in DATE to appear before ORG Judge PERSON on DATE for trial .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , DATE before the trial was to take place , the applicant \u2019s lawyer challenged Juvenile Judge PERSON on the ground that he was not impartial , since he had taken pre - trial decisions concerning the applicant \u2019s detention on remand .", "Juvenile Judge PERSON rejected the challenge as ill - founded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision to ORG , which rejected the challenge on DATE . In its decision ORG considered in detail the relevance of the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . ORG was of the opinion that there was a fundamental difference between the position of a NORP investigating judge and that of a GPE juvenile judge , particularly as far as their independence was concerned . It further held that the FAC judgment did not imply that the performance of the functions of investigating judge and trial judge in the same case constituted a breach of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) under all circumstances . GPE juvenile criminal procedure provided for an exception to the rule of general criminal procedure prohibiting the combination in a single person of the functions of investigating judge and trial judge ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) below ) . As the juvenile judge had rightly emphasised in his decision , the reason for this was to be found in the pre - eminence of the educational aspect of juvenile criminal law and the importance of optimally co - ordinating the various decisions taken with regard to the minor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was eventually tried on DATE , by Juvenile Judge PERSON . He was assisted by his lawyer . CARDINAL of the social workers representing the private association which was the applicant \u2019s legal guardian was also present and allowed to speak .", "Confirming his earlier statements , the applicant admitted the charge , which was then held to be proven in the light of the evidence . In accordance with the recommendation contained in the psychiatric report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant was committed to an institution for the psychiatric treatment of juvenile offenders pursuant to LAW . He was reminded by the juvenile judge of the right to appeal , but the applicant \u2019s lawyer , who alone could decide to do so ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , did not file an appeal .", "In DATE Juvenile Judge PERSON carried out the DATE review required by Article PERSON of LAW to determine whether or not it continued to be in the applicant \u2019s interests for him to remain in the institution . Apparently neither the applicant nor his lawyer raised any objection to the prolongation of the measure . The applicant was released unconditionally on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE it has been the rule in the GPE not to apply penal law and criminal procedure to juveniles in the same way as to adults . Juvenile penal law and criminal procedure provide for exceptions to the general law : that is , general penal law and criminal procedure apply to the extent that they are not expressly deviated from .", "Juveniles can not be prosecuted for acts committed before DATE ( Article PERSON of LAW ) .", "Juvenile criminal procedure applies if the suspect has not yet reached DATE when a prosecution against him is commenced ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) ) .", "In principle , the same age - limit applies in juvenile penal law ( Article CARDINALb of LAW ) . However , subject to certain conditions , LAW makes it possible on the one hand to apply general penal law to a suspect who at the time of the offence was DATE or DATE ( LAW , ibid . ) , and on the other hand to apply juvenile penal law to a suspect who at the time of the offence had reached the age of DATE but not yet that of QUANTITY ( Article GPE , ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . Juvenile penal law is different from that applying to adults only in that it has its own system of punishments ( straffen ) and curative or protective measures ( maatregelen ) designed to meet the specific aims of this branch of criminal law which ( in the words of the Explanatory Note to the Act of DATE - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) \" has primarily a pedagogical purpose , the interests of the minor being borne in mind at all times \" , and which , accordingly , seeks mainly to protect and educate the juvenile concerned .", "Punishments available under juvenile penal law are placement in a youth custody centre ( tuchtschool ) for DATE , juvenile detention ( arrest ) for DATE , a fine of MONEY and a reprimand ( berisping ) ( LAW ) . The measures include , inter alia , judicial supervision ( ondertoezichtstelling ) - which is in fact a protective measure under civil law ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ( PERSON ) ) - and committal to an institution for the psychiatric treatment of young offenders ( Article CARDINALh ) . The latter is a curative measure applied only to young persons with impaired mental development or suffering from a serious mental disturbance ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Juvenile criminal procedure also seeks to protect and educate , but here the differences from general criminal procedure are considerable .", "The underlying principle of juvenile criminal procedure is that it", "\" should be simple and understandable for both the minors concerned and their parents . Formalities which have some purpose for adults but are practically devoid of purpose in relation to minors should be omitted , whereas on the other hand special requirements should ensure proper treatment of juvenile cases \" . ( Quoted from the Explanatory Note to the LAW DATE , which Act entered into force in DATE , by which juvenile criminal procedure - introduced in DATE and thoroughly reviewed in DATE - was modernised )", "It is by reason of this basic idea and of the need to improve the protection of juveniles by creating links with the protection of juveniles in civil law - in which the juvenile judge is the central actor and is empowered to order various protective measures - that the juvenile judge is the central actor in juvenile criminal procedure also . Several advantages are claimed for this system :", "( a ) it is conducive to the protection of the juvenile if the juvenile judge is consulted beforehand on the subject of the desirability of criminal prosecution , especially if he already knows the minor concerned ; this may be the case for example if he has been involved in protective measures under civil law , such as placing the minor under judicial supervision ;", "( b ) a relationship of trust may develop between the juvenile judge on the one hand and the minor and his or her parents or guardian on the other owing to the fact that the minor and his or her parents or guardian ( who are summoned to appear at the preliminary investigation stage and the trial and have the right to speak ) are dealt with by one and the same judge throughout the proceedings , which moreover are held in private and in an informal manner ;", "( c ) in those cases in which the juvenile has made an immediate confession - as usually happens when the suspect is a minor - a plan may be developed at an early stage for the future of the juvenile concerned , even during the preliminary investigation ;", "( d ) the juvenile judge is the most suitable person for the purpose in view of his expert knowledge and his considerable decision - making powers .", "The close link between protective measures under civil law and criminal prosecution may be seen in LAW ; if there are proceedings relating to the protection of the minor under civil law ( such as a request to have him or her placed under judicial supervision or aimed at divesting the parents of their parental rights ) running parallel to the criminal prosecution , then under this provision the prosecution may be suspended until a final decision has been taken in those parallel proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The central position of the juvenile judge appears clearly from the fact that the juvenile judge is involved in the decision whether or not to prosecute . According to LAW , if ORG wishes to drop charges against a minor unconditionally , he must first consult the juvenile judge ; if he wishes to do so conditionally , he requires the juvenile judge \u2019s consent . If charges are not dropped immediately , ORG must obtain from the child welfare authorities information on the minor \u2019s personality and living conditions ; they may then comment on the desirability of prosecution ( ibid . , LAW .", "In order to implement these provisions effectively , it has been the practice for the juvenile judge , ORG and the representative of the child welfare authorities to meet on a regular basis to discuss case files together . This so - called \" CARDINAL - way consultation \" ( driehoeksoverleg ) took place in the absence of the minor or his legal representative or counsel , and without their being informed about it .", "CARDINAL . The juvenile judge is also the central figure in the investigation phase .", "( a ) This is clear in the first place from Article CARDINAL of LAW , which stipulates that the juvenile judge is to act as investigating judge , and from LAW , which reads :", "\" CARDINAL . The juvenile judge shall be responsible for the preliminary investigation , unless the case involves CARDINAL or more suspects who have reached DATE at the moment the prosecution against them is commenced and the case can not , in the initial opinion of ORG and the juvenile judge , be divided .", "CARDINAL . In cases where the juvenile judge orders a preliminary investigation , he shall be regarded as investigating judge responsible for the preliminary investigation . \"", "This means that the juvenile judge has all the decision- making powers of an investigating judge and that he is in charge of the preliminary investigation .", "A preliminary investigation may involve such matters as obtaining expert opinions and technical evidence , questioning witnesses , mail and telephone interceptions , searches and visits to the scene of the crime , as well as interrogation of the suspect .", "According to LAW , a judge who has undertaken any investigation in the case as an investigating judge is debarred from taking part in the trial ; however , by virtue of Article CARDINALd , this provision does not apply in juvenile procedure .", "( b ) It is also the juvenile judge who takes all decisions concerning detention on remand . In adult criminal procedure , initial detention on remand ( for a maximum of DATE , which may be prolonged once for DATE ) is ordered by the investigating judge and extended detention on remand ( for a maximum of DATE , which may be prolonged twice for further periods of DATE ) by the review chamber of ORG . In juvenile criminal procedure , the juvenile judge exercises both these powers ; he not only officiates as investigating judge but also , pursuant to Article CARDINAL , as review chamber . CARDINAL consequence of this is that in cases where in adult criminal procedure an appeal against decisions of the investigating judge lies to the review chamber , and to the extent that such appeals are allowed in juvenile procedure , the juvenile judge may be called upon to hear appeals against some of his own decisions .", "CARDINAL . The central position of the juvenile judge further appears from the fact that it is , as a rule , the juvenile judge himself who , sitting as a single judge , conducts the trial and gives judgment ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ) . It is for the juvenile judge to decide whether or not the case is one that should be referred to a chamber consisting of the juvenile judge and CARDINAL other judges ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , in conjunction with Article ORG ) .", "The juvenile judge is also involved to a significant degree with the execution of the punishment or measure imposed . For example , a sentence to the punishment of juvenile detention is not executed until the judge who imposed it has been consulted ( LAW ) and the punishment of reprimand is administered personally by the judge who imposed it ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . If the juvenile concerned has not yet reached DATE , then it is his lawyer who enjoys all the procedural rights afforded the suspect by LAW ) instead of the juvenile himself ( with the exception of the rights which the suspect may avail himself of during the hearing ) ( LAW para . CARDINAL ) . However , the juvenile \u2019s legal guardian ( wettelijke vertegenwoordiger ) may file a note of protest to the president of the court with jurisdiction as to both facts and law before which the juvenile is being prosecuted or was last prosecuted if he disapproves of the lawyer \u2019s use of these rights or his failure to make use of them ( LAW para . CARDINAL ) .", "Pursuant to LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) an appeal against the judgment of the juvenile judge lies to ORG ( gerechtshof ) . Such an appeal involves a complete re - examination of the case by CARDINAL judges ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . For a long time there has been criticism of the system described above . For this reason , a committee for the revision of juvenile criminal law was set up in DATE and it published a report in DATE . Criticism of the existing system in legal writing increased as a result of this report and of the judgments of ORG in the cases of PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and GPE v. GPE ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . However , opinion is still divided on the question to what extent it is necessary to modify the present system .", "These factors have resulted in informal changes in the way the system operates ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and a proposal for a change of the law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In this connection , it is also useful to mention a development in GPE case - law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the first place , there is now an informal arrangement under which the juvenile judge , when confronted with a suspect who denies charges , entrusts the interrogation of witnesses to another juvenile judge and to that extent does not act as investigating judge . However , even in such cases he continues to take the decisions on detention on remand .", "Secondly , \" CARDINAL - way consultations \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) have been discontinued at ORG .", "CARDINAL . A proposal for an amendment of the law was sent to ORG in DATE ; the written procedure has not yet been completed . It essentially follows the suggestions of the committee referred to in paragraph CARDINAL above , the gist of which is to remove from the juvenile judge the functions of investigating judge and review chamber . However , the proposal differs from those suggestions in that the juvenile judge is to retain the power to order initial detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . This last feature corresponds to the case - law of ORG ( PERSON ) , particularly its judgments of DATE , GPE ( PERSON ) DATE , no . CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL . In the first - mentioned judgment ORG construed Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as meaning that an investigating judge who had not carried out any preliminary investigations but had given the order for initial detention on remand was not debarred from sitting at the trial . This was not held to jeopardise his independence . The judgment of DATE concerned a juvenile judge who sat at the trial pursuant to Article ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) after he had instituted a preliminary investigation in the case as investigating judge . ORG held that as a result one of the judges taking part in the trial lacked impartiality as required by DATE ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention . According to ORG , such would always be the case if", "\" CARDINAL of those judges [ had ] previously had dealings in the same case aimed at the collection of evidence , either as an investigating judge in the course of the preliminary investigation or in another way during the investigations preparing the case \" .", "CARDINAL . As far as the preconditions for initial and extended detention on remand are concerned , juvenile criminal procedure does not differ from adult criminal procedure . They are to be found in CARDINAL and DATE of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "LAW enumerates the cases in which detention on remand ( voorlopige hechtenis ) may be ordered ; for present purposes , these may be summarised as those cases in which a person is suspected of a relatively serious crime ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . In addition , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\" The preceding paragraphs of this Article shall only be applied if it appears from certain facts or circumstances that there are serious indications ( ernstige bezwaren ) against the suspect . \"", "In this connection , the Memorandum in Reply ( PERSON ) accompanying a proposal for amendment of the statutory provisions governing detention on remand states that there are such serious indications when in the opinion of the investigating judge", "\" it is prima facie likely ( aannemelijk ) that the suspect has committed the offence in relation to which detention on remand is applied for \" . ( see ORG PERSON to ORG -CARDINAL - CARDINAL-No . CARDINAL , page CARDINAL )", "Article ORG enumerates the reasons for which detention on remand may be ordered . These may be summarised as the serious risk of the suspect \u2019s absconding ; the fact that the crime , being of a particularly grave nature , has created considerable social unrest ; the serious risk that the suspect will commit more crimes of a grave nature and the need to secure evidence .", "However , paragraph CARDINAL of Article PERSON provides :", "\" An order for detention on remand shall not be made if there exists a distinct possibility that in the event of conviction no unconditional prison sentence or measure involving loss of liberty will be imposed on the suspect , or that implementation of the order will cause [ the suspect ] to be deprived of his liberty for longer than the duration of the sentence or the measure . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
