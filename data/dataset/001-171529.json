In DATE the applicant asked the authorities to return to her some buildings and a plot of land owned by her father before nationalisation in DATE . In DATE the applicant wrote to the authorities to ask why the buildings and the land had been sold to other persons in DATE . The authorities replied in DATE that the applicant had given an incorrect address for the buildings when submitting her request for her property rights to be restored and the buildings in question had already been privatised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon their own initiative , the authorities suggested to the applicant that she submit a request to be paid monetary compensation for the buildings , if she did not have any objections to such a form of restitution . On DATE the authorities indicated that the documents submitted by the applicant did not prove that her father had owned the buildings in question and asked her to provide additional documents or DATE if she did not have those documents in her possession \u2013 to ask the domestic courts to establish as a legal fact that her father had owned those buildings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim with ORG , asking it to establish as a legal fact that before DATE nationalisation her father had owned the buildings and a plot of land . On DATE ORG stated that there was a dispute about the applicable law and left the applicant \u2019s claim unexamined . The court also suggested to the applicant that she submit her claim in accordance with the rules governing contentious proceedings ( as opposed to the rules applicable to the procedure for the establishment of a legal fact ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG established as a legal fact that the applicant \u2019s father had owned the buildings before the DATE nationalisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant indicated that she wanted to receive compensation in the form of securities . The authorities asked ORG ( a ORG enterprise ) to assess the value of the buildings , which was set on DATE at CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) . On DATE the authorities recommended that applicant \u2019s and her sister \u2019s property rights to their father \u2019s property be restored by paying them compensation in securities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the authorities adopted a decision to restore the applicant \u2019s and her sister \u2019s property rights by paying them LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in total in securities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged a claim with ORG , requesting the annulment of the valuation of the buildings made by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the appointment of independent experts to assess the market value of the buildings because she considered that the value set for the buildings was too low . The applicant \u2019s claim contained deficiencies , which she failed to eliminate within the time - limit set by ORG ; accordingly , on DATE , the court decided to rule that the applicant \u2019s claim had not been lodged .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a separate complaint , where she claimed that the authorities assessed the value of the buildings incorrectly , and complaining that the assessment of the value of the buildings had been made before the decision to restore her property rights had been taken . On DATE ORG held that ORG had made procedural mistakes and returned the case for fresh examination to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a modified claim with ORG , complaining that the assessment of the value of the buildings had been made DATE before the decision to restore her property rights had been taken . On DATE ORG held that although there were no provisions in the domestic law indicating how soon after the assessment of value the decision to restore property rights had to be taken , in the present case the time between the assessment and the decision had not been excessively long . The court therefore dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed raising the same complaints as she did before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and on DATE ORG held that the assessment of value of the buildings had been based on several methods of calculation and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law . It therefore dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , and on DATE ORG decided that the case had to be examined before the administrative rather than civil courts and referred the case for examination to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the hearing before ORG , the applicant asked for the examination of the case to be postponed that she might have time to eliminate deficiencies in her claim . She also claimed that she was not aware of the fact that she had to submit a request to renew the time - limit for lodging a complaint separately , and asked the court to provide her with an opportunity to do that . Her requests were granted and the examination of the case was postponed until DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged a modified claim in which , inter alia , she asked ORG to ( i ) annul the assessment of the value of the buildings made by ORG , ( ii ) to annul that part of the order of the authorities for her property rights to be restored in which the value of the buildings was indicated and ( iii ) to renew the time - limit for lodging a complaint . On DATE , during the hearing at ORG , the applicant asked for the appointment of an expert to determine the market value of the buildings . On DATE the court suspended the proceedings , appointed an expert and asked the expert ( i ) what the market value of the buildings had been on DATE and ( ii ) what the market value of the buildings had been DATE , i. e. when the expert had been appointed . In DATE the expert stated that on DATE the market value of the buildings had been LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) and that the market value of the buildings at the time that the examination of the case had started had been LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) . Subsequently the court proceedings were resumed , and on DATE ORG held that the new assessment of value of the buildings was more accurate and decided to annul the assessment of value of DATE by ORG and that part of the decision of DATE to restore the applicant \u2019s property rights in which the value of the buildings was set at LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The applicant did not appeal and the decision became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant lodged a claim with ORG , asking , inter alia , for the authorities to be obliged to urgently re - issue the annulled part of the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined and then rejected a claim by the applicant seeking for GPE to be obliged to pay her LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) for the buildings and to award her LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) in damages . The court held that the assessment of value in itself did not give rise to any legal consequences for the applicant . The court concluded that the decision of the authorities of CARDINAL DATE was still in force and that the question of the amount of the compensation was a matter for the public authorities and that it was not within the court \u2019s power to give instructions to them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , but on DATE ORG dismissed her appeal . The court held that the applicant \u2019s request had been for the value of the buildings to be set at what their value had been at the moment when the expert valuation had been carried out in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court also observed that the amendment of the decision of CARDINAL DATE to restore the applicant \u2019s property rights had not yet been adopted and it was not clear how the applicant \u2019s rights were being breached . The court also held that the applicant had repeatedly raised the issue of the assessment of the value of the buildings , which had already been resolved . The court upheld the conclusion of the court of first instance that public authorities\u2019 functions did not fall within the jurisdiction of the domestic courts ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant requested that the proceedings be reopened . On DATE ORG refused her request .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the relevant authorities were informed that an additional assessment of the value of the buildings had to be made and then ORG asked ORG to urgently assess their value . As no response was received , in DATE ORG again asked ORG to assess the value of the buildings . The assessment was made on DATE and the value of the buildings was set at LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in total , of which the applicant \u2019s part was LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . This valuation was officially approved by the authorities on DATE , when they amended the annulled part of the decision of CARDINAL DATE to restore the applicant \u2019s and her sister \u2019s property rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request to be compensated in securities of a ORG - owned enterprise . On DATE the applicant was sent a document of acceptance in respect of CARDINAL units of securities , the nominal value of each unit being ORG ( QUANTITY ) . ORG asked the applicant to sign the document of acceptance and indicated that the nominal value of CARDINAL security was ORG ( QUANTITY ) but that the real value was LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . It meant that the real total value of the shares was LTL MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , which was the applicant \u2019s part of the compensation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The transfer of the securities was finalised on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the authorities to set the value of the buildings at the value that they had as of DATE and to pay her additional compensation . In DATE the authorities replied that there were no grounds for re - examining and deciding on questions regarding the restoration of property rights to the applicant because the procedure had already been finalised .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a claim with the domestic courts , asking , inter alia , that the decision of the authorities of CARDINAL DATE by which the annulled part of the decision of DATE had been amended ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) be quashed . She also requested the annulment of the assessment of value of the buildings at LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) made by ORG on DATE . The applicant \u2019s claim had several deficiencies and she was asked several times to eliminate them . However , the applicant failed to do so in an acceptable manner and on CARDINAL DATE ORG declined to examine her claim . The court stated that the applicant had asked it to oblige the authorities to provide one of the original copies of the decision of DATE ; however , it observed that the applicant already had an original copy . It was suggested by the court that the applicant contest the order of CARDINAL DATE , because it was that document which had legal consequences for her . This , according to the information in the ORG \u2019s possession , she never did ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
