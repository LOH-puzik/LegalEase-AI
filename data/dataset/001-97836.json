GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Konstantins Petuhovs , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr A. Funck , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant , assisted by an interpreter , was questioned by the GPE police in criminal investigation proceedings against him . On DATE he was brought before the investigating judge who issued an arrest warrant , charging the applicant with robbery and dangerous bodily injury . The warrant was translated and a copy was handed to the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant and an accomplice were indicted for joint robbery and dangerous bodily injury . The account of the offence was essentially the same as in the arrest warrant with CARDINAL exceptions : The arrest warrant mentioned that the victim was knocked down a the second time by the co - accused immediately following the first attack by the applicant , whereas the indictment alleged that the victim was able to take a few steps before being knocked down again . Furthermore , the arrest warrant only mentioned that a bag with a wallet was snatched from the victim , whereas the indictment talked about a blue bag with QUANTITY .", "On DATE ORG appointed counsel for the applicant and assigned an interpreter for their conversations . Meetings between counsel and the applicant , assisted by an interpreter , were held on DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "After the proceedings against the applicant had been severed and the main proceedings opened , on DATE ORG submitted a decision to refer ( PERSON ) to ORG , finding that the circumstances of the offence might amount to aggravated robbery , and in view of the then higher expectation of punishment might warrant the referral of the proceedings to the higher court . ORG assumed the proceedings after the defence had submitted observations .", "At the trial on DATE counsel for the defence applied for the proceedings to be stayed for the reason that the applicant had not received a translation of the indictment of CARDINAL DATE which , according to counsel for the defence , was essential for him to prepare his defence . After deliberations ORG rejected the application , arguing that the arrest warrant , which had been translated , was identical to the indictment and had thus informed the applicant in detail of the nature and cause of the accusation . Furthermore , it had to be assumed that counsel for the defence had discussed the nature and cause of the straightforward accusation with the applicant at one of their several meetings . ORG held that under these circumstances an oral translation had to be considered sufficient .", "The trial then continued with the reading and the translation of the indictment . After hearing the applicant \u2019s pleading to the charges and CARDINAL witnesses ORG found the applicant guilty of aggravated robbery and dangerous bodily injury . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , based on the lack of a written translation of the indictment , was dismissed by ORG on DATE as ill - founded .", "On DATE the ORG declined to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for examination . It held the complaint to be inadmissible arguing that the prior appeal on points of law had been inadmissible ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
