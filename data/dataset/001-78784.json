He is represented before the Court by Ms PERSON , PERSON at ORG and GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is an owner of real properties LOC : o CARDINAL:CARDINAL and PERSON : o CARDINAL in the municipality of ORG , which lies in GPE . He acquired the plots of land in DATE and DATE , respectively . The properties included water areas in LOC , which is a border river between GPE and GPE , and its lower course is located in NORP territory . The applicant is resident in PERSON , a town situated outside the LOC valley .", "Since DATE GPE and GPE have concluded treaties on fishing in the fishing area ( in NORP \u201c kalastuspiiri \u201d , in NORP \u201c fiskeomr\u00e5de \u201d ) of LOC . LAW currently in force was concluded on DATE ( LAW on the Mutual Fishing Regulations regarding LOC of LOC , \u201c the DATE LAW ; sopimus PERSON kalastuspiirin yhteisest\u00e4 kalastuss\u00e4\u00e4nn\u00f6st\u00e4 , \u00f6verenskommelsen ang\u00e5ende gemensam fiskeristadga f\u00f6r Tana \u00e4lvs fiskeomr\u00e5de ; Finnish Treaty Series no . CARDINAL ) , and it was adopted by LAW of DATE ( Act no.CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The LAW was accompanied by LAW ( kalastuss\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6 , fiskeristadgan ) of LOC ( \u201c the Fishing Regulation \u201d ) . LAW and LAW were incorporated into NORP law by an Act enacted according to the order prescribed for the enactment of constitutional legislation . They entered into force on DATE .", "Under LAW its aim is to protect and maintain the natural stocks of anadromous salmonoids ( salmon , sea trout and LOC sea char ) and freshwater fishes , so as to preserve local biodiversity and natural productivity . ORG is applicable to those parts of the Teno , ORG and LOC which belong to GPE and constitute part of the border between GPE .", "The rights of ownership and the fishing rights in LOC are arranged differently in the CARDINAL countries : the NORP parts of the LOC waters are mainly privately owned by partnership of joint owners , and each joint owner of fishing waters is entitled to pursue fishing up to the extent of his share in the joint fishing waters . In GPE , fishing rights are based on the use of land , and the NORP parts of LOC are owned by the ORG .", "According to ORG persons who have fishing rights in their capacity as owners of the water area and who have a permanent residence in the LOC valley , are in a privileged position compared to those land owners who live outside the river valley with respect to the price of the fishing licence and the fishing equipment allowed .", "In DATE the Act on Compensation for ORG by LAW and by the corresponding Fishing Regulation entered into force ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ; laki Tenojoen kalastuss\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6\u00e4 koskevan sopimuksen ja kalastuss\u00e4\u00e4nn\u00f6n er\u00e4iden m\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4ysten aiheuttamien menetysten korvaamisesta , lag om ers\u00e4ttande av f\u00f6rluster p\u00e5 grund av vissa best\u00e4mmelser i \u00f6verenskommelsen ang\u00e5ende fiskeristadgan f\u00f6r Tana \u00e4lv och i den d\u00e4rtill anslutna fiskeristadgan ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Under the said LAW holder of fishing rights shall be paid full compensation for any losses that are caused by LAW or the accompanying Fishing Regulation and prevent him from using his fishing rights . Corresponding compensation is also paid for losses caused by the previous Treaties .", "Apparently a redemption procedure prescribed in the DATE LAW for the determination of compensation for the losses caused to the applicant was initiated on DATE before ORG ( maanmittaustoimisto , lantm\u00e4teribyr\u00e5n ) . The procedure is still pending . According to the Government the proceedings were suspended because , inter alia , the shareholder lists for the fishing places outside the reparcelling unit have not yet been confirmed .", "On DATE the applicant fished with a rod and artificial lure in his waters , without having paid for the fishing licence required for those who were not resident in the LOC valley .", "On DATE the public prosecutor preferred charges against the applicant for fishing in violation of the DATE LAW , ORG and LAW ( kalastuslaki , lag om fiske ) as the applicant had been fishing without a required fishing licence and had used a prohibited lure .", "On DATE the GPE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tt ) convicted him of breaching LAW , LAW and LAW and ordered him to pay DATE - fines . It found that the fishing restrictions were not in breach of the applicant \u2019s right to use his property , given that ORG had been adopted in order to safeguard future fish stocks and the rights and culture of the local residents . It further ruled that any losses caused by the fishing restrictions could be compensated under LAW .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tt ) of PERSON , claiming that the restrictions on fishing based on residence violated his right to use his possessions and his freedom of movement and were furthermore discriminatory . He further alleged that the compensation provided by LAW was meaningless as the compensation proceedings had already begun on DATE but were still pending .", "On DATE ORG issued its judgment , rejecting the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that the provisions of ORG and LAW were not in obvious conflict with LAW ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the LAW , and therefore found that they were applicable . It concluded that the impugned provisions of LAW and ORG did not violate the applicant \u2019s right to use his possessions , nor his freedom of movement .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) for leave to appeal , complaining , inter alia , that the domestic courts had not taken into account the requirements of section CARDINAL of the LAW , namely the direct applicability of fundamental rights . He further claimed that LAW and ORG had entered into force in GPE before the ORG and thus the said provisions should not have been applied , as they were contrary to Convention rights .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "According to LAW of DATE ( NORP hallitusmuoto , NORP f\u00f6r GPE ; Act no . CARDINAL ) as amended by Act no . CARDINAL , which entered into force on DATE , everyone was to be equal before the law and his or her property was to be protected ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . A judge or other officer was under an obligation not to apply a provision in a decree which conflicted with constitutional or other Acts of ORG ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . The LAW has been incorporated into NORP law by an ORG with the status of ordinary law ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "LAW ( \u201c Basic rights and liberties \u201d ) of LAW has been incorporated as such into LAW ( Suomen perustuslaki , GPE grundlag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , in force as of DATE . Equality and property rights are guaranteed under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Under the current LAW a court of law must give precedence to a provision therein if the application of a provision of ordinary law was in obvious conflict with LAW ( section CARDINAL ) . If a provision in a decree or any other statute of lower rank than an Act of ORG is in conflict with the LAW or ordinary law , that provision shall not be applied by a court of law or any other public authority ( section CARDINAL ) .", "According to LAW its aim is to protect and maintain fish stocks in LOC . Under LAW anyone who intends to fish on the parts of the Teno , ORG and LOC constituting part of the border between GPE and GPE shall pay a fishing licence before fishing . Persons who live permanently in the river valley shall pay MONEY ( ORG ) per calendar DATE . This also applies to persons who have inherited their fishing rights directly from a person who resided permanently in the LOC valley . Those who do not have a residence in the river valley shall pay ORG DATE for a fishing licence , depending on the area .", "Section CARDINAL prescribes that local residents are also in a privileged position compared to others with respect to the methods they are allowed to use for fishing : they are entitled to use , subject to the restrictions laid down in the Regulation , barriers with bag nets , barriers with baskets , stationary nets , surrounding nets , seines , and rods and lures for catching salmon . Other persons may fish only with rods and lures , with the exception of those who have inherited the fishing rights . Such persons are , irrespective of their permanent place of residence , entitled to use barriers with bag nets , barriers with baskets , surrounding nets , stationary nets and seines .", "ORG further prescribes that only boats owned by local residents may be used for fishing ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
