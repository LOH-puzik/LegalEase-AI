I really hope that my letter can influence the course of events .", "My son , Mr PERSON , [ who ] had successfully and independently entered ORG of [ the ORG ] , was expelled from it ... I could not even imagine that the methods described below were applied in a ORG educational institution ...", "... My son missed the beginning of studies because of a severe infectious disease ... Subsequently , I was called [ to LAW ] and during a private conversation [ S. ] told me that [ students ] like my son could not study at her faculty under the normal conditions , and that if I did not want to have problems with [ graduation ] I had to agree to additional financial conditions , in particular , to pay her CARDINAL [ United States dollars ] for every exam , and CARDINAL [ United States dollars ] for every test ... After my unconditional refusal , my road of sorrows began ...", "CARDINAL or CARDINAL times a week I was called to the office of the PERSON [ of ORG ] for numerous [ discussions of problems ] , CARDINAL of the first of which concerned the checking of [ my son 's ] medical documents ... the [ professors ] shouted at me , called me a swindler and so on ...", "Because he had been on sick leave ... and because of the enduring tense discussions with the PERSON and the Deputy PERSON ... my son did not have normal conditions in which to study ...

( a copy is enclosed ) ... [ T]he President ordered that my son be allowed additional time to take DATE exams ... [ H]owever , afterwards arbitrariness on a larger scale began : professors were simply receiving from [ S. ] and [ the Deputy PERSON ... categorical instructions not to allow my son to take exams ... Those instructions were rigorously complied with , as the staff of the ORG was hired on the basis of personal loyalty towards the management or dependency on the management [ of the ORG ] : numerous relatives ... close friends ... former students [ of the ORG ] ... about whose knowledge , competence and work experience it is not possible to speak . It is difficult for them to find another job , therefore they are ready to fulfil any assignments , obey any wishes of the management ...", "... [ S. ] and [ B. ] became so impudent that together they conducted negotiations with me concerning extra - contractual payments [ for my son 's studies ] at the office of [ S. ] . In a normal civilised country [ people ] would have already compared the earnings of the ORG servants and their standard of living .
