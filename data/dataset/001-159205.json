ORG The applicant has been serving a prison sentence in ORG since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he brought a civil compensation claim before ORG . He claimed that the conditions of detention in many of his cells in FAC were so bad as to amount to a breach of NORP CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . He referred to the fact that the cells were not properly heated in the DATE and DATE and had no proper ventilation in DATE , meaning that the prisoners suffered from intense levels of heat . The windows were old and the frames leaked . He further submitted that the toilet facilities were only separated from the cells by a low fibreboard partition , which made even a minimum level of privacy impossible for him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused a request by the applicant to gather evidence by producing photographs and carrying out an on - the - spot inspection of the cells concerned . It closed the hearing and gave judgment , dismissing the applicant \u2019s claim in its entirety .", "The court established , referring to evidence submitted by ORG , acting as the legal representative for ORG , that prisoners had access to sports , cultural and educational activities and medical care . They were provided with personal hygiene items and had appropriate food . Those factors , seen as a whole , alleviated the harm which was an inherent part and consequence of serving prison sentences .", "The court further found that the toilet facilities in the applicant \u2019s cells were indeed separated off by fibreboard partitions . This did not provide full privacy , but was sufficient to ensure that the prisoners were out of sight of others when they used the toilet . There was a WC and a washbasin in each toilet facility .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s allegations of inadequate ventilation and insufficient heating in the cells , the court found that the cells were well lit and properly ventilated ; the windows had been repaired and the heaters had been changed and worked properly . As regards the alleged lack of light , the court found that the applicant had been granted special permission to use an additional reading lamp .", "The court was of the view that ORG had not acted unlawfully and that there had been no intention to act in bad faith or to cause harm or damage to the applicant . In the absence of unlawfulness no breach of personal rights could be found . In any event , the conditions in FAC were not so harsh as to amount to a breach of personal rights .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the court had failed to establish the facts of the case correctly , in the main because it had refused to gather evidence in the form of photographs , film or an inspection of the cells . The judgment had therefore been based on insufficient factual findings . Furthermore , in so far as the court had referred to the general conditions in which the applicant served his sentence ( quality of the food , medical care , access to cultural and sports activities ) , those factors had not constituted the basis of his claim . He had complained neither about poor food quality nor about insufficient access to cultural and sports activities . The grounds of his claim had fundamentally related to the sanitary conditions in the cells and , in particular , a lack of privacy when using the toilet . This lack of privacy had been explicitly confirmed by the first - instance court . He reiterated that the lack of a proper divide between the toilets and the cell amounted to a breach of his personal rights and dignity . He further indicated that some of the cells at the prison had toilet facilities that were properly separated from the rest of the cell by normal walls and a door .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal , fully accepting the findings of fact made by the firstinstance court and that court \u2019s legal assessment of those facts . In particular , ORG was of the view that the nuisance caused by the manner in which cells were fitted with toilet facilities , namely by way of fibreboard partitions , did not exceed the normal difficulties and harm which were inherent in serving a prison sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
