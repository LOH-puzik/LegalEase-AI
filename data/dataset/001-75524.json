He was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE .", "The applicant is the father of the child PERSON , born on DATE . The parents separated in DATE . Following police intervention , the applicant \u2019s wife and son found shelter in a women \u2019s refuge , were they stayed until DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( Amtsgericht ) temporarily transferred parental custody to the child \u2019s mother . The applicant \u2019s appeals remained unsuccessful .", "Since DATE the child attended kindergarten in PERSON .", "Throughout the proceedings , the child remained with his mother ; until DATE the applicant had regular access to him .", "In DATE , following a visit during the GPE holidays , the applicant returned DATE than agreed upon .", "On DATE , following a weekend visit , the applicant refused to return PERSON to his mother . He took the child out of PERSON kindergarten and registered him at a kindergarten in GPE . On DATE , upon the mother \u2019s request , ORG ordered that the child be returned to his mother .", "As difficulties arose when the applicant had to return the child following a visit on DATE , which necessitated intervention by a ORG officer , the applicant , allegedly upon ORG advice , temporarily suspended the visits .", "On DATE the applicant attempted to visit his son . A conflict arose between the parents which culminated in police intervention .", "On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , filed a petition for divorce with ORG , acting in the capacity of a family court .

He found that both parents were in principle able and willing to raise PERSON The mother , however , had not been able to build up an unburdened relationship with her son . Her personality was characterised by introversion , emotional instability and inhibition , by a low capacity to build and stabilise human relationships and by low emphatic capacities ( geringe emotionale ORG . The applicant , on the other hand , had a more stable personality and was considerably better apt to treat PERSON with empathy and loving understanding . The expert further found that the applicant did not show any remarkable signs of aggressiveness . It followed that the applicant was better able to raise the child and to serve him as a role model . The expert concluded that both parents should be granted joint custody , that the child should live with the applicant and that the mother should be granted regular visiting rights .", "On DATE the parents concluded a friendly settlement according to which the applicant was granted visiting rights DATE from TIME .", "As difficulties arose when the applicant had to return the child following the next visit on DATE , the applicant , allegedly upon ORG advice , temporarily suspended the visits .", "On DATE ORG , in the divorce proceedings , ordered the preparation of a fresh expert opinion as to the distribution of parental authority and access rights by the psychological expert PERSON", "On DATE PERSON submitted her expert report . Having on several occasions heard and examined both parents and the child , the expert noted that the implementation of the applicant \u2019s access rights had failed because the applicant insisted on exercising these rights according to his own discretion , without accepting any rules . In this respect , the expert noted that the applicant wanted to fetch the boy at different times than agreed upon , that he refused to return him after visits and that he took him out of kindergarten and registered him in another one at his home place , without having parental authority . He further tried to discredit his wife . According to the expert , the applicant had been unable to realise that his behaviour was damaging his good relationship with his son . There was no indication that the mother influenced the child against him ; on the contrary , the fact that the child still expressed the wish to see his father indicated that such influence had not taken place .", "The expert further noted that the mother was perfectly able to raise the child and that she tried to keep him as much as possible out of his GPE post - marital conflicts . She had demonstrated her ability to deal with everyday conflicts . The applicant \u2019s reproaches against her , which had culminated in the filing of criminal information , were unfounded . According to psychological tests and the mother \u2019s reports , PERSON did not show any psychological abnormalities . This too indicated that the mother was able to educate and encourage him in accordance with his age and his individual needs .", "In so far as the mother was suspicious as to whether the applicant would abide by the agreements on visiting rights , this was justified by her previous experiences . The expert further found that the applicant had shown a high degree of aggressiveness . In so far as the expert PERSON had concluded that the applicant did not show any aggressive behaviour , his assessment had been based on psychological tests which had not been suitable for the purpose at hand . Finally , the expert expressed her doubts as to whether the applicant would be able to adequately deal with DATE problems in case the child \u2019s needs were opposed to his own interests .", "The expert concluded that the child PERSON loved and needed both parents . However , having regard to the persisting conflicts between the parents and the fact that the applicant did not accept the mother as his equal , the granting of joint custody would be contrary to the child \u2019s best interests . She recommended that sole parental authority should be transferred to the mother . With regard to access rights , the expert noted that it would be in the child \u2019s interest to have regular contacts with his father . However , both PERSON and his mother would have to be assured that the applicant abided by the rules set up for such contacts . As long as the applicant insisted that the child should live with him , as long as he degraded the mother and as long as he did not change his behaviour with a view to a more constructive strategy aimed at solving conflicts , such visits would have to be supervised .", "On DATE ORG , having heard both parents , the child and the experts PERSON and PERSON , issued the divorce decree , transferred sole parental authority to the child \u2019s mother and temporarily suspended the applicant \u2019s access rights . ORG noted , firstly , that neither of the parents was willing to accept joint parental authority . Having regard to the development of the GPE conflicts , which had not diminished in spite of the long period of separation , it would be contrary to the child \u2019s best interests to award joint custody . This had not been contrary to the finding of the first expert PERSON , who had favoured joint custody . In this respect , ORG noted that PERSON \u2019s expert opinion had been DATE and that PERSON himself , in a supplementary statement dated DATE , had declared that joint custody had to be excluded with a view to the subsequent developments . Furthermore , the expert had expressly declared that his expert opinion was \u201c outdated \u201d and that changed circumstances warranted a fresh examination .", "ORG found that it was in the child \u2019s best interest to transfer parental authority to the mother . The applicant was not able to properly raise the child . Following the expert PERSON opinion , that court found that the applicant was not able to adequately deal with DATE problems in case the child \u2019s needs were opposed to the applicant \u2019s own interests . Furthermore , the child \u2019s well - being was jeopardised by the applicant \u2019s aggressive impulses and by the fact that the applicant did not accept the child \u2019s mother as his equal , but tried to debase her .", "The child \u2019s mother , on the other hand , had proved that she was able to raise the child and that she had developed strategies to solve conflicts of DATE life . As established by the expert , she had succeeded in keeping PERSON out of his GPE conflicts and to preserve the positive image he had of his father . Insofar as PERSON appeared to be shy and aggrieved when heard by the court , this had to be explained by the fact that the child was torn into the conflict between his parents and that he had to take sides between CARDINAL persons whom he both loved . There was no indication that the child had been negatively influenced against his father , otherwise he would not have declared that he wished to have contact with him . This finding was not contrary to the conclusions drawn by expert PERSON , as the latter had conceded that his report had to be updated as the GPE personal circumstances had changed in the meantime . ORG could not follow the expert PERSON \u2019s finding that the applicant did no show any signs of aggressive behaviour . In this respect , it pointed out that in DATE , the lease of the applicant \u2019s flat had been terminated on the ground that the applicant had attacked the lessor \u2019s wife . In separate proceedings , the director of the women \u2019s refuge where PERSON \u2019s mother temporarily found shelter had given testimony on the applicant \u2019s aggressive behaviour . ORG noted that these findings were in line with the finding of the expert PERSON , who attested the applicant violent impulses .", "ORG further decided to temporarily suspend the applicant \u2019s access rights pursuant to section DATE of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch , see relevant domestic law below ) . It acknowledged that the child had a strong relationship to his father and that it would be desirable to grant regular contacts . This , however , was not possible at the present time . In this respect ORG noted , firstly , that the applicant \u2019s contacts with his child led to serious conflicts which necessitated police intervention . Referring to the expert PERSON \u2019s finding , ORG found that access rights could only be granted if the child could be assured that the applicant abided by the rules . As long as the applicant insisted on taking PERSON with him to GPE and did not accept any differing decisions DATE including court orders \u2013 such visits would have to be supervised . Such supervision was presently not possible as the applicant was not willing to accept any person as a supervisor , who did not completely meet his own expectations and who did not act accordingly . ORG could not act as a supervisor in the present case due to serious tensions between the applicant and ORG . The applicant had lodged petitions for administrative and criminal review against ORG . Accordingly , the latter had refused to act as a supervisor in the applicant \u2019s case . Another possible supervisor , PERSON , was only willing to supervise visiting contacts if both parents agreed to this . During the court hearing , ORG had phoned PERSON in order to render visits possible . These endeavours failed , firstly , because the applicant was not willing to bear the costs entailed by supervision . Furthermore , the mother only agreed to commission PERSON in case the applicant accepted that the child remained with her until a final court decision . The applicant had not been willing to make such a declaration . That the mother \u2019s fears were not unfounded was demonstrated by the fact that the applicant had refused to return the child in DATE . There were no other persons available who could supervise visiting contacts . In any event , the problem would persist as the applicant was not willing to bear the necessary expenses .", "On DATE the ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decisions on parental authority and on the temporary exclusion of access rights . ORG followed ORG reasoning , according to which the serious tensions persisting between the parents excluded the possibility of joint custody . With regard to the transfer of parental custody to CARDINAL parent , ORG left the question undecided whether the applicant was sufficiently able to raise the child on a DATE basis , as the mother had proved to be . The transfer of custody to the mother was in accordance with the wishes the child had expressed when heard by the expert and by the court . The most decisive point was that the transfer of custody to the mother gave continuity to the child \u2019s present life and educational circumstances . A change of the child \u2019s present life circumstances which would be added to the psychological burden which had already been imposed on him by his GPE separation could only be justified if such change was compensated by considerable advantages for the child . Such advantages could not be found in the present case . Following the expert PERSON opinion , that court found that the child was well taken care of by his mother . It was not necessary to determine whether the finding of the expert PERSON had been scientifically correct , as they dated back to DATE and the decision had to be taken according to the current circumstances . The expert PERSON did not claim that his findings were still valid . He had , on the contrary , stated that PERSON recommendations may be correct for the time of her examination . The issue which parent was more ready to accept the child \u2019s relationship with the other parent ( ORG ) clearly pointed in favour of the mother . This was established by the expert PERSON findings as well as by the applicant \u2019s unfounded allegations during custody and access proceedings , who had reproached the mother of \u201c brainwashing \u201d and abusing the child . The fact that the child had looked forward to meet his father disproved the allegations that the mother had influenced the child against him .", "With respect to the decision on the temporary exclusion of access rights , ORG confirmed ORG finding that unattended visits could not be granted as long as the applicant did not respect the rules set up for such meetings . Supervised visits were currently not feasible as the applicant refused to cooperate . ORG noted that ORG could not supervise meetings , as the applicant did not accept ORG staff and that ORG had consequently refused to undertake that task . ORG further noted that ORG , in its hearing of CARDINAL DATE , had tried to arrange supervised visits . These endeavours had failed inter alia because the applicant had been unwilling to bear the necessary expenses , in spite of being legally obliged to do so . The applicant had not changed his attitude during second instance proceedings .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint and joint request for an interim order for adjudication .", "The relevant provisions of LAW ( ORG ) read as follows :", "Section DATE", "Living separately and joint parental authority", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If parents who share joint parental authority are separated more than temporarily , each parent can request the family court to be transferred either sole parental authority or part of the parental authority .", "( CARDINAL ) The request shall be granted if", "CARDINAL . the other parent consents , unless the child is DATE and is opposed to the transfer , or", "CARDINAL . if it is to be expected that the lifting of joint parental authority and its transfer to the applicant is best suited to serve the child \u2019s welfare", "... \u201d", "Section DATE", "Contacts between parent and child", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The child is entitled to have access to both parents ; each parent is obliged to have contact with , and is entitled to have access to the child .", "( CARDINAL ) The parents must not do anything that would harm the child \u2019s relationship with the other parent or interfere with the child \u2019s upbringing ...", "( CARDINAL ) The family courts can determine the scope of the right of access and can prescribe more specific rules for its exercise , also with regard to third parties . They may oblige the respective parties to fulfil their obligations under paragraph CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) The family court can restrict or suspend access rights or the execution of previous decisions on access if such a measure is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare . A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if otherwise the child \u2019s well - being would be endangered . The family courts may order that the right of access be exercised under the supervision of a third party .
