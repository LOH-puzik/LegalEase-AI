She said that her children had come to see her about a lawsuit between them concerning the non - payment of maintenance to which she was entitled because of her ill - health . While the applicant was in the front passenger seat of a motor car driven by her daughter , her son , who was in the back , had allegedly immobilised her and used a syringe to inject her twice with an unknown substance . She said she had quickly got out of the car and gone to hospital .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was found to have marks of injections .

During the investigation , the applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Saint - Pierre investigating judge ruled that there was no case to answer on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that anyone had committed the offence .

In her written observations to the court of appeal , the applicant requested , inter alia , that the investigating judge be made to stand down , that the investigation be resumed , that it be formally recorded that \u201c her complaint [ related to ] premeditated assault with an offensive weapon resulting in DATE total unfitness for work and , given the results of the tests on the syringe , with criminal intent \u201d , and that her children be \u201c brought to the d\u00e9partement by force in order to explain themselves \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

The primacy of a decision in a criminal case is not prescribed by law in the strict sense but derives from case - law .

As application of the rule is not mandatory on public policy grounds , this rule can not be relied on by the prosecution or by the judge of his own motion . Decisions by investigating judges are not binding on the civil courts . Accordingly , the only criminal decisions which are binding are the final and irrevocable decisions of the trial courts .
