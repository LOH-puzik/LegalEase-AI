She had made a will before a notary in DATE . Under the seventh clause of her will , she settled her estate on her son , ORG , as tenant for life . Should he be unable to inherit , the estate was to pass to his sister , GPE , and if she was also unable to inherit , it was to pass to PERSON son , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The testatrix indicated that ORG , the beneficiary and life tenant under her will , was to transfer the estate to a son or grandson of a lawful and canonical marriage . To that effect she had inserted the following clause in her will : \u201c The future heir to the estate must leave it to a son or grandson of a lawful and canonical marriage ... \u201d ( \u201c El qui arribi a \u00e9sser hereu haur\u00e0 for\u00e7osament de transmetre l\u2019her\u00e8ncia a un fill o net de leg\u00edtim i can\u00f2nic matrimoni ... ) \u201d .", "Should those conditions not be met , the testatrix had stipulated that the children and grandchildren of the remaindermen under the settlement would be entitled to her estate .", "CARDINAL . The beneficiary under the will , ORG , contracted canonical marriage to the second applicant , PERSON . By deed drawn up on QUANTITY DATE before a notary in GPE ( GPE ) , they adopted a child , PERSON , in accordance with the procedure for full adoption . They subsequently adopted a second child .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG made a will in which he left MONEY ( ORG ) to his son , PERSON ( the first applicant ) , and EUR CARDINAL to his daughter . He named his wife , PERSON ( the second applicant ) , sole heir to the remainder of his estate . In a codicil of DATE , ORG left the assets he had inherited under his mother \u2019s will to his wife for life and to his adopted son , PERSON , as remainderman . The assets in question consisted of real estate . On DATE ORG died . The codicil was opened on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the only potential heirs to the estate under the will are the applicants , PERSON and his mother , and CARDINAL sisters , GPE and NORP PERSON , who are the great - grandchildren of the testatrix .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Carolina and NORP PERSON brought proceedings in ORG to have the codicil of DATE declared null and void and seeking an order requiring the applicants , as defendants in the proceedings , to return to the plaintiffs all the assets of the estate of ORG PERSON , their great - grandmother , and to pay them damages for unlawful possession of the assets .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE , after hearing submissions from both sides , ORG of ORG dismissed the action for the following reasons :", "\u201c ...", "III . Both parties agree that it is the contents of the will that determine the testatrix \u2019s intention at the time of making it , so that the will has to be interpreted in accordance with that intention , which is to be inferred from the words used in the will ( Digest CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) . Since DATE it has been apparent from the case - law of the PERSON courts ( judgment of the Judge of Appeals dated DATE ) that \u2018 on both a partially intestate and a testate succession it is principally the testator \u2019s intention that must be taken into account , as can be inferred from many provisions of ORG and canon law ... \u2019", "IV . In her will dated DATE , the testatrix stipulated that ... \u2018 The future heir to the estate must leave it to a son or grandson of a lawful and canonical marriage ... \u2019 [ \u2018 NORP qui arribi a \u00e9sser hereu haur\u00e0 for\u00e7osament de transmetre l\u2019her\u00e8ncia a un fill o net de leg\u00edtim i can\u00f2nic matrimoni ... \u2019 ] .", "In doing so , the will in question set up a family settlement si sine liberis decesserit . An analysis of this type of settlement shows that the purpose is to secure and preserve the estate by keeping it in the settlor \u2019s family .", "PERSON In interpreting the contents of the will in question , account has to be taken , as has previously been stated , of the testatrix \u2019s intention in the light of the words used and the actual nature of the society in which she lived .", "When the will was made , the LAW had not been enacted and there was no ordinary statute or other relevant analogous provisions . Consequently , for the purposes of interpreting the wording in the will reference has to be made to customary law , the ius commune , deriving from the influence of NORP law as amended by canon law , and to the relevant case - law of the LOC courts ... Foreign legislation , case - law and legal theory can not apply in the present case .", "The Corpus Iuris provided for the institution of adoption and included in the word \u2018 child\u2019 , children born out of wedlock and adopted children ... by providing for CARDINAL forms of adoption : CARDINAL undertaken under the authority of a princep and the other before a judge . The procedure followed in the first case was to ask the adoptive parent if he sought to take the adopted child as his legitimate child and to ask the adopted child if he consented . It was also stipulated that \u2018 a consanguineous relationship is not instituted by deed but by birth or solemn adoption\u2019 ( NORP and PERSON , Codi DATE , DATE ) . Furthermore , \u2018 the father - child bond is not created by mere declarations or false assertions , even if both parties consent , but only by lawful marriage or solemn adoption\u2019 ( NORP and PERSON , Codi CARDINAL , DATE , DATE ) ...", "Consequently , according to the NORP concept of adoption , the adopted child leaves his family of origin and terminates all legal connection with it . On doing so he becomes the son of the adoptive parent \u2019s family and , as such , takes the family name and above all acquires inheritance rights . This institution has essentially been used for inheritance purposes . Subsequently , CARDINAL forms of adoption became available : full adoption and simple adoption [ menys plena ] , the sole purpose of the latter being to safeguard the adopted child \u2019s rights over the adoptive parent \u2019s estate . Full adoption is based on the idea that adoption must replace or imitate biological filiation .", "...", "VI . ... If account is taken of the fact that adoption is a legal institution whose purpose is to enable childless couples to have children ... At that time adoption therefore already satisfied a need , with the adopted child being regarded as a legitimate child . That approach was subsequently confirmed by LAW and by statute .", "It can not therefore be said that , by inserting that clause , the testatrix intended to prevent adopted or non - biological children from inheriting her estate . If that had been her intention , she would have made express provision for it .", "Accordingly , the codicil made by the late heir , ORG , is compatible with the deceased ORG PERSON \u2019s will and can not be declared null ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The PERSON sisters appealed to ORG of GPE . In a judgment delivered on DATE , after hearing submissions from both sides , ORG set the lower court \u2019s judgment aside . It allowed the appeal , set aside the codicil of DATE , declared that the appellants were the legitimate heirs to their great - grandmother \u2019s estate and ordered the applicants to return the property in question . The grounds for the court \u2019s judgment were as follows :", "\u201c II . ... Accordingly , the fundamental question to be resolved in the instant case is whether a child who has been adopted in accordance with the procedure for full adoption can be regarded as a child of a lawful and canonical marriage , as required by the testatrix ...", "III . This question has to be resolved in accordance with the legal rules on the relationship of adopted children to their adoptive parents that were in force in DATE and DATE , that is , between the time when PERSON i PERSON made her will and the date of her death . A will becomes a legal deed from the date on which it is made in accordance with the statutory formalities . Accordingly , in interpreting the testamentary dispositions , regard must be had in the instant case to the legal position of adopted children in the social and family conditions existing in DATE when the will was made and possibly in DATE when the testatrix died ...", "Legal commentators with first - hand experience of Andorran life stress that adoption is practically unheard of in GPE ( PERSON : \u2018 PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . That assertion is borne out by all the LOC case - law reports , in which there is no reference to adoption . This silence on the subject is perfectly understandable , moreover , given that the provisions of NORP law on adoption could not easily be transposed to LOC families living in DATE for the following reasons : since DATE it could be regarded as an institution that had become obsolete and , to a certain extent , unnecessary given that the main purpose \u2013 to appoint a successor or heir \u2013 had been achieved in ORG through the institution of heretament ( agreement , specific to NORP law , on the succession of a living person ) , introduced by customary law . In that social and family context , it is difficult to sustain the proposition that , in setting up a family settlement in case her heir should die without leaving offspring of a lawful and canonical marriage , the testatrix was also referring to adopted children , given that , at the time , adoption was not an established institution in the Principality of Andorra .", "The fact that in the instant case the adoptive parents were married to each other does not make their adopted child a legitimate child or a child born of the marriage . The distinction according to whether a child was born in or out of wedlock is relevant only to illegitimate children ... with regard to adopted children , the distinction according to whether a child was born in or out of wedlock does not apply . Accordingly , a child adopted by a couple is an adopted child and not a legitimate child or a child of the marriage .", "Furthermore , the notarially recorded deed of adoption was drawn up in GPE in accordance with the NORP procedure for full adoption ... The Law of DATE , amending LAW , is applicable to the conditions and general effects of full adoption . Under that PERSON , the act of adopting a child gave him or her the status of the adoptive father / mother \u2019s child , but did not give the child family status with regard to the adoptive PERSON family . Under LAW , adoption created a filial tie between the adoptive parent , the adopted child and his or her legitimate descendants , but not with the adoptive parent \u2019s family . Moreover , the inheritance rights were also limited in the present case : the deed of adoption referred to the relevant DATE NORP legislation , that is , a compilation of DATE NORP civil law . Article CARDINAL provided that on an intestate succession adopted children were entitled to inherit only from their adoptive father or mother and not from the rest of their adoptive GPE family . That rule reflected the idea that adoption created only a filial status and not a family status .", "IV . Accordingly , from a legal standpoint , the adopted children of persons on whom an estate was settled by their father or mother were unconnected with the family circle with regard to the beneficiary \u2019s ascendants . That approach can largely be explained by the minimal impact of adoption on the social and family consciousness in GPE , both at the time when the will was made and when the testatrix died . The testatrix \u2019s presumed intention has to be established in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of her death . The adopted children of her legitimate son or of the marriage were unconnected with the family circle both from a legal and a sociological point of view .", "The purpose of a family settlement si sine liberis decesserit under NORP law is to keep the family estate in the legitimate or married family and NORP legal tradition has always favoured the exclusion of adopted children from such family settlements ... Thus , in order for adopted children to inherit under this type of settlement , there must be no doubt as to the testatrix \u2019s intention to depart from the usual nature of this institution . In the instant case , the expression \u2018 offspring of a lawful and canonical GPE , which appears in DATE will , does not suffice to infer that the testatrix intended to depart from the usual meaning given to family settlements si sine liberis decesserit under the NORP and PERSON law of succession .", "PERSON It is apparent from the foregoing that , although the law in force when the child was actually adopted allowed adopted children to inherit from their adoptive parents on an intestate succession ( code CARDINAL , DATE , DATE ) , those rights can not extend to a testate succession , where the main factor is the testator \u2019s intention . Accordingly , any doubt as to the scope of the expression \u2018 offspring of a lawful and canonical GPE falls away when the testatrix \u2019s intention is analysed in the light of the social , family and legal conditions in which she lived . In the present case , nothing militates in favour of including the life tenant \u2019s adopted children , given the minimal impact of adoption on PERSON family and inheritance law , the adopted child \u2019s status as the adoptive GPE child ( son ) but not as a member of the GPE family , the purpose traditionally ascribed to family settlements under NORP law , and NORP and PERSON legal tradition . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an application with ORG to have the proceedings set aside . They submitted that the latter had breached the principle of equality before the law enshrined in LAW and that they had breached LAW ( right to judicial protection and to a fair trial ) of LAW . In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed their application as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an empara appeal with ORG against the decisions of ORG . They alleged a violation of LAW ( principle of children \u2019s equality before the law regardless of filiation ) and LAW ( right to judicial protection and a fair trial ) of LAW . In a decision of DATE , ORG declared their appeal inadmissible for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... It seems clear that the judgment of ORG is limited to clarifying and determining , that is , interpreting , a specific point concerning the testatrix \u2019s intention , as expressed in her will in the form of a family settlement in favour of a child or grandson of a lawful and canonical marriage .", "ORG does not at any point suggest that there is general discrimination against , or inequality between , children according to whether they are biological or adopted . Such an assertion would evidently amount to a flagrant breach of LAW and would also be contrary to the prevailing legal opinion according to which legal systems must always be interpreted , which is that all children are equal , irrespective of their origin . However , as submitted in substance by ORG , \u2018 discrimination against adopted children as compared to biological children does not in the instant case derive from an act of the public authorities , that is , from the judgment of ORG of ORG , but from the intention of the testatrix or settlor regarding who should inherit under her ORG in accordance with the principle of freedom to make testamentary dispositions , which is a concrete manifestation of the general principle of civil liberty .", "In its judgment , ORG confined itself to interpreting a testamentary disposition . It did so from the legal standpoint it considered adequate and in accordance with its unfettered discretion , seeing that the interpretation of legal instruments is a question of fact which , as such , falls under the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
