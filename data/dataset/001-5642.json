He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , of ORG .", "summarised as follows .", "DATE the applicant was a judge in the former GPE ( GPE ) and , in particular , President of ORG ( Vorsitzender des Strafsenats des Bezirksgerichts ) of GPE from DATE .", "In a decision of DATE ORG of the former GPE allowed him to be admitted as a member of the Bar from CARDINAL DATE .", "In a decision of DATE ORG disbarred him under section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act on the verification of admissions as a member of the Bar and appointments as a notary or a lay judge ( Gesetz zur Pr\u00fcfung von Rechtsanwaltszulassungen , ORG and ORG ehrenamtlicher Richter \u2014 \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2014 see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) on the ground that he had violated the principles of humanity and the rule of law ( da er gegen Grunds\u00e4tze der PERSON hat ) .", "ORG accused him , in particular , of having in QUANTITY cases sentenced to DATE imprisonment persons accused of having merely expressed the wish to leave the former GPE to institutions and organisations of the ORG ( GPE ) , such as the ORG \u2019s ORG , ORG and a NORP second channel ( ZDF ) television programme .", "ORG also accused him of having imposed a sentence of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for aiding illegal border - crossing ( PERSON ) and CARDINAL of DATE and DATE for incitement to subversion ( staatsfeindliche PERSON ) .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) acquitted the applicant of the charge of administering justice perversely ( PERSON ) .", "In a decision of DATE ORG Special Section for Matters relating to Lawyers ( ORG ) upheld the applicant \u2019s disbarment .", "In a decision of DATE ORG Special Section for Matters relating to Lawyers ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG ) dismissed an appeal by the applicant .", "In the opinion of ORG , there was a serious violation ( beachtlicher ORG ) of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW mentioned above where a lawyer , in his previous duties as a judge , had adopted an extreme construction ( bei exzessiver Auslegung und Interpretation ) of the relevant provisions of the former GPE \u2019s criminal code or the code of criminal procedure to the disadvantage of an accused or had started a prosecution showing contempt for human beings ( menschenverachtende GPE ) even though in the eyes of the law his conduct had not been so culpable as to constitute perverse administration of justice ( GPE ) .", "ORG held that in the present case the applicant , while in the high - ranking position of president of a criminal division , had for DATE voluntarily taken part in decisions , which , at least as a whole ( in der Gesamtschau ) , had shown contempt for human beings and had been contrary to justice . The applicant had applied laws which had been contrary to the rule of law , to the former GPE \u2019s LAW and to the international conventions to which the former GPE had been a party . In all cases , hearings had been held in camera in a kind of secret trial and heavy prison sentences had been imposed on citizens who merely wished to leave the former GPE , which often meant the destruction of their personal and social lives .", "In the opinion of ORG , those criticisms were still valid because the applicant had flagrantly violated human rights by taking part in politically - motivated criminal justice ( politische NORP ) for DATE , thus assisting the apparatus of ORG repression . Failure to penalise that would have met with the incomprehension , not only of the victims but also of the population in general and would have undermined the confidence of the public , especially people from the former GPE ( for whom politically - motivated criminal justice still remained a painful memory ) , in the integrity of the legal profession . ORG held that even though the applicant had practised the profession of lawyer for DATE without fault , that had been too short a period to allow the applicant \u2019s interest in practising his profession to override the public interest in confidence in the integrity of the legal profession .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL members , declined to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal for adjudication .", "In the opinion of ORG the appeal was not of fundamental constitutional importance , since it had already decided the issue of the constitutionality of LAW on the verification of admissions as a member of the Bar and appointments as a notary or a lay judge . The disbarment of lawyers who , because of their participation in acts manifestly contrary to justice committed under the regime of ORG ( PERSON an eklatanten ORG ) , were not worthy of confidence and were a burden for the administration of justice , was in accordance with LAW ) .", "ORG added that both the interpretation of that section by ORG \u2014 which had looked beyond the simple fact of the former judge \u2019s involvement in politically - motivated criminal justice ( GPE politischem ORG ) in that it had also examined the actual application of the law and had held that for the offence to be made out the judge must have adopted an extreme construction and application of the relevant provisions at the material time , to the detriment of the accused \u2014 and its application of the section in the present case had also been in accordance with LAW .", "As to the applicant \u2019s submissions that the courts had not sufficiently taken into account the conditions under which the former - GPE \u2019s court system had been functioning and that it had been impossible for him to act differently at the time , ORG held that the applicant should have raised and supported those arguments in the ordinary courts , which he had failed to do . In that connection , he should , in particular , have pleaded in the relevant courts the actual circumstances which had led him to take part in politically - motivated trials , and explained whether and under what conditions he could have withdrawn and what would have been the consequences for him had he departed from the habitual practice in criminal cases and had acted in favour of the accused .", "B.
