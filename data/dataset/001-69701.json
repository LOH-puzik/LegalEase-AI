SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a NORP limited liability company , which was dissolved on DATE . It was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the shares of the applicant company , which was then called ORG , were sold by ORG , its executive director , to another person , ORG The company changed its name in DATE and S.S. was registered as its director in the official company register in DATE . The applicant company was therefore represented by ORG during the main part of the domestic proceedings in the present case .", "Following a tax audit of the applicant company , ORG ( skattemyndigheten ) of GPE , by a decision of DATE , revised upwards its taxable income for DATE by MONEY ( SEK ) and ordered it to pay a tax surcharge ( skattetill\u00e4gg ) amounting to PERCENT of the increased tax liability . By another decision of the same date ORG also revised upwards PERSON 's taxable income , and ordered him to pay a tax surcharge . The whole of the amounts were payable on DATE .", "On DATE both the applicant company and ORG appealed against ORG decisions . They also requested that the execution of the amounts assessed be stayed .", "By decisions of DATE and , upon reconsideration , CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the requests for stays of execution , stating that the prerequisites laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW ( Uppb\u00f6rdslagen , DATE ) had not been fulfilled . The matter was then automatically referred to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE for determination .", "On DATE and DATE ORG reconsidered its decisions on taxes and tax surcharges but decided not to change them . In the latter reconsideration decision , it was stated that the taxation matter was forwarded to ORG , to which further submissions should be made .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant company and GPE requested ORG to decide before the taxes and surcharges became due on DATE on an interim stay of execution until that issue had been finally examined or to grant a stay pending the final examination of the tax cases . They maintained , inter alia , that , under LAW , they had a right to a court determination of their tax liability before the amounts assessed by ORG were enforced , especially since such enforcement could lead to their being declared bankrupt . They also asked the court to hold an oral hearing on the stay - of - execution issue .", "By judgments of DATE ORG quashed ORG decisions regarding the requested stay of execution and referred the cases back to the ORG . Having found that the formal prerequisites for granting a stay under LAW , subsections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( in respect of GPE ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( in respect of the applicant company ) of LAW had been fulfilled , the court noted that the granting of a stay of execution under these provisions was conditional on security being provided if it could be assumed that the amounts for which a stay had been sought would not be duly paid . As ORG had not ruled on the question whether security was required , the cases had to be referred back for such an examination . The court further found that , in view of this outcome , an oral hearing was unnecessary .", "On DATE ORG granted ORG stay of execution pending ORG examination of the appeal against the decision of DATE regarding his taxation . However , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the applicant company 's corresponding request . It found that the company 's ability to pay was open to doubt , that a stay of execution could not therefore be granted unless security was provided and that , although given the opportunity to do so , the company had failed to provide security .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant company asked that the stay - of - execuation issue be examined in its entirety . ORG interpreted this as a new request for a stay and rejected it on DATE and , upon reconsideration , on DATE , as the company still had not provided security . Noting that ORG , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , had determined that the formal prerequisites for granting a stay had been fulfilled , ORG found no reason to examine this question .", "On DATE the applicant company again appealed to ORG . It reiterated its request for either an interim stay of execution or a final stay pending the outcome of the tax assessment proceedings . In pointing out the potential damage that could be caused to the company , it noted that nothing prevented ORG ( kronofogdemyndigheten ) from filing a petition for the company 's bankruptcy . Stating that it intended to request an oral hearing in the tax assessment proceedings at which it would invoke oral evidence , the company also repeated that it wished the court to hold a hearing on the stay - of - execution issue .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the request for an interim stay of execution , finding that it had no legal basis .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and again referred the case back to the ORG . The court stated that the applicant company , in its new application for a stay of execution , had requested that the issue be examined in its entirety and noted that ORG had not made a new examination of whether any of the prerequisites for granting a stay were at hand . ORG should therefore rule on this question as well as on the question of security . In view of this outcome , the court did not find it necessary to hold an oral hearing .", "By a decision of DATE ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE found no reason to examine the applicant company 's appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE as the latter court had later taken a final decision on the stay - of - execution issue . The appeal was thus dismissed . On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused leave to appeal against the appellate court 's decision .", "On DATE ORG , representing the ORG , filed a petition with ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , requesting that the applicant company be declared bankrupt . According to a statement submitted by the ORG , the company was registered as being in arrears with taxes and surcharges amounting to a total of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The ORG noted that an investigation had revealed that the value of the company 's assets was insufficient to cover the debt . In fact , it had no known assets .", "On DATE ORG attempted to serve the bankruptcy petition and a summons for a hearing on DATE under the ordinary procedure for serving documents set out in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the Act on the Service of Documents ( PERSON ; GPE ) , by sending CARDINAL letters , CARDINAL to the applicant company 's registered address and CARDINAL to the registered address of FAC , its director . The letters contained a so - called \u201c white card \u201d to be signed and returned to the court within a specified time - limit . When that notice of delivery was not returned , ORG proceeded to employ a special procedure for serving the documents ( s\u00e4rskild delgivning med aktiebolag ) , set out in DATE , subsection CARDINAL of the LAW . Thus , on DATE it sent the documents by mail to the applicant company 's registered address and on DATE it sent a letter to the same address confirming the earlier dispatch .", "ORG held its hearing on DATE . No representative of the applicant company was present . Noting that the company had been notified of ORG bankruptcy petition and summoned to the hearing on DATE after the dispatch of the second letter sent in accordance with the special procedure \u2013 , ORG proceeded with the hearing . On the merits , ORG found that it had been shown that the ORG had a claim against the applicant company and that the company must be considered insolvent as it did not have sufficient assets to cover the full debt . Thus , the company was declared bankrupt .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG , without having held an oral hearing , upheld ORG reconsideration decision of CARDINAL DATE concerning the underlying tax issues . It thus agreed with the ORG 's assessments in regard to the applicant company 's taxable income and the imposition of a tax surcharge . By another judgment of the same date the court also upheld ORG decision on the taxation of GPE", "By a letter of DATE the applicant company appealed against ORG bankruptcy decision to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) . It claimed , inter alia , that ORG , its present director , had been abroad for some time and had not been given an opportunity to reply to the bankruptcy petition . ORG had therefore made a gross procedural error , for which reason the case should be referred back to that court .", "On DATE ORG found that the applicant company had been notified of the bankruptcy petition and summoned to ORG hearing in due order and that there was thus no reason to refer the case back to ORG . Further noting that the company had not shown that it was not insolvent , the appellate court upheld the declaration of bankruptcy . On DATE ORG ( ORG domstolen ) refused leave to appeal against the appellate court 's decision . The bankruptcy proceedings were terminated on DATE owing to a lack of assets .", "On DATE the applicant company and ORG lodged appeals against ORG taxation judgments . They completed their appeals on DATE . They asked ORG to stay the execution of the taxes and tax surcharges involved pending the final determination of the tax issues . In the first place , they requested that the judgments be quashed and the tax case be referred back to ORG as that court had committed a grave procedural error by neither holding an oral hearing nor giving the company and GPE the opportunity to make final submissions in the case . In the alternative , they asked the appellate court to give judgments in their favour .", "On DATE ORG , in the stay - of - execution case referred back to it by ORG on DATE , informed the applicant company that it had found that the prerequisites for a stay were at hand but that , due to the company 's economic situation as shown by the fact that it had been declared bankrupt , a stay required that security be provided . The company was therefore invited to provide security . The company having failed to do so , ORG , on CARDINAL DATE , refused to grant a stay . Already having been declared bankrupt , the company found that a stay of execution was no longer useful and thus did not appeal against ORG decision .", "By decisions of DATE ORG found , in response to the letter of DATE , that it could not rule on the question of a stay of execution as no decision on this matter had been brought before that court . It stated , however , that the matter was pending before ORG . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal against the appellate court 's decisions .", "By judgments of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant company 's and ORG 's appeals against ORG taxation judgments . The appellate court found that their requests for an oral hearing at first instance had to be considered as having been made only in relation to the stay - of - execution issue . Consequently , neither the lack of an oral hearing on the tax issues nor any other part of the written procedure at first instance gave reason for the cases to be referred back . In regard to the substantive tax issues , the appellate court agreed with the assessments made by ORG .", "By letters of DATE the applicant company and LOC appealed against the appellate court 's taxation judgments to ORG . While , on DATE , the court granted ORG leave to appeal , it refused the applicant company leave to appeal by a decision of DATE .", "The rules on taxes and tax surcharges relevant to the present case were primarily laid down in LAW ( Taxeringslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "Income tax is determined by county tax authorities , to which taxpayers are obliged to submit information relevant to the assessment of taxes . For the purpose of securing timely , sufficient and correct information , there are provisions stipulating that , under certain circumstances , the tax authorities may impose penalties on the taxpayer in the form of tax surcharges .", "A tax surcharge is imposed on a taxpayer in CARDINAL situations : if he or she , in a tax return or in any other written statement , has submitted information of relevance to the tax assessment which is found to be incorrect ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ) or if , following a discretionary assessment , the tax authority decides not to rely on the tax return ( chapter CARDINAL , LAW ) . It is not only express statements that may lead to the imposition of a surcharge ; concealment , in whole or in part , of relevant facts may also be regarded as incorrect information . However , incorrect claims are not penalised ; if the taxpayer has given a clear account of the factual circumstances but has made an incorrect evaluation of the legal consequences thereof , no surcharge is imposed . The burden of proving that the information is incorrect lies with the tax authority . A discretionary tax assessment is made if the taxpayer has submitted information which is so inadequate that the tax authority can not base its tax assessment on it or if he or she has not filed a tax return despite having been reminded of the obligation to do so ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . In the latter case the decision to impose a tax surcharge will be revoked if the taxpayer files a tax return within a certain time - limit . The surcharge amounts to PERCENT of either the income tax which ORG would have failed to levy if it had accepted the incorrect information or the income tax levied under the discretionary assessment . In certain circumstances , the rate applied is PERCENT .", "Notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer has furnished incorrect information , no tax surcharge will be imposed in certain situations , for example when the tax authority has corrected obvious miscalculations or written errors by the taxpayer , when the information has been corrected or could have been corrected with the aid of certain documents that should have been available to the tax authorities , such as a certificate of income from the employer , or when the taxpayer has corrected the information voluntarily ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "Moreover , in certain circumstances , a tax surcharge will be remitted . Thus , taxpayers will not have to pay a surcharge if their failure to submit correct information or to file a tax return is considered excusable owing to their age , illness , lack of experience or comparable circumstances . The surcharge should also be remitted when the failure appears excusable by reason of the nature of the information in question or other special circumstances , or when it would be manifestly unreasonable to impose a surcharge ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "If dissatisfied with a decision concerning taxes and tax surcharges , the taxpayer may , before the end of DATE after DATE , request the tax authority to reconsider its decision ( chapter CARDINAL , sections TIME ) . The tax authority 's decision may also be appealed against to a county administrative court . As with requests for reconsideration , an appeal must normally be lodged before DATE after DATE ( chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Following the appeal , the tax authority shall reconsider its decision as soon as possible and , if it decides to vary the decision in accordance with the taxpayer 's request , the appeal will become void ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL ) . If the decision is not thus amended , the appeal is referred to the county administrative court . If special reasons exist , an appeal may be forwarded by the tax authority to the county administrative court without reconsidering the assessment ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL ) . Further appeals lie to an administrative court of appeal and , subject to compliance with the conditions for obtaining leave to appeal , ORG .", "If the proceedings before a county administrative court or an administrative court of appeal concern a tax surcharge , the appellant has the right to an oral hearing upon request in all cases except where there is reason to assume that no surcharge will be imposed ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . Normally , however , the proceedings before the administrative courts are in writing ( section CARDINAL of the Administrative Court Procedure Act ( F\u00f6rvaltnings - processlagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) .", "At the material time , the collection of taxes and tax surcharges was regulated by LAW .", "A request for reconsideration or an appeal against a decision concerning taxes and tax surcharges has no suspensive effect on the taxpayer 's obligation to pay the amounts in question ( section CARDINAL of LAW and chapter CARDINAL , LAW ) .", "However , the tax authority may grant a stay of execution in respect of taxes and surcharges provided that CARDINAL of the following CARDINAL conditions is met : ( CARDINAL ) if it may be assumed that the amount imposed on the taxpayer will be reduced or remitted , ( CARDINAL ) if the outcome of the case is uncertain , or ( CARDINAL ) if payment of the amount in question would result in considerable damage for the taxpayer or would otherwise appear unjust ( section DATE , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "If , in cases where the second or third condition just referred to is applicable , it may be assumed DATE due to the taxpayer 's situation or other circumstances DATE that the amount for which a stay of execution is requested will not be duly paid , the request can not be granted unless the taxpayer provides a bank guarantee or other security for the amount due . Even in these cases , however , a stay may be granted without security if the relevant amount is relatively insignificant or if there are other special reasons ( section DATE , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "A taxpayer may request the tax authority to reconsider its decision concerning the stay - of - execution issue and may appeal against its decision to a county administrative court . The procedure is essentially identical to that followed in regard to requests for reconsideration and appeals concerning the main tax issues ( sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . Further appeals to an administrative court of appeal and ORG are subject to leave to appeal being granted ( section CARDINAL ) .", "The enforcement offices are under an obligation to levy execution on a debtor upon request , even if the tax authority 's decision concerning tax and tax surcharges is not final ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL and chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) in conjunction with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . If the debtor does not have enough distrainable property , the enforcement office may request a district court to declare the debtor bankrupt . The debtor will normally be considered insolvent if it is discovered during attempts to levy distress in DATE preceding the presentation of the bankruptcy petition that the assets are insufficient to pay the debt in full ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) . If the bankrupt 's estate is not sufficient to defray all the existing and expected bankruptcy expenses and other liabilities that the bankrupt has incurred , the bankruptcy proceedings will be terminated ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "If a bankruptcy petition is based on a tax debt determined by a decision that is not yet final , the court examining the petition is required to make an independent assessment of the alleged debt , having regard to the evidence adduced in the bankruptcy proceedings . The court accordingly has to make a prediction about the outcome of the pending tax assessment proceedings ( judgment of ORG of DATE , case no . \u00d6 CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "If a limited liability company has been declared bankrupt and the bankruptcy proceedings are terminated without any remaining assets , the company is dissolved ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG , DATE ) ) .", "As taxes and tax surcharges are payable even if the tax authority 's decision is not final , the decision may be varied or quashed after the relevant amounts have been paid . In this situation and also if the tax decision is amended to the taxpayer 's advantage by a court judgment , the amount overpaid is refunded with interest ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL and chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . If distress has been levied on the taxpayer 's property or the taxpayer has been declared bankrupt on account of the tax debt , the distress warrant or bankruptcy decision will be set aside on appeal . Should the warrant or decision have become final , the taxpayer may , upon request , have the case reopened and the warrant or decision quashed ( chapter LAW ( R\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) ) . Any property that has been distrained upon will , if possible , then be restored ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ) . The same applies to property forming part of a bankrupt 's estate to the extent that it is not required for the payment of the bankruptcy expenses and other liabilities ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ) . If the taxpayer 's property has been sold and the amount obtained from the sale has been used to pay off the alleged tax debt , the taxpayer will receive financial compensation . In addition , it is open to the taxpayer to bring an action for damages against the ORG for the financial loss caused by the distress or the bankruptcy ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ( LANGUAGE - lagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) , on the ground that the authorities or the courts have acted wrongfully or negligently .", "Service of a document on a legal person shall be effected by delivering the document to someone who has the comptence to represent the legal person ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the Act on the Service of Documents ) . In the event of a failure to serve a document on a limited liability company in the manner mentioned or when such service is deemed to have no prospect of success and provided it is not considered inappropriate in view of the circumstances of the case , so - called special service may be used ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the Act ) . This means that service is effected by sending the document by mail to the company followed by a letter DATE informing it that the document has been dispatched . Both the letter containing the document and the information letter shall be sent to the company 's registered address , as found in the official company register . Service of the document is considered to have taken place DATE after the dispatch of the information letter unless it appears unlikely that the document has arrived at the registered address ( section QUANTITY ) . A precondition for employing the special service is usually that CARDINAL attempt has been made at serving the document in accordance with the ordinary procedure . This may be done by sending the document to the company by ordinary mail including a notice of delivery , which is to be signed by a competent representative and sent back to the authority ( Government PERSON , p.
