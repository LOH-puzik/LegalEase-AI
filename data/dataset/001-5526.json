THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "On DATE , while driving a car , the applicant was stopped by the police for an alcohol test . A breath test taken from him disclosed an alcohol level of QUANTITY . As this was QUANTITY \u03bcg / l , the statutory maximum level , the police confiscated ( invordering ) his driving licence .", "On DATE , the applicant was informed by the public prosecutor at ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) that his driving licence would remain confiscated for DATE . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) with ORG against the public prosecutor \u2019s decision to confiscate his driving licence . In this objection , the applicant mentioned having paid a fine in DATE for drunken driving and explained that he needed his driving licence for professional reasons . He further explained that , on DATE , he had consumed more alcohol than legally allowed for driving as he had been under a great emotional stress caused by private circumstances . In his opinion , to deprive him of his driving licence for such a lengthy period was disproportionate in that it would not only affect his own professional activities , but also those of the persons working for him .", "By summons of DATE , the applicant was ordered to appear on CARDINAL DATE before the Magistrate ( politierechter ) of ORG on charges of drunken driving . On DATE , the Magistrate convicted the applicant of drunken driving . The applicant was sentenced to payment of a fine of NLG . CARDINAL and disqualification for driving for DATE ( ontzegging rijbevoegdheid ) . The disqualification for driving was suspended pending a probation period of DATE . The applicant did not file an appeal against this judgment .", "Also on DATE , ORG determined the applicant \u2019s objection of DATE . It held that , although the public prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE could not be regarded as unreasonable , the applicant \u2019s written and oral submissions disclosed reasons for ordering that the confiscated driving licence be returned to the applicant and , consequently , issued an order to this effect .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was informed that , following information provided by the police on DATE , the Minister of Transport , Public Works and Water Management ( Minister PERSON en Waterstaat ; hereinafter \u201c the Minister \u201d ) had decided that the applicant should be subjected to an Educational Measure Alcohol and Traffic ( Educatieve Maatregel Alcohol en Verkeer ; hereinafter \u201c EMA \u201d ) . He was further informed that the costs of this measure , i.e. NLG . CARDINAL , were to be paid by himself . He was warned that a failure to co - operate in respect of the ORG would result in declaring his driving licence invalid .", "The applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) against the decision of DATE was rejected by the Minister . The applicant was informed of this by letter of DATE . The applicant filed an appeal against this rejection with ORG , which was rejected by the President of this court by judgment of DATE .", "The applicant filed an appeal against the judgment of DATE with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) . Relying on LAW under its criminal head , he argued that the imposition of the ORG constituted a double punishment or punitive measure since the criminal court had already dealt with his case . He further complained that , as his driving licence had already been returned to him , the imposition of the ORG constituted undue hardship . He further complained of unequal treatment as persons in whom a higher alcohol percentage is found are not subject to an ORG imposition , but are subjected to a medical examination .", "In its decision of DATE , the President of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . Insofar as relevant , the President of ORG held :", "< Translation >", "\u201c The President [ of ORG ] has justly considered that , with the fact that the appellant was found to have an alcohol level of QUANTITY , the requirements set out in the relevant rules for imposing the Educational Measure have been fulfilled .", "The circumstance that the criminal court , at the time of the imposition of the Educational Measure , had already taken a decision as to the confiscation of the appellant \u2019s driving licence does not alter this , as the confiscation under criminal law of the driving licence on grounds of LAW ( ORG ) concerns a wholly different procedure than the administrative law measure of imposing the obligation to comply with an Educational Measure . The legislator does not exclude that , in addition to dealing with an offence involving alcohol under criminal law , an administrative law measure is imposed like the obligation to comply with an Educational Measure . ... A connection between the criminal and administrative procedures in FAC , as the appellant apparently wants to make , has not been intended by the legislator . The circumstance that the criminal procedure apparently has ended prior to the administrative law procedure , therefore , has no consequences for the imposition of the Educational Measure .", "The President shares the opinion of the president < of ORG > that imposing on the appellant the obligation to subject himself to an Educational Measure can not be regarded as a \u201c criminal charge \u201d within the meaning of LAW . The qualification given by the legislator to the measure , the aim the measure pursues , the nature and seriousness of the measure and the lacking of a punitive character of the measure make that it does not concern a punishment or sanction as argued by the appellant .", "As to the appellant \u2019s argument that the regulation results in an unequal treatment of motorised vehicle drivers having consumed alcohol , the President subscribes in the first place to the finding of the president < of ORG > that it does not concern similar cases . Motorised vehicle drivers , with whom at the time when they are stopped < by the police > a breath alcohol level higher than CARDINAL \u03bcg / l is found are not in a similar situation that drivers with whom an alcohol level QUANTITY . Like the president < of ORG > , the President finds no basis for the correctness of the appellant \u2019s contention that persons having driven a car with a considerable higher alcohol percentage receive a less severe treatment that persons like him . In this connection , the President points to the possibility , as mentioned by the president [ of ORG ] , of suspending the validity of the driving licence of persons falling in the \u201c heavier category \u201d . Furthermore , unlike persons falling in the \u201c heavier category \u201d , the applicant will not be confronted with an examination of his driving ability or suitability with , as a possible result , a declaration of invalidity of his driving licence . \u201d", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Where suspicion arises as to the driving ability or the physical or mental suitability to drive of a holder of a driving licence , the police or other public officials as designated by an Order in Council ( Algemene Maatregel van Bestuur ) are obliged , under LAW Road and Traffic Act ( ORG ) , to report this in writing to ORG ( \u201c the Minister \u201d ) .", "Under LAW DATE Roads and GPE , the Minister may order , in case the information transmitted gives reason for doing so , that the driving licence holder concerned must be subjected to an investigation of his or her driving ability or suitability . In case the results of such an investigation are unsatisfactory , the Minister may declare the driving licence of the person concerned invalid .", "Under LAW , the Minister may decide , where the Minister finds that the information transmitted does not disclose a need for an investigation of the driving ability or suitability , to subject the driving licence holder concerned to an Educational Measure .", "Pursuant to LAW , the person in respect of whom it has been decided to impose an Educational Measure is obliged to co - operate in the execution of the Educational Measure .

The teacher will transmit a report to the Minister on his or her findings as to the participation of the person concerned in the ORG . On the basis of these findings , the Minister will decide whether or not the driving licence of the person concerned is to be declared invalid .", "A person subjected to an Educational Measure may file an objection with the Minister against that decision . An appeal against the Minister \u2019s decision on such an objection lies with ORG of ORG .", "Only the Minister is competent to order the imposition of an ORG . Consequently , it can not be imposed by a criminal court judge as part of a sentence in cases where a person has been convicted of a traffic offence .
