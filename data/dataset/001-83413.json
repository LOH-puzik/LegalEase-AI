THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 10;Violation of Art. 5-1;Remainder inadmissible;Costs and expenses (Convention proceedings) - claim dismissed", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Wilhelmina Thomassen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) convicted CARDINAL accused , PERSON , PERSON H. , of arms trafficking . In the criminal investigation into the offences at issue , the GPE police had stated that an arsenal of weapons had been found by chance : the caretaker of a building situated on the GPE in GPE had contacted the police when water was leaking from CARDINAL of the flats in the building , whose occupants were absent . With the aid of CARDINAL locksmiths , the police had gained entry to the flat and in the subsequent search for the source of the leak , the weapons had been found .", "CARDINAL . The accused lodged an appeal against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the DATE newspaper Sp!ts published CARDINAL articles , written by the applicant and his colleague PERSON , in which doubts were expressed about the amount of coincidence allegedly involved in the finding of the weapons . The article of DATE , entitled \u201c Chance Hit or PERSON ? \u201d ( \u201c PERSON of loepzuiver schot ? \u201d ) , quotes an unnamed policeman of the GPE force as commenting in respect of the flooding , \u201c That is what we made out of it . Sometimes you just need a breakthrough in an investigation \u201d ( \u201c Dat hebben we er maar van gemaakt . CARDINAL heb je net even een doorbraak nodig in je onderzoek \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings on appeal against PERSON , PERSON H. , the applicant and PERSON were summonsed to appear as witnesses at the request of the defence . At the first hearing before ORG ( gerechtshof ) on DATE in the cases against PERSON and PERSON , the applicant \u2013 who was assisted by DATE stated inter alia that he knew that the policeman , whom he had quoted verbatim in the article of DATE , had been involved in a previous investigation against PERSON When the applicant was asked whether that policeman was also involved in the investigation of the flat or was aware of that investigation , he invoked his right of non - disclosure ( verschoningsrecht ) . Counsel for the defence argued that both the individual interest of the accused \u2013 on whom a custodial sentence had been imposed as a result of the investigation carried out by the police \u2013 and the interest of criminal justice in the GPE outweighed the applicant 's interest in not disclosing his source . The Advocate General also expressed as his opinion that the applicant could not invoke a right of non - disclosure . He stated in addition that the source , if his name was made known , had nothing to fear from either the police or the public prosecution service .", "CARDINAL . After having deliberated , ORG considered that , if the statement made by the police officer to the applicant was correct , this might affect the conviction of the accused . It also affected the integrity of the police and judicial authorities . For these reasons , ORG held that the applicant was to reply to the question whether his source had been involved in the investigation of the flat and had been aware of that investigation . The President of the court further reminded the applicant that the court was empowered to order his detention for failure to comply with a judicial order ( gijzeling ) . Upon this , the applicant replied that his source had both been aware of , and involved in , the investigation of the flat .", "CARDINAL . NORP Asked by counsel for the accused to reveal the identity of his source , the applicant once again invoked his right of non - disclosure . Counsel for the applicant submitted that he was justified in so doing , given that disclosing the identity of his source would render it impossible for the applicant to work as a journalist in the future since sources would no longer approach him . The interests of the journalist and of freedom of expression outweighed other interests . Moreover , as the criminal charges at issue concerned only arms trafficking and not , for example , a multiple homicide , it was disproportionate to require the applicant to name his source . It also went against the principle of subsidiarity , since there were other ways in which the identity of the source could be discovered .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply , the Advocate General stated that journalists exposed obvious wrongs ( kennelijke misstanden ) in society . Where they chose to do so , they should also face the consequences . The applicant was the only witness who could clarify whether or not the CARDINAL accused had been wrongly convicted . In the present case , where official records , drawn up on oath of office ( ambtseed ) by police officers , and the integrity of the judicial authorities were at stake , the applicant must reveal the identity of his source . It could not be the case that , in order to trace this identity , every member of the GPE police force should be heard , bearing in mind that all officers in the case against PERSON had already been heard by the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) .", "CARDINAL . Having deliberated , ORG decided that the applicant was to reveal the identity of his source , for the same reasons as it had held that he had to reply to the question of his source 's involvement in the investigation . The applicant invoked his right to remain silent ( zwijgrecht ) , upon which the court ordered his immediate detention for a maximum of DATE . No legal remedy lay against the decision to detain the applicant ( Article QUANTITY of LAW , \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . When questioned by counsel for the accused , the applicant 's colleague , PERSON , stated that she was aware of the identity of the source , but that she had never met him in person . Having regard to this last fact , as well as to the fact that the journalist who had had direct contact with the source \u2013 i.e. the applicant \u2013 had already been placed in detention , ORG considered that PERSON was not obliged to reveal the identity of the source .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was served with an unreasoned decision on DATE . On DATE he was handed a copy of the record of the hearing of CARDINAL DATE , containing the decisions made by ORG at that hearing and the reasons for them .", "CARDINAL . Late on DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG to be released from detention . Prior to the examination of this request on DATE , the applicant was able to consult his lawyer only once , namely in TIME of DATE . Requests to visit the applicant on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , ( TIME CARDINAL , DATE and DATE were refused . The request for release was dealt with by ORG in chambers ( raadkamer ) , by the same judges who had ordered his detention .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing in chambers on DATE , ORG reported that , following the applicant 's statements at the hearing on DATE , a police inspector had carried out an internal investigation , which had revealed that CARDINAL police officers had been involved in both the first and the second investigation into the accused PERSON All these officers had made sworn affidavits to the effect that they had never been in contact with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Informed of the outcome of the internal police investigation , the applicant insisted that he did not want to reveal the identity of his source . He stated that he was a journalist and that he might as well give up on that career if he started revealing his sources ; no sources wanting to remain anonymous would any longer be willing to provide him with tip - offs . The applicant was informed by the President of ORG that the right of non - disclosure was not absolute , and that more weighty interests could be at stake . In the present case , long prison sentences had been imposed on the CARDINAL accused , partly on the basis of official records drawn up by police officers . The applicant replied that he was willing to state only that his source was not CARDINAL of the police officers who had made sworn affidavits in the internal police investigation .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant argued that the journalist should be the last , rather than the first , means of arriving at the truth . The witnesses , whose examination had been requested by the CARDINAL accused , ought to be heard first . Those witnesses could be confronted with the articles published in Sp!ts as well as with the article which had appeared in the DATE news magazine PERSON on DATE . This latter article had also suggested that the flooding of the flat had been staged , and the author had informed counsel for the applicant that the information contained in the article had not come from the same source as the one relied on by the applicant . Counsel for the applicant further posited that ORG ( Rijksrecherche ) could carry out an investigation of the police force . Finally , it was for ORG to assess the value of the article written by the applicant \u2013 that court could also decide to disregard it .", "CARDINAL . NORP By decision of DATE , ORG refused the applicant 's request for his detention to be lifted . It repeated that the interests of the accused and of the integrity of the police and the judicial authorities outweighed the interest of the applicant in not having to disclose the identity of his source . Having regard to the outcome of the internal police investigation , as well as to the fact that an appeal made by the police commissioner for the applicant 's source to come forward had not produced any results , ORG considered it unlikely that an investigation by ORG would clarify , within a reasonable time , the cause of the flooding , quite apart from the fact that such an investigation would seriously delay the criminal proceedings against PERSON , PERSON and H. The Court of Appeal similarly rejected the suggestion to hear the witnesses proposed by the defence first , given that those witnesses had already been heard extensively about the point in issue . For these reasons , it could not be held that the detention of the applicant breached the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further considered that the applicant 's objections against the order for his detention as given at the hearing of CARDINAL DATE did not require examination since no appeal lay against such order . It also rejected the argument that the order had not been served on the applicant within TIME , since DATE as appeared from the record of that hearing of DATE he had been informed of the order orally . Finally , ORG held that the possibilities for contact between the applicant and his counsel were laid down in penitentiary legislation . It was not for ORG to assess the application of that legislation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) against the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . A second hearing before ORG in the criminal proceedings against PERSON took place on DATE . The applicant once again refused to reveal the identity of his source . Upon this , ORG decided to lift the order for the applicant 's detention . It considered that no support for , or confirmation of , the applicant 's statement that he had received information from a police officer who had been involved in both investigations against the accused PERSON could be found in statements made by other persons and/or in the contents of documents . On the contrary , the applicant 's statement had been contradicted by CARDINAL police officers . Therefore , no credence could be attached to his statement . This being the case , the applicant 's detention no longer served any purpose .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing on DATE , and following ORG decision to lift the applicant 's detention , counsel for the accused PERSON challenged ( wraken ) ORG . A different chamber of ORG upheld that challenge , also on DATE . It held that the opinion that the applicant 's statement was not credible , as expressed by ORG in the criminal proceedings against PERSON H. , might have a bearing on decisions which that court would be called upon to take in the criminal proceedings against PERSON This constituted an exceptional circumstance , providing an important indication for the conclusion that the accused 's fear of a judge being prejudiced against him was objectively justified .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings against the CARDINAL accused continued on DATE before ORG in a new composition . The applicant was again heard as a witness , as were CARDINAL other journalists who had also published articles about the case against PERSON and the possibility of the flooding having been staged . ORG also heard CARDINAL plumbers and the caretaker of the building .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent to the decision to lift the order for his detention , the applicant withdrew his appeal on points of law as his release had rendered that appeal devoid of interest .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the criminal proceedings against PERSON , PERSON H. have been brought to a conclusion .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has submitted photocopies of CARDINAL cuttings from print media .", "CARDINAL . The first is of a report in the mass circulation DATE newspaper PERSON , dated DATE . It is therein stated that following reports of flooding from a second flat in GPE , police had found another large quantity of weaponry . PERSON , PERSON H. , the accused in the applicant 's case , were not at that time suspected of involvement ; the weapons were thought to belong to a terrorist organisation . The report drew attention to the similarity between the ORG case and this new case as regards the circumstances in which the weapons were found . It cited \u201c police sources \u201d as suggesting that intelligence services , possibly foreign , had engineered events in order to protect their informants .", "CARDINAL . The second , which is incomplete , is of an article that appeared on DATE in the DATE magazine PERSON . It links the CARDINAL events and cites an unnamed source as stating that they had in fact been engineered by the then ORG ( Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the report in PERSON and the article in PERSON were both written by journalists other than the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has also submitted a printout of a page taken from the internet web site of the GPE DATE newspaper ORG , dated DATE . It quotes the CARDINAL plumbers who were called in to repair the water leak as dismissing as nonsense all allegations that the damage had been caused deliberately ; in actual fact , such leaks were very common in older buildings .", "CARDINAL . Provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure relevant to the case provide as follows :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c Persons who , by virtue of their position , their profession or their office , are bound to secrecy may ... decline to give evidence or to answer particular questions , but only in relation to matters the knowledge of which is entrusted to them in that capacity . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c CARDINAL .

No remedy shall lie against the order .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court shall order the witness released from detention as soon as he has fulfilled his obligations or the investigation at the hearing is closed . It shall however have competence to order the witness released from detention whatever the state of the investigation , including at the request of the witness . LAW shall apply .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL shall apply . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , which are thus declared applicable to witnesses at the trial hearing , per se apply to witnesses heard by an investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides , in relevant part , that the detained witness may appeal within DATE after the official notification in writing of the decision against any refusal to order his release from detention and may appeal on points of law to ORG against any such refusal given on appeal .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that the witness shall receive notification in writing within TIME of all decisions to order or extend his detention or to refuse his release from detention .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that the witness shall have the right to consult counsel . His counsel shall have unrestricted access ( vrije toegang ) to him , be allowed to see him in private and exchange confidential correspondence with him , subject to detention rules and provided that the criminal investigation in which his evidence was sought not be delayed . Counsel shall also have access to any official records relating to the questioning of the witness and , if the criminal investigation admits of it , the remainder of the case file .", "CARDINAL . Although these provisions by their wording apply to proceedings at first instance before ORG , by virtue of Article CARDINAL they apply by analogy to appeal proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Guidelines on the position of the press in relation to police action ( PERSON over de positie van de pers bij politieoptreden ) were issued by the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON ) on DATE . At the time of the events complained of , they provided , in relevant part :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Seizure of journalistic material", "Journalistic material may be seized in cases described in LAW .
