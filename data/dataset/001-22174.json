THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant was convicted at ORG of raping and indecently assaulting a young woman , PERSON was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for rape and CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for indecent assault , the CARDINAL sentences to run concurrently . The applicant was acquitted at the same time of raping a second woman , B.", "The background of the case may be described as follows . When PERSON was aged DATE she joined a modelling agency in GPE and began DATE classes . The agency was owned by PERSON , a friend of the applicant , and DATE classes took place at ORG \u2019s home . When PERSON was aged DATE , she started staying overnight at PERSON \u2019s house on DATE . A number of other girls aged DATE also stayed at the house . PERSON exerted control over the girls , to the extent that he would tell them what to wear , what to eat , when to wash and when to go to bed . J. left school when she was aged DATE and went to live permanently at ORG house at about GPE DATE . PERSON used to take the girls to restaurants . On CARDINAL such occasion , DATE after PERSON began living with him , PERSON pointed out the applicant to her , telling her that he was \u201c a very important man and dead rich \u201d . DATE , when PERSON , PERSON and another girl from the agency NORP were at the restaurant , the applicant was also present . After the meal , PERSON said that they were to drive the applicant home in PERSON \u2019s car .", "At the trial , PERSON gave evidence that she got into the back of the car at PERSON \u2019s suggestion , while PERSON sat in the front with PERSON who was driving . PERSON stated that during the journey the applicant forced her to have oral sex with him . On arrival at the applicant \u2019s home , PERSON told PERSON to get out as the applicant wanted to show them his house . J. followed the applicant and PERSON and ended up in a bedroom . The applicant and PERSON , who was his girlfriend , had sexual intercourse . The applicant then told PERSON to take off her clothes and made her have sexual intercourse with him . PERSON left the house and joined PERSON who was waiting in the car . PERSON said that she did as the applicant wanted because she was dominated by PERSON , and was afraid of upsetting the applicant , whom she knew to be PERSON \u2019s friend .", "J. contacted the police in DATE . On DATE , the applicant was arrested and charged with a number of offences of a sexual nature allegedly committed against young women from the modelling agency . PERSON , who had been arrested in DATE was also charged with a number of offences of a sexual nature committed against young women from the modelling agency , including the rape of J.", "The applicant was originally charged with CARDINAL offences . His defence to each charge was that the event alleged had never taken place . The applicant \u2019s evidence was that he had no recollection of J. having visited his home , and that there had been no contact of a sexual nature between him and PERSON at any time .", "At the end of J. \u2019s examination in chief by the prosecution , the applicant \u2019s leading counsel obtained leave from the trial judge pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Sexual Offences ( Amendment ) Act DATE ( see below ) to cross - examine J. on her sexual experiences with PERSON , and in particular on the fact that she had been raped by PERSON and about the alleged control that he exerted over her . It was the defence case that PERSON was obsessed with a hatred of PERSON and it was this which motivated her allegation against the applicant . PERSON was extremely distressed by this cross - examination .", "PERSON gave evidence for the defence . She had started working at PERSON \u2019s agency when aged DATE and had begun a relationship with the applicant when aged DATE . She stated that on one occasion she had travelled to the applicant \u2019s home with PERSON , the applicant ( with whom she was then having a relationship ) and PERSON ; that PERSON had driven the car , she had travelled in the front passenger seat , and the applicant and PERSON had travelled in the back of the car ; that PERSON had gone into the applicant \u2019s bedroom in order to use the toilet in the en suite bathroom . When PERSON came out of the toilet , she saw PERSON and the applicant lying on the bed , fully clothed . They all then left . Nothing improper occurred .", "PERSON was asked in cross - examination by the prosecution about her relationship with the applicant , who had been introduced to her by PERSON . She was also asked about sexual relationships with other men introduced to her by PERSON . She accepted that she had had sexual intercourse with CARDINAL of the men , when she was aged DATE , and in the case of CARDINAL of the men , while she was still conducting a relationship with the applicant . When re - examined by defence counsel , she described these relationships as \u201c almost dirty or sordid \u201d and contrasted them with her relationship with the applicant , which she said was \u201c [ r]omantic , how it should have been \u201d . PERSON was also asked by prosecution counsel about an abortion which she had had at around this time , and was asked whether she had had \u201c QUANTITY in a bed \u201d sex involving the applicant .", "No reference was made to L. \u2019s sexual experience by either counsel in their closing speeches , or by the judge in summing up the case for the jury . The jury proceeded to convict the applicant .", "On DATE , ORG granted the applicant \u2019s application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence . The applicant applied at the same time for leave to adduce fresh evidence , in the form of a number of witnesses whose evidence was not available at the trial because , the applicant submitted , he was unaware of their existence or of the fact that they had material to make available to him . CARDINAL of the witnesses was a young man with whom PERSON had had a sexual relationship while on holiday in GPE in DATE , and to whom she had subsequently written a letter , a copy of which formed part of the fresh evidence which it was sought to adduce . ORG gave the applicant leave to amend his grounds of appeal in order to contend that his convictions were in all the circumstances unsafe , having regard to the fresh evidence .", "Lord PERSON said , in giving judgment granting leave :", "\u201c While we conclude that these witnesses are not in a position to give evidence which would have been admissible at the trial , we nonetheless consider that this is material which could have been used to attack the credit of J. and which the applicant should be free to draw to the attention of the court in support of his submission that in the light of these materials and of the case as a whole this court should consider the convictions of the applicant to be unsafe . \u201d", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against conviction and sentence . ORG received the fresh evidence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of LAW DATE , and then considered its significance in the context of the appeal . ORG said , in giving the judgment of ORG :", "\u201c ... the full ORG ruled that we should give the new material such weight as it deserves when considering the extent to which the credit of ORG might have been shaken had it been available to the defence at the time of the trial . ORG did not consider , however , that it amounted to evidence which could be placed before the jury . Before us [ applicant \u2019s counsel ] challenged that conclusion . He submitted that where , as here , the prosecution case turns exclusively on the evidence of the complainant , evidence that bears on the credit of the complainant is not merely collateral , but goes to the heart of the case ... It seemed to us somewhat arid to invite lengthy argument about the basis upon which we should consider the significance of the new material . If it proved such as to to lead us to doubt the credibility of the complainant , we would be loth to entertain argument that the convictions should nonetheless stand because of a technical rule of evidence against the admissibility of evidence going solely as to credit . ... In these circumstances , we decided that the convenient course was to receive the evidence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of LAW DATE and , having done so , to evaluate the significance of that material . \u201d", "As regarded the significance of the evidence of J. \u2019s holiday on GPE when it was alleged that she had had sexual intercourse with a young man , Lord PERSON said :", "\u201c [ Applicant \u2019s counsel ] urged that this evidence was significant and could have been admitted by the Judge on CARDINAL bases :", "( CARDINAL ) it showed that PERSON was not as vulnerable as she appeared .", "( CARDINAL ) it had significance in relation to a pregnancy test .", "( CARDINAL ) the evidence was in conflict with other evidence PERSON had given and thus tended to destroy her credibility .", "J. \u2019s vulnerable appearance", "To seek to introduce this evidence simply to counter the general impression that J. was making in the witness box would have been a paradigm example of the type of conduct that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act is designed to prevent . We have no doubt that the judge would have refused an application made on that basis . The fact that J. had enjoyed the brief relationship with a young man , which is reflected by the letter , whether before or after the date on which the offences were alleged to have been committed by the [ applicant ] , is of itself of no relevance to the question of whether she was raped and indecently assaulted by a man CARDINAL times her age .", "The pregnancy test", "J. had a pregnancy test on DATE . The defence were aware of this , but naturally asked her nothing about it . The new material indicates that the test probably resulted from anxiety as a result of having had sexual intercourse with [ the young man in GPE ] so that it would have been safe to cross - examine as to why PERSON did not have a pregnancy test after the alleged rape by the [ applicant ] . This argument does not attach intrinsic significance to the evidence itself , nor constitute any reason why it should have been introduced at trial . There are various reasons why the victim of a rape might not think it necessary to have a pregnancy test and the fact that the defence refrained from asking about this under a misapprehension does not affect the safety of the verdicts . \u201d", "Concerning alleged inconsistencies revealed in ORG evidence , Lord Justice PERSON said :", "\u201c In her evidence in chief , ORG said nothing about the effect that the alleged offences had had on her . Under cross - examination she volunteered the statement that \u201c when I came back from the house I spent DATE of my life trying to forget what happened . \u201d We do not find that the GPE holiday , if it took place during DATE in question , is inconsistent with that statement ... DATE \u2019s counsel ] submitted that the NORP holiday was inconsistent with the statement that PERSON had messed up her life completely and that she hated having sex ... [applicant \u2019s counsel ] said that if all this material had been available he would have adopted a completely different approach to ORG statement as to what happened ...", "This puzzled us for we could not envisage how [ applicant \u2019s counsel ] could have hoped to persuade the Judge to allow him to adduce evidence about what PERSON had said in relation to events at [ PERSON \u2019s house ] in order to cross - examine her on the truth of those statements . Furthermore , J. had given evidence at PERSON \u2019s trial which ended in his conviction in DATE on counts which included rape of J. We asked [ applicant \u2019s counsel ] if he was suggesting that ORG account of the sexual abuse and rape that PERSON inflicted on her was untrue . He answered that he could not say that . It seems to us that that concession , which was inevitable , undermines the points that [ applicant \u2019s counsel ] has sought to make on inconsistencies . There can be no doubt that PERSON was subjected to appalling sexual abuse by PERSON . In whatever way she behaved thereafter , her behaviour can not be an indication that this abuse never occurred , and thus we do not see it can be an indication that abuse at the hands of the [ applicant ] never occurred . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the Sexual Offences LAW DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If at a trial any person is for the time being charged with a rape offence to which he pleads not guilty , then , except with the leave of the judge , no evidence and no question in cross - examination shall be adduced or asked at the trial , by or on behalf of any defendant at the trial , about any sexual experience of a complainant with a person other than that defendant .", "( CARDINAL ) The judge shall not give leave in pursuance of the preceding subsection for any evidence or question except on an application made by him in the absence of the jury by or on behalf of a defendant ; and on such an application the judge shall give leave if and only if he is satisfied that it would be unfair to that defendant to refuse to allow the evidence to be adduced or the question to be asked . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
