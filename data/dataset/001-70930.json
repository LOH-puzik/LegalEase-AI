POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , PERSON , a NORP national , is also a statutory representative of the second applicant , an ORG ( ORG ) with headquarters in GPE Wola . She also represents the second applicant before the ORG .", "At a meeting held on DATE the applicant association distributed among its members CARDINAL copies of an election leaflet of which it had printed CARDINAL copies . The leaflet exhorted the members of the association to vote in the municipal elections scheduled for DATE . It was further stressed that no votes should be cast in favour of these representatives of the local parties who had been using their position in various municipal authorities to enrich themselves by being involved in dubious business deals , to the detriment of the public interest and municipal finances .", "In this context name of CARDINAL of the local councillors , PERSON , who also was a candidate to the council in the coming elections , was mentioned . It was alleged that she had , contrary to applicable laws regulating the status of local councillors , been combining her function of councillor with a paid post on the governing board of CARDINAL of public companies owned by the municipality , obtaining a \u201c nice salary \u201d ( \u201c pensyjka \u201d ) .", "Subsequently PERSON instituted proceedings on the basis of the CARDINAL LAW . This LAW made it possible for the election candidates to institute proceedings in which to claim that untrue information published about them during the election campaign be rectified and that apologies be published ( see Relevant domestic law ) . The plaintiff argued that she had indeed been a member of the governing board of CARDINAL company owned by the municipality , but only from DATE until DATE , before she had become a councillor . Afterwards , she had stepped down . As it transpired from the leaflet concerned that she remained on the board , contrary to the applicable anti - corruption provisions of the DATE ORG ( County ) Act , the leaflet was disseminating false information , detrimental to her reputation and to her prospects of being elected .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing during which it questioned the parties . It had also regard to the evidence submitted by the plaintiff , including a letter of ORG dated DATE , from which it transpired that PERSON had been on the board of ORG company owned by ORG from DATE to DATE . It further took evidence from the documents of the company , from which it transpired that ORG had ceased to be on its governing board on DATE .", "On DATE the court gave a ruling , in which it ordered the applicant association and the applicant to cease dissemination of information concerning ORG alleged involvement in the governing board of that company . It also ordered forfeiture of the remaining copies of the leaflet , ordered the applicant association to publish apologies in a local newspaper and to pay the plaintiff \u2019s costs in the amount of PLN MONEY . The court dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s request that the association be ordered to pay PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the local children \u2019s home .", "The court established that it was not in dispute that the leaflet had been authored and distributed by the bodies of the applicant association and that it contained an allegation that ORG had at the time of its distribution been a member of the governing board of CARDINAL company , owned by the municipality of GPE . The court noted that if this had been true , it would have been in breach of the anticorruption provisions of the DATE ORG ( County ) Act .", "Having regard to the documents of the company and to the letter of ORG of Stalowa Wola submitted by ORG , the court found that it indeed had been the case , but only from DATE until DATE . On DATE she had ceased to serve on the board , Hence , the allegations that she retained this post afterwards and continued to receive a salary were untrue . Therefore , under LAW of DATE on Elections to GPE , ORG , this information had to be rectified . Consequently , the court ordered that the remaining copies of the leaflet should be forfeited and that the applicant association should publish in a local newspaper apologies for disseminating untrue information during the election campaign .", "As for the plaintiff \u2019s demand of payment of ORG MONEY by the association , the court found that such payment would constitute a serious blow to its finances , which in any event were in a quite precarious position , given the relative newness of the association . The association had had no time in which to find any serious source of income , other than the membership fees . The court further observed that if it had ordered the association to make this payment , this might seriously impair its ability to act and also constitute an interference in the democratic process of election , unduly improving the plaintiff \u2019s chances to be elected .", "The court further noted that such an order would not serve any useful purpose for the protection of the plaintiff \u2019s interests and reputation , which were sufficiently ensured by the forfeiture of the remaining copies of the leaflet and by the order to publish apologies by the association .", "The applicant association appealed , arguing essentially that in the light of document it had at its disposal , the information contained in the leaflet was true and that the judgment was generally wrong .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , considering that the findings of fact made by the lower court that PERSON had ceased to be on the governing board of the company in DATE were correct . The use of the present tense in the impugned leaflet clearly suggested that , in contravention of laws governing the status and obligations of municipal councillors , she still remained on the board and had been obtaining emoluments for her work . This was obviously untrue , and therefore the first - instance judgment was correct .", "Article CARDINAL of the Law of DATE on Elections to GPE , ORG provided , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL . If posters , slogans , leaflets , statements or other forms of propaganda and campaigning contain untrue data and information , a candidate standing for local election or a representative of an electoral committee has the right to make an application asking ORG to :", "CARDINAL ) NORP order the confiscation of such materials ,", "CARDINAL ) NORP issue an injunction restraining [ the defendant ] from publishing such data and information ,", "CARDINAL ) NORP order rectification of the information ,", "CARDINAL ) NORP order [ the defendant ] to apologise to the aggrieved party ,", "CARDINAL ) NORP order [ the defendant ] to pay to a charity up to PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL ,", "CARDINAL ) NORP order [ the defendant ] to pay to the claimant up to FAC CARDINAL,CARDINAL in damages .", "\u00a7 CARDINAL .

The court shall serve on the interested party referred to in \u00a7 CARDINAL , the relevant regional electoral commissioner and the person obligated to execute the court \u2019s decision , without undue delay , a decision terminating the proceedings in the case .", "\u00a7 CARDINAL .
