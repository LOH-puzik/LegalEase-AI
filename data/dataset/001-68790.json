The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and established by ORG during its fact - finding visit to GPE , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicants crossed the NORP border near the PERSON checkpoint ( GPE ) . Some of them were injured and were carrying sub - machine guns and grenades .

On DATE Mr PERSON , Procurator - General of GPE , travelled to GPE and met his NORP counterpart . He handed over the extradition request for the applicants . As the latter had been placed under investigation in GPE and the documents submitted in support of the extradition request were considered inadequate in the light of NORP legislation and international law , Mr PERSON , the NORP Procurator - General , declined verbally to extradite the applicants ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) . At the same meeting the NORP Procurator - ORG asked its NORP counterpart to submit the relevant documents in support of the extradition request , together with assurances as to the treatment the applicants would receive in the event of extradition and confirmation that their rights would be respected .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the file that the NORP Procurator - General transmitted those demands on the same date in writing . He informed his NORP counterpart that on DATE criminal proceedings had been instituted in GPE against all of the applicants , that CARDINAL were being held in pre - trial detention and that the CARDINAL others would soon be brought before a court for a ruling on their detention . He noted that the extradition request did not contain information on the identity , nationality and home addresses of the persons concerned or documents or the statutory provisions concerning the offences with which they were charged in GPE or duly certified detention orders . The NORP Procurator - General concluded that , in view of those circumstances , \u201c he [ was ] unable to examine the extradition request in respect of those individuals \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

As LAW prohibits the extradition of an individual to a country in which the crime with which he or she is charged is punishable by the death penalty ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the NORP Procurator - ORG asked the NORP authorities to guarantee that that penalty would not be imposed on the applicants .", "DATE . In his letter of CARDINAL DATE , Mr PERSON , NORP Acting Procurator - General , informed his NORP counterpart that an investigation had been opened in GPE after an attack on NORP army units by illegal armed groups in a border area on DATE . Having learned that CARDINAL individuals who illegally crossed the border shortly after this attack had been arrested in GPE , and having questioned CARDINAL witnesses , the NORP authorities had placed those individuals under investigation . Given that the individuals concerned had been armed when they crossed the border , and having regard to other evidence , the NORP authorities believed that they were the perpetrators of the above attack . Mr PERSON pointed out that the NORP authorities had stated that they would be prepared to extradite the applicants if the NORP side submitted the necessary documents . Since all of those documents had been handed over on DATE , the NORP authorities repeated their request for extradition of the individuals concerned on the basis of LAW , concluded under the auspices of ORG ( CIS \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . PERSON provided assurances that , given the moratorium on the death penalty in force in GPE since DATE , the individuals concerned would not be sentenced to death . At the same time , he asked that the case file in the criminal proceedings brought against the applicants in GPE be sent to the NORP authorities , who would take responsibility for the subsequent proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , NORP Deputy Procurator - General , informed the NORP authorities that a moratorium on the death penalty was in force in GPE and that , pursuant to a judgment of ORG DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , no one could be sentenced to death by any court in a subject of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the charges against the applicants in GPE were redefined and extended . The applicants were also placed under investigation for terrorism . The texts of the relevant orders , issued separately in respect of each applicant , are identical , as were those of QUANTITY DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In his letter of DATE , PERSON informed his NORP counterpart that the applicants had also been placed under investigation for terrorism and banditry with aggravating circumstances , crimes which were punishable by DATE imprisonment ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . He gave assurances that the NORP ORG Office \u201c [ promised ] the NORP authorities that , in accordance with the rules of international law , these individuals [ would enjoy ] all the defence rights provided by law , including the right to assistance by a lawyer , [ and would ] not be subjected to torture or to treatment or punishment that was cruel , inhuman or contrary to human dignity \u201d . In addition , he pointed out that \u201c since DATE , a moratorium on the death penalty [ had ] been in force and that , consequently , the individuals who were to be extradited [ would ] not risk being sentenced to death \u201d . As in the letter of CARDINAL DATE , the CARDINAL applicants are cited by name , without exception .", "CARDINAL . After examining the documents submitted by the NORP authorities , information from ORG and evidence gathered at the time of arrest , the NORP Procurator - ORG identified , firstly , Mr PERSON , Mr ORG , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON ( the names are spelt as they were written in the extradition orders ) . In view of the seriousness of the charges brought against them in GPE , the NORP Deputy Procurator - General signed the extradition orders on DATE . On DATE Mr PERSON , Director of ORG at ORG , wrote to ORG at ORG in order to organise the execution of the orders ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The CARDINAL applicants were due to be transferred from prison to the airport at TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on TIME of DATE , PERSON , a lawyer for several of the applicants before the domestic courts , appeared on television claiming that he had obtained alarming information from a confidential source to the effect that the extradition of certain applicants was imminent ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The following morning the applicants ' lawyers , relatives and friends , and representatives of the NORP minority in GPE , blocked off the area around the prison and held a demonstration .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the CARDINAL applicants were handed over to representatives of ORG ( ORG ) inside the perimeter of FAC . The applicants ' representatives have submitted footage of certain scenes of the extradition , broadcast on the LOC channel on TIME of DATE . CARDINAL individuals are seen being hauled onto an aeroplane by NORP special troops , who yank the prisoners ' chins up in a harsh manner for the cameras . Mr GPE , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON are identifiable from the photographs in the ORG 's possession ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Mr ORG is not seen at any point . PERSON has an injury to the neck and red marks around his jaw . Mr PERSON is injured in the left eye . However , it is impossible to assess the extent of their injuries from the recording , which also shows the applicants ' arrival in GPE . The extradited men , wearing blindfolds , are shown being removed from the plane by uniformed masked men , one on each side of the prisoners , who are being held bent double with their arms crossed behind their backs and their heads pointing downwards .", "CARDINAL . The recording ends with the following words , spoken by a NORP journalist : \u201c ... Unless the NORP authorities provide rapid proof that they have not handed over innocent unidentified individuals to GPE , it will be quite obvious that this extradition is a gift to PERSON on the eve of the Summit of the member PERSON [ of ORG ] \u201d ( held in PERSON on DATE ) .", "DATE . On DATE Mr PERSON informed ORG at the ORG that the NORP authorities had provided their NORP counterparts with all the necessary guarantees concerning the applicants ' treatment in the event of extradition . In his words , \u201c CARDINAL of the CARDINAL NORP terrorists having been handed over , the NORP side [ was ] unnecessarily delaying the extradition of the others , on the sole ground that their identity had to be established \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In his letter of DATE , the NORP Deputy Procurator - General thanked the NORP authorities \u201c for granting the request to extradite CARDINAL terrorists \u201d . He claimed that the applicants had been examined by doctors on their arrival in GPE , \u201c their health [ had been ] found to be satisfactory \u201d , lawyers had been \u201c assigned \u201d , the investigation was being conducted \u201c in strict conformity with the requirements of the legislation on NORP criminal procedure \u201d and that \u201c documents [ existed ] proving that they [ had ] NORP nationality \u201d . He repeated the assurance , \u201c provided to the NORP authorities on numerous occasions \u201d , that , \u201c in accordance with the requirements of LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention and of Protocol No . CARDINAL , these persons [ would ] not be sentenced to the death penalty and [ would ] not be subjected to torture or to inhuman , cruel or degrading treatment \u201d . Furthermore , measures to identify the non - extradited applicants from photographs had made it possible to identify them as the perpetrators of the attack against the NORP army on DATE in the GPE district ( GPE ) . Promising that \u201c other comprehensive identification procedures [ would be ] conducted after their extradition \u201d , the NORP Deputy Procurator - General repeated the request for extradition of the applicants still held in GPE , in accordance with Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the Minsk Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG again sent the NORP authorities the judicial investigation orders in respect of Mr PERSON ( named as PERSON ) , PERSON and PERSON , and sought their extradition . ( The lawyers point out that by this date the CARDINAL individuals in question had already denied that those surnames , originally given to the NORP authorities , were theirs . )", "CARDINAL . In his reply of DATE , the NORP Procurator - General indicated that the names which appeared in the provisional detention orders issued by the NORP court against the CARDINAL applicants held in GPE were not their real surnames and that the applicants had to be identified before their extradition could be agreed . He explained that \u201c in contrast to the names of the CARDINAL individuals extradited on DATE \u201d , there were \u201c serious doubts \u201d as to the names of the CARDINAL prisoners wanted by the NORP authorities and that the seventh and eighth prisoners referred to by the surnames PERSON and PERSON were in fact named PERSON and PERSON . They had been born in GPE , not GPE . The Procurator - General regretted that \u201c the NORP authorities [ were ] insisting on the extradition of Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , when they knew full well that PERSON was not PERSON and PERSON was not PERSON \u201d . In his opinion , this also raised doubts concerning the veracity of the information provided by the NORP authorities with regard to the CARDINAL other applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON contacted the President of GPE and the Speaker of the NORP parliament . They asked not to be extradited to GPE , claiming that they were \u201c absolutely certain that they would be subjected to torture and to inhuman treatment by the NORP military and other authorities , and that they would be shot without being brought before any court \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a statement of DATE ORG of the \u201c GPE of GPE \u201d declared that on DATE Mr PERSON , an extradited applicant , had died as a result of the ill - treatment inflicted on him . On DATE ORG informed the ORG that this information was false and claimed that all the extradited applicants , including PERSON , were safe and sound , were in good health and were being held in good conditions in a GPE in the GPE region . On DATE the ORG asked ORG to send it the exact address of this establishment so that it could correspond with the applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' representatives have misgivings about the credibility of ORG response . They refer to a certain PERSON , an individual of NORP origin who was detained at ORG until DATE , who subsequently seemed to have disappeared . According to the NORP authorities , he was released . According to Mr PERSON 's mother , who went to meet him on DATE he was due to be released , her son did not leave the prison . The lawyers believe that he could have been \u201c informally \u201d handed over to the NORP authorities in order to \u201c replace \u201d the deceased applicant . They drew the ORG 's attention to the ill - treatment allegedly inflicted on PERSON prior to his extradition ( see CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having concluded that Mr PERSON , PERSON ORG and PERSON were named PERSON , PERSON and Elikhadjiev PERSON respectively and that they were NORP citizens , the NORP Procurator - ORG agreed to their extradition to GPE . The extradition order expressly stated that it was to be served on the applicants and that it was to be explained to them that an appeal lay before the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( GPE ) . Their lawyers pointed out that the extradition request had not been drawn up using their clients ' real names and that it included photographs of them taken by the NORP authorities during their detention in FAC no . CARDINAL . They complained that the detention orders in respect of their clients , issued on DATE by ORG ( ORG ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , contained no reference to a maximum length of detention and that the applicants ' defence rights had been totally breached in the proceedings which had resulted in those orders . In view of these shortcomings , they sought a refusal of the impugned extradition request . Further , basing their argument on GPE 's failure to ratify Protocol No . CARDINAL to ORG , they concluded that the NORP assurances were scarcely sufficient for the purposes of LAW . They considered that , in order to be satisfactory , these assurances ought to have come from the President of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE this appeal was dismissed . On DATE ORG overturned that decision and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court to which the case had been remitted held that the extradition of PERSON and PERSON was legal . For the first time , it was stated before that court that on DATE and DATE ( DATE according to ORG \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON had been granted refugee status in NORP territory . The Acting Minister for Refugees stated before the court that that status had been granted under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Having established that Mr PERSON had never been deprived of his refugee status in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law , the court concluded that it was impossible to extradite him to GPE . With regard to PERSON , the court noted that , by a decision of DATE , ORG had withdrawn his refugee status , on the basis of a letter from ORG dated DATE and a report from ORG .", "CARDINAL . Basing its decision on an expert report and on explanations provided by the representatives of ORG , the court ruled that it was established that the extradition request from the NORP authorities had been accompanied by photographs of the applicants taken on DATE by the NORP authorities , while those individuals were imprisoned in FAC no . CARDINAL . According to the court , communication of the photographs to the NORP authorities had been justified since it had been necessary in order to identify the persons concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld this decision in so far as it concerned the impossibility of extraditing PERSON . It ordered that Mr PERSON 's extradition be suspended pending completion of the administrative proceedings instigated by him against the decision of CARDINAL DATE to withdraw his refugee status . As to PERSON , ORG noted that his photograph , taken by the NORP authorities , had been sent to the NORP authorities for the purpose of identifying him , but that this had been unsuccessful . Furthermore , the defence submitted a copy of a NORP passport indicating that PERSON was not in fact named either PERSON or PERSON , but PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . At the request of the NORP Procurator - ORG , the NORP authorities had apparently checked the authenticity of this copy and had replied on DATE that such a passport had never been issued . Given those circumstances , ORG considered that PERSON identity had not been established and decided to suspend his extradition ; it sent this part of the case back to PERSON Office for further investigation .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and Mr Magomadov were tried by ORG for illegally crossing the border and were acquitted on DATE on the ground that there was no corpus delicti in their actions . In particular , it was established that both of the applicants had been injured and had been obliged to cross the NORP border in circumstances of \u201c dire necessity \u201d in which they were obliged to evade a confrontation with the NORP armed forces and the siege in which they had been trapped since DATE . ORG found that they had been forced to commit the offence because they had no other option and that \u201c they had naturally considered that what was transgressed [ national security , the border , etc . ] was less important than what was preserved , namely their own lives \u201d . It was noted that the investigating authorities had not questioned the border guards involved and had prosecuted the CARDINAL applicants solely on the basis of their own statements . ORG had examined the border guards , who had stated that , at the point where the applicants had crossed into GPE , the border was not marked , even by a flag , and that as such it was unidentifiable and delimited in an approximate manner by the CARDINAL GPE concerned . They confirmed that , at the material time , the areas adjoining the border , and the border itself , were being shelled by the NORP army and that the applicants had offered no resistance whatsoever in handing over their weapons and had requested asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL . This judgment was upheld on appeal on DATE ; however , PERSON and Mr Magomadov could not be released , since they had been placed in pre - trial detention on DATE in connection with the criminal case arising from acts of violence against ORG employees during TIME ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the same grounds as in the case of Mr PERSON and Mr Magomadov , ORG acquitted Mr PERSON of illegally crossing the border . In particular , it established that Mr PERSON had CARDINAL gunshot wounds on his left forearm when he entered GPE . He had met PERSON and PERSON , who were also escaping from NORP shelling , in the forest . All CARDINAL had sought refuge in the cabin of a NORP shepherd named PERSON . Another group of NORP had also taken shelter there . Having learned from the shepherd that they were already in NORP territory , the escapees had sent their host to request help from the NORP border guards . They had voluntarily handed over their weapons and requested asylum in GPE . Those elements had been confirmed to ORG by the border guards in question ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court also established that Mr PERSON 's arrest had been brought to the attention of the NORP authorities by ORG . After his arrest , Mr PERSON had corrected the name of his father CARDINAL times before it was finally ascertained that he was the son of a certain PERSON . In line with those changes , the NORP authorities had also amended the documents supporting their extradition request in respect of this applicant . The court considered that \u201c the documents submitted by the NORP prosecution service and included in the case file seemed to have been drawn up in a contrived manner with a view to securing the extradition of the individual concerned \u201d . They did not suggest that this individual \u201c had been known to the NORP law - enforcement agencies ... prior to his arrest in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The acquittal was upheld on appeal on DATE . However , Mr PERSON could not be released because he had been placed under investigation in the criminal proceedings arising from acts of violence against ORG employees ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON and PERSON , NORP citizens , were acquitted on charges of carrying , handling and transporting weapons illegally . The other aspect of the case ( illegally crossing the border and infringing customs regulations ) was remitted for additional investigation . Their pre - trial detention was commuted to judicial supervision and they were immediately released . On DATE Mr PERSON was rearrested in the light of the decision of CARDINAL DATE ordering that he be placed in pre - trial detention in connection with the case concerning acts of violence against ORG employees ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON PERSON were also acquitted by ORG of crossing the border illegally . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment and remitted the case for further consideration .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , in the presence of CARDINAL witnesses , PERSON PERSON , investigator , drew up a damage assessment report of cell no . CARDINAL , where CARDINAL applicants had been detained before being removed TIME previously ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Damage was observed : in particular , the furniture had been taken apart and the walls had been damaged . On DATE proceedings were instituted . On DATE PERSON Office submitted a number of objects for analysis , with a view to determining whether they had been part of the furnishings in cell no . DATE . The expert report , dated DATE , identified the following objects : stick - shaped pieces of metal and metal discs , removed by hand from the window - bars and the bunk beds in cell no . CARDINAL ; the foot of the cell ventilator ; pieces of brick removed from the cell walls and placed inside a pair of jeans , the legs of which had been knotted ; a sharpened spoon embedded in a plastic cigarette lighter to make a knife ; a soup spoon , sharpened along CARDINAL side ; and other objects which had been part of the cell and its furnishings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE and DATE the non - extradited applicants , with the exception of PERSON , were charged with premeditated resistance by a group of prisoners involving the use of force against ORG employees , and with refusing to obey lawful orders from prison warders with the intention of prejudicing the proper functioning of the prison . On DATE and DATE the indictments , together with translations into NORP , were served on the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL May CARDINAL Mr PERSON , Mr Magomadov , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were convicted at first instance and were each sentenced to DATE imprisonment . According to the judgment , the prisoners in cell no . CARDINAL had seen on television that \u201c certain NORP \u201d were to be extradited but , not knowing which of them were affected by that measure , they had opposed the prison wardens who tried to remove them from the cell . They were armed with metal objects which had been removed from the bed - frames and plumbing and with projectiles made from pieces of brick wrapped in sheets and clothing . They had caused injury to prison wardens and members of the special forces . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment . On DATE , ruling on an appeal on points of law by the applicants , ORG quashed the appeal judgment and sentenced the applicants to DATE and DATE imprisonment . The period spent in detention since their arrest was counted as part of this sentence . Mr PERSON was released on CARDINAL DATE , PERSON and Mr PERSON on DATE and PERSON PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the same case , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were convicted at first instance and given a DATE prison sentence . As the length of time spent in pre - trial detention was deducted from this sentence , those CARDINAL individuals were released immediately . On DATE ORG overturned that judgment and remitted the case for a fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . Following their release on DATE , PERSON and PERSON PERSON moved in with a relative in GPE ; they were joined by PERSON . On DATE they left the house for an appointment at ORG , but disappeared before ever arriving there . On DATE the NORP media , citing a NORP agency report , announced that the missing men were being held in a NORP prison in the town of ORG , on suspicion of having crossed the NORP border illegally . On DATE PERSON informed ORG and stated that she was anxious about the health of PERSON , who apparently needed an operation on his jaw . She explained that , following their release , the CARDINAL applicants had not left their residence unless accompanied by their representatives . As the latter had assured them that they had nothing to fear in GPE , PERSON and Mr PERSON had dared to venture out alone for the first time on DATE in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG claimed that an investigation by ORG had ascertained that the CARDINAL applicants had disappeared on DATE at TIME They had subsequently been arrested by the NORP authorities near the village of GPE ) for crossing the border illegally . On DATE the NORP Government alleged that the CARDINAL applicants had been arrested in GPE on DATE by ORG on the ground that they were on the list of wanted persons . At the time of his arrest , PERSON had been carrying a false passport in the name of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , under the names of PERSON and PERSON , had been placed under investigation and imprisoned in FAC , pursuant to a decision by ORG ( PERSON ) .

The cells contained CARDINAL prisoners , the number they had been designed for . According to PERSON \u201c prisoner card \u201d , he had been placed under strict surveillance . The applicants had never complained about their conditions of detention . The photographs showed them face on and from the side , and had been taken in CARDINAL different rooms which did not appear to be the same as the cells shown in the above - mentioned photographs .", "CARDINAL . According to medical certificates dated DATE , Mr PERSON was in good health and had no recent injuries . Mr PERSON was suffering from a broken lower jaw , complicated by osteomyelitis .

In DATE they had allegedly crossed illegally into the PERSON region in GPE , with CARDINAL members of the armed group in question . On DATE , surrounded by NORP border guards , the group had opened fire and attacked the guards . CARDINAL NORP soldiers had been killed and several others injured .

ORG submitted that they were unable to provide the ORG with a copy of the judgment of DATE . They claimed that , under LAW adopted by ORG in accordance with ORG recommendations , only the convicted person could obtain a copy of the judgment concerning his or her case . The Government expressed their willingness to cooperate with the ORG , but regretted that , on this occasion , such cooperation was impossible on account of ORG recommendations . They advised the ORG that if it wished to obtain the document in question it should write to the NORP court concerned . The ORG learned from a letter of DATE from ORG that an appeal had been lodged against the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In their submissions of DATE , the ORG gave the ORG to understand that the appeal court had quashed the judgment in question in its entirety ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted to the ORG in GPE photographs of the GPE in town B and of the CARDINAL extradited applicants ' cells , taken on DATE ( Mr PERSON , the fifth applicant , had been released on DATE ) .

On the basis of the authorities to act dated DATE , those applicants , with the exception of Mr PERSON , were also represented by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings in GPE , at which only PERSON and PERSON were present , CARDINAL applicants confirmed that , with the assistance of PERSON and PERSON , they had lodged an application with the ORG against GPE and GPE in order to challenge their extradition and have it stayed . They stated that they wished to pursue their application and continue to be represented by the same lawyers in the proceedings that would ensue before ORG ( or , in some cases , by the lawyers then present in the room ) . As he had only a very basic knowledge of NORP , PERSON , the sixth applicant who was heard , had difficulty in understanding the questions put by the ORG . However , he maintained that he was complaining about his arrest under the NORP name of PERSON , as he was merely a simple NORP shepherd . Mr PERSON confirmed that he had applied to the ORG , that the lawyers present in the room were his representatives and that he wished to pursue his complaint .", "CARDINAL . Five of the applicants who appeared were heard by the ORG in NORP with interpretation into LANGUAGE , one of the ORG 's CARDINAL official languages .

No names having been given , they were unaware of who exactly would be affected by that operation . They had received no prior information or official notification on this matter . The applicants understood that the information gleaned from the television was accurate when , CARDINAL , prison wardens arrived and asked them to leave the cell so that it could be disinfected ( or searched , according to PERSON ) . The applicants categorically refused to comply , with the result that the prison governor named CARDINAL individuals and asked them to leave the cell . In response , the applicants asked that nothing be done until daybreak and that their lawyers be summoned ; this request was refused . CARDINAL hooded members from ORG special forces then entered the cell and removed the applicants one by one . They used truncheons and applied electric shocks . The applicants were beaten as they lay on the floor in the corridor . The CARDINAL applicants affected by the extradition order were immediately removed and the others were placed in solitary confinement . Around TIME Mr PERSON , the fifth applicant against whom an extradition order had been issued , was transferred directly from the prison infirmary .", "CARDINAL . All of the applicants heard claimed that they had put up only verbal resistance to leaving the cell .

All of the prisoners were injured more or less seriously . In particular , the applicants referred to broken ribs and a fractured shoulder in some cases , and blood - splattered heads in others . According to Mr PERSON and PERSON PERSON , the applicants who were to be extradited were given the most severe beatings . Mr PERSON , Mr ORG and Mr PERSON had heard that Mr PERSON had died as a result of his injuries . According to Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON must have had a broken spine , since he was no longer able to walk and was dragged along the corridor by CARDINAL members of the special troops . He also appeared to have an eye turned inside out . According to PERSON , the photograph of PERSON allegedly taken by the NORP authorities after his arrest could have been a copy of an old photograph .", "CARDINAL . Once placed in solitary confinement , the non - extradited applicants were examined by a doctor , who listed each prisoner 's injuries in writing . He merely measured the extent of their bruises with a ruler and did not provide treatment . The applicants did not subsequently receive any other medical care .", "CARDINAL . None of the applicants confirmed that he had been informed by a member of ORG that extradition proceedings were pending against him . They all claimed to have received visits from numerous persons while in prison ( officially assigned lawyers , investigators and prosecutors ) , whose names they did not remember . They remembered having met once , in the absence of their lawyers , a man and a young woman ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) who asked them to sign documents drawn up in NORP ( in NORP , according to Mr PERSON ) , which they refused to do .", "CARDINAL . With the exception of Mr PERSON and PERSON , the applicants all claimed that they had entered GPE in search of refuge from the armed combat in GPE . They denied having been armed when they crossed the border . They had not been arrested at the border , but had voluntarily given themselves up to the NORP border guards , from whom they had sought assistance . The latter had tended to their wounds before calling for a helicopter to transport them to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants confirmed that they had all supplied false names to the NORP authorities . With the exception of Mr PERSON and PERSON PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , they had acted in this way to avoid extradition to GPE and to prevent family members and friends who were still in GPE from being endangered should they ( the applicants ) fall into the hands of the NORP authorities . Mr PERSON alleged that he was weary of DATE of war in GPE and that , if it would put him out of danger , he \u201c [ would ] willingly change not only his name , but also his appearance \u201d . He was convinced that he had escaped extradition on account of his false identity .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON indicated that their officially assigned lawyers ( including PERSON , according to PERSON ) and an investigator from ORG had advised the applicants to say that they were armed when they crossed the border , since this would ensure that they were kept in GPE pending trial . The applicants had followed this advice .", "CARDINAL . The applicants all denied categorically that they had put up any resistance to ORG employees during TIME .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that he was opposed to his extradition to GPE on the ground that \u201c no distinction is made there between peaceful civilians , terrorists and fighters \u201d . When speaking with the representatives of the prosecution service who visited them in prison , he and his fellow prisoners had always expressed their wish not to be extradited to GPE and their fear of being subjected to ill - treatment in that country . They had asked to be tried in GPE . They had had no access to the extradition papers . According to Mr PERSON ( and also Mr PERSON ) , the officially assigned lawyers , the investigator and the representatives of the prosecutor 's office had asked the applicants to tell them their real names so that they could help them avoid extradition . Those who had complied had been extradited immediately .", "CARDINAL . Prior to his arrest , in DATE , Mr PERSON had , he claimed , attempted unsuccessfully to obtain refugee status in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON claimed that he was NORP ( of PERSON origin ) and was a shepherd in the area bordering GPE . When the region was being shelled by the NORP armed forces in DATE , he had met CARDINAL injured NORP who were fleeing . He had descended the mountain slopes on the border with them and taken them to a shepherds ' hut . He himself had sustained a head injury that night . He repeatedly claimed not to have clear memories of the events in question on account of this injury .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON explained that , since he had no money , he had given the NORP authorities and doctors a false NORP name in order to pass for a fugitive and thus receive free medical care . He did not believe that his NORP nationality represented an obstacle to extradition and considered that he was still in danger on account of his NORP origins . In a letter sent to ORG on DATE , he alleged that , during TIME , the applicants had asked to see their lawyers before leaving the cell as requested . The prison governor had replied that \u201c neither lawyer nor investigator \u201d would turn up and that \u201c [ they should ] leave the cell voluntarily before [ he used ] force \u201d . In the same letter PERSON PERSON also claimed that Mr PERSON had received a violent blow to the head and that CARDINAL of his eyes had practically come out of its socket . He had seen him for the last time when a member of the special troops \u201c was dragging him along the corridor like a corpse \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that , shortly after his arrest , \u201c extradition started to be mentioned \u201d . The applicant , who was afraid of being tortured in GPE , had signed papers , the content of which he could not remember , in the hope of being tried in GPE and avoiding extradition . In certain cases the applicants had allegedly been threatened with extradition if they refused to sign . After DATE he had written to the NORP President asking him not to authorise his extradition ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He admitted that he was still afraid of extradition and that he lived in a state of uncertainty . At the initial stage of the proceedings before the ORG , this applicant claimed that he could not return to GPE on account of the \u201c genocide of the NORP people \u201d being perpetrated \u201c by GPE throughout the country \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON did not recognise the explanatory statement of CARDINAL DATE which , according to PERSON , he had refused to sign ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Magomadov claimed that he did not know on which side of the border he had been injured , since the border line was not marked in the area in question ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . After being knocked out by a shell wound to the head , he had been carried by his comrades . A NORP general had arrived by helicopter and had introduced himself as commandant of the border troops . He had promised the applicants that he would report the facts to the NORP President in person and that they would be given refugee status . The general had previously given orders to the effect that the applicants were to receive hospital treatment .", "CARDINAL . During the meeting with a man and young woman from ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the applicants had been asked to sign documents without being informed of their contents . All of the non - extradited applicants had met those individuals , but in small groups . Mr Magomadov himself had been brought before the CARDINAL members of the prosecution service in the company of GPE ( PERSON alias PERSON ) and PERSON ( PERSON alias PERSON ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Mr Magomadov claimed that he still feared extradition .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON claimed that he had held refugee status in GPE since DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and had been granted this status in the Akhmeta region , which bordered GPE . He had then left legally for GPE , travelling via GPE ( GPE ) , in the hope of bringing his family to GPE . Once in GPE , he had begun looking for a family member who had been missing for DATE , and had arrived in the GPE . There , he had witnessed armed combat between the NORP federal army and the NORP fighters , who had been surrounded on DATE . GPE had been the only way out . He had received a shrapnel wound to the leg but had nonetheless walked as far as the NORP border , which he had crossed on DATE . He had requested asylum from the NORP soldiers who arrived on the scene by helicopter . He had been hospitalised and operated on in GPE , then transferred to a prison infirmary DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that in DATE he had been wounded while watching his flock in pastureland near the border . He did not know whether he had been wounded by NORP , NORP or NORP . After being taken to GPE , he was treated in the prison infirmary , where he was detained for DATE . He was informed that he had been arrested because he was carrying weapons . He claimed that he had not been imprisoned \u201c with a weapon , but with a quilted jacket and shepherd 's boots \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON confirmed that he had been in the same infirmary ward as Mr PERSON , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL extradited applicants . He did not mention a television set or other information source that would have enabled Mr PERSON to learn , as the other extradited applicants had , that he was likely to be handed over to the NORP authorities in the very near future . At TIME on DATE Mr PERSON had been taken away , after getting up and following the members of the hospital staff without a word . Masked men were waiting for him in the hospital courtyard . During their stay in the infirmary , Mr PERSON had frequently asked PERSON to cut out his tongue , arguing that this would help him to endure questioning more easily if he were extradited . PERSON had firmly refused to do so .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON claimed that he had not assumed a false name of his own volition . Having been taken to hospital in a serious condition , he learned on recovering consciousness that he was being referred to as PERSON PERSON . At first he had been happy to receive free medical treatment on the strength of this name , but had then rapidly challenged this identity in the infirmary and subsequently before a judge .", "CARDINAL . The ORG heard Mr PERSON , in - house inspector at FAC no . CARDINAL ( who was on duty on TIME ) , PERSON , employee of ORG ( who was also on duty that night ) , PERSON , chief inspector of ORG service responsible for transporting foreign nationals , and Mr PERSON , employee of ORG , and head of security at Prison no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Those individuals all said that they had not been officially informed of the applicants ' imminent extradition and that they had learned later , on TIME DATE , that CARDINAL NORP prisoners were to be extradited . Mr GPE and PERSON alleged that , as they had been on duty , they were unable to watch television to keep themselves informed . According to PERSON , only the prison governor , his deputies and the head of the prison secretariat ( special division ) had been informed of the applicants ' imminent transfer . He had learned from the media that CARDINAL NORP prisoners were to be extradited , but none of the prison staff had been told their names .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned persons confirmed that CARDINAL or CARDINAL NORP prisoners were held in the same cell . According to Mr PERSON , the decision to keep these prisoners together had been based on their religious convictions , so that they would not be hindered in carrying out their daily rites .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , the above - mentioned prison staff were informed that a loud noise was coming from cell no . CARDINAL . Mr PERSON instructed a warden to find out what was happening . The latter looked through the peephole in the cell door and saw that the prisoners were dismantling beds and shouting in a foreign language . According to Mr PERSON , after a certain period the warden was no longer able to observe what was going on , as the prisoners had covered over the peephole from the inside . Mr PERSON submitted a written report on the situation to the prison governor , who was still in his office . At the latter 's request , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON , accompanied by other members of staff and the deputy governor , went to the cell to see what was happening . The deputy governor ordered that the cell be opened . According to PERSON , they hoped to talk to the applicants . When the door was opened , they found the cell in chaos , heard shouts and saw that bits of metal and bricks were being thrown in their direction . PERSON shouted an order to close the door quickly . He asked that it be left closed until such time as he had reported the situation to his superiors in ORG . PERSON , who did not understand the reason for such violence , believed that a riot was about to begin and increased the number of wardens on the floor in question .", "CARDINAL . Returning to the prison 's administrative wing , PERSON saw that the director of ORG was already there , together with CARDINAL other people . He was then officially informed that CARDINAL prisoners were to be removed with a view to their extradition . A vehicle was apparently ready in a neighbouring courtyard and the airport authorities had been informed . Accompanied by the director of ORG , the prison governor and their deputies , the wardens again gathered in front of the cell . The prison governor entered first , with CARDINAL sealed files under his arm , CARDINAL for each of the prisoners affected by the extradition order . The others followed him into the cell . According to PERSON , the prisoners were standing on their beds and throwing bowls , plates and other objects at them . The governor informed them that an internal measure was to be implemented in the cell and that the prisoners were to leave it . According to PERSON , the governor mentioned the need to search the room . The prisoners categorically refused to obey and launched a direct attack .", "CARDINAL . NORP The wardens heard by the ORG confirmed that all the applicants were armed with pieces of metal which had been removed from the beds , metal grills which they had removed from the windows and trousers filled with bricks and tied at the end of the legs , which were being used as projectiles .", "CARDINAL . In this connection Mr PERSON explained that Prison no . CARDINAL was housed in a building that had been constructed in DATE , and that the walls were so eroded that bricks could be pulled out by hand . PERSON also stated that the walls were in a state of disrepair and that bricks could be removed using one 's bare hands . Having subsequently participated in drawing up the damage assessment report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , Mr PERSON noted that the cell walls had been damaged and that the metal bed - frames were in several pieces . The water pipe above the sink had apparently been pulled out of the wall .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since the prison governor 's arrival in the cell had led to an open attack , masked members of the special troops , who had previously been posted in the staircase , entered the premises at the governor 's request . Mr PERSON and PERSON considered that the use of special troops had been necessary in view of the scale of the resistance put up by the prisoners . They both agreed that hand - to - hand combat had taken place between the prisoners and members of the special troops . According to Mr GPE , the special troops , who had been placed at the prison administration 's disposal in case of necessity , usually carried a truncheon each and could hardly enter the prison armed in any other way .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON , the applicants had heard rumours about the extradition order from the television . PERSON supposed that they could have kept mobile phones illegally in their cell or could have listened to the radio . In addition , certain neighbouring cells contained television sets and their occupants could have passed on the news to the applicants without difficulty .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON alleged that , on entering the cell behind the prison governor , he had been injured on the elbow and knee by \u201c projectiles \u201d fabricated on the spot by the prisoners ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He nonetheless returned to his office , where the non - extradited prisoners had been taken for a check - up . Mr PERSON observed that all of the applicants were covered in dust , but no one was bleeding . He stated that if Mr Magomadov had had a lacerated ear he would have noticed it ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As he himself had not noted any injury and the applicants had not asked for medical assistance , PERSON had not been required to call a doctor at that point . Since the prisoners who were to be extradited had been led away immediately , he had not seen them again in his office and therefore had not seen Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At the end of his shift , on coming across demonstrators outside the prison , PERSON learned that prisoners had been extradited . Given his position , he had been surprised that the authorities had not informed him so that , as was customary , he could inform the prisoners concerned on DATE prior to their extradition . He explained to the ORG that , under normal circumstances , a written , signed and stamped notification was sent to him by the head of the prison secretariat which managed the prisoners ' personal files ; PERSON role was to check the documents for which he was responsible and to inform the individual concerned of the time of departure , so that he or she would have time to prepare . This procedure had not been followed in the instant case .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE claimed that he had been wounded in the foot by a piece of metal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , that his wound had bled and that he had immediately gone to the prison administration 's LOC for treatment . Although his wound was not serious , it had required treatment for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that , on arriving at the prison , he had learned that the prisoners were refusing to leave their cell , but that no one had explained to him why they were refusing to do so or why they had to be moved . Having followed the prison governor into the cell , he had been injured on the hand ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and had immediately gone downstairs to the infirmary . Other wardens had also been injured and the prison doctor had provided medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON , CARDINAL prisoners , armed with pieces of metal , climbed to the top of the bunk beds when the prison governor entered the cell . CARDINAL of them took aim at Mr PERSON several times , but failed to hit him . A member of the special troops then pushed Mr PERSON out of the way for his own safety . The most violent prisoners had been the CARDINAL individuals whose sealed files the governor had brandished ; CARDINAL other prisoners had attempted unsuccessfully to calm them down .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON considered it likely that , like the ORG employees , the prisoners could have been injured , given the hand - to - hand fighting that had taken place in the cell .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON explained that the special troops were based not far from Prison no . CARDINAL , which they could reach in TIME if they ran . On TIME in question he and CARDINAL of his colleagues had been instructed to defuse the situation in cell no . DATE . Unaware of the reason for the disorder , the group had been positioned in staircases near the cell , from where noise and shouting in a foreign language could be heard . The prison governor had entered the cell , but had returned TIME and asked the troops to intervene . They had complied and had performed their task \u201c after encountering limited resistance \u201d . The prisoners had been armed with pieces of metal and missile - like objects made from trousers containing a solid mass . Mr PERSON stated that he and his colleagues had indeed been wearing masks , in line with the regulations . On the other hand , they had not worn special vests or any other protective equipment . Armed only with rubber truncheons , they had not carried electric batons or other weapons . They had made the prisoners lie down in the corridor and had handed them over to the prison wardens before leaving the building . Mr PERSON had learned from the television that the applicants had been removed from the cell in order to be extradited .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON claimed that he had sustained a small injury ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He denied the allegation that he and his colleagues had beaten the applicants mercilessly and insulted them .", "CARDINAL . The ORG questioned Mr PERSON and PERSON , trainee prosecutors at FAC at the relevant time , Mr P. Mskhiladze , director of international relations at FAC , and Mr PERSON , former NORP Procurator - General .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON explained that , under the supervision of Mr PERSON , his superior , he had been responsible for various tasks in connection with the disputed extraditions . In particular , PERSON had asked him to visit the applicants in prison , to inform them that the issue of their extradition was being examined by ORG and to request explanations concerning their nationality . He had carried out this visit on DATE with his fellow trainee , PERSON , and without the lawyers being present , since \u201c it was not official questioning , but a request for information \u201d . On that date they met CARDINAL applicants .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON had first spoken with PERSON in NORP in a separate room . The latter had provided information orally , but had refused to sign the corresponding document that would provide formal confirmation of his remarks ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On being returned to the room where the other prisoners were being held , PERSON had said something to them in NORP . The prisoners then collectively refused to \u201c provide the required explanations and sign the relevant document \u201d , on the ground that they were not assisted by a lawyer and a NORP interpreter .", "CARDINAL . The document that Mr PERSON had refused to sign was an explanatory statement intended for the Procurator - General . It contained the applicant 's assertions to the effect that he was NORP and had been born in PERSON in DATE ; had arrived in GPE on DATE and been arrested by the NORP authorities ; had been held for DATE in ORG investigation prison then transferred to Prison no . CARDINAL in GPE ; and had been informed at the time of his arrest that he had been arrested for crossing the border illegally . The following sentence can be read at the bottom of this piece of paper : \u201c The prisoner refused to sign this document and requested the assistance of a lawyer . \u201d The document had been drawn up by Mr PERSON , trainee prosecutor . According to the TIME of the meeting , signed only by PERSON and PERSON , they had unsuccessfully attempted \u201c to obtain an explanatory statement from the applicant in connection with his extradition \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following this refusal to communicate , PERSON postponed the discussion in order to seek the assistance of an interpreter . Mr PERSON , his superior , arranged with ORG team of investigators ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that , following an interview scheduled for CARDINAL DATE , PERSON would be able to meet the applicants . PERSON thus received an assurance that lawyers and a LANGUAGE - speaking interpreter would be present at the meeting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , accompanied by his colleague PERSON , PERSON went to the prison . He met PERSON , an interpreter hired by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and explained to him that , \u201c on account of an ongoing extradition procedure , [ he wished ] to receive information from the NORP prisoners that would enable their nationality to be established \u201d . The interpreter had translated these remarks , but , since he did not speak NORP , PERSON had been unable to assess the accuracy of the interpretation . In response , the applicants reiterated their refusal to provide information and to sign the corresponding documents , which had been drawn up in NORP . Nonetheless , the documents were read out to them .", "CARDINAL . As the applicants ' representatives had indicated that Mr PERSON 's name did not appear on either of the CARDINAL \u201c visitors ' logs ( citizens , lawyers and investigators ) for Prison no . CARDINAL \u201d covering the periods of DATE to DATE and DATE to DATE respectively , PERSON explained that on DATE and DATE his name had not been entered in those logs but in the prison 's \u201c register of access to the investigation room \u201d . Since prosecutors DATE unlike visitors , lawyers and investigators \u2013 had no need of a pass and could enter the prison on the strength of their professional badge alone , he did not believe that his name could have been entered in the visitors ' log mentioned by the lawyers . By the same token , his name did not appear in the \u201c register of requests to bring a prisoner [ from his or her cell ] \u201d because , on the CARDINAL dates in question , he had joined the applicants in the investigation room , to which they had been conducted at the request of ORG investigators ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON explained that ORG , which was responsible for executing extradition orders , had been informed immediately of the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On the same date PERSON had personally informed the applicants ' domestic lawyers by telephone and , furthermore , had served the written extradition orders on them . PERSON seemed to remember going to the lawyers ' offices for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . NORP According to PERSON , at the material time neither the NORP Code of Criminal Procedure nor any regulatory measure governed the procedure to be followed in lodging an appeal against an extradition order . LAW CARDINAL of the above - mentioned LAW alluded to it only vaguely ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This loophole had been remedied by ORG case - law in the PERSON case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that , given the lawyers ' criticism that neither they nor their clients had been informed of the extradition proceedings and orders , he had contacted Mr PERSON in DATE and had asked him to certify by affidavit that he had indeed gone to the prison on DATE and informed the applicants of the extradition proceedings against them . PERSON produced the affidavit in question before the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON confirmed that she had been responsible for the extradition case in question within FAC . On DATE , together with PERSON , she had met CARDINAL of the applicants in the investigation room of GPE 's Prison no . CARDINAL . Given those CARDINAL individuals ' refusal to cooperate , she and her colleague had decided against asking that the other applicants be brought to them , as originally planned . PERSON and PERSON wished to obtain information about the applicants ' dates and places of birth , and their nationalities . They informed the applicants that they were working on the question of their extradition for ORG and that they were not investigators . The applicants had initially pretended not to speak NORP but had subsequently stated in that language that they did not wish to return to GPE and that some of them had NORP nationality . This conversation took place without a lawyer or an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the fact that her name did not appear in the prison 's visitors ' log , PERSON claimed not to know the procedure for access to the prison , since she had visited it for the first and last time on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Mskhiladze , who was Mr PERSON 's and PERSON hierarchical superior , explained that the NORP Procurator - ORG had not been satisfied with the documents submitted by the NORP authorities in support of the extradition request concerning the applicants ; those documents had been handed over during Mr PERSON 's visit to GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) . Confirming the facts set out in paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL above , PERSON emphasised that the NORP authorities had asked their NORP counterparts for firm assurances concerning the treatment that would await the applicants in the event of extradition . He pointed out that those had not been general assurances , but individual guarantees in respect of each applicant , cited by name in the relevant letters . Given that the assurances had come from the NORP ORG and that the Office had the role of prosecutor during criminal trials in GPE , the NORP authorities had every reason to believe that the death penalty would not be sought in respect of the applicants . They had also taken into account that a moratorium on the death penalty had been in force in GPE since DATE and that the imposition of such a sanction had been prohibited by ORG judgment of DATE . Beset by \u201c certain doubts \u201d , the NORP authorities had required the same type of assurance with regard to inhuman or degrading treatment . It was only after it had obtained satisfactory assurances in that respect that the NORP Procurator - ORG had begun examining the extradition request .", "CARDINAL . Without denying that ORG had sent the NORP authorities photographs of the applicants which had been taken in GPE , PERSON firmly denied that the NORP side had used those photographs in their extradition request or in support of that request . The NORP authorities had indeed submitted the photographs of the applicants which were included with the copies of Form no . CARDINAL ( see the footnote on page CARDINAL above ) . According to PERSON , this was explained by the fact that , at the request of ORG investigation team responsible for examining the illegal border crossing , PERSON Office had submitted a request for assistance in that criminal case to the NORP authorities , in accordance with LAW . The request , accompanied by the applicants ' photographs and fingerprints , was intended to identify the persons concerned and had been drawn up at DATE . Given that the extradition request , supported by photographs of the applicants and other documents , had been submitted on DATE , PERSON did not believe that the CARDINAL sets of photographs could be the same .", "CARDINAL . As to the identification of the extradited applicants , PERSON explained that the NORP investigation orders contained their real names and that the applicants themselves had never contested this . They had also been identified by means of identification procedures in GPE , photographs , identity documents and copies of Form no . CARDINAL , submitted by the NORP authorities . In addition , according to ORG , those individuals did not possess , and had never possessed , NORP nationality . ORG had also indicated that they were not on the refugee list . Thus , the extradition orders of DATE had not resulted from a hasty procedure . For DATE , ORG had meticulously examined the documents showing that the applicants were accused of serious crimes in GPE , were NORP nationals and were protected by firm assurances from the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . Mr Mskhiladze considered that the extradition proceedings had been transparent . At his request , trainee prosecutors who were supervised by him had informed the applicants of the extradition proceedings and had obtained information about their nationality . In addition , the applicants had also been kept informed by the media . PERSON stated that the extradited applicants ' lawyers had consequently been able to rely on Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and to apply to a court at any stage of the proceedings , especially as such an application would have had a suspensive effect on execution of the extradition orders . However , PERSON accepted that he was unaware of instances in which LAW had been used prior to the PERSON case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He pointed out that , following ORG judgment in that case , CARDINAL applicants had been able to challenge the extradition orders issued against them ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the issue of access to the extradition files , Mr PERSON explained that the applicants ' lawyers had asked to inspect the files , but that this had been refused on the ground that the employees of ORG responsible for the case needed to be able to study these files themselves . In any event , according to PERSON , the lawyers would have been able to consult the files only if they had decided to apply to a court against the extradition proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that at TIME on DATE he had personally handed over a copy of the extradition orders DATE issued that day at TIME \u2013 to the relevant individual in ORG , with a view to their execution . He had also informed PERSON and PERSON PERSON , the applicants ' lawyers , of the orders by telephone ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) . As he was unable to contact PERSON , he had asked the latter 's colleagues to inform him . He had then sent the lawyers a letter containing a copy of the orders . PERSON submitted to the ORG a copy of this letter of notification , which also informed the lawyers that they were entitled to apply to a court on behalf of their clients . As he was unable to send the letter by fax on account of electricity problems \u2013 a regular occurrence in GPE \u2013 Mr PERSON instructed PERSON PERSON to leave the letter at the lawyers ' offices ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Since the lawyers were absent , PERSON handed over the envelope to an office employee . The copy of the letter submitted by Mr PERSON has an almost entirely illegible and faded signature , preceded by the words \u201c I confirm receipt on DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr Mskhiladze categorically dismissed the above - named lawyers ' argument that the extradition had taken place in secret . He considered that , since no execution date was indicated on the extradition orders , the lawyers had had sufficient time to apply to a court DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to Mr PERSON 's allegedly alarming condition , PERSON did not rule out the possibility that he had been injured during the incident between the prisoners and special troops and that the journalists had not wished to film him at the airport . In any event , ORG representatives had visited each applicant at the airport . NORP television had subsequently shown Mr PERSON being admitted to prison .", "CARDINAL . Mr Mskhiladze dismissed PERSON argument that the applicants ' detention had been directly linked to the fact of Mr PERSON 's lodging of an extradition request against them .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON said that on DATE Mr PERSON had visited GPE with his deputy , several employees of the NORP ORG and special guards . The main purpose of his visit had been to discuss the alarming situation prevailing in LOC , a NORP valley which bordered GPE . On that occasion he submitted the request for extradition of the applicants and certain supporting documents . Mr PERSON had initially refused this request for the reasons set out in DATE above . Mr PERSON had not contested that decision , but did however ask that the proceedings be expedited .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON , the extradition proceedings were conducted with maximum transparency , given that they were covered by the media and ORG organised regular press conferences on the subject . During the proceedings , firm assurances were obtained from the NORP authorities that the death penalty would not be applied and that the extradited individuals would not be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment and would receive legal assistance . In addition , account had been taken of the fact that a moratorium on capital punishment had been in force in GPE since DATE and that the imposition of that penalty was hardly possible since ORG judgment of DATE . As a Procurator - General himself , PERSON PERSON had had no reason to doubt the credibility of guarantees provided by a member ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Having concluded that the material in his possession enabled him to consent to the extradition of CARDINAL applicants , he had contacted his NORP counterpart , asking him to supervise personally the investigation proceedings in GPE and to ensure that those individuals ' procedural rights were fully respected . He had even telephoned PERSON , NORP Deputy Prosecutor - General responsible for the LOC area , who had given verbal guarantees and reassured him by referring to the assurances already provided in writing .", "CARDINAL . Once it had been decided to extradite the CARDINAL applicants , execution of this measure depended only on the arrival of an aeroplane from GPE . PERSON had instructed PERSON to inform the applicants ' lawyers of the decision immediately . Once informed , the latter could have challenged the extradition before the courts . However , PERSON noted that LAW contained CARDINAL provision on this subject , which was worded in general terms , did not set out either the procedure or the time - limits for lodging an appeal and did not identify the relevant court . He conceded that , given this deficiency in the legislation and the total lack of precedent , the fact that no appeal had been made was not entirely imputable to the lawyers . DATE ( DATE in which ORG came into force in respect of GPE ) and DATE , there had been no instance in GPE of a judicial appeal against an extradition order . Mr PERSON stressed the need to reform NORP legislation in this area .", "CARDINAL . NORP In view of the rumours concerning Mr PERSON 's death , PERSON PERSON had telephoned his NORP colleagues ; Mr Fridinskiy had assured him that the prisoner in question was alive and in good health . He had subsequently called Mr Fridinskiy on a regular basis ; the latter had kept him abreast of progress in the proceedings and had gone so far as to provide very detailed information . This had led Mr PERSON to conclude that Mr Fridinskiy was following the case closely and monitoring the applicants ' situation , as he had promised . In conclusion , PERSON maintained that , had the NORP authorities wished to subject the applicants to arbitrary extradition , they would have handed them over on DATE to Mr PERSON , who had been accompanied by a special unit for that very purpose ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , an employee of ORG , had led a team of investigators in the proceedings against the applicants for crossing the border illegally . He had personally dealt with the cases of PERSON PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON , Mr Magomadov , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON . Of those , only Mr PERSON had been in possession of a NORP passport ; this document stated that he was named PERSON , was a NORP national and had been born on CARDINAL DATE . The identity of the other applicants listed above had initially been established on the basis of their own statements . Subsequently , a request for assistance in criminal matters was sent to the NORP authorities through ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The \u201c reports on identification by a third party using photographs \u201d , the statements by the applicants ' neighbours and close family , as well as other documents provided by the NORP authorities , had made it possible to establish that PERSON was PERSON , that PERSON was called PERSON , that PERSON PERSON was called PERSON , that PERSON PERSON was PERSON and that PERSON PERSON was named PERSON .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the secrecy surrounding their real identity , the applicants told the investigator they were afraid that their relatives and friends left behind in GPE would be persecuted . They had confessed to being armed when they crossed the NORP border and had cooperated during the investigation . They had not explicitly referred to their fear , but had stated on several occasions that they did not wish to be extradited to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigation had been conducted in NORP with assistance from Mr PERSON , an interpreter hired from time to time under contract . The applicants all spoke LANGUAGE very well and , with the exception of the investigation interviews , had spoken with the investigator in that language .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON explained that CARDINAL day he had been in the investigation room in Prison no . CARDINAL with the interpreter and the lawyers for the applicants for whose cases he was responsible . The other investigators from his team were working with other applicants in neighbouring rooms . The interpreter was helping each of the investigators in turn . On leaving the room , he had met PERSON , accompanied by a colleague , who had explained to him that a request to extradite the applicants was being examined by ORG and that he needed to obtain information about their nationality . Mr PERSON had replied that it was not his task to instruct the interpreter or the lawyers to assist the prosecutor in that task . He had advised him to make arrangements directly with them .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON confirmed that , unlike investigators , prosecutors did not require a pass and could enter prisons with their badges .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , a student of international law , confirmed that he had been hired as an interpreter by ORG investigation team . He stated that he had met PERSON at Prison no . CARDINAL on CARDINAL occasion , namely DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE , while he was in an investigation room with CARDINAL or CARDINAL NORP prisoners , PERSON , accompanied by a female colleague , had informed him that he represented the Procurator - ORG . He had explained to him in NORP that this was an extradition case and that he required information about the nationality of the prisoners in question ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . PERSON had also asked him where he had learned to speak NORP and NORP so well . Considering that their conversation so far had been introductory , Mr PERSON had asked the prosecutor what specifically he wanted interpreted for the prisoners . Mr PERSON had then asked him if the applicants were willing to provide the information necessary to establish their nationality . The interpreter had translated this question into NORP . The prisoners had replied that they refused to provide any information on that subject . PERSON had left immediately on hearing the interpretation of that reply .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lawyers had not been present during this discussion and the prosecutor had not held any individual meetings with the applicants . Mr PERSON had merely asked Mr PERSON to put the above question to the prisoners and had left the room following their refusal to answer . He had not handed over any documents . Mr PERSON had provided Mr PERSON with a strictly CARDINAL - off service on the date in question , CARDINAL that was not governed by any contractual or friendly relationship .", "CARDINAL . During the investigation , the applicants referred to extradition proceedings several times among themselves , in NORP ; according to PERSON PERSON , the very expression made them afraid . Those discussions had always been marked by doubts and suppositions . At a meeting prior to CARDINAL DATE , PERSON had asked the applicants about their wishes and whether they needed to see a doctor . The applicants had replied that the only thing they wished was not to be extradited . They explained that they watched television in their cell and had heard rumours that they might be extradited to GPE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the affidavit of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , Mr PERSON explained that following their meeting on DATE , PERSON had visited him at home and asked him to swear before a notary that he had met the applicants in PERSON presence and that they had refused to take part in discussions . Mr PERSON apparently needed this statement on account of problems with his superiors .", "CARDINAL . In the affidavit in question , entitled \u201c Statement for the Deputy Minister of ORG \u201d and handwritten by PERSON , he stated :", "\u201c On DATE , at FAC no .
