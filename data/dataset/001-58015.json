Moreover , the children reveal certain details to him which even the mother has not mentioned and which her children manifestly can not have invented .

It is already clear that the immediate effect of access is that the children are extremely upset and disorientated ; after DATE spent with their father , they present as anxious and aggressive . If these visits continue , we fear that both children may develop problems , in the nature of mental illness in the case of the elder and , in the case of the younger , a tendency to regress , with arrested development .

Professor [ MA ] concluded : \u2018 The CARDINAL children confirm , independently of each other , the various types of sexual abuse which have been inflicted on PERSON Could the mother have coached the children in these stories ? Professor [ MA ] says \u2018 DATE \u2019s version of events always coincides with his mother \u2019s . I see this in itself as an indication that DATE \u2019s story reflects real experiences .

Equally remarkable are the X family \u2019s efforts in support of apartheid . CARDINAL of the members of the family was even a founder of the pro - NORP club GPE .

The least that can be said is that PERSON has been misinformed ( indeed , it has since gone back on its first article ) . What exactly is the truth ?", "CARDINAL court - appointed experts , Dr [ PERSON ] , Dr [ MJ ] and Dr [ MK ] , had PERSON and DATE for observation during DATE at the Algemeen Kinderziekenhuis Antwerpen ( \" the ORG \" [ a paediatric hospital ] ) . Their report is not yet ready and therefore has certainly not yet been filed . ORG judge and the parties have nothing in writing from them . ORG judge [ YL ] has therefore rushed a decision through even before the experts\u2019 report is finished . This procedure in itself appears extremely suspect . But what is worse is that it leaves the mother completely defenceless . Since there is nothing official on paper , she can not appeal against ORG judge \u2019s decision .", "Secondly , contrary to what is suggested , the CARDINAL doctors referred to are not independent experts . Dr [ MJ ] and Dr [ MK ] work under Dr [ ORG ] at the ORG . It is therefore difficult for them to challenge their superior \u2019s findings . At the ORG these CARDINAL doctors are not known for being the kind to put a spoke in their boss \u2019s wheel .", "Thirdly , there is the question whether it was advisable to put Dr [ ORG ] in charge of the team of experts . We do not wish to prejudge the report before knowing what it contains , but is it not singularly unfortunate that a person belonging to the same ideological camp as the extreme - right - wing notary should have been appointed in this case , which is already so politicised ? Dr [ PERSON ] is married to the daughter of [ ZH ] , who was a governor during the war . Readers will also remember that PERSON family has a very close relationship with \u2018 ORG circles . Dr [ ORG ] also boasts , in front of hospital staff , that he supports the apartheid regime in GPE , just like PERSON family . This is the same Dr [ PERSON ] who , some time ago , treated a maladjusted child by enrolling him in the extreme - right - wing Vlaams PERSON ( ORG ) , just to teach him some discipline . Everyone is entitled to their political opinions , but in this sensitive case it would have been reassuring to see a less politically charged expert appointed .", "Just as inexplicable is the fact that ORG judge [ YL ] keeps PERSON ] on as ORG officer attached to the court . Judge [ YL ] has to rely very considerably on the child protection officer for all her information , and therefore also for her view of the case ; yet we have already disclosed that PERSON knows PERSON ] well . Moreover , that fact appears in an interview record dated DATE . In this interview the notary repeatedly cites PERSON ] as one of the people whom the courts can ask to testify to his basic kindheartedness . Is it really impossible to remove from this case everyone who has ideological or friendship ties with the PERSON family ?", "...", "How does the notary defend himself against his children \u2019s accusation that in DATE he beat PERSON with \u2018 a spiked PERSON ? In a very confused way . It emerges from a transcript of the children \u2019s story and a bailiff \u2019s report that he beat PERSON on DATE That day , the notary and his little boys were visiting Dr [ MJ ] . In the presence of his father , PERSON told the doctor some very compromising things about him . As soon as they got home , the father started beating PERSON . DATE , the notary went to see Dr [ MJ ] on his own and , strangely , said not a word about his son \u2019s injuries . It was not until DATE , when the photographs were sent to the relevant authorities , that he came up with a story about PERSON having fallen downstairs . Why did he not say this at the outset ? The children confirm to Professor [ MC ] that PERSON was beaten and that he did not fall downstairs at all . So the notary changes tack . On DATE he calls in a bailiff who is a friend of his and who draws up a report according to which the children deny everything . Strangely , it is not the bailiff but the father himself who questions his little boys . So this report is worthless .", "On DATE the notary comes up with yet another idea . A Dr [ ML ] issues a certificate stating that he can find no injuries . Which is quite possible , since DATE have gone by in the meantime . Why does the notary have the fact that there are no injuries certified DATE , when he originally stated that the injuries were caused by a fall downstairs ?", "The latest version is that Jan hit PERSON . This figment of the imagination comes from ORG judge herself . There \u2019s bias for you .", "...", "The ill - treatment which occurred in DATE was not an isolated incident ( as we have already indicated on several occasions ) . As early as DATE Dr [ MG ] sent the following results of his examination of CARDINAL smear tests to a forensic medical examiner , Dr [ PERSON ] : \u2018 Apart from amorphous matter , epithelial and mucous cells , I observed , in CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL samples , a structure with a triangular head on a long , more or less straight tail , which matches the description of spermatozoa . I observed the presence of CARDINAL such structure in CARDINAL of the CARDINAL samples , and QUANTITY in the third.\u2019 Other doctors also made the same findings . Subsequently , Professor [ MA ] and the court expert [ ORG ] reach the conclusion , independently of each other , that PERSON and PERSON have been sexually and physically abused . The latest report is by Professor [ MC ] . In order to supplement an earlier report , this expert examined the children on CARDINAL occasions DATE and CARDINAL May CARDINAL - the elder without his mother present , PERSON normally in his mother \u2019s presence because at the beginning it was practically impossible to examine him without her . As Director of \u2018 Kind en Gezin in Nood\u2019 [ \u2018 Children and Families in Need\u2019 ] , CARDINAL of the departments of PERSON [ ORG ] , Professor [ MC ] is one of the principal authorities in the field . In order to remain entirely uninfluenced in his work , he expressly decided to refuse any form of payment . His report contains the most horrific findings . According to it , the children have been beaten not once but several times with a spiked cudgel . This abuse is , moreover , inflicted as a form of ritual . Candles are lit ; sometimes , the father wears a brown uniform and the cudgel has a \u2018 sign of the devil\u2019 on it . Through the children , Professor [ MC ] was also able to discover where the father took his inspiration from . He found the sign of the devil in Volume I of ORG ( \u2018 ORG ) ( ! ) , entitled ORG barst in de Ronde Tafel ( \u2018 The cleft in the Round Table\u2019 ) . The sign is accompanied by the following text : \u2018 This is the symbol of ORG , an unknown magician and Grand Master of Black Magic ! Even before the Round Table was created , he went away and no one knows where he is DATE ! He devotes his exceptional knowledge and power to everything that is evil and negative ! His sole objective is to sow confusion and destruction . He is a symbol of the violence which reigns in these times over humanity and justice!\u2019", "Professor [ MC ] does not mince his words in his report : \u2018 By way of conclusion , it can be said that PERSON is the victim of repeated sexual and physical abuse and that his brother PERSON is subjected to the same abuse to a lesser degree but , under very strong psychological pressure , is becoming increasingly psychologically disturbed , hence the drop in his school marks and the occasional inconsistencies in what he says in different interviews . In the interests of both children a court order should be made immediately to remove them completely and permanently from their father \u2019s orbit . Any further delay would be medically unjustifiable.\u2019", "Appended to the professor \u2019s CARDINAL reports are very precise descriptions of the children \u2019s injuries , the statements made by the children , sinister drawings by PERSON and DATE of sex scenes with their father ( often represented with horns ) , and photographs . Both reports are in the hands of the experts [ ORG ] , [ MJ ] and [ MK ] . Judge [ YL ] also has them . Just as she has Professor [ MA ] \u2019s CARDINAL reports and the report by the court expert [ ORG ] . How can PERSON [ YL ] maintain that there is no evidence ? Do the children have to be beaten or raped before her eyes before she believes it ?", "...", "Similar accusations by the children against their father were also subsequently recorded by Professor [ MA ] , the court expert [ ORG ] , the CARDINAL detective sergeants [ ORG ] and [ ZG ] in the presence of PERSON \u2019s schoolteacher , and , lastly , Professor [ MC ] . On the other hand , there is CARDINAL retraction of the statements in an interview ( of which there is only a single , confused minute on tape ) carried out by Detective Sergeant [ ZJ ] , since suspended , who intimidated DATE with a weapon ; CARDINAL in an interview with Detective Sergeants [ FAC ] and [ ZG ] , at the end of which Jan broke down completely ( as PERSON happened to witness ) ; and CARDINAL retraction made by DATE to Professor [ MC ] , in his father \u2019s presence .", "The crucial question remains : is any mother capable of inventing all this ? Even more to the point , would CARDINAL young children - they will be CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively this DATE - be capable of keeping up their accusations for over DATE if those accusations had been invented and forced on them by their mother ? And when could the mother have coached her children in accusations such as these ?", "It should not be forgotten that since DATE the notary has had custody of the children by order of ORG of ORG . For DATE the father has had a great deal more influence over these children than their mother , who has the right to see her children only from time to time - a right of access with which the notary has frequently not complied .", "What is more , if the notary has such a clear conscience , why does he declare war on anyone who puts legal or other obstacles in his path ? Why has he already threatened so many people in connection with this case ? In this article we shall mention only the most recent threats and acts of intimidation .", "...", "The case file also contains the report of an interview Professor [ MA ] had on DATE with ORG [ ORG ] and ORG [ YD ] . We realise how delicate it is to quote from letters that were not intended for publication , but needs must when the devil drives . Professor [ MA ] describes how the interview went : \u2018 After I had discussed my problem and my request , namely that CARDINAL experts should be appointed , I quickly realised that Principal Crown Counsel wished to proceed with the case impartially and without prejudging the issues , but that Mr [ YD ] already had a very clear idea of what should be done - \" The children \u2019s story was made up , perhaps fed to them by the mother , and the children should be entrusted to the care of their grandparents , with the father also being involved in the process . \" Mr [ YD ] brushed aside my request for an expert report rather brusquely . In his view , judges had far more expertise than doctors in this field , and subjecting the children to further expert investigations and interviews could only do them more harm . Principal Crown Counsel was much more balanced in his response and considered that an expert report was indeed called for . Moreover , Principal Crown Counsel expressed serious reservations about Mr [ GPE ] \u2019s suggestion . He said that the children \u2019s paternal grandfather , to whose care Mr [ YD ] proposed entrusting the children , was , and I quote , \" mad \" . At every reception at which he encountered PERSON , he would see PERSON senior explaining , very clearly and without attempting to disguise his meaning , that PERSON should come back to this country . He added that this impression that the grandfather was \" mad \" was shared generally by all the guests at such receptions . And he expressly told PERSON [ YD ] that he would consider it totally unjustified to entrust the children to the care of their paternal grandfather.\u2019", "Despite being in possession of this preliminary information , the GPE courts entrusted the children , at first instance , to the care of the notary under the supervision of his \u2018 mad\u2019 father . In the course of the meeting with Professor [ MA ] , ORG [ ORG ] also cast doubt on the notary \u2019s probity . Professor [ MA ] gave the following evidence in his own defence before ORG [ ORG ] : \u2018 He ( Principal Crown Counsel ) described how PERSON had been made a notary , against the advice of the judicial bodies , on DATE in office of the late Mr [ ZK ] ( then Minister of ORG ) and that , furthermore , in a very short space of time ( a few years ) he had succeeded in transforming an almost defunct practice into one with an official profit of MONEY DATE . He obviously doubted whether a notary could make such an DATE profit by legal and honest means in view of the property crisis at the time , and thought he remembered that PERSON had already been the subject of legal proceedings at the time in connection with his activities as a ORG", "He was right . In DATE the notary was even suspended by ORG . ORG office ( once again ! ) took no account of that penalty . In the meantime a fresh criminal complaint has been lodged against the notary alleging forgery .", "The worst thing is the notary \u2019s publicly expressed NORP sympathies . A statement taken by NORP ORG shows that he calls the genocide of CARDINAL NORP an \u2018 NORP lie\u2019 . At his wedding the notary and his father gave the NORP salute and struck up the \u2018 PERSON at the top of their voices .", "But the notary goes much further . He wants to bring his children up according to PERSON \u2019s principles . That is why they must learn to bear pain and to endure humiliation and fear . PERSON himself described a Hitlerite education :", "\u2018 My educational philosophy is tough . The weak must be beaten and driven out . My \u00e9lite schools will produce young people whom the world will fear . I want young people to be violent , imperious , impassive , cruel . That is what young people should be like . They must be capable of bearing pain . They must not show any weakness or tenderness . Their eyes must shine with the brilliant , free look of a beast of prey . I want my young people to be strong and beautiful ... Then I can build something new.\u2019", "There is little to add . Except to say that it is high time that , in the interests of the children , the medical certificates , the reports and evidence produced by the court expert , the bailiff and the child psychiatrists should at last be taken seriously and that a decision in this case be given on the basis of facts and not on the basis of the influential status of CARDINAL of the parties . Public confidence in the judiciary is at stake . \"", "The article was illustrated with what the applicants described as photos of injuries sustained by \" Wim \" in DATE , CARDINAL drawings said to be by \" Jan \" and another said to be by \" PERSON \" ; it also contained a transcript of part of ORG [ ORG ] \u2019s alleged questioning of \" Jan \" on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the fourth article by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON appeared . It read as follows :", "\" ...", "DATE the GPE and PERSON case took a dramatic legal turn . On an application by ORG [ ORG ] , ORG withdrew the X case from the GPE court and transferred it to the GPE tribunal [ de premi\u00e8re instance ] in the hope that the ORG magistrats would adopt a less biased approach . It is certainly none too soon . The battle between the legal and medical professions in the PERSON and PERSON case had reached a climax . In a final attempt to make the GPE magistrats see reason , CARDINAL eminent experts sent a joint letter to ORG [ ORG ] , declaring on their honour that they were PERCENT convinced that PERSON children were the victims of sexual and physical abuse . The professional competence of these CARDINAL experts can not be questioned - even by the GPE magistrats . They are Professor [ GPE ] ( Professor of Paediatrics at UIA [ ORG ] , Medical Director of the Algemeen Kinderziekenhuis Antwerpen and Director of ORG [ medical reception centre for abused children ] ) ; Professor [ MC ] ( Professor of Paediatrics at Louvain C[atholic ] U[niversity ] , Head of the PERSON [ ORG in PERSON and President of ORG ) ; Professor [ MA ] ( Professor of ORG at ORG ] , PERSON C[atholic ] U[niversity ] , who was appointed by ORG [ ORG ] to study the case ) ; and Dr [ ORG ] ( a child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst , appointed as an expert by the court ) .", "With their letter they enclosed a note listing CARDINAL pieces of evidence , any CARDINAL of which on its own would , in any other case , have led to criminal proceedings or even an arrest . The aim of these scientists was clear . They were seeking from the courts a temporary \u2018 protective measure\u2019 whereby the children would have been admitted to CARDINAL of the CARDINAL [ medical reception centres in GPE for abused children ] pending a final court ruling . There was no response . The relevant magistrats did not react . ORG , however , did - it forbade Professors [ MA ] and [ MC ] to voice their opinions . Yet again the messenger is being shot without anyone listening to the message .", "Politicians also reacted . The ORG Minister , PERSON , asked to see the file and is following the case closely but is powerless to intervene because of the constitutional separation of powers . And the MEPs PERSON , PERSON ... and PERSON ... have laid a draft resolution before ORG requesting a proper investigation and urgent measures to put an end to the children \u2019s dangerous predicament .", "The public are finding the case harder and harder to \u2018 ORG .

The DATE silent demonstrations on the steps of the GPE law courts continue and DATE , during DATE TIME , posters were stuck up all over the centre of town revealing PERSON surname and forename .

The notary PERSON , so called in order to protect the identities of PERSON and DATE , now shows himself in public and is giving interviews , sometimes even accompanied by his children . The fact that his name ( and therefore the names of his little boys ) now appears in the press does not appear to bother him .", "Another consequence is that the media are now breaking several months\u2019 silence , and some editors have really gone off the rails .", "It is very worrying , for example , that certain DATE and DATE newspapers are trying to play down the X case , depicting it as a run - of - the - mill divorce case in which both parties are hurling the most disgusting accusations at each other .

Of course , freedom of expression is sacred . But have we ever pushed PERSON and DATE \u2019s mother into the foreground ? Have we ever published her opinion of the case ? No .
