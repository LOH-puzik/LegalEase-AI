SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Baka", "TEXT": ["The applicant , a NORP citizen born in DATE , is a construction engineer residing in GPE in GPE . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "", "On DATE at CARDINALhCARDINAL TIME the applicant was driving a car in PERSON in GPE when he was stopped by the police . His blood level was checked , disclosing an alcohol level of QUANTITY .", "On DATE ORG of the GPE of GPE ( PERSON ) withdrew the applicant 's driving licence for DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) issued a penal order ( PERSON ) in which it found the applicant guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol . It imposed on him a prison sentence of DATE suspended on probation for DATE as well as a fine of MONEY ( CHF ) . No appeal was filed against this penal order which acquired legal force .", "Against the decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE the applicant filed an appeal in which he complained of the length of the withdrawal of his driving licence . The appeal was dismissed by ORG ( ORG - kommission ) of the GPE of GPE on DATE .", "The applicant filed an administrative law appeal ( PERSON ) with ORG ( PERSON ) in which he complained that he had not had a public hearing as required by LAW , and that the measure imposed on him was excessive . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG considered , with reference to NORP doctrine and practice , that LAW was applicable to the case concerning the withdrawal of a driving licence . Thus , even if the matter had already been decided by the criminal judge , the authorities withdrawing the driving licence were \u201c determining a criminal charge \u201d within the meaning of this provision . According to LAW , the applicant should have had an oral hearing which he did not have . As a result , the ORG quashed the decision of the lower court .", "Proceedings were resumed before ORG . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the President of the Commission informed the applicant of the public hearing ( \u00f6ffentliche Verhandlung ) fixed for DATE in which the applicant would be questioned and the lawyer would have the opportunity to comment on the evidence . A representative of ORG would also have the possibility to speak .", "The applicant 's lawyer replied on DATE that he intended to plead the case fully and not merely to limit himself to comment on the evidence . Any limitation in this respect would contradict the purpose of an oral hearing .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE the President of ORG informed the applicant 's lawyer as follows :", "\u201c In reply to your letter of CARDINAL DATE I can inform you that on DATE there shall not be a ' trial ' ( ' PERSON ' ) but a public hearing ( \u00f6ffentliche GPE ) of the appellant , based on LAW .", "As a lawyer of the appellant you may be present at the hearing and you may thereafter comment thereupon . If at the hearing new legal issues arise you will have the opportunity to express yourself .", "I would explain this manner of proceeding essentially as follows . The appeals proceedings continue to be in writing ... Despite a public hearing they are not replaced by oral proceedings . It is therefore not admissible to repeat or to add appeal grounds in open court ( an GPE ) . In the present case , the exchange of statements has occurred long ago and the content is known to the court . \u201c", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant 's lawyer replied that the oral hearing should be the same as a trial conducted in criminal proceedings , and that he would speak before the court on his complaint of ne bis in idem .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE the President informed the applicant 's lawyer of a judgment of ORG according to which the principle ne bis in idem was not breached in the applicant 's situation . The letter continued : \u201c it can be left open whether this statement ( ORG ) is admissible in court \u201d .", "The hearing before ORG took place on DATE . The President prepared notes for this hearing which mentioned its conduct and contained prepared statements for each stage . According to the notes , the applicant was first questioned . The notes continue :", "\u201c I now wish to give the floor to [ the applicant 's lawyer ] . He may comment on the duration of the withdrawal of the licence based on the questioning of the appellant . Actual legal explanations which amount to a repetition of the written appeal statement are not admissible . Thus , the exchange of written statements has been closed , the content of the case - file is known to the court . In this sense I now ask ( the applicant 's lawyer ) to take the floor .", "( To the extent that [ the applicant 's lawyer ] evidently departs from this topic , he must be admonished . Possibly there should be a reproach ( S. CARDINAL of LAW ) if [ the applicant 's lawyer ] continues along the same lines . A disciplinary fine should only be imposed in last resort . )", "..... listen to the statements of [ the applicant 's lawyer ]", "..... at the end thank [ the applicant 's lawyer ] for his statement . \u201d", "A representative of ORG was heard , and the applicant was given the final word .", "On DATE ORG gave its judgment in which it dismissed the applicant 's appeal . The judgment recalled that the applicant had been questioned at the hearing ; that his lawyer had been able to make comments ; that the applicant had been given the final word ; and that the applicant 's lawyer had disagreed with this procedure , requesting a trial corresponding to criminal proceedings .", "The judgment continued that the topic of the appeal was limited in that the administrative authority was bound both factually and legally by the result of the criminal proceedings . As a result , the main topic in the applicant 's case was the length of the withdrawal of the driving licence . With reference to LAW found that the withdrawal of a driving licence resembled in many respects a criminal sanction , but it remained an administrative measure in respect of which written proceedings were in principle called for .", "The judgment then dealt with the applicant 's complaint of ne bis in idem which he had raised in open court and also in his letter of CARDINAL DATE . This principle was not breached as the withdrawal of a driving licence was an administrative measure which was distinct from the penal sanction . Both the criminal and the administrative authority were called upon to consider all sanctions in their entirety when meting out the punishment . The judgment concluded that the applicant could not be acquitted on this ground , \u201c independently thereof whether it was admissible to raise this matter at all in open court \u201d .", "The applicant filed an administrative law appeal in which he complained , inter alia , of a breach of ne bis in idem and that at the hearing his lawyer had on a number of occasions been interrupted and admonished not to make any pleadings .", "The appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . Insofar as the applicant complained that he had not had an oral hearing as required by LAW , the ORG noted that the applicant was heard orally and publicly before ORG , and the applicant 's lawyer was able to comment in court on ne bis in idem . To the extent that the lawyer complained that he had been interrupted when speaking on this matter , he had not claimed that he had been unable to comment on the points relevant for the judgment .", "In respect of the applicant 's complaint of a breach of ne bis in idem , the ORG found that the criminal judge and the administrative authority had different jurisdictions , and this was not called in question by the criminal nature of the withdrawal of the driving licence within the meaning of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
