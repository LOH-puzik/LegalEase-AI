NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by ORG , a law firm based in GPE . The Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant pleaded guilty at ORG to conspiracy to supply drugs . On DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE ORG reduced the sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . Meanwhile , the prosecution applied for confiscation orders under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG judge found that the applicant had benefited from drug trafficking in the sum of MONEY ( \u201c GBP \u201d ) . He was found to have realisable assets in the sum of ORG CARDINAL . A confiscation order was made for the latter sum to be paid within DATE . The applicant paid the order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from prison . He entered a business partnership with his father . The business was successful and the applicant acquired substantial assets .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution subsequently became aware of the value of the applicant \u2019s equity in the business . It applied to ORG for a certificate under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) declaring that the amount that might be realised from the applicant \u2019s assets was greater than it had been at the time when the original confiscation order was made . On DATE ORG issued a certificate under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution subsequently applied to ORG under section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) for an increase in the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order .", "CARDINAL . A hearing took place over a DATE period . Evidence was lodged of the further assets identified . The applicant lodged witness statements and gave oral evidence on oath . He accepted that he had acquired further assets since his release from prison but submitted that he had taken a conscious decision to live an entirely honest , law - abiding and hard - working life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG judge handed down his judgment . He identified CARDINAL issues : the first was a factual question as to the existence and value of further recoverable assets ; the second concerned the exercise of the court \u2019s discretion to order further payment and impose a term of imprisonment in the event of non - compliance . The judge indicated that his assessment of the applicant \u2019s credibility would be a significant factor in both aspects of the case . He declined the prosecution \u2019s invitation to take account of adverse credibility findings made in the context of the earlier confiscation proceedings , explaining that he began on the basis that convicted criminals were able to rehabilitate themselves and to turn from crime . However , taking into consideration the incomplete details of his assets in his first witness statement made in DATE and his subsequent evasiveness when giving oral evidence , the judge concluded that the applicant was not a reliable witness .", "CARDINAL . After considering in some detail the applicant \u2019s assets and business activities , the judge found the applicant to hold realisable assets to the value of GBP QUANTITY . However , he added :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]hat is not , necessarily , the end of the matter . I preface this section by specific remarks about [ the applicant \u2019s ] credibility ... [ PERSON failed , at the outset , to make proper disclosure of his finances . The discovered torn up paper relating to matters in GPE was revealing , particularly with its reference to a few business interests and to not wishing to declare matters . His explanations were risible . Furthermore , despite his protestations of honesty since his release from prison , there was clear evidence of fraudulent dealing with mortgage lenders in the supply of financial information ... I find [ the applicant ] to be an intelligent man , fully aware of all aspects of his business dealings . I find , too , that he has over a period dealt to a large extent in cash , with the specific intention of frustrating any enquiries by Authorities into his financial affairs ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the light of his findings , the judge then turned to consider how to exercise his discretion as to whether the confiscation order should be increased . He explained that had he found the applicant a credible witness , who had set out to lead a law - abiding and responsible life , he might have felt able to give sympathetic consideration to submissions that the court \u2019s discretion should be exercised in his favour . However , he was satisfied that the applicant had lied to the court and had set out quite deliberately to deceive the court as to the truth as to his financial affairs and assets . In the judge \u2019s view , this was entirely the type of case for which statute had provided the opportunity for society to recoup some of the damage caused to it by criminality . The judge also considered the length of time which had elapsed since the applicant \u2019s release from prison but decided that this did not prevent the modification of the confiscation order . He accordingly exercised his discretion to substitute for the GBP CARDINAL originally recoverable the full amount of the benefit previously assessed , namely GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The order was to be paid within DATE , with a period of imprisonment of DATE in the event of non - compliance .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG , contesting the calculation of his assets by ORG judge and seeking a reduction in the recoverable amount . The appeal was dismissed by ORG ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently appealed the decision of ORG to issue a section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) certificate ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He argued that section PERSON ) was not intended to allow confiscation of after - acquired assets ( i.e. assets acquired after the date of conviction ) . If that had been the intention of ORG , the statutory provision should have been unequivocal . He emphasised in particular that other provisions of the DATE LAW set a time - limit of DATE to revisit a confiscation decision , but that no time - limit appeared in section PERSON ) . He contended that the definition of realisable property in section CARDINAL ) of the Act was restricted to property held at the time of the original confiscation proceedings . Finally , he submitted that section CARDINAL no longer had effect after the entry into force of LAW CARDINAL in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was dismissed by ORG ) on DATE . The court held that section DATE applied to assets lawfully acquired post - conviction , referring to the absence of any time limitation in that section . This conclusion was not undermined by the fact that LAW CARDINAL contained clearer provisions on the matter . Finally , the court held that the savings provisions in the relevant commencement order made under LAW clarified that section CARDINAL remained in force for the purposes of the present proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed the DATE judgment to ORG . The agreed statement of facts and issues before ORG identified the issues which had arisen before ORG as follows :", "\u201c i. Whether , having regard to the transitional provisions contained in LAW CARDINAL ( Commencement No . CARDINAL , ORG , Savings and LAW Order DATE ... , section CARDINAL of LAW ( which was repealed by LAW ) was in force at the material time ( \u2018 LAW ) .", "ii . Whether ORG had jurisdiction to issue a certificate under LAW in respect of after - acquired assets ( \u2018 the section QUANTITY", "iii . whether in the Appellant \u2019s case the delay between the making of the confiscation order and the application under LAW amounted to a breach of the Appellant \u2019s right to have his case heard within a reasonable time ( \u2018 the reasonable time issue\u2019 ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It clarified that the issues before ORG were the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Whether section CARDINAL of the DATE Act was in force at the material time .", "CARDINAL . Whether the High Court has jurisdiction to issue a certificate under LAW in respect of after - acquired assets . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s written case included the following argument :", "\u201c C. The Compatibility Issue", "The interpretation of the statute by ORG ... is in conflict with a defendant \u2019s rights under Article CARDINAL ) of the Convention ... For a defendant to be liable in perpetuity to an increased penal sanction is submitted to amount to a clear breach of his right to determination of any criminal charge within a reasonable time , as well as raising issues under LAW ( protection of property ) . The construction of Article PERSON ) contended for by the Appellant is compliant with LAW whereas the interpretation adopted by ORG arguably is not . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the section CARDINAL issue , in particular , the written case included the following statements :", "\u201c The definition of the words \u2018 the amount that might be realised\u2019 in section CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW provide a clear definition of the scope of the legislation . \u201d", "\u201c If , which is not accepted , there is any ambiguity in the words of the statute , an examination of the debates of the PERSON in ORG and ORG and in ORG make it clear that the scope envisaged did not include \u2018 after acquired assets\u2019 . \u201d", "\u201c The Appellant \u2019s case was not that Section PERSON ) was unclear and ambiguous ... To the contrary , it was submitted that the words of the section clearly do not refer to assets acquired after the confiscation order was made . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment . On the question whether section DATE was still in force at the time of the second confiscation proceedings , the court was satisfied that it was .", "CARDINAL . As to the correct interpretation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the justices were divided by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , with the majority finding that the section applied to after - acquired assets and dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal after careful consideration of the legislative framework . Lord PERSON , for the majority , explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . As for the main argument , based on fairness and rehabilitation , naturally I recognise that ORG could have chosen a different policy with regard to after - acquired assets . But it seems to me perfectly understandable that in fact ORG decided ( as indisputably it did when later enacting ORG [ the Proceeds of Crime Act DATE ] ) to leave it open to the courts as a matter of discretion to mulct a defendant of his criminal gains on an ongoing basis irrespective of precisely how and when he came by any increased wealth .", "CARDINAL . That the court does indeed have a discretion in the matter is plain both from the wording of section CARDINAL ) and from a number of authorities ... This is not , however , the occasion to explore the approach to the proper exercise of that discretion DATE or , indeed , the question whether its exercise could ever be affected by considerations arising under LAW DATE . As already noted , there is no challenge here to the exercise of ORG section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) discretion , only to whether the section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) certificate was lawfully issued . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope , in the minority , referred to the general principle of construction that a statute should not be held to take away property rights without compensation unless the intention to do so was expressed in terms which were clear and unambiguous . He was therefore of the view that where assets were subsequently acquired entirely legitimately , it ought not to be assumed that ORG intended their confiscation unless it provided for this in clear terms . While the relevant provision in LAW CARDINAL satisfied this test , Lord Hope considered that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW did not .", "CARDINAL . The applicable legislation at the time was LAW DATE . LAW has now been replaced by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section QUANTITY of the CARDINAL Act allowed for the increase in the value of a confiscation order in certain circumstances . It applied where the amount which a person was ordered to pay by a confiscation order was less than the amount assessed to be the value of his proceeds of drug trafficking . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , if , on an application by a prosecutor , ORG was satisfied that the amount that might be realised was greater than the amount taken into account in making the confiscation order , it had to issue a certificate to that effect , with reasons .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) allowed a prosecutor who obtained a section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) certificate to apply to ORG for an increase in the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order . Upon such an application , the court had discretion to :", "\u201c ( a ) substitute for that amount such amount ( not exceeding the amount assessed as the value referred to in subsection ( CARDINAL ) above ) as appears to the court to be appropriate having regard to the amount now shown to be realisable ; and", "( b ) increase the term of imprisonment or detention fixed in respect of the confiscation order ... if the effect of the substitution is to increase the maximum period applicable in relation to the order ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provided that the amount that might be realised at the time a confiscation order was made was the total of the values at that time of all the realisable property held by the defendant , less the total amount of any obligations having priority , together with the total value of all gifts caught by the LAW . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , \u201c realisable property \u201d meant any property held by the defendant and any property held by a person to whom the defendant had made a gift caught by the LAW .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) incorporates the LAW into GPE law . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that so far as it is possible to do so , legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the LAW rights . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , a person who claims that a public authority has acted in a way which is incompatible with Convention rights may rely on the LAW rights concerned in any legal proceedings . LAW requires a court determining a question which has arisen in connection with a LAW right to take into account the case - law of this Court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
