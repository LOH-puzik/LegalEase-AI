This difficulty becomes acute in cases where torture is inflicted not only with the collusion but through the impotence of the state in controlling the behaviour of its officials .

Reference was made in the Preface to the potential tension between a ORG 's obligation to protect its citizens against terrorist acts and the need to uphold fundamental values . This is well illustrated by the current controversy over the use of ' diplomatic assurances ' in the context of deportation procedures . The prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment encompasses the obligation not to send a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would run a real risk of being subjected to such methods . In order to avoid such a risk in given cases , certain ORG have chosen the route of seeking assurances from the country of destination that the person concerned will not be ill - treated . This practice is far from new , but has come under the spotlight in DATE as GPE have increasingly sought to remove from their territory persons deemed to endanger national security . Fears are growing that the use of diplomatic assurances is in fact circumventing the prohibition of torture and ill - treatment .", "DATE . The seeking of diplomatic assurances from countries with a poor overall record in relation to torture and ill - treatment is giving rise to particular concern . It does not necessarily follow from such a record that someone whose deportation is envisaged personally runs a real risk of being ill - treated in the country concerned ; the specific circumstances of each case have to be taken into account when making that assessment . However , if in fact there would appear to be a risk of ill - treatment , can diplomatic assurances received from the authorities of a country where torture and ill - treatment is widely practised ever offer sufficient protection against that risk ? It has been advanced with some cogency that even assuming those authorities do exercise effective control over the agencies that might take the person concerned into their custody ( which may not always be the case ) , there can be no guarantee that assurances given will be respected in practice . If these countries fail to respect their obligations under international human rights treaties ratified by them , so the argument runs , why should one be confident that they will respect assurances given on a bilateral basis in a particular case ?", "CARDINAL . In response , it has been argued that mechanisms can be devised for the postreturn monitoring of the treatment of a person deported , in the event of his / her being detained . While the ORG retains an open mind on this subject , it has yet to see convincing proposals for an effective and workable mechanism . To have any chance of being effective , such a mechanism would certainly need to incorporate some key guarantees , including the right of independent and suitably qualified persons to visit the individual concerned at any time , without prior notice , and to interview him / her in private in a place of their choosing . The mechanism would also have to offer means of ensuring that immediate remedial action is taken , in the event of it coming to light that assurances given were not being respected . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
