In a letter dated DATE , the President of ORG Court informed the applicant that he could inspect the case file at the secretariat of the court .

The judgment was served on DATE . With regard to the defence based on an alleged violation of LAW of LAW , it concluded :", "\u201c The defence refers to LAW , and in particular to LAW , inasmuch as the court is allegedly called upon to determine civil rights and obligations or a criminal charge . Under that provision , it is said that [ the applicant ] is entitled to a public hearing within a reasonable time . He claims that the proceedings in the present case have exceeded a reasonable time , since DATE elapsed between the registration of the committal order by the public prosecutor 's office at the court on CARDINAL DATE and the letter of CARDINAL DATE from ORG summoning [ the applicant ] to appear on DATE . Accordingly , it is claimed that by reason of the unreasonable length of the proceedings , the offence is time - barred and the proceedings null and void , both under LAW referred to above and LAW CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , as amended .", "The fines imposed pursuant to the LAW DATE by ORG Court did not relate to the determination of civil rights and obligations or of a criminal charge . They are thus outside the scope of the provisions of paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL of the Convention ... The applicant is therefore unable to rely on those provisions of the ORG in support of the contention that the proceedings were defective because the impugned decision was not taken after a public hearing . Consequently , the ORG must apply the final paragraph of LAW of the Law of DATE , as amended , [ L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL ] , which provides that hearings before the court are not held in public .", "For the purposes of the DATE limitation period instituted by LAW DATE , as amended , time ran from the date of the act rendering the perpetrator liable to the application of the penalties laid down by LAW that is to say , DATE until the case was brought before the ORG , in the instant case by committal from ORG on DATE . Thus , the prosecution of the offence ... is not time - barred ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Then , after going through the evidence against the applicant , ORG ) Court found that he had infringed the LAW governing ORG and was liable to the penalties laid down by the statute . In that connection , it found that :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] executed CARDINAL loan agreements in turn in his capacity as NORP ambassador without receiving prior instructions to do so from ORG . Indeed , that ministry was not competent to give such instructions , as , under the terms of the Ordinance of DATE governing ORG , only the Minister of Finance was empowered to enter into borrowing agreements under the general authorities given DATE by ORG . However , by acting within his apparent authority and by contracting an obligation , the ambassador exposed ORG to the risk that it would have to bear any harmful consequences .", "...", "However , the ORG finds that [ the applicant ] was confronted as a matter of urgency with a situation brought about by the wishes of the municipality and ORG to recover possession of the land occupied by the NORP school . Moreover , it was recognised that the school did not have sufficient teaching capacity . The initiative taken by the [ applicant ] meant that the school was able to reopen in satisfactory conditions at the start of DATE in DATE , as was deemed imperative . The central administrative department of ORG was slow to react to correspondence and the various departments failed to act in a coordinated manner . Throughout the period in which the financial arrangements were being put into place [ the applicant ] received encouragement from the minister and from the minister 's private office . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Disciplinary Offences ( Budget and Finance ) ORG found that those circumstances , taken as a whole , entitled the applicant to be exonerated from the imposition of a fine and he was acquitted of the charge .", "CARDINAL .
