Serghides;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He has lived in GPE , a residential district of GPE since DATE . Since DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) has allowed licensed LOC , such as bars , pubs and discotheques , to open in the vicinity of his home . In view of the problems caused by the noise , ORG resolved on DATE not to permit any more licensed LOC to open in the area . However , the resolution was never implemented and new licences were granted . In DATE , ORG carried out a study of the levels of TIME - time noise during DATE on behalf of ORG . It was reported that in the GPE district the noise levels were notably higher to the legally accepted norm .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant became president of the neighbourhood association of his district . In that position , and in an attempt to improve the noise - pollution situation for both himself and his neighbours , he lodged various claims against ORG . He also asked for the withdrawal of the business licences of several establishments . ORG replied that in fact no business activities were being carried out in some of the LOC , and that the business activities carried out in the others could not be considered as producing a high level of noise ( for example bakeries ) . Lastly , the licences had in any case expired in many of the establishments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted the municipal Ordinance on noise and vibrations ( ORG hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . Furthermore , in DATE , at the applicant \u2019s request , the municipality required the pub located in the basement of the applicant \u2019s building to install a noise limiter .", "CARDINAL . Following a resolution of ORG , sitting in plenary session on DATE , which was published in the GPE ORG on DATE , the area in which the applicant lives was designated an \u201c acoustically saturated zone \u201d ( zona ac\u00fasticamente saturada ) .", "CARDINAL . In view of the fact that the levels of noise pollution did not decrease , the applicant decided to replace his windows with double glazing and to install air conditioning in order to alleviate the high temperatures caused by having the windows permanently closed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a preliminary ORG liability claim before ORG , relying on LAW ( right to life and to physical integrity ) and LAW ( right to privacy and inviolability of the home ) of LAW . The applicant asked for compensation for the expenses incurred , as well as for compensation in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . Having received no reply from the authorities ( silencio administrativo negativo ) , the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u201c the High Court \u201d ) on DATE . On DATE ORG issued a resolution denying his preliminary State liability claim . ORG joined the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant provided the court with CARDINAL reports : the first CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE prepared by the municipal service for the environment stated that :", "\u201c Prior to the entry into force of the declaration of an acoustically saturated zone , the levels of disturbance by noise during TIME exceeded QUANTITY , mainly during DATE from TIME .", "... after the declaration [ of the area ] as an acoustically saturated zone and the adoption of some corrective measures the levels of disturbance still exceed [ those permitted for TIME - time ] .", "CARDINAL . The second report was issued on DATE by the same municipal service , which admitted that :", "\u201c ... it must be concluded that ... the limits established in LAW of [ the Ordinance ] are still being exceeded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to sustain his arguments , the applicant also produced an expert report , produced by an applied physics professor , which was joined to his complaint . The report noted as follows :", "\u201c The measured noise on the street and the noise perceived by neighbours in their homes , in the NORP area of GPE DATE which is where the applicant lives DATE rise high total levels of ... QUANTITY ... Those levels are clearly related to the presence of a concentration of the entertainment industry in that area ( pubs and discotheques ) .", "CARDINAL . As a result of this situation , the expert stated that it could be estimated that the sound levels for instance in a front facing bedroom were QUANTITY ( hereinafter ORG ) and sometimes they could even reach CARDINAL ORG . The expert highlighted that ORG had recommended a maximum permitted level at TIME of CARDINAL dBA . Consequently , there was a difference of CARDINAL dBA . However , the expert report pointed out that this was a general estimation and that it was made without measuring the inside of the dwellings concerned .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant produced a medical report stating that he was suffering from anxiety due to the excessive noise inside his flat . The report concluded by considering that there was a relationship of cause - effect between the noise pollution and his psychiatric illness .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , ORG ordered a legal medical expert report by a specialist in preventive medicine . The appointed expert reported that :", "\u201c ... the nocturnal noise altered necessarily the physiological sleep of Mr GPE and his family , [ although it is not ] possible to ascertain the intensity of the disturbance owing to the lack of corresponding sleep studies \u201d .", "\u201c ... the sleep disturbance as a consequence of that noise produced in Mr GPE an \u2018 anxious depressive syndrome reacting to the noise , change in his psychiatric state manifested by irritability with his , anxiety , diminution of intellectual ability and somatization\u2019 \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG maintained that it was not proven that the applicant was suffering the noise level which he claimed in his home , as the environmental noise is perceived differently in each home , according to its height , aspect and other particularities . Furthermore , ORG had been carrying out extensive activities in order to enforce compliance with the legislation on noise . It could not be said that ORG tolerated infractions of that legislation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the complaint . It found that there was no causal connection between the noise pollution and the alleged damage caused to the applicant , since there was no evidence proving that in his particular flat the level of noise pollution exceeded the established limits . Indeed , the applicant had decided to replace his windows without previously asking for a measurement of the noise inside his flat , as provided by LAW . Furthermore , it should be taken into account that the applicant \u2019s flat was on the fourth floor , where the noise would certainly be less intense than on a lower floor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an amparo appeal before ORG , claiming that the ORG had violated his fundamental rights protected by ORG ( equality before the law ) , CARDINAL ( right to life and to physical and moral integrity ) , CARDINAL ( inviolability of the home ) and CARDINAL ( right to a fair trial ) of the Spanish Constitution . This appeal was initially dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the Court \u201d ) delivered a judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALX ) . In the light of this judgment , the public prosecutor lodged an appeal against ORG decision , asking for the admission of the applicant \u2019s amparo appeal . On DATE ORG upheld the public prosecutor \u2019s appeal and declared the amparo appeal admissible . ORG stated that the judgment issued by ORG in the case of PERSON :", "\u201c ... justifie[d ] entirely the reconsideration of the present amparo appeal , in order to ascertain the measure in which it might deal with an analogous case , and to examine whether the objects of analysis of the [ GPE ] Court [ had been ] the same fundamental rights as in this amparo appeal \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG , the public prosecutor claimed that there had been a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW . He argued that the ORG had already addressed this issue in the case of PERSON , which had dealt with the exact same situation suffered by the applicant \u2019s neighbour , and declared that GPE had violated LAW . The prosecutor considered that PERSON and the applicant \u2019s case were similar in terms of the facts as well as in the object and the merits , which was in principle sufficient to deliver a judgment on the merits on the alleged violations of the right to private and family life and to inviolability of the home .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , served on the applicant on DATE , the plenary of ORG dismissed the amparo appeal , arguing that ( CARDINAL ) both cases were not identical , ( CARDINAL ) the applicant had not proved that in his particular case the noise at his flat was above the permitted level , ( CARDINAL ) that ORG had indeed adopted specific measures to reduce noise pollution at the applicant \u2019s neighbourhood and ( CARDINAL ) that he had not proved that his health problems had been directly caused by noise pollution . The judgment was not adopted by unanimity .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL judges out of CARDINAL issued a dissenting opinion holding that there had been a violation of Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . In particular , the dissenting judges argued that the standard employed by ORG to decide when the right to privacy and family life had been infringed should have been based on the case - law of the ORG and that prolonged exposure to a high levels of sound that could be qualified as avoidable and unbearable deserved the protection of the courts , given that it impeded him from living a normal life . They reiterated that according to the judgment delivered in the PERSON case ( cited above ) , the assessment of a violation no longer depended on the evidence provided by the applicant about the seriousness of the noise pollution inside his home . Instead , the decisive element was to be hereafter the location of the house in an excessively noisy area and it would be enough for the applicant to prove the excessive level of noise in the street . Furthermore , the effects of noise on the applicant \u2019s health had been confirmed by the expert report issued in the proceedings before ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
