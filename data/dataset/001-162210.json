Irrespective of the time that has passed since the period at issue , the defendant , who has only recently been informed of the facts of the offences forming the charges against him , if at large is likely to try to contact the [ following ] witnesses ... [ These witnesses ] still feel distress and fear and [ the defendant could ] , in order to minimise his criminal responsibility , directly or indirectly influence their statements and thereby hinder the proper course of the investigation . Therefore , in order to avert the collusion , the investigating judge properly ordered the defendant \u2019s pre - trial detention under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "Furthermore , in view of the manner in which the war crimes against the civilian population under LAW were allegedly committed by the defendant , and which are punishable by DATE imprisonment , the investigating judge correctly found that the circumstances of the offences were particularly grave , warranting pre - trial detention under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . These particularly grave circumstances of the offences concern , in the view of this panel , the manner in which the civilians ... were unlawfully and arbitrarily deprived of their liberty , how their property was confiscated without any legal basis , how they were physically and mentally ill - treated ( often by the use of electric shocks ) and eventually killed ; and the fact that some of these unlawful acts were committed on the basis of the defendant \u2019s orders , while the others he did not prevent although he was aware of them ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge extended the applicant \u2019s detention for a further DATE under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( risk of collusion and gravity of charges ) .

Following the submission of the indictment against the applicant to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of that court extended the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( gravity of charges ) . The relevant part of the decision reads :", "\u201c When assessing whether further extension of the detention is needed under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the panel looked into the facts of the indictment and found that there was a reasonable suspicion that the accused PERSON , in the period between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , as an official and the commander of the reserve unit of ORG , authorised to command his subordinates , ordered the unlawful deprivation of liberty , torture and killing of certain civilians . When he was not present in the field , although aware that his subordinates were acting unlawfully by arbitrarily depriving civilians of their liberty , robbing , ill - treatment , torture , causing physical harm and killing civilians , he did not take the necessary measures to prevent and suppress such unlawful actions , therefore accepting that his subordinates continue with such acts and condoning their consequences .", "...", "Furthermore , the perpetrators \u2013 members of the accused \u2019s unit \u2013 took money and valuables from their victims ( cars , jewellery , household appliances etc . ) and subsequently exposed them to brutal torture , such as electric shocks through an induction telephone , cutting open muscles and wiring open wounds , severe beatings , physical ill - treatment , degrading treatment and locking them in rooms without beds or toilets . In addition , the charges against the accused also concern an incident in which members of the unit under his command killed a DATE girl ORG by firing CARDINAL bullets into her head , together with her mother PERSON , both of whom had been taken away after her father , ORG , had been killed in their doorway in Z.", "Consequently , and bearing in mind the extent of the unlawful actions which there is a reasonable suspicion that the accused committed and in particular the number of victims , which was , according to the facts of the indictment , CARDINAL , all of them civilians , who were brutally tortured , robbed and killed or who have disappeared , the panel finds that the perpetrator acted with extreme cruelty , brutality , persistence and an extraordinary degree of criminal intent .", "All of the above - mentioned circumstances , in the opinion of this panel , represent particularly grave circumstances that overcome the usually grave circumstances pertinent to such offences . Therefore , the detention is necessary under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , upholding the decision of ORG . ORG in particular noted :", "\u201c ... the finding of the first - instance court that the grounds for further detention of the accused under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW still exist is correct .", "The indictment shows a relevant degree of reasonable suspicion that the accused committed the criminal offence under LAW , by which the general statutory condition under LAW has been fulfilled .", "...", "According to the indictment ... the behaviour of the accused , in the view of this second - instance court , significantly surpasses the ordinary circumstances and consequences of such offences , and represents particularly grave circumstances of the offence allegedly committed by the accused which warrant detention under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "In his appeal , the accused alleged that there had been a serious breach of criminal procedure , without specifying his argument . In this regard , the second - instance court was unable to find breaches that should have been examined ex officio .", "The appeal argument of errors of facts is also unfounded , since the first - instance court fully determined the facts and gave detailed , valid and clear reasons for its findings , which this second - instance court fully accepts .", "The accused also relied on the case - law of ORG in its decision ORG of DATE and LAW [ of the LAW ] , arguing that deprivation of liberty before a final judgment is a particularly sensitive issue , and that such detention should not turn into a prison sentence . Thus , [ according to the accused ] it can be ordered only when there is a high probability that guilt will be established and a sentence imposed , in cases where there is a reasonable suspicion that the accused has committed a criminal offence and only for the purposes of the proper conduct of the proceedings , conditions which had not been met in the case at issue .", "Contrary to the appeal arguments , the extension of detention under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW is not contrary to LAW Detention under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW has a preventive purpose , namely the deprivation of liberty of the perpetrators of such serious crimes that , if they would be at large , the reputation of the judiciary and the public \u2019s faith in it would be diminished ; its purpose is not to avert the risk of the proceedings being hindered .", "...", "The poor state of health of the accused does not call into question the reasonableness of his detention , since adequate medical care , bearing in mind that he suffers from a chronic disease , can be offered to him in detention , that is to say in the prison hospital . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the decision of ORG before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) , arguing that ORG had failed to provide relevant and sufficient reasons for his prolonged pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL .
