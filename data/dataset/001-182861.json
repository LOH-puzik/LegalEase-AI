In DATE , the first applicant , via the second applicant , decided to produce the play Stitching for the theatre audiences in GPE , and proceeded to obtain the necessary performance licence from the author and his agent . The relevant authorisation was granted to the first applicant by the author and agent of the production following the payment of a fee .", "CARDINAL .

At the same time , the first applicant entered into a reservation agreement with a theatre for CARDINAL dates DATE and DATE and hired the third , fourth and fifth applicants in connection with the services for such play .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a certificate ( no .

No reasons were provided for the decision . Before ORG submitted a further classification certificate with the same conclusion , also dated DATE , which stated that the classifier was GPE , as well as GPE , DATE and FAC ( the latter names added by means of an asterisk ) . The applicants submitted that they had never received the certificate submitted by the Government . The Government explained that the latter certificate was an internal document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , via the second applicant , sent an email , followed by a telephone call , to the chairperson of ORG enquiring about the decision . No reasons were provided by the chairperson .", "CARDINAL .

The letter contained no reasons and did not list the names of the persons who had been involved in the review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another letter was sent to the first applicant by the chairperson . It enclosed a document dated DATE addressed \u201c to whom it may concern \u201d , which had been deposited with the Commissioner of Police , containing the reasons why the production was banned , namely :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

ORG feels that in this case the envelope has been pushed beyond the limits of public decency . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a judicial protest against the chairperson , in her personal capacity and as Chairperson of the ORG , the Commissioner of Police and the Attorney General claiming that the actions of the ORG were illegal in so far as they constituted a violation of LAW of LAW and LAW . They considered the defendants responsible for any damage suffered .", "CARDINAL . By DATE ( DATE following what had to be the first performance date ) , no reply was received to the mentioned judicial protest . In consequence , the applicants called a press conference explaining the situation , noting that they were adhering to the law but that they were determined to perform the play at some stage .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of the same day , the applicants and their legal counsel were summoned for questioning at ORG . The applicants were sternly warned by a police inspector that they would face immediate arrest if they attempted to stage the play .", "CARDINAL . Rehearsals for the production carried on unabated . According to the applicants CARDINAL persons watched the rehearsals and none of them found the play objectionable .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s decision was not revoked and an invitation to the Chairperson to attend a rehearsal ( as members of ORG sometimes did in connection with other performances ) remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings complaining that they had suffered a breach of LAW . They also claimed damage and redress . Complaining under LAW they claimed that they did not have a fair hearing before ORG in so far as they had no hearing and no possibility to make submissions , nor were any reasons for the decision ever communicated to them . They also relied on the relevant provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of CARDINAL DATE the court rejected a request for the production to be shown behind closed doors to the court and the defendants .", "CARDINAL . During these proceedings the court heard several witnesses which it classified as ( i ) those who acted in the play and had thus read the script and performed it in rehearsals , ( ii ) persons who watched the rehearsals but did not read the script and ( iii ) the defendants who read the script but did not watch the rehearsal .", "CARDINAL . The court heard the applicants , CARDINAL witnesses ( who had watched the rehearsals ) produced by the applicants , namely , TIME a consultant psychiatrist , PERSON an educator , child psychologist and actress , GPE a tourism marketing executive and actor , a priest who was a former film classifier for the Archdiocese of GPE , as well as the author of the play . The latter testified that the play had been performed uninterruptedly in all parts of the world and extensively in LOC , during which time it had collected a number of awards .", "CARDINAL . The author described the play as follows :", "\u201c A couple called PERSON and PERSON , a very normal couple but however a couple who find themselves in relationship difficulties , there have been betrayals , they \u2019re wondering whether to continue with their relationship . PERSON discovers that she is pregnant by PERSON and so a large part of the play is concerned with them discussing whether or not to have the child . Ultimately they decide to have the child but they decide to do so in order to save their relationship , one might say for somewhat impure motives , they feel that having this child will keep them together . However their relationship continues to disintegrate and at CARDINAL point during a fight they are having between themselves when their attention is diverted elsewhere , the child is involved in an accident and then dies . Obviously this is a huge trauma for them and they are driven apart . They come back together again sometime later , maybe DATE and meet and for them their relationship is not quite finished and they come back together in their grief because they are the only other people who understand the depths of their grief . When they come together they can only do so in a perverted fashion , where PERSON actually poses as a prostitute . She wants to make their sexual relationship a matter of commerce in order to distance herself from the emotions .", "What then ensues is a very violent and dark relationship , a kind of a punishment of themselves , confessions of their guilt . Eventually PERSON is tipped into clinical mental illness and performs an act of self - mutilation which she believes will restore her to a virginal state , and that is what finally blows apart their relationship . In a final coda PERSON meets PERSON DATE when she has obviously received treatment for her mental illness and has in fact converted to NORP and both of them decide to go their separate ways . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He further testified as follows :", "\u201c ( Concerning pornographic references ) I would not for instance have used real pornographic pictures . I felt that that would be needlessly offensive for people however another director might chose to do so . ...", "( Concerning women in FAC walking towards death ) it should not be an unfamiliar concept that in their grief that couple confess to thoughts , to feelings that they feel guilty about . The play to some extent is about life and about death . When he talks about masturbating and using as his material pictures of women from FAC , this is something that occurs when he is a small child , this occurs when he is a very young child . He says that it is the first time that he masturbated which would imply that it is reasonably early . At that time of life a young man is completely concerned with procreation , with the creation of life and he understands nothing of death , of mortality . So in fact that is what actually that phrase is about , the fact that he is confessing , he is saying I knew nothing about death , I did not look at the atrocity of life , I saw only the nudity . So it \u2019s actually nothing to do with FAC , it \u2019s to do with sexual urges and it \u2019s to do with him , you know small children do n\u2019t understand FAC .", "( In reply to a court \u2019s question concerning the swearing / blasphemy ( daag\u0127a ) ) well that \u2019s not a concept that ever crossed my mind . I \u2019m not a religious person .", "( Domestic court \u2019s question - Does the script allow the director to put aside certain references to things that could be described by people as hard ? Will the text lose by the director leaving it out ? ) I dare say that a director could remove CARDINAL or CARDINAL swear words but that would all have to be taken on the case by case basis , but largely speaking I would say they would suffer yes because there is a reason why every line is in every one of my plays . There \u2019s a reason for it and I \u2019m happy to stand here and justify them DATE .", "( Domestic court \u2019s question - As far as PERSON is concerned an omission by the director could affect the whole performance ? ) Yes absolutely . \u201d", "CARDINAL . P.M. , a consultant psychiatrist , stated that in his opinion the play was a love story which unfortunately turned very badly . He explained that following the death of their son through their own negligence , the main characters had a relationship based on various fantasies , until the female character became mentally ill . It was a sad story , with however a redeeming feature , in that the CARDINAL finally manage to get back a balance in their life . He testified that there was nothing pornographic in the story and the bad language was in the context of the emotions being felt by the couple .", "CARDINAL . J.S. , a child psychologist , stated that in her opinion the play concerned a tragedy of a couple going through a crisis , which reached its peak when their son had died in an accident . She explained that the couple tried to connect in ways which were not necessarily conventional . She considered that it was a sensitive play that called for a mature audience . In reply to a court \u2019s question concerning a specific part of the text , PERSON replied that she was not shocked because she could not dissociate her female gender from her being a psychologist .", "CARDINAL . The priest ( who saw the rehearsal but did not read the script ) considered that he would have classified it for wise adults ( bil - g\u0127aqal ) . He explained that when a person was suffering she or he \u201c may lose it \u201d and enter into areas which decent people may object to . However , in his view that was the human reality . When CARDINAL was ready to study illnesses and the suffering of people who were going through pain one must be democratic and tolerant and give society the chance to understand those not living normally .", "CARDINAL . GPE ( who saw the rehearsal but did not read the script ) testified that most of the dialogue was between CARDINAL people who had certain hang - ups and inter personal problems , and who in a quest to get closer , nearly started a competition between them as to who was the more outrageous . Nevertheless , in his view , at some point one could tell that they were flirting with each other despite them being outrageous .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant who was performing as PERSON stated that she did not find the play offensive in any way , noting that the emotions were very real and that she felt that it was a love story . She also testified that no pornography was used as props .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also submitted that the script could be purchased and read by any person in GPE , without hindrance .", "CARDINAL . The defendants produced the witness testimony of the members of ORG and other individuals , as explained below .", "CARDINAL . Another priest ( who read the script but did not see the play ) felt that the script was offensive in various parts and dehumanising . He was annoyed by the blasphemous words and the reference to the Moors murderer , and very annoyed at the reference to the Holocaust . Further , he considered that the woman was being put forward as an object , and while it was possible that it was her choice , he thought she was totally subordinate to the man .", "CARDINAL . PERSON ( a member of ORG who only read the script ) had no doubt that it would have been better had they watched the theatrical production . He , however , explained that there were instances , such as the one in the present case , where the script was so objectionable , that he did not feel the need to watch it , since the CARDINAL elements which he objected to ( the words concerning FAC and the passage about PERSON and PERSON ) would always remain objectionable , no matter the way in which they were presented , be it a tragedy or a comedy . They would nonetheless remain offensive to certain sectors of NORP society or indeed society anywhere . While shock was a legitimate theatrical weapon and may be used repeatedly , one could not offend other people \u2019s sensibilities . Both in the case of the holocaust and that of child murders , humanity was at stake , and the relevant passages offended the sense of decency CARDINAL individual should have towards another .", "CARDINAL . D.M. ( a psychologist and member of ORG ) found the script barely credible in so far as it was unlikely that a person would go through so many situations one after the other . While perversions did exist , this couple was being put forward as a normal couple . In his view a normal couple , a couple who went through a normal life experience such as the death of a child , would not react like the characters in the play , who for example , reenacted a killing which had greatly marked GPE . Further the scene concerning FAC desecrated the memory of the persons who suffered .", "CARDINAL . Another witness , a retired Chief Justice and professor of law ( who only read the script ) , examined the play from the point of view of public morals . He considered that certain parts of the play were disgusting , such as that describing FAC , and the blasphemous words . He explained that the word \u201c fuck \u201d combined with the word \u201c God \u201d was unacceptable because it offended public morals , not only that of NORP , but that of CARDINAL the world . Thus , in his view those parts had to be deleted from the play . The parts concerning sex and sexual perversions , such as the part where the male figure wanted to pay the female figure to allow him to do certain things , disgusted him , but he considered that certain people could accept that .", "CARDINAL . J.C. , the member of the board who confirmed on appeal that the play should be banned considered that , apart from other concerns mentioned by other members of the board , it was not justifiable for a couple to do certain things in public just because they were going through a bad patch . It was not acceptable that a woman had to give her vagina to a man to show him she loved him . In his view , if CARDINAL were to make the appropriate deletions to the script , there would be nearly nothing left , and he could not find anything positive about it .", "CARDINAL . The Chairperson of the ORG testified that there were entire scenes which she considered went against morality and were an affront and atrocious attack on human rights and the dignity of the individual . She was shocked and very annoyed by what she considered to be unadulterated pornography where the woman was becoming the man \u2019s absolute slave . She considered that the play in its entirety , and not one scene here and there , was objectionable and offensive . The fact that the play ended with the couple possibly deciding to have a baby , did not suffice to hold that the play had a positive message , given the DATE ( sic ) pages .", "CARDINAL . In an CARDINAL - page judgment of DATE , ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional competence rejected the ORG claims .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the second applicant had no further interest than that of the director of the company , thus it sufficed that the company was an applicant , and he , thus , had no victim status in his own capacity . Nevertheless , the artistic directors as well as the actors were victims of the alleged violation , as persons who were giving life to a script by means of their artistic representation - a theatrical performance which was a form of expression for the purposes of LAW .", "CARDINAL . It rejected the ORG \u2019s objection as to non - exhaustion of ordinary remedies since the ORG complaints concerned mainly issues of a constitutional and conventional nature , and thus were best dealt with by the courts of constitutional jurisdiction . For the purposes of the present case , the applicants were complaining of a human rights violation , and therefore an action for judicial review could not be an effective remedy in so far as it could not award the relevant damage , and could not order that the performance go ahead irrespective of the ban .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits , the court made extensive reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law , in particular PERSON v. the GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and PERSON v. ORG DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) as well as prominent authors in the field of human rights . It considered that the decision of the Board to ban the play had been correct and in accordance with the law and established guidelines . The court , having read the entire script , could not tie the plot which the author wanted to transmit with the means employed to do so . In the court \u2019s view the author did not need to make use of such perversions in order to show the troubled reality of the characters .", "CARDINAL . It considered that the ORG was correct to conclude that the play in its entirety was offensive to NORP society . Indeed the specific scenes referred to , as well as other parts of the play , were an affront to the dignity of the individual , which was an integral part of the civil and moral fabric ( tessut ) of the country . Even in a pluralistic and democratic society , such as the NORP one , human dignity could not be trampled on , even if the aim was \u201c presumably \u201d a genuine one . As problematic as the relationship of the couple might have been , one could not make extensive use of vulgar , obscene and blasphemous language to highlight perversions , vilify ( ikasbar ) the right to life and the right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment , and vilify the respect towards a woman \u2019s dignity . It was not acceptable to publicise uncivil behaviour , which broke the law , debased the suffering of women during the holocaust , portrayed women as the object of sexual satisfaction , as well as ridiculed family life and the responsibilities parents have towards their children . A NORP society , while being tolerant , could not permit its values to be turned on their head in the name of freedom of expression . In the court \u2019s view , the stitching of a vagina as an act of sexual pleasure , bestiality , the depravity arising from the thought of a woman eating another woman \u2019s excrement , the pleasure obtained in raping children , the murder of children and sexual intercourse with parents of violated and murdered children , were unacceptable even in a NORP society . The court noted that under NORP law , blasphemy was a contravention , and a person could not be immune from punishment simply because he or she was acting on stage . The PERSON , the court went on , \u201c was a historical fact where innocent victims underwent unprecedented suffering . Instead of treating this sensitive and delicate subject ... with due respect to the dignity of the victims , the character PERSON shows only sexual depravity ... the author permits the demeaning and humiliation of that tragedy totally out of context and for no other reason than for perversions . No matter how the text of the play is looked at , it runs aground on the reef of the inalienable dignity of the human person , and the court understands that this was the underlying reason for the ORG \u2019s decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court rejected their complaint under LAW basis that the proper procedure had been undertaken , the applicants had been free to put forward their views in their request for reconsideration , which was carried out by another person [ not present at first - instance ] and no bias had been shown .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed the first - instance judgment only in so far as it concerned the merits of their complaints , and asked ORG to confirm the judgment in so far as it related to the second applicant \u2019s victim status . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG confirmed the first - instance judgment and ordered the applicants to pay all costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the first - court had chosen to exercise its jurisdiction and rejected the GPE objection of nonexhaustion of ordinary remedies , which in the absence of an appeal on the matter had become final . Nevertheless , it noted that the applicants had not instituted judicial review proceedings of the administrative action in question ( the ORG \u2019s decision ) ; thus they were not complaining that the ORG \u2019s decision was based on improper motives or irrelevant considerations . Moreover , the ordinary court , \u2019s decision ut sic , and people \u2019s opinions on the play were irrelevant given that the applicants considered the decision to be reasonable .", "CARDINAL . As to the constitutional and conventional complaint raised by the applicants , ORG held that the existence of ORG did not breach any of the applicants\u2019 rights , and indeed the applicants had not impugned the law establishing ORG . It further considered that freedom of expression had limits and that it was accompanied by duties and responsibilities . Both the Convention and the LAW provided for inter alia the protection of morals and the reputation and rights of others , and LAW also included public decency , in the relevant provision .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having read the script , shared the firstinstance court \u2019s view about various scenes of the play . It considered that such scenes all throughout the play affected the morality and decency of the entire production , and it was within the ORG \u2019s competence to assess that in line with the ORG . ORG had no doubt that there were phrases which constituted disparaging and insolent remarks towards CARDINAL belief , towards women and towards the suffering of the NORP in the Second World War .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law , in particular , OttoPremingerInstitut v. GPE ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) it recalled that those who chose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion , \u201c must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith . However , the manner in which religious beliefs and doctrines are opposed or denied is a matter which may engage the responsibility of the ORG , notably its responsibility to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under LAW to the holders of those beliefs and doctrines . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its view the limits of decency had been breached due to the blasphemy which was an offence under NORP law and to the vilification of the dignity of a people , of a woman , of children , and of the human being , as well as the extreme glorification of sexual perversion . These instances were so strong that they affected the play in its entirety and prevailed over any genuine aim presumably intended by the play . The court emphasized that the production despised the dignity of the individual , in particular sectors , such as women and children , whether because of their nationality or religion , and opined that even though the main characters were acting in this way because of tension , pressure and depression , such contempt could not be justified as article In the court \u2019s view while art was a wide concept covering any type of manifestation of expression , it could not include language which was obscene and despised the trauma of a genocide , and which , in itself , was against the laws of the country . For a strong moral message to be portrayed it was possible to cause discomfort and annoy other persons , but not to the extent of insulting them because of their beliefs , their people , or simply because they were a woman or a child .", "CARDINAL . Recalling that it was the duty of the ORG to protect the morality of the country , ORG considered that the ORG had fulfilled its duty . What was morally correct depended on the ORG and the relevant religion , and could not be determined universally . Thus , the fact that the production was performed elsewhere did not mean that it had to also be produced in GPE , particularly in the light of the laws in force in each country . This was precisely why states had latitude in applying certain restrictions on freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . It further noted that under the laws in force , the ORG could ban the play , as opposed to classifying it for a mature audience . In any event it considered that adults , who could chose to watch the play in such a case , would also be deserving of protection , and thus limitations could also be necessary in such cases . It highlighted the ORG duty to preserve the sensitivities of the silent citizen ( as opposed to the vociferous ones , who inundated media forums ) and considered that no remedy after the performance could heal any harm already done to society . Thus , in ORG view the ORG \u2019s decision was correct , was not capricious or exaggerated , and it corresponded to the need to protect public morality in NORP society and the rights of others .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that it was not necessary to watch the play as the script was enough . In the absence of an Article CARDINAL complaint , it was also unnecessary to compare the performance to other performances which had been allowed by ORG . The applicants having refused to make any changes to the text , despite its invitation to do so , ORG confirmed that it would remain banned and that there was no breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In connection with their LAW complaint , ORG held that the applicants did not institute judicial review proceedings and in any event there had been no breach of their rights . Furthermore , in their view there had been no determination of any civil right ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
