The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d or \u201c the Service \u201d ) informed a prosecutor that on DATE an officer at the ORG , PERSON , acting together with the applicant , who had been driving the car , and GPE , had committed a crime of fraud by simulating a car accident and later claiming payment from an insurance company .", "CARDINAL . DATE the prosecutor asked the ORG to open a pre - trial investigation on suspicion of fraud , in accordance with LAW hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( see Relevant Domestic Law below ) .", "DATE the ORG opened the pre - trial investigation on the basis of LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , CARDINAL men , who introduced themselves as officers of the Service , went to the applicant \u2019s workplace , the \u201c LOC \u201d restaurant , in GPE city centre . From then on , the applicant \u2019s and the Government \u2019s versions of events differ .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that the CARDINAL officers had asked her to accompany them and threatened to use restraining measures should she not comply . She had not been allowed to contact anyone by telephone , except for her supervisor . She had then been taken to the ORG car and driven to the GPE headquarters of the ORG . On arrival her handbag had been searched , her mobile telephone had been taken away and the officers had read her text messages . The officers had not returned the telephone to the applicant until DATE . Immediately after the search , the officers had started interrogating the applicant about the circumstances of the car accident of DATE . She had been threatened with loss of reputation , placement in a detention facility , conviction and loss of career opportunities , unless she gave them information necessary for the insurance fraud investigation . The officers had refused the applicant \u2019s request for a lawyer . They had also dismissed her request that a record be made of her questioning , saying that it was for them to decide \u201c what to write down and what not to \u201d . Likewise , the officers refused to explain to the applicant what her procedural status was at that moment .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not dispute that the ORG officers had gone to the applicant \u2019s workplace at TIME on DATE . However , the Government submitted that no force or threats had been used against the applicant ; she had merely been invited to accompany the officers for questioning .", "CARDINAL . According to the report of the applicant \u2019s provisional arrest , she was arrested at TIME . Even though the arrest took place while the applicant was at the FAC headquarters of the ORG , the arrest report specifies that she had been arrested \u201c at GPE international airport \u201d on suspicion of fraud . The report stated that it had been necessary to arrest the applicant because she might flee from the investigators or prosecutor , or commit further offences .", "The officers also made a record of the personal search of the applicant , which stated that the search had been conducted CARDINAL TIME on DATE .", "DATE the applicant was taken to a police detention facility ; her sister had been informed of her arrest .", "CARDINAL . NORP The same day at TIME the ORG arrested GPE and questioned him , as a suspect , about the circumstances surrounding the car accident and the suspected insurance fraud .", "CARDINAL . On DATE from CARDINAL to QUANTITY the ORG tried to question PERSON , as a suspect , about the car accident and insurance fraud , but PERSON refused to give any evidence .", "After further questioning as a suspect on DATE , PERSON testified that the car had been driven by the applicant , but denied any involvement in the insurance fraud .", "CARDINAL . As it transpires from the report of the applicant \u2019s interrogation , on CARDINAL DATE from TIME , the ORG investigator questioned the applicant about the insurance fraud . At that time her procedural status was that of a suspect ; her lawyer was present at the questioning . The applicant refused to testify .", "CARDINAL . DATE at TIME the ORG investigator decided to release the applicant , because \u201c there were no reasons to keep her under arrest \u201d . He noted that the applicant \u201c had been arrested on DATE on the basis of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer complained to ORG that DATE his client had been arrested by the ORG officers in breach of LAW ORG . He also maintained that she \u201c had been questioned before being granted the status of a suspect ( neparei\u0161kus PERSON \u012ftarimo ) and forced to testify \u201d . The lawyer contended that the pre - trial investigation had not been within the ORG \u2019s competence and jurisdiction , as it was related to insurance fraud .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied that the pre - trial investigation had been opened in accordance with the domestic law . The reply did not say that the decision could be appealed against .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the ORG , ORG of ORG , the Attorney General and the Director of the ORG . She stated that on CARDINAL May at TIME , CARDINAL officers of the ORG had gone to her workplace at the \u201c LOC \u201d restaurant in GPE . She had been forced to leave with them , and had been taken to the ORG \u2019s GPE headquarters and questioned about the car accident . The applicant reiterated that the ORG officers had refused to record her questioning , had not explained her rights to her , and had not allowed her to make telephone calls . No one had answered her question whether she could leave ; nor had they explained what her procedural status was at that time . She had been threatened with conviction , placement in a detention facility , and the end of her career unless she agreed to confirm the ORG \u2019s account of the car accident . Relying on LAW , the applicant argued that her right to liberty had been breached . She maintained that the ORG officers had acted in an arbitrary fashion .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG found no flaws or abuse of powers in the actions of the ORG officers and refused to open a pre - trial investigation into their actions . The prosecutor noted that the applicant had been arrested on DATE at \u201c QUANTITY CARDINAL \u201d , as stated in the provisional arrest report . The following day she had been served with notice of suspicion of the crime of fraud and had been questioned as a suspect from TIME Therefore the applicant \u2019s allegation that she had been questioned without a record being drawn up was false . Lastly , the prosecutor held that it was only because of \u201c a technical mistake \u201d that the report of the applicant \u2019s arrest had specified her place of arrest as FAC .", "The decision stipulated that it could be appealed against to an investigating judge . The applicant did not appeal against the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , the applicant lodged complaints with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant \u2019s complaint valid . He noted that under LAW of the ORG investigating officers had the possibility to call a person for questioning orally , without notifying him about it in writing . This could be done , for example , by a telephone call or via family members of the person invited . He stressed that the provision simply referred to the \u201c transfer of a message ( informacijos perdavimas ) \u201d that a person ought to come for questioning . However , in the applicant \u2019s case , on DATE at CARDINAL , the ORG officers had not merely conveyed a message to her , but had in fact taken her in [ by force , atvesdino ] or even arrested her . On this point the ORG also referred to the written reply by the Head of ORG to the effect that the officers who went to the applicant \u2019s workplace had demanded ( buvo pareikalauta ) that she go with them so that she could not contact the other suspects and thereby obstruct the investigation .", "CARDINAL . In the same written reply to the ORG , the Head of ORG also said that once the applicant had been taken to their headquarters , she had told the officers that she knew nothing about the car accident ; accordingly , she had not been questioned as a witness . For the ORG , however , the ORG officers\u2019 actions when trying to find out whether the applicant knew anything about the crime they were investigating had been nothing less than questioning . Such questioning had to be recorded in writing , in accordance with LAW ORG . Given that no record of questioning had been drawn up until TIME , the ORG considered that , until that time , the applicant had been held at the ORG headquarters without a reason , and thus unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted that CARDINAL TIME the applicant had been arrested on suspicion of having committed fraud and on the ground that she might attempt to abscond from the investigation . No sufficiently strong evidence had been submitted to him to justify the applicant \u2019s arrest . Furthermore , the prosecutor in charge of the investigation had not subsequently asked a court to sanction the applicant \u2019s detention . Lastly , for the ORG , there was no reasonable explanation as to why the fraud relating to the car accident should have been investigated by the ORG officers .", "CARDINAL . Whilst conceding that it was not within his competence to assess the validity of the actions taken during the pre - trial investigation , on the basis of above considerations the ORG concluded that the conduct of the ORG investigators had had the sole aim of exerting psychological pressure on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also considered that the actions of the ORG officers had given rise to a suspicion that they had committed a crime . As a result , he notified ORG about the matter . The Minister of the ORG was also to be informed about the episode so that such incidents could be avoided in future .", "CARDINAL . In their reply of DATE to a complaint lodged by the applicant on DATE , the ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s allegations about abuse of power by its officers when arresting her had already been dismissed by the prosecution . The officers who had taken part in the applicant \u2019s arrest and their superiors had nevertheless been urged to take into consideration the ORG \u2019s conclusions and to ensure that similar incidents were not repeated in future .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , criminal proceedings against PERSON for insurance fraud were discontinued because of his death . For the same reason , proceedings against PERSON in respect of other charges pending against him ( for forgery of an official document and smuggling people over the State border ) were also terminated .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE , the pre - trial investigation into the charges of fraud by the applicant was discontinued . The prosecutor noted that the applicant had been notified that she was suspected of the crime on CARDINAL DATE . However , she had refused to testify on those charges . Neither GPE nor ORG had confirmed the applicant \u2019s involvement in the crime . As the applicant and PERSON had been friends , it could be only assumed that she had known about the fraud . Yet , this mere assumption was not sufficient evidence to prove her guilt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vilnius City ORG found that ORG had committed fraud by simulating a car accident on DATE . However , the court relieved GPE of criminal liability as he had fully acknowledged his guilt and settled with the insurance company .", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted civil proceedings for the damage sustained as a result of her allegedly unlawful arrest and questioning . She argued that the ORG officers had exceeded their powers , because it was not within their competence to investigate crimes concerning road accidents . The applicant maintained that by being arrested at her workplace she had been humiliated in front of her colleagues and her reputation had been tarnished . Her arrest had been made public in the newspapers and on television . Her family and friends had learned about it , which had affected her relationship with them . The applicant maintained that on DATE she had been interrogated at the ORG headquarters and forced to incriminate herself . No lawyer had been present , her rights had not been explained to her and she had not been allowed to make a telephone call . She complained that her rights under LAW had been violated and claimed CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL ) for pecuniary damage , LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage and LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL for litigation costs .", "CARDINAL . At ORG hearing on DATE , the applicant \u2019s employer , the manager of the ORG restaurant , testified that on CARDINAL May he had received a telephone call from her . The applicant had explained that she had been arrested because of a car accident . He said that there were \u201c such stereotypes in society that after someone has been arrested , others regard them with considerable suspicion \u201d . CARDINAL waitresses who had been working with the applicant the day \u201c when the applicant was arrested \u201d testified that \u201c the applicant was taken away quickly \u201d , the officers \u201c showed identification of some kind \u201d and \u201c demanded that the applicant went with them \u201d , CARDINAL waitress had seen \u201c how the officers took the applicant with them \u201d . The applicant \u2019s colleagues also testified that the events had surprised them , and , although for DATE they had remained without a supervisor , \u201c there was no panic among the colleagues , but they asked each other what had happened . Everyone was interested to know what had happened \u201d . The applicant \u2019s lawyer maintained that his client had been taken from her workplace by force . He also argued that such actions in front of the applicant \u2019s colleagues had stained her reputation . The applicant had left her job DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims . It found that the applicant had been suspected of having committed fraud and arrested for fear that she would flee from justice or commit new crimes . The ORG officers had jurisdiction in the applicant \u2019s case on the basis of the prosecutor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . The court also referred to the ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-IV ) to the effect that the fact that the applicant \u2019s case had not gone to trial at a later stage did not mean that her arrest during the criminal investigation had been unlawful as such . The prosecutor \u2019s decision to discontinue the pre - trial investigation in respect of the applicant did not mean that the investigative measures had been unlawful , since the pre - trial investigation had been discontinued because of lack of evidence .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court noted that reports of the applicant \u2019s arrest and questioning as a suspect had been made \u201c after the applicant \u2019s arrest \u201d , although the court did not specify the exact time when the arrest had taken place . Moreover , as the applicant had conceded at the hearing , \u201c on DATE of her arrest \u201d she had been allowed to have a lawyer . Lastly , the court noted that the applicant \u2019s claims about her arbitrary arrest and questioning had been dismissed by the prosecutor and the ORG on CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , reiterating her complaint about abuse of powers by the ORG . In the applicant \u2019s view , it was not logical to have her arrested DATE after the car accident . The reason given to justify her arrest and detention \u2013 that she might hide from the investigators \u2013 had been even more preposterous given that there had been no evidence that she intended to flee . She invoked LAW .", "CARDINAL . At ORG hearing of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer argued that his client had been arrested at her workplace and detained for DATE , partly in the ORG \u2019s GPE headquarters . She had been pressured to give evidence against PERSON The ORG officers had acted outside their jurisdiction .", "The representatives of the ORG , which was the defendant in the civil proceedings for damages , maintained that the ORG did have jurisdiction to investigate the crime of insurance fraud . The applicant had been arrested \u201c on CARDINAL May \u201d and charged with fraud \u201c on CARDINAL May \u201d . Above all , they stressed that the applicant had been merely \u201c invited \u201d to accompany the ORG officers when they had arrived at her workplace . No incidents took place at the \u201c LOC \u201d restaurant and the applicant had accompanied the officers calmly .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG concurred with the lower court \u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor \u2019s decision to discontinue criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant did not mean that her arrest had been unlawful as such . Moreover , the proceedings against the applicant had been discontinued because of lack of evidence and not for reasons of rehabilitation . The appellate court noted that the applicant \u2019s complaints that the ORG officers had abused their powers had been dismissed by the prosecutor . That being so , the court nevertheless emphasised that it had competence to hear the applicant \u2019s civil claim for damages , even though she had not appealed against the prosecutor \u2019s decision to drop the criminal charges against the officers . On this point it referred to ORG ruling in civil case no . CARDINALK-CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG also held that \u201c on DATE the applicant had been arrested at QUANTITY \u201d According to the court , the applicant had not been arrested at her workplace ; the officers had merely \u201c invited \u201d her to go with them for questioning , in accordance with LAW of LAW . There was no evidence in the case file that by inviting the applicant for questioning in the manner regulated by the above provision , the ORG officers had breached the law . For the court , \u201c the fact that before arresting her , notifying her of the charges and questioning her as a suspect [ all at TIME ] , the officers had discussed with her the circumstances relating to a pre - trial investigation , without making a record of that conversation , did not disclose any unlawfulness , because a conversation [ between the applicant and the officers ] and questioning were CARDINAL separate notions \u201d . Accordingly , the appellate court dismissed the applicant \u2019s civil claim , which she had based on LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged CARDINAL appeals on points of law , which , on DATE and CARDINAL and DATE , ORG refused to examine as raising only questions of fact and thus giving no grounds for cassation .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of GPE provides that the freedom of a human being is inviolable . No one may be arbitrarily detained or arrested . No one may be deprived of his freedom , except on grounds and according to procedures established by law . A person detained in flagrante delicto must be brought before a court within TIME for the purpose of obtaining a decision , in the presence of the detainee , on the validity of the detention . If the court does not decide that the detainee should be arrested , he or she will be released immediately .", "CARDINAL . NORP In an opinion of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that LAW was in compliance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . DATE LAW provides that a person suspected of committing a crime will be guaranteed , from the moment of his or her detention or first questioning , the right to defend himself and the right to a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides for criminal liability for fraud . The offence is punishable by community service , a fine , restriction of liberty , arrest , or imprisonment for a term of DATE . A pre - trial investigation of the crime of fraud may be started only on the basis of a complaint by a victim or by a prosecutor \u2019s order ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .

A witness has the right to have an audio or video recording made of his testimony . He has the right to read the record of his testimony , make corrections and write his own testimony ( LAW and CARDINAL ) . Anyone called as a witness must testify before the pre - trial investigation officer , failing which he may be fined or arrested ( Articles DATE and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A prosecutor or an investigator may provisionally arrest a person caught in flagrante delicto . Provisional arrest is also possible if there is a reasonable assumption that the person may obstruct the course of justice by influencing other suspects or commit further offences . Provisional arrest may last up to TIME without the authorisation of a judge ( ORG and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

The measure may be documented by audio or video recording or by other means . The record must be drawn up while the investigative measure is being taken ( tyrimo veiksmo metu ) or immediately thereafter . The record must state the place and time of the measure and the persons present . The investigating officer and all those present must sign the record . If the person in respect of whom the measure was taken refuses to sign the record , this must also be noted in the record ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the way in which a person may be called for questioning , LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A person shall be called for questioning by summons .
