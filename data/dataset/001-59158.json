The applicant is a gypsy by birth . Since her birth she has travelled constantly , mainly in the GPE area , with her family in search of work . After marrying her husband , A , DATE , this nomadic way of life continued . They have CARDINAL children , born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and A are illiterate , as , due to their way of life , they have received little , if any , formal education . They regard travelling as detrimental to both the health of their family and to the education of their children . The applicant suffers from depression , her husband from severe gout and several of her children are asthmatic .", "CARDINAL . NORP In pursuit of a more stable existence , the applicant and her husband applied repeatedly throughout DATE for places on many of the local private and official sites in GPE including the official sites in ORG . Their applications proved unsuccessful as all the sites were full with long waiting lists . Consequently , the applicant and her husband had no option but to continue travelling . They were required to move on from roadside to roadside on innumerable occasions . For a period of time they stayed at a private site but when it was redeveloped as an official site , they were forced to move on as no space was available for them . In DATE they stayed on a relative \u2019s site for a period of time but were forced to leave . While the Government have suggested that in fact the applicants owned this land and that it received planning permission , this was denied by the applicant . According to the applicant , the land belonged to her brother . When , following his divorce , the land was ordered to be sold by the court as part of the financial settlement , the applicant had to leave .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant bought land known as ORG , ORG . It was a portion of a garden in a LOC area where there was already some residential development . The applicant moved a mobile home onto the land and took up residence with her family . In a declaration dated DATE the applicant \u2019s uncle , PERSON , a member of ORG and an employee of ORG , stated that he had attempted on numerous occasions prior to DATE to obtain a site on an official site on behalf of the applicant without success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) rejected the applicant \u2019s application to join the waiting list for rented council accommodation on the basis that they had not lived in the borough for a minimum of DATE . The applicant alleged that by this time they had lived for DATE in the Runnymede area , although they had been compelled to move on frequently from place to place .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG had granted a declaration that ORG was in breach of its duty under section CARDINAL of GPE DATE to provide provision for gypsies ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG ex parte Smith [ DATE ] C.O.D. CARDINAL ) . In DATE , the Secretary of ORG issued a direction under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act directing that CARDINAL caravans should be accommodated . However , on CARDINAL DATE , GPE was declared a designated area pursuant to LAW DATE . The area was designated on the basis that it was not expedient for adequate provision to be made for gypsies residing in or resorting to the borough .", "CARDINAL . The previous owner of ORG , also a gypsy , had been refused planning permission in DATE to live on the land in a caravan on the basis that it conflicted with local and national planning policies . The ORG considered that the stationing of a caravan would be detrimental to the character of the Green Belt . An enforcement notice had been issued requiring discontinuance of the unauthorised use . The applicant was aware of this situation and the fact that the previous owner had appealed to the Secretary of ORG for the Environment against the refusal of planning permission and the enforcement order . When the applicant purchased the land , she was advised that there was a special concession for granting planning permission to gypsies in GPE areas under Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Accordingly , she took over the appeal from the previous owner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG was held . An Inspector appointed by ORG heard evidence and representations from the applicant and ORG . By a letter dated DATE , the ORG dismissed the appeal .", "\u201c CARDINAL . The mobile home is situated on an enclosed plot of land fronting FAC , adjacent to No . CARDINAL . This land is separated from the adjacent house by a screen fence , which continues along the rear boundary of the appeal site . The site is contained on its other side boundary by a row of conifer trees . The land has a frontage of QUANTITY to the road , most of which is formed by a hedge . \u2026", "CARDINAL . From my inspection of the site and its surroundings and from the representations made I consider that there are CARDINAL main issues \u2026 Firstly , whether the use of the land as a residential caravan site for a mobile home and associated operational development is appropriate to this part of ORG ; and , if not , secondly , whether there are very special circumstances that would justify the retention of inappropriate development in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On the first issue , the use of land as a residential caravan site is not one of the purposes listed as being appropriate to the green belt in Planning Policy Guidance Note CARDINAL ( NORP ) . However , policy CCARDINAL of the approved PERSON DATE and policy PECARDINAL of \u2026 the Replacement Structure Plan DATE provide that gypsy caravan sites may be appropriate and necessary in the green belt , but they will not be considered acceptable as of right .", "CARDINAL . The appeals site lies within the south west sector of ORG . This section is described as containing valuable green wedges which thrust inwards to the GPE west of Molesey . PERSON is a small settlement located within CARDINAL of these wedges . Given its location within a narrow stretch of generally open countryside between FAC and Chertsey I agree with the council that the appeals site lies within a particularly sensitive part of the green belt .", "CARDINAL . From my own observations I agree \u2026 that FAC comprises CARDINAL distinct parts and that the appeals site lies within the significant gap between LOC and CARDINAL which is predominantly rural in character despite the presence of Nos CARDINAL and CARDINAL . The rustic feel of the locality is enhanced by the woodlands to the rear of < the applicants\u2019 > land and the field on the opposite side \u2026 Notwithstanding the previous use of the land as part of the garden of No . CARDINAL , the unauthorised use and works represent an encroachment of additional development into a predominantly rural locality . It also contributes towards the coalescence of the nearby built up frontages on FAC and thereby the merger of nearby settlements . As a result I consider that the development subject to the appeals conflicts with the second and third objectives of government green belt policy listed in PPGCARDINAL . \u2026", "CARDINAL . Whilst the mobile home is set behind the front of the adjoining house and its range of visibility from the other direction on FAC is limited by conifers on its western boundary , it , and the related operational development is significantly different to the character of the touring caravans that are parked in some of the nearby gardens , which are incidental to the enjoyment of the residential curtilages within which they stand . Notwithstanding the support of some nearby residents , I consider that the discernible presence of the unauthorised development on the appeals site is harmful to the appearance of this mainly rural location . \u2026 In light of this and its particular impact on the aims of green belt policy , I conclude \u2026 that the use of the land for a residential caravan site for a mobile home and associated operational development is not appropriate to this part of FAC .", "CARDINAL . Turning to my second issue , ORG CARDINAL states that it may be necessary to accept the establishment of gypsy caravan sites in green belt areas and that there are advantages in gypsies providing their own sites . However , in designating PERSON under LAW DATE on the grounds of expediency the Secretary of ORG gave significant weight to the extent of and characteristics of the green belt within the borough and the number of sites that had already been provided within these areas . \u2026", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL advises that after a district or borough has been designated , authorities may have to be prepared to increase the provision they have made if there is a subsequent expansion of the gypsy population in their area and it is DATE since the designation of ORG in DATE . However since then the DATE surveys indicate that the number of vans parked illegally in the borough has tended to decline . Consequently , having regard to the reasons given for designation , there does not appear to be a case at this time for permitting additional gypsy caravan sites , in the green belt in ORG , contrary to policies ORG and HCARDINAL , unless there are very special circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the personal circumstances of < the applicants > none of the family requires regular hospital treatment and I do not consider the ailments of < the applicant and her husband > and CARDINAL of their children are so exceptional or debilitating as to constitute compelling reasons for allowing inappropriate development in the green belt . Whilst I sympathise with < the applicants\u2019 > aim to have the CARDINAL youngest children educated , CARDINAL of these is currently at school and there is no evidence that this locality is preferable to any other in terms of access to educational facilities .", "CARDINAL . I can appreciate < the applicants\u2019 > current desire to settle in CARDINAL place but there is no specific reason why this has to be in the green belt . With regard to the consequences of < the applicants > having to vacate the site you state that they would have no alternative to reverting to their previous existence of moving from CARDINAL unauthorised site to another , with consequent hardship for the family and inconvenience to the general public . In this respect \u2026 the borough and district councils have no record that < the applicants > have sought a place on any of the official sites and < the applicant > stated that she has not enquired whether there was any space on any of the sites occupied by her relatives . Additionally , it would be open to < the applicants > to seek priority housing from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP \u2026 I accept that < the applicant and her husband > have lived and worked in this area for some time and that it might not be possible to accommodate < their > mobile home on any authorised site within the area . However , on the basis of the evidence at the inquiry I am not convinced that all avenues relating to possible alternative accommodation have been fully explored . I am not , therefore , assured that < the applicants > inevitably would have to return to living on unauthorised sites \u2026 In any event , I am not persuaded that such a consequence \u2026 together with any limited benefits that might arise in terms of the health and education of the family represent very special circumstances that would justify the retention of this inappropriate development in this particularly sensitive part of FAC . \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant remained on her land in the caravan as the family had not been offered a place on an official campsite and thus had no alternative legal site to place their caravan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant applied to the ORG for planning permission to build a bungalow , of which there were already CARDINAL on FAC . The ORG refused planning permission . On DATE , the applicant appealed this decision by written statement as she could not afford a public enquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an ORG appointed by ORG dismissed the appeal on similar grounds to the earlier appeal , namely that the bungalow was inappropriate within the Green Belt and that there were no special circumstances which would override the strong presumption against such a development , which in this case would contribute to the coalescence of existing developments and further diminish the rural character of the area . As a consequence , the applicant and her husband were in breach of the enforcement notice and liable to receive a summons issued by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Injunction proceedings were instituted against the applicant and her family by the ORG . On DATE , the ORG obtained an injunction in the High Court requiring the applicant and her family to move off their land immediately . The applicant applied for judicial review of this decision and was granted limited legal aid . However , she received counsel \u2019s opinion which advised that the application was doomed to failure .", "CARDINAL . In light of the new Criminal Justice and LAW DATE , which came into force on DATE , the applicant , in fear of being on the roadside , applied to be placed on the local authority homeless list on DATE . The ORG informed the applicant \u2019s solicitors on DATE that the applicant had been placed on the list .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was offered accommodation in CARDINAL flats in a town . However , the rent was excessively high and there was no facility to keep her husband \u2019s van nor his tarmacadaming and landscape gardening equipment . Moreover , the environment next to a busy , treeless road was contrary to the country existence which she and her family had enjoyed all their lives . They have applied for accommodation in a more natural environment but no offer has yet been made . ORG had previously offered CARDINAL alternative pieces of land which were subsequently withdrawn due to a methane gas leak , boggy ground and vicinity to a rubbish dump respectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP The local authority has stated that , in the event that the applicant is forced to leave the site , the authority will provide temporary accommodation for her until permanent accommodation becomes available . However , in view of the restrictions on development within LOC , all accommodation offered will be in urban areas .", "CARDINAL . NORP The DATE Annual Report from ORG planning department revealed that following the coming into force of ORG LAW DATE ORG no longer had an obligation to identify new gypsy caravan sites and that unless very special circumstances were proved it was unlikely that new sites would be allowed in LOC and sensitive areas . The statistics for DATE showed that the official sites in the area catered for CARDINAL caravans while there were another CARDINAL caravans on unauthorised sites .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that in DATE the local authority decided to institute proceedings against her . Though no proceedings were issued , the ORG threatened to do so from time to time and she lived under the threat of committal for contempt . The applicant \u2019s husband continued to suffer from severe gout and was recently in hospital for treatment . He and the applicant both suffer from depression . Her eldest son , his wife , their son and baby lived with her , as well as CARDINAL other children . The applicant \u2019s children of school age were attending the local school regularly . The applicant stated that she continued to visit gypsy sites to see whether pitches were available but she has not been offered a pitch on any site and has not received any visits from the local authority .", "CARDINAL . In the Runnymede area , there were CARDINAL local authority sites accommodating CARDINAL caravans . In addition there were CARDINAL caravans on authorised sites and CARDINAL caravans on unauthorised sites . The applicant submitted that since the DATE direction by the Secretary of ORG CARDINAL additional pitches were provided . Since DATE , there had been no increase in provision in either public or private sites and no decrease in the number of unlawful encampments .", "The applicant submitted that all the area of the ORG was in the Metropolitan Green Belt area while the ORG stated that only a large part of it was . The diagram and materials submitted from ORG DATE indicates that PERCENT of the County was GPE , PERCENT urban and PERCENT countryside beyond LOC , which includes some areas designated as areas of outstanding natural beauty ( PERSON ) or designated landscape value ( ORG ) . Parts of the LOC area are also classed as PERSON and ORG . PERSON and ORG areas account for PERCENT of the County . According to the diagram , the NORP area consists entirely of LOC and urban centres .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE ( as amended by LAW DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "CARDINAL . Again there is a further right of appeal \u201c on a point of law \u201d to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector \u2019s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "CARDINAL . Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice , the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The purpose of Green Belts and the operation of the policy to protect them is set out in the national policy document ORG ( DATE ) .", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Government attaches great importance to GPE , which have been an essential element of planning policy for DATE \u2026", "CARDINAL . The fundamental aim of LOC policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open ; the most important attribute of ORG is their openness . Green Belts can shape patterns of urban development at sub - regional and regional scale , and help to ensure that development occurs in locations allocated in development plans . They help to protect the countryside , be it in agricultural , forestry or other use . They can assist in moving towards more sustainable patterns of urban development .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The essential characteristic of GPE is their permanence . Their protection must be maintained as far as can be seen ahead . \u2026", "CARDINAL . The general policies controlling development in the countryside apply with equal force in Green Belts but there is , in addition , a general presumption against inappropriate development within them . Such development should not be approved , except in very special circumstances \u2026", "CARDINAL . Inappropriate development is , by definition , harmful to LOC . It is for the applicant to show why permission should be granted . Very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of inappropriateness , and any other harm , is clearly outweighed by other considerations . In view of the presumption against inappropriate development , the Secretary of ORG will attach substantial weight to the harm to the Green Belt when considering any planning application or appeal concerning such development . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Part II of GPE DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in DATE , in particular the closure of commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section CARDINAL of GPE and ORG DATE . LAW of LAW defined \u201c gypsies \u201d as :", "\u201c persons of nomadic habit of life , whatever their race or origin , but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen , or of persons engaged in travelling circuses , travelling together as such \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

The Secretary of ORG could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Where the Secretary of ORG was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of GPE , or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision , he could \u201c designate \u201d that district or county ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway , on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , LAW gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a GPE court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By DATE it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was inadequate , and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems .

The report made numerous recommendations for improving this situation .", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL was issued by ORG . Its stated purpose was to provide local authorities with guidance on \u201c statutory procedures , alternative forms of gypsy accommodation and practical points about site provision and management \u201d . It was intended to apply until such time as more final action could be taken on the recommendations of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

By DATE , therefore ORG legislated to make the s.CARDINAL power a duty , resting in rural areas upon county councils rather than district councils \u2026 For DATE there followed a history of non - compliance with the duties imposed by the Act of DATE , marked by a series of decisions of this court holding local authorities to be in breach of their statutory duty , to apparently little practical effect . The default powers vested in central government to which the court was required to defer , were rarely , if ever used .", "The culmination of the tensions underlying the history of non - compliance was the enactment of \u2026 the Act of DATE \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . New guidance on gypsy sites and planning , in the light of LAW , was issued to local authorities by the Government in Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( DATE ) , which cancelled ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see above ) .", "Councils were told that :", "\u201c In order to encourage private site provision , local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development . ...

CARDINAL )", "However :", "\u201c As with other planning applications , proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land - use factors . Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations , the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural , archaeological , countryside , environmental , and LOC policies ... \u201d ( para . CARDINAL ) .", "It was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted , for example Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty , Sites of Special Scientific Interest . Nor were gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a Green Belt ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Further guidance issued by the Secretary of ORG dated DATE concerned the unauthorised camping by gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land ( LOC above ) . Paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL required local authorities to adopt \u201c a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which can not be effectively controlled , an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance . Accordingly , authorities should consider tolerating PERSON presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites , for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets , a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water .", "CARDINAL . Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government - owned land , it is for the local authority , with the agreement of the land - owning ORG , to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health . It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of ORG that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance .", "CARDINAL . The Secretaries of ORG continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly . They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs CARDINAL further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under LAW . These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly - born children , the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson , NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE and NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE , unreported ) , ORG held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG drew to the attention of all local planning authorities in GPE that Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL required local planning authorities to assess the need for gypsy accommodation in their areas and make suitable locational and/or criteria based policies against which to decide planning applications . The Government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up . ORG research ( see below ) had showed that PERCENT of local authorities ( CARDINAL ) had no policy at all on gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on gypsy provision . It was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and the detailed policies should be provided . Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the ORG \u2019s objective that gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation , applying for planning permission like everyone else . It was necessary , therefore , that adequate gypsy site provision be made in development plans to facilitate this process .", "CARDINAL . The Advisory Council for ORG and Other Travellers ( ACERT ) which carried out research sponsored by ORG , noted in its report that since DATE private site provision had increased by CARDINAL caravans per year while the pace of public site provision had declined by CARDINAL caravans , disclosing that the pace of private site provision had not increased sufficiently to counterbalance decreases in public site provision . Noting the increase of gypsies in housing and the increased enforcement powers under LAW , it questioned , if these trends continued , the extent to which the ethnic , cultural and linguistic identity of ORG people would be protected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The research looked , inter alia , at CARDINAL refused private site applications , which showed that PERCENT related to land within the countryside and that PERCENT were refused on grounds relating to the amenity value ( e.g. Green Belt , conservation area locations ) . Of the CARDINAL gypsy site applicants interviewed , for most acquiring permission for their own land was an important factor in improving the quality of life , gaining independence and providing security . For many , the education of their children was another important reason for private site application . All save CARDINAL had applied for permission retrospectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report stated that the figures for success rates in CARDINAL planning appeals showed that before DATE the success rate had averaged PERCENT but had decreased since . Having regard however to the way in which data was recorded , the actual success rate was probably PERCENT as given as the figures in DATE and DATE by the gypsy groups and ORG respectively . Notwithstanding the objectives of planning policy that local authorities make provision for gypsies , most local authorities did not identify any areas of land as suitable for potential development by gypsies and reached planning decisions on the basis of land - use criteria in the particular case . It was therefore not surprising that ORG most gypsies made retrospective applications and that they had little success in identifying land on which local authority would permit development . Granting of permission for private sites remained haphazard and unpredictable .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG survey on caravans GPE disclosed that of CARDINAL caravans counted , CARDINAL were accommodated on local authority pitches , CARDINAL on privately owned sites and CARDINAL on unauthorised sites . Of the latter , CARDINAL gypsy caravans were being tolerated on land owned by non - gypsies ( mainly local authority land ) and CARDINAL gypsy caravans tolerated on land owned by gypsies themselves .
