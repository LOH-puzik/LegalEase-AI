FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and apparently lives in H\u00e4meenlinna without a permanent address . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in H\u00e4meenlinna . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested together with another person who was subject to an order of arrest . An unlawful gas pistol was found in the applicant 's possession . Later the applicant became suspected of other , mainly property offences . Several bags were seized from the car in which the applicant was when arrested . The bags contained , inter alia , several car keys , some of which had been filed , and a skeleton key .", "On DATE the applicant was charged with several offences before ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tt ) of PERSON . This included a charge of being in possession of objects which could be used for committing property offences . This charge was based on LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflag ) and read as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] and PERSON [ a co - defendant ] , who must be regarded as vagrants within the meaning of LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW , had on DATE in GPE in their possession CARDINAL car ignition keys , some of which had been filed , a skeleton key of NORP origin and other equipment suitable for lock picking . \u201d", "In ORG the public prosecutor recalled that although the Act on Vagrants ( irtolaislaki , lagen om l\u00f6sdrivare ; CARDINAL ) had been abolished , the concept of \u201c a vagrant \u201d was still maintained in LAW , section DATE , of LAW . The prosecutor claimed that the applicant and his co - accused had both admitted to have been wandering around for DATE and maintained that they should be regarded as \u201c vagrants \u201d within the meaning of LAW .", "The applicant denied being \u201c a vagrant \u201d . During the proceedings the applicant also submitted , inter alia , that he had been living in Riihim\u00e4ki in an apartment he had been renting since DATE and that as CARDINAL of the charges concerned a provision of law which could only be applied to people without a permanent address ( i.e. to so - called vagrants ) , it could not be applied to him .", "According to the public prosecutor LAW , section DATE , of LAW was to be interpreted as applying to persons wandering around , i.e. \u201c a vagrant \u201d , and in possession of objects which could be used when committing a burglary ( i.e. keys or skeleton keys ) . In the final hearing the public prosecutor further interpreted the said section as prohibiting a person who regularly committed property crimes from possessing objects such as skeleton keys .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant on several counts , including the count under LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW . The applicant was sentenced to DATE and DATE imprisonment . The court also ordered that , inter alia , CARDINAL car keys and a skeleton key be confiscated from the applicant .", "As to LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ORG found the provision applicable and in force even though the comparable provision of the old Act on Vagrants had been abolished . According to the court , the notion of \u201c vagrant \u201d had its own independent meaning in LAW . The relevant provision prohibited a person who was wandering around and living rough from being in the possession of certain equipment , if that equipment could , in the light of that person 's behaviour and other circumstances , be considered as in his possession for the purpose of committing an offence .", "The applicant 's co - defendant was convicted on several counts . He was however not convicted of possession of skeleton keys pursuant to LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW due to lack of evidence .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , maintaining , inter alia , that he was not \u201c a vagrant \u201d as he had had a permanent address since DATE and could therefore not be convicted under LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . As to the applicant 's conviction as \u201c a vagrant \u201d within the meaning of LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG recalled that the old Act on Vagrants was revoked on DATE . According to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of ORG for ORG ( p\u00e4ihdehuoltolaki , lag om missbrukarv\u00e5rd ; CARDINAL ) , which replaced the Act on Vagrants , LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW was not to be amended . ORG , thus , found that the revoked Act on Vagrants and the practice built on it had not lost its relevance for the interpretation of LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW . According to LAW , subsection CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the revoked LAW on Vagrants \u201c a vagrant \u201d was , inter alia , a person who by his way of life endangered public order or safety . ORG noted that the applicant had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for , inter alia , offences against property on numerous occasions during DATE . It therefore found that the applicant endangered public order and safety by his criminal way of life and was , accordingly , to be regarded as \u201c a vagrant \u201d within the meaning of LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant applied for leave to appeal to ORG and requested that the conviction be quashed or , at least , that the case be referred back to ORG or ORG for an oral hearing . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW ( perustuslaki , grundlagen ; GPE ) provides that no one shall be found guilty of a criminal offence or be sentenced to a punishment on the basis of a deed , which has not been determined to be punishable by an LAW at the time of its commission . The penalty imposed for an offence shall not be more severe than that provided by an LAW at the time of commission of the offence . This section corresponds to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the repealed LAW ( hallitusmuoto , regeringsformen ) , in force at the relevant time .", "LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( as in force at the relevant time ) provided that a vagrant who was found with a lock pick or a skeleton key should be sentenced to a fine . The said provision was enacted in DATE , when the existing LAW entered into force , and has not been amended until DATE .", "The ORG passed a PERSON for the amendment of LAW of LAW ( ORG Reply CARDINAL ) . The amendment entered into force on DATE . In this context , section DATE was repealed .", "According to the new LAW , section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , concerning possession of tools used for burglary , a person who without an acceptable reason has in his / her possession a key to the lock of another or a skeleton key or other implement that can justifiably be suspected as intended for use primarily for entry into closed LOC in the possession of another for the commission of an offence , shall be sentenced to a fine for possession of a burglary implement .", "Section CARDINAL of the Act on Vagrants provided until DATE that a vagrant pursuant to the LAW was , inter alia , a person fit to work who was unemployed without sufficient sustenance and wandered around from one locality to another without the purpose of seeking employment , and a person who acquired income by morally unacceptable or indecent means , or who by his or her way of life otherwise manifestly endangered public order , safety or morality .", "The ORG which had been set up to assess the effects of repealing the Act on Vagrants ( Committee Report CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) held that \u201c [ section CARDINAL in LAW of LAW ] was never intended to refer to \u201c vagrants \u201d within the meaning of LAW or the earlier Decree \u201d . The ORG maintained that most of the referrals in the legislation to the concept of \u201c a vagrant \u201d had lost their meaning after the repealing of the Act on Vagrants . The concept of \u201c a vagrant \u201d in LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW was however regarded as being originally independent from the concept pursuant to LAW . The ORG recommended that the provision should be clarified in connection with the general reform of LAW .", "At the relevant time there were some references in the legislation to the concept of \u201c a vagrant \u201d . Firstly , LAW ( asetus joka sis\u00e4lt\u00e4\u00e4 maaseudun yleisen j\u00e4rjestyss\u00e4\u00e4nn\u00f6n ; f\u00f6rordning innefattande allm\u00e4n ordningsstadga f\u00f6r landsbygden ; CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) was in force until DATE . Its section DATE , subsection CARDINAL provided , inter alia , that nobody was allowed to hide a vagrant in his / her home .", "Secondly , the LAW on the Publicity of Official Documents ( laki yleisten asiakirjain julkisuudesta ; lag om allm\u00e4nna handlingars offentlighet ; CARDINAL ) was in force until DATE , i.e. , at the time of the offence in question . In the said Act there was an outdated reference to ' vagrants register ' ( irtolaisrekisteri , registret \u00f6ver l\u00f6sdrivare ) , which register no longer existed .", "In the ORG 's PERSON . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on LAW for ORG ( p\u00e4ihdehuoltolaki , lag om missbrukarv\u00e5rd ; CARDINAL ) , which replaced the Act on Vagrants , it is stated that characteristics of a vagrant are a drifting life , rejection of work , begging and an indecent life . It was held that the LAW was largely based on the Decree on Vagrants from DATE and that there were significant regional differences in applying LAW . It was maintained that the characteristics of a vagrant could no longer be regarded as appropriate criteria for admitting people to involuntary health care .", "In the subsequent Government 's PERSON . CARDINAL concerning the amendment of the provisions of LAW of LAW it was held that \u201c [ T]he concept of \u201c a vagrant \u201d lacks an appropriate meaning in the contemporary language of a modern society . \u201d It was also held that the existing provisions of LAW , section CARDINAL provided a certain justification for the prohibition of possession of burglary implements albeit it was regarded as limited in nature and , more particularly , was open to interpretation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
