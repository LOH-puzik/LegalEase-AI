GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicants are an association , ORG Reduci PERSON Liberazione ( GPE ) , registered in GPE , and CARDINAL natural persons who are all NORP nationals ( see list appended ) . Most of those individuals are members of the applicant association . Some of the applicants lodged the application in their capacity as legal successors . The applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr J. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "Most of the applicants were members of the NORP armed forces during the Second World War . GPE had first been an ally of ORG , but after PERSON \u2019s fall the new ORG concluded a truce with the allied forces on DATE . As of CARDINAL DATE the NORP armed forces disarmed and captured NORP soldiers . The NORP army offered those captured NORP soldiers the choice of either joining the NORP armed forces or becoming prisoners of war . The latter were detained in labour camps and used as labourers in the NORP industry .", "As of DATE those detainees were called \u201c NORP Military internees \u201d ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "On DATE GPE declared war against GPE .", "Beginning in DATE the internees were transferred from war captivity ( Kriegsgefangenschaft ) to so - called \u201c civilian employment \u201d ( PERSON ) . At first , the internees were asked to sign an according declaration consenting to the change of their status . Despite pressure exercised by the NORP authorities , only few internees agreed to the transfer of their status . The Government of ORG then abstained from obtaining those declarations and transferred the internees to civilian status without any formal declaration . They were subsequently registered as civilian forced labourers . The working conditions and the detention in labour camps , however , did not change . The internees had to carry out physically hard work without receiving adequate nutrition and many of them died as a consequence .", "CARDINAL of the applicants , among them Mr GPE and PERSON , were not members of the NORP armed forces . They were civilians who were deported to GPE and subjected to forced labour as an act of retaliation against the NORP civilian population .", "GPE , after its foundation on CARDINAL DATE , did not establish any compensation schemes specifically for forced labourers .", "Under LAW on GPE \u2019s ORG ) of DATE , the regulation of compensation claims was deferred until the final settlement of reparation .", "GPE paid compensation to victims of the NORP regime , mostly to those who were living in GPE , GPE and other GPE , in particular pursuant to the provisions of LAW ( ORG ) , which entered into force on DATE . It provided inter alia compensation for detention in a concentration camp and damage caused to the detainees\u2019 health . However , forced labour as such was not covered by the existing legislation .", "In DATE GPE and GPE concluded an agreement pursuant to which GPE paid a lump sum to the NORP ORG , which then awarded compensation to victims of persecution by the NORP regime . ORG did not award any benefits to the former \u201c NORP Military Internees \u201d . They receive a supplement of MONEY per day to their regular old - age pension from ORG , as do all former members of the NORP armed forces who were detained as prisoners of war .", "After DATE GPE furthermore paid lump sums to several ORG , which then created funds for victims of the NORP regime .", "However , individual compensation for forced labour as such was still not provided by GPE . Hence many of those former forced labourers brought actions against NORP companies , in particular class action suits in GPE . Against that background the Government of GPE and ORG of GPE concluded a treaty that envisaged the creation of the foundation \u201c PERSON , Responsibility and Future \u201d ( ORG , Verantwortung und ORG \u201d \u201c the ORG \u201d ) which would provide individual compensation for former forced labourers .", "GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , ORG on NORP Material Claims against GPE ( \u201c the NORP Claims Conference \u201d ) , legal representatives of former forced labourers and representatives of the NORP industry had participated in those negotiations . GPE had not been a party .", "On DATE the \u201c Law on the Creation of the ORG \u201c Remembrance , Responsibility and Future \u201d ( Gesetz PERSON \u201c GPE , Verantwortung und FAC \u201d \u201c the LAW \u201d ) entered into force ( see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law \u201d below ) .", "On DATE the applicant association , a former NORP Military LOC ( M ) and the CARDINALst applicant ( Mr GPE ) , who had been subjected to forced labour as a civilian , lodged a constitutional complaint against sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , QUANTITY and QUANTITY of the Foundation Law with ORG .", "On DATE applicants CARDINAL . DATE joined the constitutional complaint .", "The applicant Mr GPE and M submitted that they had had claims for compensation for forced labour under NORP civil law in conjunction with international public law against GPE prior to the entry into force of LAW . Invoking a violation of their right of property ( LAW see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law \u201d below ) they complained that they lost those claims by virtue of LAW of LAW . All complainants contended that the exclusion of judicial review of the decisions by ORG ) violated their right to an effective remedy under LAW of LAW . Moreover , they held the opinion that the exclusion of former prisoners of war from the ambit of compensation under LAW was discriminatory and thus contrary to LAW of the German Basic PERSON ( prohibition of discrimination ) . Lastly , the complainants submitted that they had lost the right under LAW of the LAW to have the unlawfulness of their arrest , detention and forced labour confirmed by a judge .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the complaint . In respect of the applicant association the court held that the complaint was inadmissible since the association did not invoke a violation of its own constitutional rights , but solely a violation of the rights of its members . Regarding applicants nos . DATE , the court found that the complaint had been lodged outside the statutory time - limit of DATE since the entry into force of the Foundation Law on DATE . As far as the applicant Mr GPE and M were concerned the court held that their complaint was partly admissible , but unfounded .", "In respect of LAW of the NORP Basic PERSON the court held that LAW did not apply to the arrest , the detention and the forced labour , since those events had taken place before LAW entered into force on DATE . Furthermore , referring to LAW ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law \u201d below ) the court found that international public law did not establish individual claims for compensation for forced labour . The court pointed out in particular that LAW did not establish an individual claim of compensation against a ORG , but created only claims of CARDINAL ORG . The court went on to say that it was not excluded that national law might establish claims of individuals that existed next to the claims of ORG . This , however , did not mean that there was a general rule according to which individuals had a right of compensation against the ORG which had violated LAW . Hence the question as to whether individuals were entitled to compensation was entirely dependant on domestic law .", "Moreover , the court found that the exclusion of former prisoners of war from the scope of those eligible for benefits under LAW by LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL was not discriminatory since prisoners of war could be compelled to perform labour under LAW . In this respect the court elaborated that the legislator was allowed to distinguish , when awarding compensation , between victims of general hardships caused by the war and victims of particular ideological persecution by the NORP regime , especially as the funds of the ORG were limited .", "In respect of the exclusion of judicial review by the Foundation Law the court found that LAW of LAW required that actually a right existed whose alleged violation could be examined by the courts . The court concluded that the legislator was free to decide not to establish claims of an individual vis - \u00e0 - vis a public law foundation and to exclude judicial review in this connection .", "In its decision ORG pointed out that , according to his own submissions , PERSON GPE had not lodged a request for compensation with the ORG since he had not been detained in \u201c another place of confinement \u201d within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Foundation Law and was furthermore not in a position to demonstrate that he met the requirements as set up by the guidelines of ORG ( see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law \u201d below ) .", "The applicants nos . DATE submitted that they had all lodged unsuccessful request for compensation for forced labour with the ORG . However , only the ORG and ORG applicants , PERSON and Mr della PERSON , presented decisions of the ORG to the ORG .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the request lodged by the applicant PERSON holding that he did not meet the requirements for compensation under LAW in respect of forced labourers from LOC ; i.e. forced labour in a concentration camp , a ghetto or \u201c another place of confinement \u201d .", "On DATE the ORG \u2019s appeals board rejected Mr della PERSON \u2019s appeal as unfounded , confirming that , as a former prisoner of war , he was excluded from benefits .", "On DATE the ORG and GPE applicants , PERSON and Mr Malberto , who had been subjected to forced labour as NORP Military Internees , lodged requests for compensation with the ORG . By letter dated DATE the ORG informed the applicants that they did not fall within the scope of ORG , as determined by the ORG and ORG . By letter of DATE the ORG notified the applicants that its appeals board was bound by the decision of the ORG and ORG . Apparently , no formal decision was rendered by the ORG .", "On DATE the applicants PERSON and Mr Malberto brought an action for declaration ( PERSON ) against GPE and the ORG in ORG as a pilot case . They requested the court inter alia to hold that they , as former NORP Military Internees , were entitled to benefits under LAW .", "The court rejected the applicant \u2019s action . The court found that the action was inadmissible since there was no legal relationship ( Rechtsverh\u00e4ltnis ) between the applicants on the one hand and GPE and the ORG on the other hand , which is an admissibility criterion for an action for declaration . LAW did not establish individual claims vis - \u00e0 - vis the ORG or ORG , but solely vis - \u00e0 - vis the partner organisation . The court added that the fact that ORG exercised the legal supervision of the ORG did not create a legal relationship between the applicants and GPE . From the court \u2019s point of view the legal supervision was solely carried out in the public interest and not in the interest of the beneficiaries under LAW . The court held the opinion that the applicants were thus only indirectly affected by the legal supervision of ORG .", "The court refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "ORG rejected the ORG request for leave to appeal against the judgment of ORG confirming the lower court \u2019s reasoning .", "On DATE the ORG applicant , Mr della Piazza , brought an action ( Verpflichtungsklage ) against GPE and the ORG in ORG . He requested the court to order ORG to instruct the ORG to recognise that he was entitled to benefits under LAW of LAW . Furthermore , he requested the court to order the ORG to recognise that he , as a former NORP Military Internee , was entitled to benefits under LAW of LAW .", "On DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s action . In respect of the first motion the court held that the applicant could not derive any rights vis - \u00e0 - vis ORG from the fact that the latter exercised the legal supervision of the ORG .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s second motion the court found , as outlined above , that LAW did not establish a legal relationship between the applicants and the ORG .", "The Foundation Law stipulates that the ORG should be endowed with MONEY ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) , to be provided equally by ORG and by NORP industry .", "The sum of CARDINAL ORG is intended for the compensation of forced labour . The largest share of those funds ( MONEY DEM ) is reserved for applicants residing in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . The remaining share is destined for beneficiaries residing outside GPE , namely CARDINAL DEM for non - NORP beneficiaries and PERCENT ORG for NORP beneficiaries .", "The remaining funds of MONEY DEM inter alia aim at compensating the loss of property or were granted as humanitarian aid to ORG and ORG on ORG , which finance social programmes for Holocaust survivors .", "ORG exercises the legal supervision ( Rechtsaufsicht ) of the ORG .", "Requests for compensation are not processed by the ORG itself , but by its regional partner organisations in several NORP countries . The competent partner organisation for GPE is the ORG in GPE .", "Each partner organisation has an appeals board which reviews the organisation \u2019s decisions upon an applicant \u2019s appeal . Judicial review of the appeals boards\u2019 decisions is not provided for by LAW .", "The highest amount of compensation - for forced labour in a concentration camp - is CARDINAL DEM ( CARDINAL ORG ) .", "Pursuant to LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Foundation Law forced labour carried out during war captivity , as a matter of principle , does not entitle to compensation . The provisions read as follows :", "\u201c LAW : Eligible persons", "( CARDINAL ) Eligible under this law are :", "CARDINAL .

ORG shared that view and instructed the ORG that former NORP Military Internees were excluded from benefits under LAW .", "In DATE the board of trustees of the ORG issued guidelines according to which NORP Military Internees were excluded from benefits unless they had been detained in a concentration camp . Those guidelines had been prepared in concert with ORG . In a letter dated DATE addressed to the ORG the ORG pointed out that the ORG and its partner organisations were bound by the ORG \u2019s position .", "As regards civilian forced labourers from GPE , they , according to the aforementioned guidelines , are only entitled to benefits if they were subjected to forced labour in a concentration camp , a ghetto or \u201c another place of confinement \u201d as set out in the first sentence of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Foundation Law . Otherwise , from the ORG \u2019s point of view the former forced labourers would not meet the criterion of \u201c similar extremely harsh living conditions \u201d referred to in the second sentence of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . According to the ORG there was a presumption that they were not housed under \u201c conditions resembling detention \u201d , which could , however , be rebutted by the former forced labourers .", "All possible further claims against the NORP ORG or NORP companies going beyond the benefits provided by LAW are excluded by LAW , which reads as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL : Exclusions from Claims", "( CARDINAL ) Payments from public funds , including social security , and from NORP business enterprises for injustice suffered under ORG as defined in LAW may be claimed only under the terms of this PERSON .
