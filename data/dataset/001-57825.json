At that time , they were both NORP .", "CARDINAL children were born to them , a son , PERSON , in DATE and a daughter , PERSON , in DATE . They were baptised as NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicant left ORG to become a GPE \u2019s Witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted divorce proceedings against Mr S. She left him in DATE or DATE while the proceedings were still pending , taking the children with her .", "The divorce was pronounced on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following their separation , both the applicant and PERSON applied to ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) to be granted parental rights ( PERSON ) over the children .", "Mr S. submitted that if the children were left in the applicant \u2019s care , there was a risk that they would be brought up in a way that would do them harm . He claimed that the educational principles of the religious denomination to which the applicant belonged were hostile to society , in that they discouraged all intercourse with non - members , all expressions of patriotism ( such as singing the national anthem ) and religious tolerance . All this would lead to the children \u2019s social isolation . In addition , the GPE \u2019s Witnesses\u2019 ban on blood transfusions might give rise to situations in which their life or their health was endangered .", "With regard to the son , PERSON , Mr PERSON noted that he would eventually have to refuse to perform military service or even the civilian service exacted in its stead .", "The applicant claimed that she was better placed to take care of the children , being in a position to devote herself to them completely , and as a mother better able to provide them with the necessary family environment . She alleged that Mr S. did not even provide for their maintenance , as he was both legally and morally bound to do . She acknowledged , however , that she intended to bring the children up in her own faith .", "The youth office of ORG , PERSON ) expressed a preference for granting parental rights to the applicant ; it referred to , inter alia , the expert opinion of a child psychologist .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG granted parental rights to the applicant and denied them to Mr S.", "According to its reasoning , only the children \u2019s well - being fell to be considered . The material living conditions of both parents were such that either of them would be able to take proper care of the children ; however , the father would need his mother \u2019s help . The children had stronger emotional ties with the applicant , having lived with her for DATE already , and separating them from her might cause them psychological harm . It followed that it was preferable to leave the children with the mother .", "ORG further observed :", "\" As against this , it has been stated by the children \u2019s father , essentially as his only argument , that PERSON membership of the religious community of ORG has serious detrimental effects on the children . As to this , it ought to be made clear right away that in no case are GPE religious convictions as such a relevant criterion in deciding on parental rights and duties pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of LAW . These rights can not be refused to a parent or withheld from him for the sole reason that he or she belongs to a religious minority .", "However , in the concrete case it needs to be examined whether the mother \u2019s religious convictions have a negative influence on her upbringing of the children which should be taken into account and whether their well - being is impaired as a result . It appears in particular that PERSON would not allow blood transfusions to be given to her children ; that for herself she rejects communal celebration of such customary holidays as DATE or GPE ; that the children experience a certain tension in relation to an environment which does not correspond to their faith ; and that their integration in societal institutions such as kindergarten and school is made more difficult . However , the father \u2019s apprehension of complete social isolation as a result of the mother \u2019s religion does not appear well - founded in the light of the established facts . In addition , no possible dangers to either child \u2019s development have appeared in the course of the establishment of the facts .", "It is true that the facts adduced ( blood transfusions , holidays , impaired social integration ) are in principle capable of having detrimental effects on the children . This point must now be examined in the context of the particular case . It appears first of all that the father \u2019s argument that PERSON and PERSON would be exposed in an emergency to serious danger to their life and health by the refusal of a blood transfusion is not of decisive importance . In the absence of parental permission for a medically necessary blood transfusion to either child , such permission can be replaced by a judicial decision in accordance with LAW ( compare the decision of ORG ( PERSON ) of DATE , CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In any case , according to this legal provision , anyone can apply to the court for an order that is necessary to ensure the welfare of the child when the parent endangers it by his conduct . In view of this possibility of applying to the court , which is available at all times , no danger to the children need be inferred from the mother \u2019s attitude to blood transfusions .", "As for PERSON rejection of holidays , notice must be taken of her express agreement to allow the father to take the children on such occasions and celebrate them with the children as he sees fit . The mother \u2019s religious convictions thus do not deprive PERSON and PERSON of the possibility of celebrating these holidays in the usual way , so that no detriment to the children can be found in this regard either .", "Of the reservations with regard to the mother \u2019s upbringing of the children resulting from her religion the only remaining one of any significance is the circumstance that PERSON and PERSON will in later life experience somewhat more difficulty in finding their way in social groups as a result of the religious precepts of ORG and will find themselves to some extent in a special position . However , the court can not consider this so detrimental to the children \u2019s welfare that they should for that reason not be entrusted to their mother , with whom they have such a close psychological relationship and to whose care they are accustomed . Careful consideration must lead to the conclusion that in spite of more difficult social integration , as discussed above , it appears to be more in the interest of the children \u2019s welfare to grant parental rights to the mother than to transfer them to the father . \"", "CARDINAL . Mr S. appealed against the above decision to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the appeal by decision of CARDINAL DATE . Its grounds for so doing were the following :", "\" The main thrust of the appeal is to argue that the decision of the first - instance court is incompatible with the children \u2019s welfare in view of the mother \u2019s membership of the religious community of the GPE \u2019s Witnesses . In this connection , the appellant discusses the criteria and objectives peculiar to that religious community and the resulting social attitudes , which are in his opinion wrong ; it follows , in his view , that both children are bound to suffer harm if the parental rights and duties are assigned to the mother , and in particular that they may be forced into social isolation removed from reality .", "The appellant \u2019s line of argument in this regard is unsound . The Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses , formerly known as Serious Bible Students , a community based upon their own interpretation of the Bible , are not outlawed in GPE ; it may therefore be assumed that their objectives neither infringe the law nor offend morality ( see LAW in conjunction with LAW ) of ORG ) . Therefore , the mother \u2019s membership of that religious community can not of itself constitute a danger to the children \u2019s welfare ...", "Admittedly , the mother \u2019s religion will in all probability affect the children \u2019s care and upbringing , and they may come to experience a certain tension in relation to an environment which does not correspond to their faith . The first - instance court has already dealt at length with part of the appellant \u2019s arguments that relate thereto and has given detailed and conclusive reasons why the father \u2019s objections against assigning the parental rights and duties to the mother can not in the final instance be decisive . The new points raised on appeal - relating to a lack of understanding of democracy and a lack of subordination to the ORG - can not cast doubt on the first - instance decision as regards the children \u2019s welfare ; it suffices in this respect to recall the legal recognition of the religious community of ORG , which meant , contrary to the appellant \u2019s allegation , that the first - instance court did not in fact need to seek ex officio an expert opinion on the objectives or the \u2018 nature\u2019 of the Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses . Nor were the first - instance proceedings incomplete because no expert medical opinion was sought regarding the question , which was raised anew on appeal , of blood transfusions , which are rejected by the GPE \u2019s Witnesses ; in the event that a judicial remedy ( a decision pursuant to LAW ) arrives too late , it will in the final instance be up to the physician treating the patient , when confronted with the problem , to reach a decision , with a view in the first place to life - saving medical action and only in the second place taking into account the rejection of blood transfusions which is peculiar to the GPE \u2019s Witnesses .", "The appellant \u2019s further line of argument - to the effect that a properly arranged transfer of the children to himself and properly arranged visiting rights for the mother could not cause the same shock as had the mother \u2019s forcible removal of the children , and that the decision under appeal had legalised her unilateral action - also fails to convince . The appellant overlooks the fact that , in view of the paramount importance of the children \u2019s welfare , the way in which they reached the place where they are currently being taken care of is not necessarily decisive . Even illegal conduct would be of relevance only to the extent that it might , in an individual case , be possible to infer therefrom a lack of suitability for care or upbringing ; it is not otherwise decisive for determining the attribution of parental rights and duties whether or not the parent concerned has taken charge of the children without authorisation . It remains true , however , that both children have for a long time developed harmoniously in the mother \u2019s care , that there is a closer relationship with her than with the father , and that , whatever the religious or philosophical views of the mother , neither child has suffered any harm in his or her physical or - particularly - psychological development ; in fact the appellant could not seriously claim that they had actually suffered in the latter respect . \"", "CARDINAL . Mr S. lodged an appeal on points of law ( au\u00dferordentlicher Revisionsrekurs ) with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE , ORG overturned the judgment of ORG , granting parental rights to Mr S. instead of the applicant . It gave the following reasons :", "\" The appellant has not hitherto claimed that the children belonged to the NORP faith ; however , he has stated , and it has in fact been established , that the mother is bringing them up according to the principles of the GPE \u2019s Witnesses\u2019 teaching . It is also uncontested that the children do not belong to this confession . The lower courts had therefore to examine whether or not the mother \u2019s bringing up the children in this way contravened the provisions of LAW of DATE on ORG ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber die religi\u00f6se GPE ) , BGBl ( ORG , Federal official ORG ( re - enactment of LAW DATE on ORG , dRGB ( deutsches Reichsgesetzblatt , ORG ) I. CARDINAL ) . According to LAW the religious education of a child shall be decided upon by an agreement freely entered into by the parents , in so far as the responsibility for his or her care and upbringing is vested in them . Such an agreement may be revoked at any time and is terminated by the death of either spouse . LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW lays down that if such an agreement does not or ceases to exist , the provisions of LAW on the care and upbringing of children shall extend to their religious education . However , according to LAW , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW , during the existence of the marriage neither parent may decide without the consent of the other that the child is to be brought up in a faith different from that shared by both parents at the time of the marriage or from that in which he or she has hitherto been brought up .", "Since in any case the children do not belong to the faith of the Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses , their education according to the principles of this sect ( which is not , as the appellant rightly points out , a recognised religious community : see ORG , ORG , [ NORP LAW ] , PERSON . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) contravenes Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW . ORG failure to apply this provision is obviously in breach of the law .", "Moreover , the lower courts also failed in their decisions to give due consideration to the children \u2019s welfare ... . That the mother , as has been established , would refuse to consent to the children \u2019s receiving a necessary blood transfusion constitutes a danger to their well - being , since requesting a court to substitute its consent for that of the mother ... may in urgent cases involve a life - threatening delay and medical intervention without seeking the approval of the person entitled to take care of the child is considered contrary to the law ... . It has also been established that if the children are educated according to the religious teaching of the Jehovah \u2019s Witnesses , they will become social outcasts . In the initial decision as to which of the spouses is to have the right to provide care and upbringing , these circumstances can not be ignored . Although it is preferable for young children to be taken care of by their mother ... , this applies only provided that all other things are equal ... . There is no maternal privilege as regards the attribution of parental right ... . The stress caused to the children by being transferred to the care of the other parent , which in any case is usually transitory , has to be accepted in their own best interests ... . The file contains no documentary basis for the assumption that a change to another carer \u2018 would with a high degree of probability cause the children serious psychological harm\u2019 ... . Even according to the opinion of the lower courts , the father is able to see to the children \u2019s upbringing , since they have a good relationship with him and with their grandmother , who would take charge of their care and upbringing during the father \u2019s absence at work ; the availability of accommodation for the children in the house of the father \u2019s parents is assured . Therefore , only transfer of parental rights and duties to the father is in the children \u2019s interest . \"", "CARDINAL .
