The applicants , PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Ms PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who live in GPE ( see GPE for dates of birth ) . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Co - Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants as employees of ORG ( GPE per la promozione dello sviluppo nel LOC ) had by DATE accumulated a certain length of service and had been paying contributions towards their old - age pension into ORG ( ORG ) , the primary NORP welfare entity . Thus , according to the law in force at the time , on DATE , even assuming they became unemployed in the future , all the applicants had already accrued all the necessary DATE of contributions to obtain an old age - pension on attaining pensionable age ( CARDINAL for men and CARDINAL for women ) ( see annexed table ) .", "CARDINAL . AGENSUD had previously been called ORG ) , a public entity having its own juridical personality . Thus , according to the applicants , on DATE they were civil servants and all the relevant guarantees applied to them , including LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( Law no . TIME ) ( the law which had instituted the Cassa ) , providing that on the date of cessation of the ORG or its dissolution , all the rights and obligations of the latter would be transferred to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP By means of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ( Law no . CARDINAL ) ORG was dissolved . However , the working relationship between employer and employee with its duties and obligations was not transferred to the ORG as had been provided . Instead , this working relationship ceased to have effect and the employees acquired a right to an \u201c end - of - service payment \u201d ( TFR ) . They were further given the option to undertake new employment with a new civil service entity . This employment , however , provided for lower salaries than the ones they had previously received , contrary , according to the applicants , to consolidated principles of the public service ( Presidential decree no . CARDINAL of DATE see relevant domestic law ) . The ORG noted that this salary corresponded to that of ORG employees in equal grades of service .", "CARDINAL . Eventually , in DATE , the applicants were employed within ORG ( the Ministry ) with retroactive effect from DATE . Thus , they had chosen to remain in employment and accepted lower salaries , together with the implications for their future social welfare coverage and pensions , in respect of contributions to be paid during this new employment .", "CARDINAL . At the time , the law ( LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provided for CARDINAL options , CARDINAL of which ( hereinafter referred to as joining ) entailed that previous contributions paid by the applicants , viz by ORG to the ORG , be joined to those that would subsequently be paid by ORG to a different welfare entity , namely the ORG ( ORG per I Dipendenti dell\u2019Amministrazione Pubblica ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , on the basis of LAW ( b ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , any benefits acquired had to remain untouched and the change of system should have occurred without any disbursements or losses on their part . Thus , the applicants accepted the relevant employment offer and the joining of their contributions , believing that , in accordance with the case - law as it stood at the time ( see Title C below ) , they would receive back any payments in excess which would not go towards the calculation of their pension .", "CARDINAL . Indeed , at the time , the system of joining entailed that only part of the previous contributions ( paid to ORG ) was used for the calculation of the pensions . However , it eventually resulted that any contributions in excess were to the benefit of the ORG and were not given back to the ORG or to the applicants . It followed that a future pension would also not have benefited from the entirety of the contributions paid . Thus , through this move the applicants suffered CARDINAL disadvantages : firstly , any future pensions would be lower and secondly a good share of the already paid contributions would be lost .", "CARDINAL . In consequence , the legislator provided for a derogation ( LAW ) applicable to a limited number of employees of the LAW , namely personnel who had left the civil service after DATE and before the entry into force of LAW b ) of PERSON No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The derogation entailed the restitution of the paid contributions which had not been calculated for the purposes of joining the social security periods . The applicants did not fall within this category .", "CARDINAL . Initially , the civil service started paying up all the ORG employees , without distinction , either spontaneously or as a result of a number of court cases successful at first instance . However , eventually , the civil service limited this payment only to persons who had left the civil service after DATE and before the entry into force of LAW b ) of PERSON No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , thus excluding the applicants , who had accepted to take up new employment and agreed to the joining of their contributions into one entity .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the NORP welfare system introduced a new pension calculation , namely ORG ( calculation of pension by reference to contributions paid throughout a life - time and revalorisation factors ) as opposed to ORG ( based on the salaries applicable to employees in DATE of service ) . The change in system has been gradual and while for young employees the system is obligatory , for older ones it is only optional .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants instituted judicial proceedings to ascertain their right to the restitution of the contributions they had paid to the ORG and which had not been used to calculate their pensions . They contended that if LAW bis had to be interpreted as not implying the right for them to take back their contributions , it would be discriminatory vis - \u00e0 - vis both a ) other ORG employees and/or b ) other employees in general who had previously been transferred and had been reimbursed the excess contributions . They requested the reimbursement of the relevant sums .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( TAR ) declared the application inadmissible on formal and procedural grounds .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by a judgment delivered on DATE in the relevant registry of the plenary ( PERSON ) , ORG ( PERSON ) rejected the claims on the merits . It held that the contributions which had been paid to ORG but had not been used for pension calculation could validly be vested in the ORG . In the ambit of a welfare system based on the principle of solidarity , the circumstances that social benefits do not reflect the contributions paid did not amount to unjust enrichment of the entity receiving the contributions . Lastly , the restitution of contributions was an exceptional measure not regulated by uniform norms and only applicable to a certain category of people . In consequence , in the absence of any specific norm to that effect , the applicants did not have a right to the reimbursement of contributions paid in excess . Moreover , the applicants had accepted to take up new employment with the civil service and requested the joining of their contributory periods .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the plenary ( PERSON ) of ORG ( PERSON ) had held that it was possible to reimburse contributions in excess to civil servants . The same was reiterated again in DATE in analogous cases relating to the dissolution of ORG ( enti mutualistici ) , whose employees were transferred to another organ of the civil service .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , numerous ex - employees of the ORG instituted court proceedings complaining about the lower salaries and social coverage . By a judgment of ORG of DATE it was held that persons in the ORG position had acquired a new status equal to their colleagues . Thus , since they had been given the option either to retire and maintain the old welfare regime or to continue in employment and join the contributions into CARDINAL ( at the ORG \u2019s expense and for certain others with the recovery of such contributions ) , the system was in conformity with constitutional principles .", "CARDINAL . Again in relation to ORG employees , ORG had originally by an opinion of DATE , delivered in the framework of its consultative competence , expressed itself in favour of reimbursement being made to all ORG employees , including the ones in the applicants\u2019 situation . On the same lines , a number of decisions at first instance , some of which had become final , were delivered ( for example PERSON the Ministry for transport and Infrastructure , ORG and ORG , judgment of ORG of DATE and PERSON , ORG , ORG and ORG judgment of ORG DATE ) . It was only ORG formation which reversed this jurisprudence in DATE in the applicants\u2019 domestic case .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the law in force up to DATE , persons were eligible to receive an old - age pension on attaining pensionable age , namely CARDINAL for men and CARDINAL for women , after DATE of welfare contributions . As from DATE to DATE , DATE of welfare contributions were necessary to obtain the said benefit . This applied even if persons had been unemployed up to the date when they reached pensionable age . As from DATE to DATE , DATE of welfare contributions were necessary to obtain the said benefit ; however , pensionable age was increased to CARDINAL for men and CARDINAL for women . As from DATE to DATE , DATE of welfare contributions were necessary to obtain the said benefit when reaching pensionable age , which remained CARDINAL for men and CARDINAL for women .", "CARDINAL . LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c On the date of cessation of the ORG or its dissolution , all the rights and obligations of the latter are transferred to the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of Presidential decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , provides as follows :", "\u201c In the case of career changes in the same or a different administration , employees having higher salaries than those provided on such change are awarded a personal cheque , relevant to pensions , equal to the difference between the CARDINAL salaries , without prejudice to future salary increases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL bis paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL provided that LAW no . DATE was applicable to the persons in the applicants\u2019 positions for the purposes of welfare coverage . The latter read as follows :", "\u201c The joining of social security periods related to service rendered with suppressed public entities , in relation to which there has been a transfer of personnel to other public entities , occurs ex officio through the receiving welfare entity , without any charges on the employees . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
