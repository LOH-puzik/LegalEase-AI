POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-3", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having assisted an offender who was being sought pursuant to a \u201c wanted \u201d notice . He was subsequently brought before ORG ( Prokurator Rejonowy ) and charged with having intentionally impeded the apprehension of an arrestable offender . The actual offender had been charged with homicide . The prosecutor applied to ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) for the applicant to be detained pending the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after hearing evidence from the applicant , remanded him in custody for DATE in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence with which he had been charged . The court also considered that , given that the applicant had not confessed and that the evidence given by him contradicted the material gathered by the prosecution , there was a fear that he would induce witnesses to give false testimony or would otherwise obstruct the proper course of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the detention order , as well as his further appeals against decisions prolonging his detention and all his subsequent repeated applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him , were unsuccessful . In his applications and appeals , he argued that the charge against him was based on unreliable and contradictory evidence . He referred to his personal circumstances , in particular his age ( he was DATE at that time ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the investigation , on DATE , the applicant was charged with attempted homicide and CARDINAL counts of armed robbery . The decision setting out the charges against the applicant was further amended on CARDINAL occasions .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the courts prolonged the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention on CARDINAL occasions . The relevant decisions were given , respectively , by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE and DATE , ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) on DATE , DATE and DATE and ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) on DATE . ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In all those decisions the courts relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged , which was supported by evidence from witnesses and experts . They attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a heavy sentence being imposed on the applicant . They further considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation , especially the need to verify evidence from the suspects and witnesses , justified holding him in custody .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings , the courts informed the prosecutor and the applicant \u2019s lawyer about the dates of the sessions concerning the review of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention . Nevertheless , the applicant \u2019s lawyer failed to appear at the sessions .", "CARDINAL . NORP The representatives of the prosecution participated in all court sessions relating to the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention and were invited to state their position as to the necessity of keeping the applicant in custody .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the relevant penitentiary court had ordered that the applicant serve a sentence of imprisonment imposed in other criminal proceedings . He served that sentence from DATE ( the date of his arrest in the present case ) to DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a session held on DATE , at which the applicant \u2019s lawyer was present , ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , repeating the grounds that had been given in the previous decisions and DATE more particularly \u2013 relying on the need to secure and supplement evidence gathered in the investigation . That decision and the reasons therefor were upheld on appeal on DATE at a session at which the applicant \u2019s lawyer was present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted before ORG on charges of attempted homicide , armed robbery , burglary and having intentionally impeded the apprehension of an arrestable offender . The bill of indictment comprised CARDINAL accused . In all , CARDINAL charges were brought against them . The principal accused , a certain PERSON , was charged with CARDINAL counts of homicide , CARDINAL counts of attempted homicide , several counts of incitement to homicide and several counts of armed robbery . The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant and his CARDINAL co - defendants be kept in custody until DATE . The court referred to a strong likelihood that he had committed the serious offences with which he had been charged and stressed that a heavy penalty might be imposed on him . It considered that the severity of the anticipated penalty could by itself be a sufficient ground for continuing the detention in order to secure the proper course of the proceedings . In that context , the court added that both the gravity of the charges and the applicable sentence justified the conclusion that the defendants , if released , would obstruct the trial for fear of having that sentence executed .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the case was referred to ORG , within whose territorial jurisdiction the offences in question had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , under LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until DATE . It reiterated the grounds previously given for his detention . On DATE ORG , ruling on the applicant \u2019s appeal , upheld the decision and added that it should be based on LAW since the applicant \u2019s detention had already exceeded the statutory time - limit of DATE laid down in that provision , it being immaterial that during most of that period he had served the earlier sentence of imprisonment . ORG fully shared the lower court \u2019s view that there were valid grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was subsequently prolonged under LAW on many occasions .", "CARDINAL . The relevant decisions were given on the following dates .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be held in custody until DATE . On DATE that court ordered his continued detention until DATE but then amended its decision and set the deadline for DATE . This was due to the fact that after DATE only ORG could prolong his detention beyond the term laid down in LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . On DATE it prolonged his detention until DATE . On DATE it ordered that the applicant be kept in custody until DATE . The next decision was given on DATE ; it extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It was followed by the decision of DATE , whereby the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . All the decisions reiterated the grounds previously given for the applicant \u2019s detention , most notably the reasonable suspicion of his having committed the offences in question and the severity of the anticipated penalty which , in the ORG opinion , justified keeping him in custody to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . ORG also held that the proceedings had not been unduly protracted and that the frequent adjournments had been caused by events for which ORG could not be held responsible .", "CARDINAL . All appeals and applications for release filed by the applicant \u2013 who repeatedly contested the factual basis for the charges against him and invoked the principle of the presumption of innocence \u2013 were to no avail .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the court held a number of hearings scheduled for various dates , some of which were cancelled or adjourned due to the absence of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants , some of whom had been released , or the fact that the defendants still in detention had not been brought to trial from prison . As of DATE , the trial court had heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment . The applicant was convicted and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . He appealed . The applicant \u2019s detention was subsequently prolonged on CARDINAL occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the impugned judgment . The applicant failed to inform ORG whether he lodged a cassation appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL .
