THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE , and , at the time of the introduction of the application , was detained in the GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "", "On DATE , the applicant , an employee of ORG , was arrested and taken into detention on suspicion of embezzlement and of having been involved in a robbery committed on DATE at FAC . On DATE , following the applicant \u2019s appeal against a decision of CARDINAL DATE prolonging his pre - trail detention , ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE ordered the applicant \u2019s release from pre - trial detention .", "After an initial summons had been withdrawn , the applicant was summoned to appear on DATE before ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE . The judges dealing with his case would be PERSON as President , and PERSON and PERSON", "On DATE , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against the summons . On DATE , after having deliberated , ORG sitting in chambers ( Arrondissementsrechtbank in Raadkamer ) , composed of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , rejected the objection . Subsequently and on DATE , ORG commenced its examination of the charges brought against the applicant .", "As the composition of ORG was the same as that of ORG sitting in chambers that had rejected the objection against the summons , the defence challenged ( wraking ) the CARDINAL judges . After having deliberated , CARDINAL other judges of ORG rejected the challenge . ORG , in its original composition , then resumed its examination of the applicant \u2019s case .", "In the course of DATE , ORG took a short break in order to hand down its judgment in the criminal proceedings that had been brought against the coaccused R.M. Sitting in the same composition as in the applicant \u2019s case , ORG convicted PERSON of the robbery committed on DATE .", "After having become aware of this , the applicant challenged ORG for a second time when DATE the court resumed its examination of his case . After having deliberated , CARDINAL other judges of ORG rejected the challenge . ORG , in its initial composition , resumed its examination . It considered a request of the defence to take evidence from TIME witnesses , ordered that evidence should be taken from CARDINAL of them and adjourned its further examination .", "On DATE , ORG heard evidence from the CARDINAL witnesses whose appearance it had ordered on DATE and heard the parties\u2019 final pleadings .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of robbery committed on DATE at FAC , and participation in the commission of unlawful deprivation of liberty and embezzlement . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "On DATE , ORG started its examination of the applicant \u2019s appeal . Further hearings were held on DATE and DATE , in the course of which ORG , inter alia , heard a number of witnesses .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE . On the basis of the full rehearing on both facts and law that had taken place before it , ORG convicted the applicant of participation in a robbery and embezzlement , acquitted him of the remaining charges and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . It rejected the argument advanced by the defence that , given the composition of ORG , the case should be referred back to ORG as ORG that had convicted the applicant could not be considered as an impartial tribunal in that the same judges had rejected the applicant \u2019s objection against the summons and had already formed a view on the matter in that they had already convicted a co - accused . The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "By judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal in cassation . It rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments in relation to the alleged partiality of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
