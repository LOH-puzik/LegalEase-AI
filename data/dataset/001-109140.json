The background of this case was a civil dispute between ORG and GPE over the villa that the latter had built . The court noted that both parties had their arguments , more or less justified , but it was not the court \u2019s role to adjudicate on this conflict , since its final outcome was already before a civil court . The court further referred to expert evidence ( several opinions ) obtained in the criminal and civil proceedings from which it appeared that indeed part of GPE \u2019s allegations against PERSON as regards the quality of the construction works was substantiated .
