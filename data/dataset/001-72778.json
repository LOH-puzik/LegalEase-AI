{"ITEMID": "001-72778", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "CODONA v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives near GPE , GPE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant is a gypsy . She lived with her young son and other members of her extended family in caravans on what has become known as Plot CARDINAL Woodside Caravan Park at ORG , near PERSON in GPE ( \u2018 the Site\u2019 ) . ORG ( \u2018 the Council\u2019 ) was responsible for planning control in relation to the Site and was also the responsible housing authority .", "The applicant moved with other gypsies onto the Site with their caravans in DATE , in breach of planning control . Over time , the Site became divided into CARDINAL plots . ORG first learned in DATE that gypsies were occupying the Site . In DATE , the ORG served enforcement and stop notices on the occupiers of the ORG under the provisions of ORG DATE . The occupiers appealed . It is not clear from the materials submitted whether the applicant was amongst those who appealed .", "Following a local public inquiry held in DATE , a planning inspector dismissed the appeals by decision letter dated DATE . He gave the occupiers DATE within which to comply with the enforcement and stop notices , so as to enable them to apply for planning permission in respect of smaller area . It appears that they took no steps to comply with either set of notices . In DATE or DATE the ORG resolved to take enforcement action by way of injunction or prosecution ; at about the same time , the occupiers , styling themselves \u201c the owners of FAC \u201d made a further planning application , essentially to continue its use , albeit with more landscaping . Again , it is not clear from the materials submitted whether the applicant was involved in the making of this application .", "In DATE , shortly after the expiry of DATE period of grace given by the inspector , the ORG refused the application for planning permission . Following inquiry , the inspector dismissed the ORG appeal in DATE .", "DATE , before the ORG could put into motion steps to evict the occupiers , the latter , including the applicant , made CARDINAL planning applications in respect of individual plots on the site . In DATE , the ORG refused the majority of the applications , including those of the applicant . The applicant and CARDINAL other occupiers each appealed the refusal in their individual case .", "In the meantime , in DATE , the ORG issued proceedings for injunctions against named and un - named occupiers of the Site . The latter responded in DATE by seeking and obtaining permission to apply for judicial review , it appears against the decision to issue these proceedings .", "In DATE and DATE an inspector held an inquiry into the CARDINAL individual appeals . In DATE , the inspector dismissed each of them . The ORG then immediately sought and obtained ( after DATE hearing , at which evidence was given ) an injunction against her and all the other occupiers of the Site to remove themselves , their caravans , all hard standings and associated materials from the Site by DATE ( \u2018 the ORG ) .", "The applicant responded by making a further planning application , this time in relation to CARDINAL plots on the land . The ORG refused to determine this application because of its close similarity to the previous application . The applicant sought without success on paper to obtain permission to claim judicial review in respect of that decision . At about the same time she and other occupiers applied both to ORG to vary the terms of the injunction as to the date when they should leave the Site and also to the ORG for accommodation as homeless persons under the provisions of Part VII of LAW ( \u2018 the DATE Act\u2019 ) .", "In DATE , ORG refused the ORG application for variation of the injunction and refused them permission to appeal . Very shortly thereafter the ORG exercised its power under s.CARDINAL Town and Country Planning Act DATE to clear the majority of the occupiers from the Site , but not the applicant , who with her family continued to occupy so - called LAW ( with CARDINAL caravans ) .", "In DATE , ORG refused the occupiers permission to appeal the decision of ORG . The applicant did not seek to renew orally her judicial review application in respect of the ORG \u2019s refusal to entertain her application for planning permission , on the ORG agreeing not to enforce the injunction without giving her and her family DATE notice of its intention to do so and to consider and determine their homeless applications ( one made on DATE and a revised one made on DATE , the former ultimately being subsumed into the latter ) .", "In that homelessness application , the applicant explained that she had an aversion to conventional \u201c bricks and mortar \u201d and that she :", "\u201c ... [ did ] not wish to be given bricks and mortar . She has always lived in a caravan , has only spent TIME in a building in her life . PERSON wishes to live in a caravan and have the support of her extended family around her . \u201d", "On DATE , the ORG , acting through ORG ( to which it had delegated its housing function ) ( \u2018 the Association\u2019 ) , accepted its duty under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act to provide the applicant and her family with suitable accommodation . The ORG concluded that they could only offer them \u201c bricks and mortar \u201d accommodation in a \u201c bed and breakfast establishment \u201d until it could make a final offer of accommodation acceptable to them . The letter read to the applicant read in relevant part as follows :", "\u201c The ORG ... have a duty to secure suitable accommodation is available for your occupation and , in doing so , shall have regard to all the relevant circumstances relating to you and those who normally reside with you or might reasonably be expected to reside with you .", "The ORG is aware that there are CARDINAL / CARDINAL caravans on Plot CARDINAL , GPE , ORG , the occupants of which you have included in your homelessness application . The ORG is also aware that you consider the occupants of these other vehicles as part of your immediate household and that you have requested that they be accommodated with you . In your application you have also indicated that you do not wish to live in accommodation made of bricks and mortar and that you would consider the offer of a plot / piece of land .", "Unfortunately , as you aware from previous meetings , the ORG is unable to offer land , and can only secure accommodation from either its own housing stock or , on some occasions , property owned by ORG also operating within LOC . Further , it is also highly unlikely the ORG will be able to secure a single property large enough to accommodate all the occupants of Plot CARDINAL , FAC . However , given that each family occupying DATE resided in their own separate unit of accommodation , the ORG does not consider it unreasonable to offer an individual property for each family on Plot CARDINAL and will endeavour to ensure the properties offered are in as close proximity to each other as is reasonably possible . \u201d", "The applicant sought to clarify what accommodation the ORG was intending to offer her ; they made it clear that they were intending , in the short term , to offer her bed and breakfast accommodation . Through her solicitor , the applicant sought an internal review of this decision pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW . On DATE , the decision was upheld . The ORG wrote in the following terms :", "\u201c In relation to the question about reasonableness [ sic ] of an offer of ORG or other temporary accommodation I have reached the following conclusions :", "...", "[ LAW and LAW ( DATE ) ] ... provide clarity of what constitutes suitable accommodation . ORG is deemed to be suitable accommodation particularly as ... the ORG have already confirmed that they will take all reasonable steps to minimise its use . Wherever reasonably practicable the offer of any temporary accommodation would be within Mid Beds and that such accommodation as would be provided would be fit for occupation and would not result in statutory overcrowding [ a reference to section CARDINAL of LAW ] .", "... I note your concerns regarding a stay in bricks and mortar accommodation and would certainly not underestimate the differences [ sic ] which you would have to face having always lived in a caravan . I understand that you are concerned about living without the support of your family but again ... [ the ORG ] have advised that all practical steps would be taken to accommodate you as a close family unit .", "Therefore having fully considered the details of your case and your cultural aversion to bricks and mortar as detailed ... I find that , while sympathetic to them , I must also take into consideration the general makeup and stock of the housing within the area and also the availability of suitable accommodation and this leaves us with no alternative but to offer bricks and mortar accommodation . \u201d", "The applicant then applied to ORG for a statutory review pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW . She advanced multiple grounds , but CARDINAL of them , the question of whether the accommodation offered was suitable , was considered at length , the others being found to be entirely groundless . ORG found : ( CARDINAL ) that the ORG had accepted and continued to accept that it owed a statutory duty to the applicant and her family to secure that suitable accommodation was made available to them ; and ( CARDINAL ) the applicant had a \u201c cultural \u201d aversion to living in \u201c bricks and mortar \u201d accommodation . However , the court also accepted that the ORG did not have any land available for the applicant or members of her family to pitch their caravans , such that it was impossible for it to offer what she wanted . ORG judge considered the position by reference to domestic decisions which had , in turn , considered the jurisprudence of this Court . The judge considered that he was bound by the decision in R ( Price ) v ORG [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ( in which the case of PERSON v. the GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI had itself been the subject of consideration ) . ORG in Price found that , while it was necessary that special consideration be given to the position of gypsies as a minority , it could not be argued that an offer or bricks and mortar accommodation could never constitute a suitable alternative accommodation for a Gypsy with a cultural aversion to bricks and mortar .", "ORG found that \u201c to impose on ORG a duty to produce a pitch or berth for CARDINAL or CARDINAL caravans is not supported by statute or by case law , whether in this country or in LOC . \u201d It also found that , while the ORG had not expressly considered Articles CARDINAL or DATE , it had proceeded in a way compatible with their requirements . The court therefore found that , in the circumstances , the ORG \u2019s offer was an adequate discharge of its duty under section CARDINAL .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , which dismissed her application for permission to appeal on DATE . ORG found that , while an empty pitch is not itself \u201c accommodation \u201d for purposes of CARDINAL , a council could , by making it available as a site to pitch a caravan , and with the agreement of the individual , be said to have discharged its duty under the section . ORG therefore considered at some length the question of whether bricks and mortar accommodation could be said to be \u201c suitable \u201d for a Gypsy with a cultural aversion to bricks and mortar . It considered the same domestic cases as had been considered by the lower court , as well as PERSON , and found there to be CARDINAL main criteria for assessing the suitability of accommodation offered :", "\u201c CARDINAL ) suitability to a [ ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL KB CARDINAL ] minimum level of suitability in the nature , location and standard of condition of the accommodation having regard to the circumstances of the applicant and his or her resident family including the duration of their likely occupation of it ; CARDINAL ) the absolute nature of the duty which , though , coupled with an elastic concept of suitability is not elastic as to allow an offer below the ORG minimum standard ( or ... outside the margin of appreciation ) ; and CARDINAL ) special consideration , in the regulatory and decision - making in individual cases , for the housing needs of particularly vulnerable applicants such as traditional gypsies with a view , so far as is practicable and when considered with all other circumstances , to facilitating their traditional way of life . \u201d", "ORG found that , if the ORG had carried out a genuine consideration of a ORG needs ,", "\u201c where land is not available , or can not readily be made available , on which a Gypsy applicant can station his or her caravan , it is open to a local authority to provide other accommodation of the conventional bricks and mortar kind , providing that it satisfies the ORG minimum line of suitability . \u201d", "ORG found that the ORG and first instance judge had correctly identified and applied the relevant principles in the applicant \u2019s case . It also considered that the first instance judge had properly considered the Article CARDINAL question in his own right .", "ORG noted that the ORG was required as \u201c as a matter of relative urgency to find accommodation for an extended family occupying CARDINAL or CARDINAL caravans , who were insisting , because of their aversion to conventional housing , on being provided with an alternative site for all of their caravans on which they could continue to live together . \u201d As with the first instance court , ORG found that there was no such site available , nor was the ORG immediately able to provide long - term conventional bricks and mortar accommodation for the extended family .", "It therefore concluded that , \u201c depending on the quality of bed and breakfast accommodation offered and , on the reasonable assumption that the ORG will see to it that their stay will only be for a short time , \u201d the ORG by offering bed and breakfast accommodation had discharged its duty under section CARDINAL and had acted compatibly with ORG CARDINAL and/or CARDINAL . It added the caveat that bed and breakfast accommodation could become unsuitable either under domestic law or by reference to LAW if too long a period elapsed before the provision either of conventional housing or , if it could be found , a caravan site .", "ORG refused the applicant permission to appeal on DATE on the basis that her petition did not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by the ORG at that time , given that it had already been the subject of judicial decision .", "On DATE , the ORG reassessed the applicant and made a further offer of temporary accommodation . This was refused by letter dated DATE . No details of the accommodation offered at that point have been provided by the applicant . It is in particular not clear whether the ORG offered bed and breakfast or permanent settled accommodation and/or whether it restated its view that there were no suitable caravan sites available .", "On DATE ( and again on DATE ) , the ORG gave notice of its intention to enforce the injunction ; ORG dismissed an application for judicial review of the ORG \u2019s decision on DATE .", "The applicant and her family vacated the Site on or before DATE . It appears that they are now on unauthorised sites , and the applicant \u2019s family is split because they have been unable to find a site where they can remain together . She contends that she ( and her family ) are now vulnerable to proceedings for possession from local authorities and private landowners , and also to the imposition of removal directions and/or possible criminal proceedings under sections DATE , CARDINALA - E , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG .", "The applicant has submitted a press release from ORG Deputy Prime Minister dated DATE , from which it appears that the ORG is consulting on a revision to the directions given to local authorities with a specific view to increasing the number of authorised caravan sites available for use by travellers and gypsies .", "Local authority duties to the homeless are provided in Part VII of LAW . Section CARDINAL provides , in material part :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This section applies where the local housing authority are satisfied that an applicant is homeless , eligible for assistance and has a priority need , and are not satisfied that he became homeless intentionally .", "( CARDINAL ) Unless the authority refer the application to another local housing authority ( see section CARDINAL ) , they shall secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provides , again in material part ,", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A local housing authority may discharge their housing functions under this Part only in the following ways \u2013", "( a ) by securing that suitable accommodation provided by them is available ,", "... \u201d", "There is no definition of the word \u201c suitable \u201d in this section .", "By section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW", "\u201c A person is also homeless if he has accommodation but \u2013", "...", "( b ) it consists of a moveable structure , vehicle or vessel designed or adapted for human habitation and there is no place where he is entitled or permitted both to place it and to reside in it . \u201d", "The meaning of the word \u201c suitable \u201d within the context of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act has been considered in several domestic cases . The most relevant is that of R ( Price ) v ORG [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) , in which the main issue was whether the Gypsy in question had a cultural aversion to bricks and mortar . However , ORG had to consider as a starting point whether such an aversion of itself could prevent an offer of such accommodation from amounting to an offer of suitable accommodation . ORG , expressly considering itself to be following PERSON , accepted that it was incumbent on local authorities to give effect to the positive obligation imposed on contracting GPE under LAW to facilitate the Gypsy way of life , but found that , had the respondent council concluded that :", "\u201c the claimant \u2019s cultural commitment to traditional life was so powerful as to present great difficulties in her living in conventional housing , it was not bound by duty to find her a pitch , but it would have been a significant factor in considering how far it should go to facilitate her traditional way of life . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
