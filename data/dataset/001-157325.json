De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in GPE and claimed that she had arrived in GPE on DATE . In an interview with ORG ( Migrationsverket ) , at which she was informed that a search in the NORP asylum fingerprint database EURODAC had revealed that she had applied for asylum in the GPE in DATE , the applicant stated that she had arrived in GPE in DATE from the GPE and had remained illegally in GPE since then . She had been afraid to contact the NORP authorities since she did not want to be returned to the GPE as she would be sent TIME to GPE where she had no housing or opportunity to support herself . She wanted to remain in GPE where cousins of hers were living .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had applied for asylum in the GPE DATE under a different name and birth date \u2013 ORG requested that that country take her back in accordance with LAW . The NORP authorities refused , however , as she had previously applied for asylum in GPE , under a slightly different name than that given to ORG . The NORP authorities were then requested to take back the applicant . The NORP authorities did not reply to the request within the prescribed time - limit and were consequently , under LAW , considered to have agreed to receive her . Accordingly , on DATE , ORG dismissed the asylum application and decided to transfer the applicant to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the decision became time - barred before the transfer could be realised . On DATE the applicant therefore applied for asylum and a residence permit in GPE again . At an asylum interview in DATE , which lasted for DATE , she submitted essentially the following . In DATE her family had forced her to marry an older man against her will . At the time she had for DATE had a secret relationship with a boy from school . This relationship was revealed DATE after the forced marriage when the applicant and her boyfriend had tried to escape from GPE together . They had been detected by her uncles when they had been sitting on the loading platform of a truck . Both she and her boyfriend had been beaten and thrown off the truck . She had sustained injuries to her hips and had been hospitalised for DATE . Thereafter she had lived at home until DATE when her father had considered that her health condition permitted her to move in with her husband . She had then contacted her boyfriend and they had fled together , first to GPE and then to GPE and eventually to GPE in order to take a boat to GPE . However , the boat had sunk and the boyfriend had died . Later , while in GPE , she had learned that her father had died in DATE and her mother in DATE . If returned to GPE , the applicant claimed that she would have to return to the man whom she had been forced to marry , unless she were sentenced to death for fleeing the marriage and the country . These threats would be carried out by her uncles . The applicant further asserted that she lacked a male support network in GPE and therefore risked being sexually assaulted . As a single woman , she would further not be able to rent accommodation or otherwise organise her life and would risk becoming a social outcast . She also invoked the generally dire humanitarian situation in GPE and , in particular , claimed that she was unlikely to find the help still needed for her injured hips .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for asylum and ordered her deportation to GPE . At the outset , the ORG found that she had failed to substantiate her identity , noting in particular that she had not submitted any identification papers and had previously applied for asylum in the GPE and GPE under different identities . However , it found it plausible that the applicant originated from GPE . Noting that she had arrived in GPE in DATE but had not applied for asylum until DATE and had thus not reported a need for protection during a period of DATE the ORG called into question whether she had felt a real need for protection . Turning to the substantive allegations presented by the applicant in support of her application , the ORG considered that they were marred with credibility issues . For example , in her initial asylum application in DATE , she had stated that she was unmarried . Only during the asylum investigation following her renewed application in DATE had she claimed that she had married in GPE in DATE . ORG found that the applicant had failed to provide a sufficient explanation for this , particularly given that this was a crucial part of her story . Furthermore , in DATE she had only invoked the armed conflict in the country as grounds for asylum and had stated that she could not remember how she had sustained the hip injury since she had been very young at the time . She had then also said that she had stayed with a female friend in GPE before leaving the country whereas she later claimed that she had lived with her parents and siblings .", "ORG concluded that the applicant had failed to make plausible that she had been subjected to any ill - treatment by her relatives in GPE and consequently had failed to show that she would lack a male support network there . It noted that , according to the applicant , her brother and uncles still lived in GPE . Moreover , the ORG examined the general situation in GPE and the particular situation of women , based on information gathered at a fact - finding mission to the city in DATE and further information obtained thereafter , and considered that the circumstances were not of such severity that the applicant would be unable to return there , taking into account the finding that she had a male network to protect her . In this connection , ORG also noted that the applicant had not lived in a refugee camp before leaving the country and had not claimed that she would risk doing so upon return .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( NORP - domstolen ) , maintaining her claims and adding , inter alia , the following . The security situation in GPE was still very unstable and the particular situation of women in GPE was extremely severe . She further asserted that , as her situation in GPE had been difficult , it was understandable that she had decided to apply for asylum under another identity in the GPE , in order to avoid being sent back . This had also been the reason why she had decided to stay illegally in GPE . Moreover , she stated that ORG had misunderstood her ; she had stayed with a female friend in GPE , not in GPE where she had lived with her family . Furthermore , in her view , she was not married since she had not consented to the marriage or been present at the marriage ceremony . She submitted an x - ray image of her hip prostheses to show that she had been assaulted and injured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , agreeing with ORG reasoning and findings . The court subscribed to all the misgivings concerning credibility expressed by ORG . It added that , whereas the applicant initially had claimed to have been forcibly married in DATE , in a later submission to the ORG she had stated that this had been decided by her father and her uncles in DATE . Since the applicant was in general not credible , the court did not believe her statement that she lacked a male support network in GPE . Moreover , it considered that the submitted x - ray image did not show that the applicant had been subjected to ill - treatment in her home country .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant requested that ORG re - examine her case , claiming that there were impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order . She stated that she had recently found out that her uncle , who had previously physically assaulted her , had now joined ORG , and that he had killed her sister and forced her brother to join ORG . Thus , if returned to GPE , she would risk being stoned to death by her uncle .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the petition , finding that no new circumstances justifying a reconsideration had been presented . It held that the alleged threats stemming from the applicant \u2019s uncles had already been examined by ORG and that , given her lack of credibility , a mere statement from her about her uncle \u2019s actions was not sufficient to assume that she would risk being stoned upon return . The applicant did not appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
