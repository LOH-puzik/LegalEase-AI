It also pointed out that the issue of whether the applicant was guilty of the crimes in respect of which the NORP authorities had requested his extradition could only be assessed by a court in the requesting country examining the merits of the criminal case against him . Hence , the applicant \u2019s arguments that he was not guilty and that the charges against him were fabricated could not be subject to examination in the proceedings at hand . The court concluded that the extradition order was lawful and well founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the ORG decision , arguing that the decision on the applicant \u2019s extradition had been taken in violation of ORG , DATE , DATE and DATE of LAW . With reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law and , in particular , to the judgment in case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( no .

The applicant argued that he had been questioned by the police of GPE on several occasions since DATE , with a view to extracting a confession that he was a member of ORG . During CARDINAL of the interrogations , which took place on an unspecified date , the local police had handcuffed the applicant , severely beaten him and threatened him with torture .

The applicant referred to written statements from witnesses to the searches of the flat and interrogations of the applicant \u2019s relatives , carried out in connection with the applicant \u2019s request for refugee status ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Finally , the applicant made reference to reports by ORG on the question of torture dated DATE and DATE , as well as to ORG report dated DATE , from which it followed that a widespread practice of illtreatment of detainees remained a problem in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE examined the applicant \u2019s appeal in the presence of his counsel . The court established that the extradition order had been issued in accordance with law . Referring to the applicant \u2019s complaints that he risked ill - treatment and torture in GPE , the court reiterated that the applicant had never cited a risk of persecution and ill - treatment before the NORP authorities before his arrest on DATE . Furthermore , when questioned by the prosecutor on that date , he had submitted that he had arrived in GPE in order to look for work . He had not applied for refugee status on arrival in GPE in DATE , but had only done so after he had been placed in custody .", "CARDINAL . The court further pointed out that in DATE the applicant had returned to GPE to renew his passport . The authorities had not been searching for him . He had not been ill - treated , threatened or otherwise persecuted , and was able to renew his passport and return to GPE freely and unharmed . The court further noted that CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s children were living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Finally , it rejected the applicant \u2019s reference to several reports by independent international human rights protection associations , including the reports referred to in the PERSON case ( cited above ) , as outdated . The court pointed out that the competent domestic authorities had conducted checks through diplomatic channels and had concluded on the absence of any obstacles to the applicant \u2019s extradition . It found that ORG had not been in possession of any information on human rights violations in GPE in DATE when deciding on the extradition issue . The court concluded that the applicant \u2019s fear of ill - treatment and persecution if extradited was unfounded , and upheld ORG judgment of DATE . The extradition order became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General of GPE sent a letter to ORG , in addition to the extradition request of DATE . The letter contained assurances that the applicant would not be prosecuted in GPE on political grounds , and that the criminal proceedings against him would be conducted in compliance with the domestic law of GPE and international treaties to which GPE was a party . It was pointed out in the letter that all forms of inhuman and degrading treatment were prohibited in the destination country .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG of the ORG ( GPE ) received a request from ORG of the ORG ( GPE ) to keep the applicant in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor of ORG authorised his detention . The prosecutor observed that on DATE the applicant had been placed on a wanted list and ORG had ordered his placement in custody , and that on DATE the applicant had been charged with several offences in his home country . Therefore , the prosecution was in possession of information that the applicant had committed crimes on the territory of GPE . Accordingly , the applicant could be remanded in custody , as provided by LAW on legal aid and legal relations in civil , family and criminal cases ( the DATE Minsk Convention ) . No time - limits for the detention were set in the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG to extradite the applicant to GPE . The NORP authority enclosed copies of the relevant documents , apparently including a copy of the judgment of ORG of DATE . According to the ORG , the request was received by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the decision of ORG ( GPE ) of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on DATE the prosecutor of ORG issued a new decision to remand the applicant in custody until DATE . The prosecutor referred to LAW ORG and LAW . The parties did not submit a copy of that decision .", "CARDINAL . At some point the Perovskiy Inter - District Prosecutor \u2019s Office requested an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention , because the necessary checks within the extradition proceedings had not been completed , further information on the applicant \u2019s character needed to be obtained , and the extradition proceedings were lengthy by nature .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The applicant was represented in the proceedings by a ORG - appointed lawyer . The court stated by way of justification that the applicant had been charged with serious offences in GPE , had been placed in custody on the basis of a court decision of a foreign ORG , did not have a permanent place of residence in GPE , and therefore could abscond if released . The court observed that the applicant had not applied for NORP citizenship . The court also found that further checks were needed in the course of the extradition proceedings , which would require additional time \u201c for objective reasons \u201d . When granting the extension , the court referred to the provisions of LAW", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not lodge an ordinary appeal against the decision . He subsequently attempted to challenge the decision by way of supervisory review , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL of DATE by ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , with reference to LAW ORG , in order to secure the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE . The court found that the applicant had been charged with serious offences in GPE , which were also punishable under the NORP criminal law . He had not applied for NORP citizenship and did not have refugee status in GPE . The court also took into account the applicant \u2019s personality , referring to the fact that he had been unemployed and had no permanent residence in GPE . The court considered that the applicant was likely to abscond if released . The court further noted that extradition proceedings were pending at the material time , and considered that the extension of the detention period was objectively justified by the need to complete the extradition procedure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not challenge the decision on appeal .", "CARDINAL . At some point the prosecutor of GPE requested a further extension of the applicant \u2019s detention . The applicant argued in reply that he had not committed any crimes in GPE . The applicant \u2019s lawyer pointed out that the applicant had complained to ORG , and that his case was pending before the ORG at the material time , and requested the applicant \u2019s release . The parties did not submit copies of those requests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the period of the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE . The court allowed the prosecutor \u2019s argument that the extension was necessary in order to secure the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE . The period of the applicant \u2019s detention was assessed by the court as reasonable , since it was justified by the necessity to comply with the extradition procedure . The court found that the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s case requiring his placement in custody had not changed . The court pointed out that the applicant \u2019s argument regarding the application of the interim measure under LAW could not be taken into account , since ORG had not examined the applicant \u2019s case on the merits at the material time and , in any event , the application of an interim measure did not constitute a ground for release . The court further rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that he had not committed the offences referred to , finding that \u201c such an argument was rebutted by the [ above ] documents \u201d and , in any event , that issue could not be subject to examination in the proceedings concerning the extension of the detention period . The court further observed that the applicant did not have a permanent place of residence in GPE and had not been granted refugee status . It noted that the applicant had been charged with serious and particularly serious crimes in GPE , which were also punishable under NORP law . The court further found that the applicant had previously absconded from the NORP authorities and therefore there were grounds to believe that he would flee from justice if released . It further decided , without giving further details , that the applicant \u2019s family situation , medical condition and age were compatible with his detention . The court concluded , with reference to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , that the applicant \u2019s detention should be further extended until DATE , that is for a total of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed against the extension . He requested the applicant \u2019s release from custody , with reference to the ORG \u2019s decision to apply Rule CARDINAL in his case , arguing that the applicant ran the risk of illtreatment in GPE . The representative further submitted that the applicant would not constitute a threat to GPE if released from custody . Finally , the representative argued that the applicant \u2019s criminal prosecution in GPE had not been in accordance with law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the extension . The court found that the decision on the applicant \u2019s extradition had been lawful and that it had become final . The court was not competent to review the reasonableness of the extradition decision in the proceedings at stake . When authorising the extension of the detention , the lower court had correctly found that the suspension of the extradition proceedings pursuant to the application of Rule CARDINAL of ORG did not constitute a ground for the applicant \u2019s release . ORG found that a custodial measure had been applied with a view to securing the extradition , and on account of the fact that the applicant did not have a permanent residence in GPE .", "DATE . On DATE the Perovskiy ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release from detention , against an undertaking not to leave the town . The prosecutor \u2019s office observed that the applicant \u2019s detention had previously been extended several times , and that the domestic courts had upheld as lawful the Prosecutor General \u2019s decision to extradite the applicant to GPE . The court further noted that he had an application pending before ORG , and found that the applicant \u201c could reside on the territory of GPE pending [ his ] extradition \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from custody . It appears that the release order was not appealed against .", "CARDINAL . It follows from the decision of the ORG of DATE that on DATE the applicant applied to ORG of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) as a person seeking asylum on the territory of GPE . On an unknown date he was issued with a certificate of refugee status , not further specified , valid until DATE , by ORG in GPE . According to the applicant \u2019s representative , the applicant had been recognised as a refugee under the mandate of the ORG . The parties have not submitted any documents or further details in this respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when interviewed by an assistant prosecutor of ORG immediately after his arrest , the applicant stated that he was looking for work and needed to provide his family with financial support , and gave these statements as the reasons for his moving to GPE . He submitted that since DATE , the date of his arrival in GPE , he had not registered as a foreign national temporarily residing in the country . He stated that he had not been aware of any charges against him in GPE , had not been persecuted on political grounds in his home country , and had not applied for refugee status in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not represented by a lawyer at the interview . He produced a handwritten note to certify that he did not need the assistance of a lawyer or an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with the ORG for refugee status in GPE . In his application he submitted , in particular , that since DATE he had been persecuted in GPE on political grounds . He was a practising NORP . He had been repeatedly arrested by LOC police and questioned in connection with his alleged membership of extremist organisations . The police had repeatedly searched his apartment in GPE without producing any documents authorising the searches . The police ordered him to report to a local police station DATE . Convinced that his persecution would continue , in DATE the applicant had left GPE for GPE , where he started working as a driver . He had settled in GPE with his family , including QUANTITY of his CARDINAL minor children . He argued that he had not committed the offences he was accused of , had never been a member of proscribed religious organisations , and had not attempted to overthrow the government . He submitted , without further details , that \u201c all his next of kin and friends \u201d had been prosecuted in GPE on political grounds . He concluded that he ran a real risk of illtreatment if returned to his home country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was questioned by the assistant prosecutor of ORG and submitted that he had been persecuted in GPE in connection with his alleged membership of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , assisted by a lawyer and an interpreter , was interviewed by ORG officers . He stated that he was being sought by the NORP authorities for political crimes and he had left GPE out of fear of ill - treatment by the local police . He practised ORG , and when in GPE he had been openly persecuted by the authorities for his religious beliefs . It appears that the applicant \u2019s lawyer referred to several statements by eyewitnesses to the searches of the applicant \u2019s flat . The statements were produced in NORP . The applicant did not submit a translation or a summary of their contents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the ORG refused his request for refugee status , stating that the applicant had failed to provide sufficient evidence that he risked ill - treatment if extradited to GPE . He had failed to apply for asylum in due time after his arrival in GPE . The ORG noted that on DATE the applicant had applied to ORG of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees and had been issued with \u201c a certificate valid until DATE \u201d . At the same time , the ORG noted that he had introduced his application for refugee status only after his arrest . Furthermore , when questioned on the date of his arrest in GPE , the applicant stated that he had been unaware of the charges against him and had arrived in GPE looking for employment .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , the ORG observed , with reference to the charging order by the NORP authorities of DATE , that the applicant had been placed on a wanted list and was facing serious charges in GPE . The ORG cited the testimony of the applicant \u2019s former colleague PERSON , who had allegedly influenced the applicant to join ORG . In DATE the applicant had allegedly spread ORG ideas among NORP youth and been active in organising local branches of ORG , despite numerous warnings by the local law - enforcement authorities .", "CARDINAL . The migration authority concluded that the applicant had failed to apply for refugee status in a timely manner , and that the grounds referred to by the applicant were insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a wellfounded fear of persecution in his home country .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG of GPE against the decision of DATE , submitting that the NORP authorities were persecuting him on religious grounds in connection with his alleged membership of ORG , a banned religious organisation . He reiterated that , given the nature of the charges against him , he ran a risk of ill - treatment in custody if extradited to GPE , and his family could also become subject to persecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s appeal in the presence of his lawyer and dismissed it . The court observed that before his arrest the applicant had been living in GPE with his wife and CARDINAL minor children . The court found no evidence that the applicant \u2019s arrival in GPE had been caused by any form of political persecution . It pointed out that the applicant had failed to apply for asylum within DATE of crossing the NORP border in DATE , as required by the domestic law , and an application for refugee status had only been introduced by him after the arrest . The court endorsed the ORG conclusion that the underlying reason for the applicant \u2019s asylum request was an attempt to avoid criminal responsibility in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( according to the applicant ) or on CARDINAL DATE ( according to the authorities ) the applicant \u2019s lawyer introduced an appeal against the decision . The applicant \u2019s representative argued , in particular , that the applicant was being unlawfully prosecuted in GPE in violation of his right guaranteed by LAW . The ORG had disregarded the applicant \u2019s arguments regarding fear of persecution and ill - treatment for him and his family , as well as the ORG statements . The charges against him had been fabricated and the prosecution case was extremely weak . The applicant had not committed the offences imputed to him . Nonetheless , he had been questioned by local law - enforcement authorities , and his flat had been searched on several occasions . He had left GPE fearing further persecution . Contrary to the ORG arguments , in DATE the applicant had applied to ORG of the ORG . The applicant had not been aware that criminal proceedings had been pending against him at the time of his arrest . This is why he had not lodged a request for refugee status on the date of his arrest , but had only done so in DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that at some point a domestic court extended a DATE time - limit for introduction of the grounds of appeal and accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment for examination . The hearing on the applicant \u2019s appeal was initially scheduled for DATE , but was subsequently postponed to CARDINAL DATE , due to the parties\u2019 failure to appear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance court \u2019s decision in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer . It found that the first - instance court had correctly established the facts of the case . The court observed that the applicant \u2019s elder brother , his sister and the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL minor children were living in GPE at the material time . The court further reproduced verbatim the first - instance court \u2019s conclusion that the applicant had failed to apply for refugee status in a timely manner and had not produced sufficient evidence that he would be subjected to persecution if extradited to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request for temporary asylum to the FMS GPE .

According to the applicant , on DATE ( or on DATE , as cited in the judgment of ORG of DATE , see paragraph DATE below ) the FMS GPE refused to grant him temporary asylum in GPE . The parties did not submit a copy of the decision in that respect . The applicant \u2019s statement of appeal and the firstinstance court \u2019s decision ( see paragraphs DATE below ) indicate that the application was rejected on the ground that there were no humanitarian grounds for temporary asylum to be granted . There was no evidence that the applicant needed medical care or that , in the event of his extradition to GPE , he would face a risk of being subjected to torture or illtreatment . According to the applicant \u2019s statement of appeal , the ORG found that reform of the system of administration of justice in GPE was under way , and that the destination country had signed various international human rights treaties and was pursuing a dynamic social , economic and cultural policy .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision to ORG . He argued , in particular , that he had consistently informed the authorities of his previous ill - treatment in GPE . He reiterated that on the date of his arrest he had told the authorities that he had arrived in GPE to look for work and not as an asylum - seeker , because he had not been informed of the purpose of the interview . Finally , he challenged the ORG \u2019s findings as regards the human rights instruments signed by GPE and recent developments in the social and economic policy of the destination country as irrelevant .", "DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal for lack of humanitarian grounds which could warrant granting him temporary asylum . The court observed , in particular , that the ORG \u2019s decision had been based on information provided by the LOC police authorities in GPE about the charges against him in the destination country . Further , in the court \u2019s view , the ORG had duly taken account of the applicant \u2019s arrest and detention on DATE pending extradition . The court concluded that the ORG refusal to grant him temporary asylum was lawful since , first , the applicant \u2019s health was satisfactory and he had not furnished a medical certificate confirming that he required medical care . Second , the court found that the applicant had not referred to \u201c specific indications that there existed a real threat to the applicant \u2019s security \u201d or that he had been persecuted by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL .
