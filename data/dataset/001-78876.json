On DATE ORG discontinued the enforcement proceedings ...", "The court considered :", "The content of the open letter dated DATE from the defendant to the claimant , which was received by a large number of people and institutions , constitutes a ground for allowing the application under section CARDINAL of LAW . That letter contains untrue information about the claimant and the authority of which he is the head . The [ court 's ] assessment of the evidence showed that it was not true that a document had been lost from the case file in one of the cases examined by ORG , that documents had been forged , or that ORG had sought to intimidate the defendant or had acted maliciously against him . Nor is it true that the claimant violated the defendant 's rights by instituting enforcement proceedings , in the course of which he broke the law and abused his authority . The investigation carried out in respect of the [ lost ] document did not establish the time or place of its disappearance . The defendant did not prove that the maps prepared by ORG were forgeries or that ORG had acted improperly , still less , maliciously . These are the defendant 's impressions which are arbitrary and unsupported by evidence . All of the proceedings which were pending before ORG were instituted and carried out on the basis of applicable law and the defendant exercised his right to appeal against individual decisions . It was established that the proceedings were conducted speedily , as evidenced by the dates on which they were instituted and on which they ended . As regards the claimant 's statement in ' Gazeta Wroc\u0142awska ' the court found credible his claims that the statement had not been approved beforehand and so might be inaccurate and that the claimant could not speak about a sewer which had existed in the place he had indicated .", "In these circumstances , the court finds the application founded and , pursuant to section DATE subsections CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW , rules as in the operative part \u201d", "CARDINAL .

He submitted that his open letter did not amount to electoral campaigning . He relied , inter alia , on LAW and submitted that his critical remarks concerned Mr PERSON as the head of an administrative authority . The criticism was based on shortcomings in the administrative proceedings in which the applicant was involved , as evidenced by numerous documents , relevant administrative decisions and statements of higher administrative authorities and of ORG . Furthermore , the applicant contested ORG finding that the information contained in the open letter was thoroughly . Further , he submitted that at the hearing ORG had prevented the applicant from making comprehensive submissions in reply to the claimant 's lengthy arguments and refused to admit evidence confirming the truthfulness of the statements contained in the open letter .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disputed ORG order to pay damages to ORG and argued that the claimant had not proved that he had suffered any damage . In respect of the order to make payment to the institution run by ORG , he denied that it was a charity . The applicant complained that ORG had allowed the claimant 's application in its entirety and made orders to pay damages and to make payment to a charity at the maximum end of the scale provided for by law . Further , the applicant referred to the fact that after the hearing before ORG his access to the case file had been impeded , despite the fact that an appeal had to be lodged within TIME after the firstinstance decision was pronounced .

Contrary to the appellant 's assertions , in order to achieve that aim it was not necessary to openly discourage [ the voters ] from voting for a particular candidate . It was enough that a recipient of information about a candidate should come to such a conclusion , which , given the open letter 's content , was very likely .", "The court concurs with ORG findings that the defendant did not prove that his allegations against the claimant were true and so justified his criticism . In fact , the allegations related to decisions issued by ORG and should not have been equated with the claimant as such . A legal right of appeal lay against the decisions [ and ] in most instances the defendant obtained favourable rulings .", "Against the background of those decisions , the applicant 's categorically negative assessment of ORG and the attribution of responsibility to the claimant as a person managing the ORG , coupled with the fact that this was made public were unwarranted and unjustified in law . The facts of the case appear to indicate unequivocally that the defendant transferred to the claimant an aversion to ORG he had developed because of dissatisfaction with CARDINAL of its decisions ; he had used this for the purposes of electoral propaganda , and this [ situation ] was rightly considered by ORG as amounting to a breach of section CARDINAL of LAW .... \u201c", "CARDINAL .
