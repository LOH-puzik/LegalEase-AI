However , the circumstances in which he was questioned can not be established from the evidence adduced by the parties .", "...", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was brought before ORG , composed of a single judge , who ordered his detention pending trial . Before the judge , the applicant denied all the accusations against him . He stated that he had not taken part in any armed attack . He also denied that a confrontation had been held on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and asserted that on DATE of his arrest he had been shown to a soldier , who had been unable to identify him . Lastly , he stated that he had been ill - treated while being detained at the ORG provincial gendarmerie headquarters .", "...", "CARDINAL . In an indictment preferred on DATE the public prosecutor at ORG instituted proceedings against the applicant , charging him with separatism and with undermining the integrity of the ORG , capital offences under LAW .

In connection with the criminal proceedings against the applicant , a Mr PERSON was also accused of having taken part in the armed attack of DATE . He was therefore tried in the same proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant disputed the statements and denied all the charges . The court decided to summon the QUANTITY gendarmes as witnesses .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE counsel for the applicant contested the record of the confrontation of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and argued that the statements by the gendarmes alleged to have identified his client were contradictory .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the court , as requested by the public prosecutor , decided , on \u201c road - safety grounds \u201d , to have evidence from the CARDINAL gendarmes taken on commission . Accordingly , CARDINAL photographs of the applicant , CARDINAL from the side and the other from the front , were sent together with the reports concerning the case to the court delegated to examine the witnesses .

At a hearing on CARDINAL DATE counsel for the applicant again criticised the method by which the court had decided to take evidence from the witnesses in question , arguing that it could not be considered compatible with the rules of procedure .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE it was noted that the depositions of the witnesses who had been examined on commission , with the exception of that of GPE , had been added to the case file .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the applicant pleaded not guilty .

He also rejected the statements he had given under duress at the investigation stage .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE it was noted that the deposition of GPE , likewise taken on commission , had been added to the case file .

[ Lastly , ] there are also contradictions , indeed a blatant discrepancy , regarding the names of those who took part in the shooting , between Mr PERSON 's statements [ obtained while he was in police custody ] and those of his co - defendant .

He also stated that his code name as a member of the organisation had been ORG .", "Before the public prosecutor and ORG he denied all the offences of which he was accused . He stated that he had gone to the village of ORG to do building work in N.\u00d6 's house . He maintained that he had hidden under the bed when the soldiers had arrived purely because he did not have any identity papers . He denied all the charges against him .", "In his defence submissions before the court he again denied the charges .", "In his submissions the public prosecutor sought the defendant 's conviction under LAW .", "It appears from the reports and documents in the file that on DATE , at TIME , members of the security forces attached to the NORP gendarmerie command were attacked by a group of armed terrorists while on patrol in the province of GPE , in the district of PERSON , near GPE , on LOC . In the course of the shooting , the gendarme PERSON was killed and the gendarmes NORP and PERSON were injured .

After taking the necessary security measures , the security forces went to the house and rang the doorbell . TIME , after several rings , someone opened the door . With the owner 's agreement , they were able to go in . Inside , they asked ORG if ORG was staying with him . PERSON replied ' no ' . All the family were together in the same room . They were asked if anyone else was in the house . They replied ' no ' . However , the soldiers discovered a person in pyjamas hiding under a bed . When the person was shown to the members of the household , they said that they did not know him or what he was doing there . It was established that the person was PERSON and that he was related to the members of the household . On his arrest , ORG and GPE . , members of the security forces who had been present at the shooting on DATE , immediately recognised him as having been involved in the shooting . That much is apparent from the relevant report .", "A confrontation was held between these members of the security forces and the defendant . All CARDINAL members of the security forces recognised the defendant as having taken part in the shooting .", "The court sent a photograph of the defendant for identification by the gendarmes claiming to recognise him .", "In the deposition taken from him on commission , the witness GPE said that he could not be certain whether the person in the photograph had been among those taking part in the shooting , as the terrorists who had attacked them had had their faces covered . However , he stated that the defendant had been one of the terrorists who had organised the ambush and that his face had not been covered . During the shooting there had been a distance of QUANTITY between them , so he had had a clear view of the person 's face . He accordingly maintained that the person in the photograph was the same person he had seen during the shooting . He added that he had recognised him as soon as he had arrested him . He attested that the arrest report was consistent with his statements and that the defendant was the person who had taken part in the shooting .", "The statement by PERSON was also taken on commission .

He stated that on DATE there had been an outbreak of shooting with an armed terrorist group . He added that the shooting had carried on for a long time , with the result that at nightfall he and his colleagues had hidden in the bushes to escape the terrorists ' shots . As the terrorists had left the scene , he had had a clear view of CARDINAL of them QUANTITY away . He added that shortly after the defendant 's arrest , he had been able to identify him as the person he had seen . He maintained that that person was the one in the photograph .", "It is apparent from the arrest report that the defendant was immediately identified by the witnesses . They identified him without hesitation on being shown his photograph . Furthermore , the defendant 's sister stated that he was a member of the ORG terrorist organisation . It follows from these witness statements and declarations that the confessions made by the defendant in the statement he gave reflect the truth .", "The arrest report appears consistent with the evidence given by the defendant in his statement as to the circumstances of his arrest . That factual element tends to corroborate the confessions made by the defendant in his initial statement .", "Although the indictment states that the defendant took part in the shooting on CARDINAL DATE in the capital of the district of PERSON , his confessions on the subject are not corroborated by any documents in the file or any other related item of evidence . It has therefore not been established that the defendant took part in that operation .", "...", "On DATE the public prosecutor at ORG instituted proceedings against the defendant .

Holding that the armed attack of DATE had occurred in the context of the ORG 's terrorist activities aimed at removing part of the national territory from the ORG 's control , the court held that the defendant should be convicted under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that judgment to ORG and requested a hearing .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing on DATE ORG upheld the judgment appealed against . Its judgment was delivered on DATE with neither the applicant nor his counsel present .", "On DATE the full text of ORG judgment was added to the case file kept at the registry of ORG and thus made available to the parties .", "CARDINAL .

From the principles established by the NORP courts when applying the criminal law , it is clear that the questioning of a suspect is a means of enabling him to defend himself that should work to his advantage and not a measure designed to obtain evidence against him . While statements made during questioning may be taken into consideration by the judge in his assessment of the facts of a case , they must nonetheless be made voluntarily , and statements obtained through the use of pressure or force are not admissible in evidence . By LAW , as interpreted by ORG , any confessions made to the police or the public prosecutor 's office must be repeated before the judge if the record of the questioning containing them is to be admissible as evidence for the prosecution . If the confessions are not repeated , the records in question are not allowed to be read out as evidence in court and consequently can not be relied on to support a conviction . Even a confession repeated in court can not on its own be regarded as a decisive piece of evidence but must be supported by additional evidence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
