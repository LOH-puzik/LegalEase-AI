FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP and NORP citizen of NORP origin who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "In DATE the applicant married a NORP citizen , PERSON , with whom he had CARDINAL children in DATE and DATE . The children also have dual nationality . In DATE the parents divorced and ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE awarded the mother sole custody of the children , whereas they were entitled to receive unsupervised visits by the applicant DATE and during certain holidays . In DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON ordered that the meetings should take place on specific LOC outside the home of the children . The applicant was refused leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) .", "In DATE the applicant sought to be awarded joint custody of his children as well as to have the visiting arrangements modified . With the mother \u2019s agreement , he had been caring for the children in his home despite the terms of ORG judgment . In DATE , however , the mother had refused to comply even with those terms , instead insisting on supervised visits . The applicant requested that the children be allowed to stay with him in his new family ( his new wife and their mutual child ) during most of DATE . At any rate , the applicant requested to obtain information from the authorities on matters relating to his children .", "During the family advice centre \u2019s investigation into the best interests of the children the parents agreed to the children being interviewed in DATE . Shortly before the date in question the mother telephoned the applicant from GPE , where she gone with the children . In its recommendation of DATE to ORG the family advice centre favoured the applicant \u2019s request to have the children stay with him during holidays .", "Before ORG both parents were assisted by members of the Bar . The court took oral evidence from the parties and the mother \u2019s sister . The mother opposed the applicant \u2019s requests to ORG and could only agree to supervised visits twice a month in GPE . She stressed the dual nationality of the children and their inclusion in the applicant \u2019s passport , which would facilitate their abduction to GPE . She also pointed out that his new wife was also NORP .", "On DATE ORG maintained the sole custody of the children . Agreeing with the local family advice centre , ORG nevertheless entitled them to spend most of their school holidays with the applicant in GPE . ORG had particular regard to the distance between their current home in GPE and that of the applicant in GPE , which would have rendered the access arrangement proposed by the mother impracticable and expensive . ORG further entitled the applicant to obtain information from the authorities on matters relating to his children .", "On the mother \u2019s appeal ORG , in DATE , stayed enforcement of ORG judgment . In its judgment of DATE ORG ordered that the meetings between the children and the applicant could only take place where the children were living in GPE . The meetings were further to be supervised and could only take place on LOC which the applicant had located in advance . ORG noted the applicant \u2019s declared intention to bring the children to his parents in GPE , which had raised fear in PERSON that the children could be abducted . In the absence of a bilateral treaty preventing child abduction from GPE to GPE and given the age of the children and their current place of residence , ORG concluded that it was not appropriate for meetings between them and the applicant to take place in GPE .", "ORG reached its judgment after a re - hearing , where the parents were again assisted by counsel and which included the taking of testimony from CARDINAL additional witness on behalf of PERSON and from CARDINAL further witnesses proposed by the applicant . ORG also had regard to information from the NORP authorities as well as to the applicant \u2019s solemn undertaking at ORG to return to GPE with the children after any visit to his parents .", "In seeking leave to appeal to ORG , again with the assistance of counsel , the applicant argued that he had been discriminated against on the basis of his origin in that ORG had suspected him of planning to abduct his children to GPE . ORG had furthermore wrongly assumed that the NORP authorities would be assisting in locating LOC for the visiting arrangements . The applicant further argued that had he wanted to abduct the children he would have had ample opportunity to do so at an earlier stage , when he was occasionally caring for the children in their mother \u2019s absence , even after ORG judgment of DATE . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "Meanwhile , in DATE ORG of GPE in GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for enforcement of the visiting arrangements , noting that according to the mother she had not been obstructing the preparation of visits . On the contrary , the applicant had not been in contact with her to agree on the dates of the visits . It is not known whether the applicant appealed against this decision . In DATE the applicant moved to GPE .", "According to LAW and Right of Access ( laki lapsen huollosta ja tapaamisoikeudesta , lag ang\u00e5ende v\u00e5rdnad om barn och umg\u00e4ngesr\u00e4tt CARDINAL ) , a matter relating to child custody and right of access shall be resolved by keeping the interests of the child foremost in mind . To this end , special attention shall be paid to the manner in which custody and right of access may best be realised in the future ( section CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
