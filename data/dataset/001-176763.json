It appears from the form that the applicant had refused legal assistance since the first page of the record includes a pre - printed phrase stating \u201c No lawyer sought \u201d with the applicant \u2019s signature underneath . He was thus questioned in the absence of a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . In his statement , the applicant admitted that he was a member of the ORG / ORG and that he was active in the organisation .

He also asked the court to enquire of the banks as to whether there had been any money transferred between the applicant \u2019s father and PERSON The court dismissed the application concerning the attendance of a witness , on the grounds that the witness would not remember the incidents given the long time which had elapsed and that he would not tell the truth owing to the nature of the incident . It further dismissed the other request concerning the transfer of money , considering it not to be essential for the purposes of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a letter to the trial court in which he explained the threats and coercion he had been subjected to in detail and asked the court not to take his co - accused \u2019s statements into consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant as charged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed against that judgment and alleged , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s statements had been taken without notifying him of his rights and as a result of coercion and death threats by the police .

The applicant \u2019s lawyer gave detailed accounts of such treatment and asked ORG not to rely on these statements which had been obtained by impairing the applicant \u2019s will .", "CARDINAL .
