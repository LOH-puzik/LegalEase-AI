Prior to the parliamentary election of CARDINAL DATE , which resulted in a change of power , the applicant , one of the leaders of the then ruling party , ORG ( ORG ) , exercised , for DATE in DATE , the function of Prime Minister of GPE . Prior to that , DATE , he had held the post of Minister of the Interior .", "CARDINAL . After the political coalition ORG had won the parliamentary election of DATE and formed a new government , the applicant was elected Secretary General of the ORG , which became the major opposition force in the country .", "CARDINAL . DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the date when he was charged with criminal offences and arrested ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant had made CARDINAL business trips from GPE to various foreign countries , always returning as scheduled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when travelling from GPE to GPE to attend an international seminar of ORG , the applicant attempted to cross the NORP State border at FAC using an allegedly fake international passport .", "CARDINAL . After registering the passport in the relevant electronic database , an officer of ORG of GPE , GPE , noticed a discrepancy between the photograph in the passport , which fully matched the applicant \u2019s appearance , and the other data in the travel document , including the name of \u201c PERSON \u201d , which differed from the identity information stored about the applicant in the electronic database . The police officer returned the problematic passport to the applicant \u2019s personal assistant , requesting clarification . The assistant immediately brought from the applicant \u2019s office another passport which was issued in the latter \u2019s real name and matched all his other identification data . After checking the authenticity of that second travel document , the applicant was allowed to cross the NORP border .", "CARDINAL . DATE , DATE , a criminal investigation was launched by ORG into the abovementioned incident . The Chief of ORG immediately went to GPE airport to interview the officer , GPE , who had discovered the allegedly fake passport in the applicant \u2019s possession , in person . As subsequently established by the investigation and confirmed by a number of witnesses , when present at the airport the Chief of ORG suddenly received a call from the applicant on his mobile phone . The latter attempted to exert pressure on the Chief by using his status and long - standing personal connections within the hierarchy of ORG . The applicant demanded categorically that no inquiry be conducted with respect to the incident with the passport and that officer GPE never be called to testify as a witness . According to statements subsequently given to the investigation by the Chief of ORG , the applicant made career and personal threats and used obscene language during their telephone conversation .", "CARDINAL . Interviewed on CARDINAL and DATE by investigators from ORG with respect to the incident , the applicant denied presenting to ORG a passport under the name of \u201c PERSON \u201d , and stated that he possessed CARDINAL passports , CARDINAL ordinary ones and CARDINAL diplomatic travel documents , all of them issued under his real name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new set of criminal proceedings for embezzlement and abuse of official authority were launched against the applicant and the Governor of GPE . They both duly appeared before ORG ( \u201c the CPPO \u201d ) on DATE , and were interviewed as witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a third set of criminal proceedings was instituted at ORG of GPE in respect of another instance of abuse of official authority allegedly committed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the Governor of the Kakheti Region were examined as witnesses in the context of the second set of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE all CARDINAL of the above - mentioned sets of criminal proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE above ) were joined into CARDINAL criminal case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the Governor of PERSON were summoned by the prosecution authority for another interview . At the end of that examination both were arrested .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s arrest was linked to a suspicion that he had engaged in vote - buying ( Article CARDINAL ) of LAW ) , misappropriation of another person \u2019s property ( CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) , abuse of official authority ( CARDINAL of LAW ) , and breach of inviolability of another person \u2019s home ( LAW ) . As confirmed by the relevant record , the arresting officer duly explained to the applicant , who was assisted by a lawyer of his choice , the nature of the above - mentioned charges against him , as well as his procedural rights . The applicant was also briefed on the reasons for his arrest . Notably , that there existed risks that he , as a particularly influential person who had held several high - ranking ORG offices in the past , might negatively influence the progress of the investigation , and that , having regard to his previous attempt to cross the State border with a fake travel document , he might abscond from the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , the applicant \u2019s wife left GPE . A judicially authorised search of the applicant \u2019s apartment was conducted DATE , the results of which confirmed the discovery of large sums of money in cash ( see the subsequent paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor in charge of the applicant \u2019s case applied to ORG for pre - trial detention of the applicant as a preventive measure . The prosecutor first gave arguments in support of the risk that the applicant would abscond . Thus , because he had held the posts of Minister of the ORG and Prime Minister of the country in the past , he had formed a broad and extensive personal network within the country and abroad . The applicant possessed CARDINAL valid diplomatic passports under his real name , and those travel documents allowed him to use simplified procedures for entering any foreign country as well as other privileges reserved for diplomats . Furthermore , it appeared that the applicant also had a false passport ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Moreover , the prosecutor continued , the fact that the applicant \u2019s spouse had hurriedly left GPE on CARDINAL DATE , after the applicant had been summoned by the investigating authority , also gave rise to a suspicion that the applicant might aim to join his wife outside the country . The prosecutor also emphasised the fact that during a search of the applicant \u2019s apartment on CARDINAL DATE , large amounts of money in cash MONEY ( ORG ) , MONEY ( ( ORG , some ORG CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL NORP laris ( GEL , some ORG CARDINAL ) DATE were discovered , which fact further substantiated the suspicion that the applicant might have been preparing to flee the country .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor then enumerated arguments in support of the claim that the applicant might hamper the investigation . Again , given that the applicant had held various high - ranking ORG posts , he had therefore directed and supervised numerous ORG agents employed in various public agencies . Considering that the impugned offences were closely related to his past activities in public office , and the fact that the majority of the important witnesses had worked under the applicant \u2019s hierarchical subordination , there was a well - substantiated risk that the applicant might influence those people . The prosecutor \u2019s argument was confirmed by reference to the incident of CARDINAL DATE , when the applicant had managed to identify the mobile phone number of the Chief of ORG , placed a call and exerted pressure on the latter in a rude and obscene manner by uttering personal and career threats ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , after holding an oral hearing with the participation of both the co - accused and their lawyers , decided to release the PERSON Governor on bail , the amount of which was fixed at GEL MONEY ( some EUR CARDINAL ) , and to remand the applicant in custody . LAW was mentioned as the legal basis for imposition of the detention in the reasoning part of the decision .", "CARDINAL . As to the grounds confirming the necessity of the detention measure , ORG stated that it accepted the prosecution authority \u2019s arguments concerning the risks of absconding and impeding the course of the investigation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Whilst acknowledging that the applicant had proved to be cooperative with the investigation by appearing for interviews , ORG stated that he could nevertheless use his prominent social position , which emanated from the fact of his having held various high - ranking posts in the past , to hamper the investigation process . The court emphasised that the witnesses who were to be examined had been or still remained under the applicant \u2019s direct hierarchical authority and personal influence . ORG further specifically noted in that respect that the applicant had already been suspected of an attempt to influence the specific witnesses , the Chief of ORG and officer GPE , within the context of the ongoing criminal proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG indicated , pursuant to LAW ORG , that a pre - trial conference would open on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , complaining that the imposition of the pre - trial detention had been unreasonable because ORG had failed to refer to any specific evidence or arguments in support of the supposed risks of hampering the investigation or absconding the trial .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded , confirming that the lower court had correctly assessed the relevant factual circumstances and applied the legal provisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor asked ORG to postpone the opening of the pre - trial conference until DATE . The prosecutor substantiated his application by the need for certain additional specific investigative measures to be conducted . Both the applicant , represented by CARDINAL lawyers , and the co - accused ORG Governor agreed with that application in part . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG granted the request in part , postponing the date until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers sought a further postponement of the pre - trial conference . They argued that the case file was voluminous and more time was needed for the preparation of the defence . The prosecutor objected , indicating that the applicant was attempting to protract the proceedings and leave less time for an examination of the case on the merits . ORG satisfied , on DATE , the applicant \u2019s request in full , and a new date for the pre - trial conference was set for CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG opened the pre - trial conference .", "CARDINAL . According to a record of a subsequent session of the pre - trial conference held on DATE , the applicant asked for his pre - trial detention to be replaced by a non - custodial measure of restraint . In support , he referred to the prosecution authority \u2019s failure to indicate any new arguments arguably capable of substantiating the risks of absconding or impeding the investigation . As additional guarantees for his appearance for trial , the applicant referred to the fact that he was the Secretary General of a major political party , that he had made a public pledge to cooperate with the authorities , and that he had never failed to appear before the investigating authorities in the past . As further revealed by an audio record of the relevant court hearing , the applicant argued that his continued detention was no longer necessary , as all the witnesses had already been questioned by the investigating authority . The prosecution authority replied that since the witnesses still had to testify before the trial court , the risk that the accused would exert undue pressure on them was still present . The authority reminded ORG of the incident with the fake passport , when the applicant had managed to threaten a high - ranking officer of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s request for the termination of the pre - trial detention was examined and rejected by ORG on DATE , DATE . Thus , the court , after hearing the parties\u2019 arguments , announced its decision orally , for the audio record . As disclosed by that record , the judge briefly stated , without giving any explanation , that the \u201c request for the termination of the pre - trial detention should be rejected \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of the majority of the charges brought against him . Thus , he was found guilty of vote - buying ( LAW ) , misappropriation of another person \u2019s property in a large amount ( LAW ( a ) , ( d ) , and CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW on several counts ) , and breach of inviolability of another person \u2019s home ( LAW ( b ) of LAW ) . As regards the offence of abuse of official authority ( LAW ) , it was dismissed by the court as redundant . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction of CARDINAL DATE in full . According to the file as it stands to date , the applicant lodged a further appeal on points of law , and the ensuing proceedings are currently pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s addendum to the case file after the communication of the present case , on DATE , at TIME , he was unexpectedly removed from his prison cell . The accompanying prison guards covered his head with a jacket , put him into a car , and drove him to an unknown destination . The journey lasted TIME , after which he was escorted into a building . When he was brought inside one of the rooms the guards took the jacket off his head , and he saw CARDINAL people . CARDINAL of them was allegedly ORG , PERSON , and the other was the head of the prison authority , GPE", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , ORG offered him a bargain during that meeting . Notably , the applicant was invited to reveal the \u201c truth \u201d about the circumstances surrounding the death of the former Prime Minister PERSON on DATE ( who , according to an official version of the events , had died in a rented flat from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by an inadequately ventilated gas heater ) and , in addition , to provide information about secret offshore bank accounts of the former President of GPE . The applicant turned down the deal , describing PERSON \u2019s suggestions as a conspiracy theory and nonsense . In reply , ORG allegedly threatened the applicant that his detention conditions would worsen if he did not agree to cooperate with the authorities . The applicant was returned to his prison cell at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during a public hearing before ORG , which was already examining the merits of the criminal case against the applicant in the presence of the prosecuting authority and media representatives , the applicant made a statement about what had happened on DATE . He described in detail his night - time conversation with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prime Minister of GPE publicly commented that the applicant \u2019s allegations of the TIME removal from prison for a meeting with ORG were a sheer lie , that no investigation would be launched in that respect , and that the applicant should instead \u201c consult a psychiatrist \u201d . Subsequently , paraphrasing another public person \u2019s comment , ORG made the following remark : \u201c After all , what was this story of abducting [ the applicant ] from the prison all about ? Did [ ORG ] rape him or what?\u2019 \u201d In the same vein , ORG issued an official statement condemning the applicant \u2019s allegations as \u201c untrue \u201d and \u201c absurd \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of Prisons publicly stated that \u201c [ the applicant ] was not taken out of the prison ... No investigation has been launched into such frivolous allegations . \u201d The Minister added that recordings made by the prison surveillance systems , which could shed light on whether or not the latter had been taken out of and returned to his cell at the specified times on DATE , could be made public only if a criminal probe was launched in respect of the applicant \u2019s allegation .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , certain other high ORG officials , such as the President of the ORG and the Minister of ORG , acknowledged , in the immediate aftermath of the incident of DATE , that there was a need to launch a thorough and impartial criminal investigation into the issue . On DATE ORG of GPE visited the applicant in prison , where they discussed in detail the incident of DATE . After the meeting , the Defender made a public statement about the necessity to launch a criminal investigation in order to clarify all the facts , and emphasised that the applicant would be ready to cooperate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a formal request to ORG , of which ORG and ORG were also informed , for the video footage from the prison surveillance system covering TIME DATE to be provided to his lawyer . Those recordings would prove the need for a criminal investigation into his unlawful removal from the prison on that night .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Public Defender again called upon the authorities to investigate the applicant \u2019s allegations . On DATE the Minister of Prisons stated that the recordings from the surveillance system of the applicant \u2019s prison covering TIME DATE could no longer be extracted as they had automatically been deleted within twentyfour TIME after being recorded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a question to ORG about whether or not a criminal investigation had been launched into the incident of DATE . On DATE the prosecutorial authority informed the applicant that an internal probe carried out by ORG of ORG had not confirmed the applicant \u2019s alleged irregular removal from the prison . No further details about that probe were given .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a Member of ORG published certain documents showing that high bonuses were paid in DATE to a number of officers of the prison where the applicant was detained . The parliamentarian suggested that those officers were financially rewarded for their association with the applicant \u2019s removal from the cell .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , a chief advisor to GPE , the Head of ORG , made a public statement confirming the truthfulness of the applicant \u2019s allegations . She stated : \u201c [ E]ven a child knows that [ the applicant ] was taken from his prison cell by GPE \u201d . She further stated that she had been in contact with a number of agents of ORG who had confirmed to her , in private conversation , that they had been instructed by GPE to hide surveillance camera recordings covering TIME DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , GPE dismissed PERSON from her position . DATE , on DATE , he himself resigned from the post of head of the prison authority .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted numerous newspaper articles containing interviews with various high - ranking officials of the current regime in the country ( CARDINAL successive prime ministers , various ministers , Members of ORG from the ruling coalition , and so on ) as a proof that there was politically motivated persecution against him . He also referred to a number of official statements issued by the international community , which conveyed concern over the initiation of criminal proceedings and arrests of a number of former high - ranking Government officials , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Thus , for instance , the President of ORG made a public statement on CARDINAL DATE , after his meeting with the Prime Minister of GPE , which included the following passage :", "\u201c The elections in GPE were successfully held , and they were recognised as free and fair ... Democracy is more than elections , it is the culture of political relations in democratic environment . In this respect , situations of selective justice should be avoided as they could harm the country \u2019s image abroad and weaken rule of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The European Union High Commissioner for Foreign and Security Policy publicly declared during her visit to GPE on CARDINAL DATE the following : \u201c ORG calls on all sides in NORP politics to uphold NORP values of democracy , freedom and the rule of law . There should be no selective justice ; no retribution against political rivals . Investigations into past wrongdoings must be , and must be seen to be , impartial , transparent and in compliance with due process . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As an additional proof that the current Government was engaged in persecution of its political opponent , the applicant referred to the following excerpt from a ORG adopted by ORG of ORG PACE ) on DATE :", "\u201c It has to be noted that DATE on , almost the entire leadership of the former ruling party has been arrested or is under prosecution or investigation : former Prime Minister and ORG Secretary General , [ the applicant ] , former Defence Minister , [ GPE ] , and former GPE mayor and ORG , campaign manager , [ ORG ] , are in prison ( pre - trial detention ) . The judicial authorities have charged the former President , [ GPE ] , and ordered pre - trial detention in absentia , as well as for former Minister of Defence , [ GPE ] , and former Minister of Justice , [ Z.A. ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commissioner for Human Rights of ORG published a ORG on his visit to GPE which had taken place from DATE . Included in an array of various problematic human rights issues affecting the country the Commissioner also addressed the allegations of undue criminal prosecution of members of the former ruling party , the ORG . The relevant excerpt from the ORG as emphasised by the applicant , which passage made a separate reference to the incident of DATE , reads as follows :", "\u201c DATE . The cases of [ the applicant ] , [ GPE ] , and [ G.U. ] \u2013 all of them members of or associated with the UNM \u2013 were discussed by the Commissioner during his visit . [ The applicant ] was formerly Prime Minister and Secretary General of the FAC at the time of his arrest on DATE . He has alleged that on DATE , he was taken away blindfolded from the prison by unknown individuals and brought to ORG of ORG where he was threatened by the then Chief Prosecutor ... Human rights NGOs have called for an investigation into the foregoing allegations and expressed concerns that the internal inquiry by ORG failed to clarify the situation and raised more questions , including regarding the unavailability of video footage from surveillance cameras in the prison . In this regard , ORG indicated to the Commissioner that due to the fact that [ the applicant ] made his complaint only on DATE after the alleged events \u2013 the video footage was unavailable because it was automatically overwritten TIME . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Then , in the relevant concluding part of the ORG , the Commissioner made the following call upon the NORP authorities with regard to the above - mentioned allegations of unduly motivated criminal proceedings :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Commissioner wishes to underline that the judicial system should be sufficiently resilient so that its proper functioning is not disrupted by the transfers of power which are characteristic of any true democracy . The persistence of allegations and other information indicative of deficiencies marring the criminal investigation and judicial processes in cases involving political opponents are a cause for concern , as this can cast doubt on the outcome of the cases concerned even when there have been solid grounds for the charges retained and the final convictions . The NORP authorities must address these issues at the systemic level , in the interests of respecting fair trial guarantees for everyone and in enhancing public trust in the institutions responsible for upholding the law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In support of his claim of undue political motivation behind the initiation of the criminal proceedings against him , the applicant also referred to a ORG published on DATE by ORG ( ORG ) on its trial monitoring activities in GPE . The ORG had started the relevant trial monitoring project in DATE , focusing on the follow - up of CARDINAL sets of criminal proceedings unrelated to each other , conducted against senior officials of the previous government , which included the applicant \u2019s criminal case . After having identified , through the prism of all QUANTITY criminal cases , a number of shortcomings with respect to the fair trial guarantees \u2013 such as the principle of equality of arms between parties , the presumption of innocence , the perception of undue influence on the prosecution authority by the executive branch of power , and the unreasonable use of preliminary detention \u2013 the ODIHR Report made a number of recommendations to the NORP authorities on how to improve the system of criminal justice in general .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a ORG on the endorsement of ORG between ORG and GPE . An excerpt from that ORG , cited by the applicant himself in support of his claim , read as follows :", "\u201c [ ORG ] expresses concern that numerous officials who had served under the previous government and some members of the current opposition have been charged with criminal offences and are imprisoned or placed in pre - trial detention ; expresses concern , also , about the potential , use of the judicial system to fight against political opponents , which could undermine the efforts of the NORP authorities in the area of democratic reform ; recalls that the existence of a valuable political opposition is paramount to the creation of a balanced and mature political system , to which GPE is aspiring . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant referred to the relevant excerpts from ORG GPE Parties to ORG adopted by the PACE on DATE . These passages read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The following abusive grounds for pretrial detention have been observed in a number of GPE Parties to ORG , namely :", "CARDINAL . to put pressure on detainees in order to coerce them into confessing to a crime or otherwise co - operating with the prosecution , including by testifying against a third person ( for example the case of PERSON , in GPE , and certain cases of opposition leaders in GPE , such as former Prime Minister , [ the applicant ] ) ;", "CARDINAL . to discredit or otherwise neutralise political competitors ( for example , certain cases of ORG ( ORG ) leaders in GPE ) ; ...", "CARDINAL . The root causes of the abusive use of pretrial detention include : ...", "CARDINAL . the possibility of \u201c forum shopping \u201d by the prosecution , which may be tempted to develop different strategies to ensure that requests for pretrial detention in certain cases are decided by a judge who , for various reasons , is expected to be \u201c accommodating \u201d ( for example in GPE , GPE and GPE ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequent to the communication of the present case , the applicant informed ORG for the first time that CARDINAL additional sets of criminal proceedings had been launched against him . Those new criminal cases were not linked in any manner to the main set of the criminal proceedings which had served as the basis for the imposition of the pre - trial detention initially contested by the applicant in the present case ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , on CARDINAL DATE a charge of exceeding of official powers through the threat or use of force ( LAW ( b ) of LAW ) was brought against the applicant in relation to his role , in his capacity as Minister of the ORG , in the planning and supervision of a violent dispersal of a peaceful demonstration by police forces on CARDINAL DATE .
