The applicants are a family comprising the husband and wife ( the first and second applicants ) and their CARDINAL children ( the third and fourth applicants ) . They were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in the town of PERSON in LOC .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant arrived in GPE with a valid visa and married the second applicant . In DATE , after his visa had expired , the first applicant was deported to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant obtained a work visa valid until DATE and resumed his residence in GPE . The visa was later extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police department of LOC rejected his application by reference to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . No further reasons were provided .", "CARDINAL . The first and the second applicants challenged the refusal before a court . They complained , in particular , that the police department of LOC had not given any reasons for the refusal . The first applicant had never been charged with any criminal offence or engaged in any subversive activities . The applicants also claimed that the refusal had interfered with their right to respect for their family life and had caused them non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the decision of DATE had been lawful and rejected the ORG claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage . It found that the police department of LOC had received information from ORG that the first applicant posed a national security risk . That information was a ORG secret and could not be made public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE on appeal . It reiterated that , according to the information from ORG , the first applicant posed a national security risk . That information was a ORG secret and was not subject to judicial scrutiny .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police department of LOC prepared a decision that the first applicant \u2019s presence on NORP territory was undesirable and submitted it to the head of ORG for approval . The draft decision indicated that the first applicant had been unlawfully resident on NORP territory and had been repeatedly fined under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) for his failure to leave GPE after the expiry of the authorised residence period . On DATE the head of ORG confirmed the decision and it became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police department of LOC asked ORG to order the first applicant \u2019s deportation . On DATE the head of ORG ordered the first applicant \u2019s deportation by reference to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . No further reasons were provided . The applicants were not informed of the decision until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and second applicants lodged an application with ORG under LAW . They complained , in particular , that the refusal to grant a residence permit to the first applicant and the subsequent decision to deport him to GPE had entailed a violation of the right to respect for their family life .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE the ORG found a violation of LAW ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . It found that the applicants\u2019 relationship amounted to family life and that the refusal to grant the first applicant a residence permit and his deportation order constituted interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their family life . That interference had a basis in domestic law , namely section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the ORG noted that the domestic courts were not in a position to assess effectively whether the decision to reject the first applicant \u2019s application for a residence permit was justified , because it was based on classified information . The failure to disclose the relevant information to the courts deprived them of the power to assess whether the conclusion that the first applicant constituted a danger to national security had a reasonable basis in fact . It followed that the judicial scrutiny was limited in scope and did not provide sufficient safeguards against arbitrary exercise of the wide discretion conferred by domestic law on ORG and ORG in cases involving national security .", "CARDINAL . As to the deportation order against the first applicant , the ORG observed that it had been issued by ORG on the initiative of a local police department . Both agencies were part of the executive and took such decisions without hearing the foreign national concerned . It was not clear whether there was a possibility of appealing against those decisions to a court or other independent authority offering guarantees of an adversarial procedure and competent to review the reasons for the decisions and relevant evidence .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded that the interference with the applicants\u2019 family life was based on legal provisions that did not give an adequate degree of protection against arbitrary interference and therefore did not meet the Convention \u2019s \u201c quality of law \u201d requirements . Accordingly , in the event of the deportation order against the first applicant being enforced , there would be a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG annulled the decision of DATE stating that the first applicant \u2019s presence on NORP territory was undesirable , and the decision of CARDINAL DATE ordering his deportation .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the head of the local department of ORG notified the first applicant of the decision of CARDINAL August CARDINAL . She further reminded the first applicant that he was unlawfully residing on NORP territory . To make his residence lawful , he had to leave for GPE , obtain a NORP entry visa and then apply for a residence permit . If he failed to leave , he would be fined and administratively removed to GPE under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and the second applicants applied to ORG for a reconsideration of the judgment of DATE , as upheld on DATE , referring to the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed their request , quashed the judgment of DATE and ordered a reconsideration of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and the second applicants submitted an amended statement of claim , asking that the first applicant be issued with a residence permit and that compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage be paid to each of the applicants . The statement of claim mentioned that the first and the second applicants were acting on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor children , the third and the fourth applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG relinquished jurisdiction in favour of ORG . The judge noted that one of the main criticisms of ORG expressed in the judgment of DATE was the failure by ORG to review documents containing classified information . This factor had prevented an effective assessment of whether the finding that the first applicant constituted a danger to national security had a reasonable basis in the facts and , consequently , of whether the decision to reject his application for a residence permit was justified . The judge concluded that the case should be referred to ORG which , unlike ORG , had competence to review documents containing ORG secrets .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing ORG examined the classified documents from ORG containing information about the security risks allegedly posed by the first applicant . The first and second applicants were informed of the contents of those documents after they had undertaken not to disclose that information . They asked the court to call the police informants who had accused the first applicant of subversive activities to the witness stand and have them questioned . Their request was however refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the refusal of a residence permit to the first applicant had been lawful . It referred , in particular , to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and held as follows :", "\u201c ... if the security services discover that certain actions [ of a foreign national ] create a threat for the security of GPE or for the citizens of GPE , they are bound [ by law ] to inform the local department of ORG of [ the existence of such threat ] . [ The law ] does not require that the security services reveal the substance of the threat .", "The procedure for the preparation and approval of the materials in respect of a specified foreign national to whom a NORP DATE residence permit is to be refused is established by [ unpublished ] Instruction no . DATE , \u201c On organisation of the activities of ORG in respect of the examination of materials concerning residence permits for foreign nationals \u201d , of DATE .", "During the hearing the court examined the requirements contained in the ORG and the \u2018 classified\u2019 documents which had formed the basis for the refusal , by the security services , of permission to grant a DATE residence permit to NORP national PERSON . It finds that ORG of ORG complied with the requirements contained in the Instruction .", "The court has established that the security service revealed circumstances and discovered factors representing a danger for the vital interests of individuals , society and the ORG . The security service made the finding that there were circumstances warranting the refusal of a NORP DATE residence permit to PERSON on the basis of information obtained in the course of its intelligence activities conducted in accordance with the procedure established by the laws of GPE , when discharging its [ the security service \u2019s ] duties and within its competence .", "The court takes into account that issues relating to national security are special , in particular because the factors that represent a threat to national security are assessed by the competent authorities on the basis of information received from various sources , including sources not subject to judicial scrutiny .", "Moreover , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of [ LAW ] does not specify which actions may be qualified as representing a threat for the security of GPE or its citizens . This means that the competent security services have discretion in classifying various actions of a foreign national as a threat [ to national security ] .", "Thus , there are no reasons to hold that the refusal by ORG of ORG of permission to grant a DATE residence permit to PERSON was unlawful .", "After the receipt of news of the refusal of permission by the security service , the application of PERSON for a DATE residence permit was rejected by the police department of the GPE region , by decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , on the basis of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of [ LAW ] .", "The court concludes from the above that the mentioned decision of the police department of LOC was lawful and justified ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court then cited LAW and certain paragraphs of the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE reiterating the general principles under LAW . It continued as follows :", "\u201c Given that the instant case does not concern an expulsion order against PERSON and that during the court hearing statutory circumstances warranting a restriction of the right of NORP national PERSON to obtain a NORP DATE residence permit have been established , the court does not see any grounds to satisfy the GPE request for an injunction to examine PERSON application for a DATE residence permit and grant such residence permit on the basis of ORG on the Rights of the Child . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , referring to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) , ORG found that the first applicant was not entitled to receive a DATE residence permit either . A DATE residence permit could be issued only to a person who had lived in GPE for DATE on the basis of a DATE residence permit . As the first applicant had never had a DATE residence permit , he was not eligible for a DATE residence permit .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims in full .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants appealed to ORG of GPE . They complained , in particular , that they had not been given access to the classified materials but merely informed about their contents in general terms . They had therefore been denied an opportunity to contest the accusations levelled at the first applicant . They referred to the cases of PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL and ORG , ECHR CARDINALX ) , and ORG and Others v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG DATE ) , claiming that the refusal to disclose the relevant evidence had violated their right to a fair trial . They also argued that by refusing to provide the first applicant with a residence permit the authorities had showed disrespect for their family life .", "CARDINAL . A representative of the local department of ORG commented on the ORG appeal submissions . He submitted , in particular , that the decision to refuse a residence permit to the first applicant had been lawful and had been taken in accordance with the procedure established by law , in particular Instruction no . DATE . That instruction and the classified materials from the security services had been examined by ORG in the applicants\u2019 presence and had been attached to the case file . Accordingly , the applicants had had full access to those materials .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE on appeal , finding that it had been lawful , well - reasoned and justified . ORG had examined the classified materials in the applicants\u2019 presence . ORG was therefore convinced that the security services\u2019 assertion that the first applicant was a danger to national security had a basis in the facts . In those circumstances the public interest had absolute priority over any private interests that might be involved . There was no reason to depart from the findings made by ORG , as those findings had been compatible with the domestic and international law . The applicants had been given access to all relevant evidence and materials and no other procedural defects had been established . Accordingly , their right to a fair trial had not been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE several policemen went to the second applicant \u2019s place of work in search of the first applicant . They took the first applicant to the nearby police station . An officer from the local department of ORG drew up a report on the commission of an offence under LAW and ordered that the first applicant pay a fine of MONEY ( RUB ) . The first applicant was then released .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged the decision of DATE before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG reversed the decision of DATE . It observed that the statutory limitation period for continuous administrative offences was DATE starting to run from DATE the offence was discovered . In the first applicant \u2019s case the continuous offence of living in GPE without a valid residence permit had been first discovered in DATE . Accordingly , the administrative offence proceedings were time - barred . The parties did not appeal and the decision became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office asked ORG to quash the decision of DATE as incorrect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that ORG had incorrectly interpreted and applied the legal provisions concerning limitation periods and that the administrative offence proceedings against the first applicant were not time - barred . However , LAW did not provide for a procedure for quashing or reconsidering a court decision that had become final . It therefore rejected the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s application .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE several policemen went to the second applicant \u2019s place of work and arrested the first applicant . He was taken to the police station , where an officer from the local department of ORG drew up a report on the commission of an offence under LAW . The report was transmitted to a judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG held that the first applicant had infringed the residence regulations by living in GPE without a valid residence permit . It further held as follows :", "\u201c The offender \u2019s arguments that some members of his family ( his wife and children ) are living in GPE have been discussed . It has been found that these circumstances can not prevent an administrative removal , as in the judgments mentioned above [ the judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ] the same circumstances were considered insufficient for granting PERSON a residence permit ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
