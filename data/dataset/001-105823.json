Mr PERSON lost the elections of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On TIME of DATE a group of opposition supporters gathered in front of ORG headquarters in the centre of GPE , claiming victory for their candidate in the election . At that time there were some violent altercations between opposition supporters and the security forces .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE a number of opposition supporters started gathering near ORG , in the centre of GPE , to protest against the election results . The crowd then started moving towards FAC , the main square in the city . It was reported that , on the way , some people in the crowd began damaging cars , buildings , benches and other urban constructions . It was also claimed that the organisers of this unauthorised demonstration and certain leaders of the opposition parties were inciting their followers to violence .", "CARDINAL . It has been claimed that some police officers who had been deployed at FAC were attacked by some of the demonstrators . Shortly thereafter large numbers of riot police and military personnel , fully equipped with helmets , shields and truncheons , arrived in the square with the aim of dispersing the demonstration . The situation quickly escalated into public disorder and violent clashes occurred between the crowd and the police . It was widely reported that the authorities used excessive force indiscriminately against anyone who happened to be in the area in question .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , among other persons , were considered by the ORG authorities to be the organisers of the demonstration . At TIME all of the applicants , except PERSON , had appeared on a tribune in FAC . Mr PERSON gave a speech to the people gathered in the square , while the CARDINAL other applicants did not . PERSON was in the headquarters of his political party at that time and , according to his own statements , was unable to go to FAC ( although he wished to do so ) , because the exits from the headquarters were reportedly blocked by State security forces .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the demonstration was completely dispersed . CARDINAL people were arrested during the events of DATE and in their aftermath .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instituted criminal proceedings ( case no . CARDINAL ) concerning the events of CARDINAL and QUANTITY DATE . CARDINAL persons arrested in connection with those events were eventually prosecuted in the context of those proceedings . The proceedings concerned only the actions of the organisers of the demonstration and those participating in it , and it appears that no criminal or other form of investigation was carried out in connection with the allegations of excessive use of force by the police and military units during the dispersal of the demonstration ( see Muradova v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the above - mentioned criminal proceedings , on the dates specified below all of the applicants were arrested and charged with criminal offences .", "CARDINAL .

After his transfer to another detention facility , for an unspecified period of time he was kept in solitary confinement and was not allowed to possess writing accessories , books , a radio or newspapers .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant , together with several other detained persons ( none of whom are applicants in the present case ) , lodged a complaint with ORG , alleging that they had been ill - treated during DATE of their detention and seeking to have criminal proceedings opened against the perpetrators . On DATE their complaint was rejected as unsubstantiated . In particular , in respect of the first applicant , it was noted that he had not made any allegations of ill - treatment in the immediate aftermath of his initial questioning , that the various allegations he had made at different times had been inconsistent , and that , when given the opportunity to undergo an examination by a forensic expert , he had refused to do so , stating that there were no injuries on his person . It was concluded that no evidence of illtreatment had been produced .", "CARDINAL . During the trial proceedings ( described in section C. below ) , the first applicant complained before the trial court that he had been tortured in the ORG . Responding to a number of specific questions put to him in connection with his allegations , he mentioned that he had been handcuffed and punched in his chest and kidneys and that it had been hinted to him that his son would be ill - treated , but he expressly refused to provide any further details of the alleged torture , stating generally that he had \u201c never seen such cruelty \u201d . He also refused to mention any names of the alleged perpetrators because \u201c they were not important people \u201d , and instead accused the President , the Minister of ORG and the Head of ORG of \u201c making orders \u201d to ill - treat him . He also mentioned that , from what he had heard , many other people had also been ill - treated . It appears that the trial court dismissed his complaints of ill - treatment as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . According to the second applicant , during the first DATE of his detention in ORG no . CARDINAL , he was held in a single cell and was not given access to writing materials , books , newspapers or a radio .", "CARDINAL .

Following his arrest on DATE , the first applicant , PERSON Huseyn , was not allowed access to a lawyer until DATE . From that date on , he was represented by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Following the completion of the pre - trial investigation on DATE , the applicant and his lawyer , PERSON , were given access to the prosecution \u2019s case file and on DATE and DATE , respectively , they signed a record on familiarisation with the material in the case file . According to the applicant , his lawyer was granted access to the entire case file for only one working day .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , starting from an unspecified date during the trial , Mr ORG was also represented by another lawyer , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . After his arrest , the second applicant , PERSON , was represented by a ORG - appointed lawyer . The lawyer was subsequently replaced by CARDINAL lawyers whom the applicant retained in DATE and DATE . CARDINAL of these lawyers was PERSON .", "CARDINAL . It appears that , following the termination of the pre - trial investigation , PERSON was given access to the case file and signed a record on familiarisation with the material in the file , dated DATE . Mr ORG himself was also given access to the case file . According to him , he was given TIME to study the file , which was insufficient to become fully familiar with all the evidence , consisting of CARDINAL volumes of documents ( amounting to CARDINAL pages ) and CARDINAL video cassettes ( each containing about TIME of video material ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at CARDINAL of the preliminary hearings in ORG , which had commenced on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , Mr ORG lodged an application refusing the services of all CARDINAL lawyers representing him on the ground that these lawyers had not been able to defend him adequately . He requested leave to defend himself in person but , according to the Government , subsequently asked for a new lawyer . On DATE ORG accepted the application and decided that the applicant should be provided with a new ORG - appointed lawyer . The lawyer , PERSON , was appointed at DATE around DATE . During the trial , another lawyer , PERSON , was retained by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Following his arrest on DATE , the third applicant , PERSON PERSON , was not allowed access to a lawyer until DATE . From this date on , it appears that he was represented by a number of lawyers throughout the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Following the completion of the pre - trial investigation on DATE , the applicant and several of his lawyers ( Mr PERSON , Mr N. GPE , Mr PERSON and Mr O. Kazimov ) were given access to the prosecution \u2019s case file . On DATE the applicant , and on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE each of the lawyers , signed a separate record on familiarisation with the material in the case file .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was appointed as Mr Mammadov \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON complained to ORG , by telegram , that he had not been allowed to meet the applicant .

There is no information in the case file as to whether Mr ORG or the applicant were given access to the prosecution \u2019s case file following the completion of the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . As noted above , CARDINAL persons were prosecuted , in the framework of criminal case no . DATE , for their involvement in the events of CARDINAL and DATE . Subsequently , this case was split , dividing the accused persons into CARDINAL separate groups ( CARDINAL of which groups comprised the newly severed criminal case no . DATE concerning the applicants ) , and each group was tried separately . The first CARDINAL trials concerned the cases of those who were accused of participating in mass disorder and use of violence against officials . All those trials were conducted by either ORG or ORG and were completed in DATE and DATE . All the defendants in those trials were found guilty and were sentenced to either imprisonment , suspended periods of imprisonment or restriction of liberty .", "CARDINAL . DATE and last trial in criminal case no . CARDINAL concerned the persons who were accused of organising the mass disorder , including the CARDINAL applicants in the present case . This trial took place after the first CARDINAL trials .", "CARDINAL . The trial was conducted by ORG . It commenced with several preliminary hearings , the first of which took place on DATE . The CARDINAL - judge panel hearing the case was composed of Judges PERSON ( presiding ) , PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . During a preliminary hearing on CARDINAL DATE , the applicants\u2019 lawyers complained to ORG about an alleged danger to their personal safety , notifying the court about an incident which had taken place after the preliminary hearing of DATE . According to the lawyers , CARDINAL of them had been harassed and assaulted by a number of police officers outside the courthouse when they were giving an interview to a television journalist . To support this allegation , CARDINAL of the lawyers produced some items of clothing damaged during the altercation and photographs depicting the incident . They characterised the alleged incident as a form of undue pressure put on them by the authorities and asked the court to take measures to ensure their personal safety . The presiding judge replied that the court could not be concerned with any incidents taking place outside its courtroom and that the lawyers should use the relevant avenues of redress if they wished to complain about any alleged harassment outside the court hearings . The court nevertheless decided to notify \u201c the relevant authorities \u201d about the ORG allegation . However , from the material available in the case file , it is unclear which specific steps were taken by the court in this regard .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the first applicant , PERSON , lodged an application objecting to the participation in the trial of one of ORG judges , Judge PERSON , noting that the judge \u2019s son worked at ORG and was subordinate to the head of the investigation team dealing with his case . The other defendants joined the application . On DATE ORG rejected the application , finding that , although Judge PERSON \u2019s son indeed worked at ORG , he had never been personally involved in the applicants\u2019 case .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the first applicant , joined by other defendants , also objected to the participation in the trial of Judge PERSON . They pointed out that Judge PERSON was the brother of PERSON N. GPE , an investigator from ORG who , during the period from DATE to DATE , had been a member of the investigation team dealing with the applicants\u2019 case . The first applicant argued that , owing to Judge PERSON \u2019s brother \u2019s direct involvement in the case , he would not be able to hear the case as an impartial judge . On DATE ORG rejected that application , noting that Mr PERSON had indeed been one of the CARDINAL members of the investigation team working on criminal case no . DATE . However , he had been removed from the team on DATE . Subsequently , after the new case no . DATE ( concerning the applicants ) had been severed from case no . CARDINAL , Mr N. GPE had not been included in the investigation team dealing with this new case . For these reasons , ORG concluded that claims concerning the lack of impartiality of Judge PERSON could not be objectively justified .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout the trial in ORG , the applicants lodged a number of other applications . According to them , the court \u2019s interim decisions rejecting those applications were either not given to them or were made available to them only after significant delays . Moreover , the applicants requested permission to verify the transcripts of court hearings after each hearing in order to be able to comment on alleged irregularities and \u201c falsifications \u201d contained in them . However , they were given access to the transcripts only at the very end of the trial .", "DATE . During the course of the trial , ORG examined large volumes of testimonial evidence , as well as video recordings and other materials . Below is a brief summary of the evidence heard and the manner in which it was ultimately assessed in ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The majority of prosecution witnesses were police officers deployed at FAC on DATE . The investigation also produced records of pre - trial questioning of some of the persons who had been convicted at earlier trials in connection with the events of CARDINAL and DATE , and a number of other civilian witnesses .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the absolute majority of prosecution witnesses were called to merely provide a general description of the events of CARDINAL and DATE in order to establish the fact of public disorder . Their testimonies were aimed at showing that the demonstrators had collected clubs , stones and other objects from the headquarters of ORG and other opposition parties , that they had used these objects as weapons against the police and military forces and that they had damaged a variety of public and private property . These witness testimonies did not directly mention the applicants as either organisers of or participants in those violent actions . In addition , the prosecution produced some expert evaluations of various forms of damage to private and public property .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicants\u2019 specific role in the events of DATE , in order to establish that they had directed and incited the NORP violent actions , the prosecution produced pre - trial depositions of several police officers who had specifically described , inter alia , how they had seen the applicants arriving at FAC on DATE , publicly proclaiming the election victory of PERSON and inciting the demonstrators to violence from the tribune in the square .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the scheduled examination of these witnesses , on DATE the first applicant , joined by all the other defendants , complained that the pre - trial depositions of some of those witnesses had been identical word for word and asked for this evidence to be excluded . He pointed out that , according to the relevant records , some of these depositions had been taken by the same investigator at the same time on DATE . He argued that this was either physically impossible or in breach of LAW , which required that witnesses be questioned separately , and that , in either case , this evidence should not be admitted . It is not clear whether the ORG ever gave any decision concerning this objection , but it admitted the relevant depositions as evidence .", "CARDINAL . At the trial hearings , each of the police officers concerned testified separately and was cross - examined by the applicants and their lawyers . In particular , police officer ORG stated , inter alia , that when the public disturbance had started at FAC , some of the defendants , including the second and third applicants , had been inciting the crowd to violence and making such declarations as \u201c PERSON [ PERSON ] has been elected President , we are now in power , do not be afraid of anyone , soon we will overtake the entire city , resist anyone who confronts you ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . From the record of the court hearings , it appears that , during the cross - examination , the defence were able to reveal a number of alleged inconsistencies between the accounts given by ORG during the hearing and in his pre - trial deposition ( concerning such specific details of his testimony as , for example , whether he had actually seen any of the defendants appear on the tribune or not , or whether any of the defendants had actually used any phrases such as \u201c Beat the police ! \u201d ) . The defence read out ORG \u2019s pretrial deposition at the hearing with the aim of pointing out these alleged inconsistencies . Likewise , according to the defence , cross - examination of most of the other witnesses of this type revealed alleged inconsistencies between their statements at the trial and in their pre - trial depositions . As appears from the transcript of the trial hearings , when confronted with these alleged inconsistencies , some of the witnesses stated that their pre - trial statements had not been properly recorded , while others reverted back to their pre - trial statements and retracted any inconsistent statements which they had made during the hearing prior to cross - examination .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the transcript of the court hearings that CARDINAL witnesses of this type were heard . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG separately summarised the testimonies of CARDINAL of those witnesses and relied on them as proving the applicants\u2019 guilt . The judgment addressed neither the objections raised by the applicants as to the admissibility of these witness testimonies , nor any objections concerning the inconsistencies allegedly revealed in their testimonies during crossexamination by the defence .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution also relied on testimony obtained during pre - trial questioning from a number of other persons convicted in connection with the events of CARDINAL and DATE . These persons had already been convicted at first - instance trials conducted by ORG in DATE . Inasmuch as this can be discerned from ORG judgment of DATE in the applicants\u2019 case , the court relied on testimonies of CARDINAL witnesses of this type .", "CARDINAL . According to the records produced by the prosecution , in the course of questioning as accused persons at the pre - trial investigation stage of criminal case no . DATE , these persons had described , in various degrees of detail , that they had witnessed the applicants at FAC inciting the demonstrators to violent resistance during the events of DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the trial hearings , these witnesses were called to be questioned about their pre - trial statements . According to the relevant trial transcripts and ORG judgment of DATE , having taken to the witness stand at the oral hearings , CARDINAL of these witnesses openly retracted their pre - trial statements against the applicants , noting that they had been forced to make those statements under torture , ill - treatment and other forms of duress applied to them during their pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to these allegations , ORG noted that the ORG complaints of ill - treatment had been addressed at their own respective trials and had been found to be unsubstantiated . The court found that , since these ORG statements had already been relied on as sound evidence at those trials , the assessment of this evidence was a \u201c res judicata matter \u201d . In such circumstances , the court decided to accept these ORG pre - trial statements as good evidence , and refused to attach weight to the fact that the witnesses had subsequently retracted them at their own trials and at the ORG trial .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution also submitted depositions of several other civilian witnesses who had not been convicted in connection with the events of DATE . According to the records produced by the prosecution , during the pre - trial investigation these witnesses had made statements similar to those made by the witnesses mentioned above . However , again , during the questioning at the public hearing , CARDINAL of those witnesses retracted their earlier statements and claimed that they had been forced to make them under threat of ill - treatment or by means of actual ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . According to the trial transcript , witness ORG noted that he had been detained for a period of DATE after the events of DATE and , during that time , had been coerced into giving false testimony against the defendants ( mostly against the second applicant ) . He noted that he had been threatened with prosecution and imprisonment for participating in the events of DATE , had been refused any water during his questioning and had otherwise been intimidated with the purpose of making him sign a pre - printed witness statement prepared by an investigator .", "CARDINAL . In order to assess the allegations of ill - treatment made by these witnesses , ORG heard evidence from investigators and police officers who had questioned them . They stated that they had not ill - treated these witnesses during pre - trial questioning . Furthermore , the court noted that the ORG pre - trial statements were corroborated by other evidence . On that basis , the court found that the allegations of ill - treatment were unfounded and that , therefore , the statements contained in the pre - trial depositions of these witnesses should be accepted and relied on as evidence incriminating the applicants .", "CARDINAL . ORG partially granted the ORG requests to obtain the attendance of witnesses prepared to testify on their behalf . From the judgment , it appears that CARDINAL such witnesses testified . Most of these witnesses were the applicants\u2019 political companions or other persons affiliated with their political parties .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , ORG summarised all of these ORG testimonies noting that all of them denied that the applicants had carried out the specific acts attributed to them , such as planning any violent actions in advance , verbally inciting the crowd to violence or organising the distribution of clubs and stones to demonstrators . It further noted that the witnesses had insisted that , on the contrary , the police had used excessive violence against the demonstrators and that , in their speeches , the applicants had called the demonstrators to refrain from attacking the police and responding to any provocation .", "CARDINAL . ORG then went on to dismiss these testimonies as unreliable , using the following reasoning :", "\u201c Having examined the testimonies of these witnesses heard at the request of [ the defendants ] , the court established that , as indicated above , these persons were members or employees of the [ political ] parties headed by the defendants and , as they worked with [ the defendants ] , they were persons subordinate to and associated with [ the defendants ] . Some of their statements were even contradictory . In particular , while replying to the questions , [ GPE ] stated , on the one hand , that the people speaking from the tribune had not been inciting people to violence and , on the other hand , that he had not heard the speeches as he had been standing QUANTITY away from the tribune and had not been able to even see who had been speaking . [ GPE ] stated that she had been at the square by herself , while [ ORG ] stated that [ GPE ] had been there with him .", "Moreover , the circumstances described by them have been refuted by the above - mentioned comprehensive , reliable and mutually corroborative evidence consisting of testimonies of victims and witnesses , video recordings , material evidence and court judgments in force . Therefore , the court considers that [ the defence witnesses\u2019 ] testimonies are groundless . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , a number of videos depicting the events of DATE were viewed during the court hearings .", "DATE . The videos submitted by the prosecution were intended to show the allegedly violent actions of the demonstrators . Some of the images seen on the videos contradicted the testimonies of certain prosecution witnesses . Some of the defendants\u2019 lawyers ( for example , PERSON ) claimed that they had seen the video evidence for the first time at the court hearings , as it had not been made available to them by the prosecution before the trial , and that they had therefore been unprepared for the examination of this evidence .", "CARDINAL . It appears that , following an application by the defence , ORG also admitted additional video evidence submitted by the defence , which was intended to demonstrate the allegedly excessive use of force by the police and military while suppressing the demonstration .", "CARDINAL . Assessing the video evidence , ORG noted that the video depicted the violent actions of the demonstrators as well as the distribution to them of bludgeons , stones and other \u201c weapons \u201d in an organised manner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG announced that the presentation of evidence was complete and that it would proceed to hear the parties\u2019 oral submissions , inviting the prosecution to make their closing address first . The prosecution asked for an adjournment until DATE to prepare their speech . On DATE the prosecution asked for another adjournment until DATE . The prosecution delivered their closing address during CARDINAL hearings on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the prosecution \u2019s speech , on DATE the court invited the defendants to deliver their respective closing addresses . However , in response to this invitation , almost all of the applicants\u2019 lawyers , taking the floor one after the other , refused to take part in the oral submissions and make a closing address for the defence , providing the court with the following explanations for their refusal .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s lawyer , PERSON , speaking first , noted that , throughout the proceedings , he had not been given adequate time and facilities to prepare his client \u2019s defence . He had not been allowed to fully study the investigation file before the trial and had not been given access to some of the prosecution evidence , such as video recordings , in order to be able to adequately plan his defence tactics . He further noted that , during the proceedings , the defence lawyers had come under various forms of pressure and had even been physically assaulted when arriving at one of the preliminary hearings . He claimed that the lawyers had regularly received various threats from unspecified persons aimed at preventing them from adequately defending the applicants . Although the lawyers had repeatedly brought this matter to ORG attention , and had even specifically complained about the incident involving the physical assault on them , the court had failed to take any action and had ignored the difficulties faced by them . He further argued that , in reality , the outcome of the trial had been predetermined and politically motivated and that the trial itself was being held only as a show , since even before its conclusion the President had publicly declared that the applicants were criminals and would be punished . He stated that , in such circumstances , the lawyers themselves felt vulnerable and frightened . He stated that , for these reasons , he was unable to adequately defend his client and was therefore unable to submit an oral argument . He apologised to his clients , the first applicant and PERSON Ibrahimov , and noted that it would be best if the defendants were allowed to prepare and deliver the oral arguments themselves .", "CARDINAL . Mr Panahov , counsel for the first and second applicants , gave a similar explanation . He also noted that he was not able to provide effective assistance to his clients because , inter alia , he had never been given access to the investigation file . He claimed that after the completion of the pre - trial investigation the lawyers had been pressured into signing records on familiarisation with the material in the case file so that the case could be sent for trial quickly . Although he had specifically complained about this during the preliminary hearings , ORG had ignored this matter . Like PERSON , PERSON also noted that the lawyers were concerned for their personal safety , and that this affected their ability to provide adequate assistance to their clients .", "CARDINAL . Other lawyers concurred with everything stated by their colleagues and gave similar explanations for their refusal to give a closing address .", "DATE . Following this , the first applicant spoke to the court , on behalf of himself and the other defendants , asking for permission to make their defence speeches in person . He noted that , following their ORG refusal to take part in the oral submissions , they were essentially left without any legal assistance . He requested the court to allow them sufficient time to prepare their closing addresses .", "CARDINAL . In response , Judge PERSON stated that the defendants would be allowed to exercise a right of reply ( replika ) . Judge PERSON noted that procedural law allowed a defendant to give a closing address in person only if he or she was unrepresented by counsel . Judge PERSON commented that counsel could not shirk their duty to defend their clients .", "CARDINAL . At the next hearing , on DATE , the first applicant , on behalf of himself and the other defendants , lodged a formal application in writing , requesting the court to allow them to make their defence speeches themselves .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the application as groundless . It noted that the defence lawyers had provided effective and adequate legal assistance to their clients . It further noted that the lawyers had been given ample opportunity to consult the investigation file but had themselves failed to do so , that it was the ORG duty to participate in oral arguments , that they could not refuse to assist their clients at this stage of the proceedings , and that they had no good reason for shirking their duties .", "CARDINAL . It appears that only the fourth applicant \u2019s lawyers delivered a closing address on behalf of their client , despite the fact that the fourth applicant had joined the first applicant \u2019s request for permission to give the closing address in person .", "CARDINAL . ORG then proceeded to invite the parties to exercise their right of reply . The prosecution waived that right .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the defendants\u2019 speeches in reply , the third applicant asked the court not to place any time - limits on them , taking into account the fact that no closing addresses had been delivered on their behalf during the oral submissions . The presiding judge noted that this would be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . Exercising his right of reply , the first applicant spoke for TIME . The presiding judge interrupted him CARDINAL times , reminding him that a reply should be brief ( no longer than TIME ) , and ultimately cut short his speech despite the applicant \u2019s protests .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , all the other applicants attempted to deliver long speeches while exercising their right of reply , but were interrupted and ultimately stopped by the presiding judge after TIME , on the ground that a reply should be brief .", "CARDINAL . Following this , the trial hearings ended after each of the defendants was allowed to speak CARDINAL more time , in order to make their final plea .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicants of organising public disorder ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) and organising acts of violence against ORG officials ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The first and fourth applicants were each sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The second and third applicants were each sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicants appealed to ORG against their conviction . In particular , in his appeal , the first applicant complained of , inter alia , breaches of his rights to an impartial tribunal , adequate time and facilities for preparation of his defence , effective representation , equality of arms and presumption of innocence . He also complained of errors by the trial court in the procedure for the admission and assessment of evidence .
