The first applicant currently lives in GPE and the second to fifth applicants live in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , a mechanics and a professional driver , is of NORP ethnic origin coming from south - east GPE . He was not a member of any political party but like many other members of his family sympathised with the ORG ( ORG ) . During the violent conflicts between NORP authorities and NORP people in DATE and DATE he lived in GPE . The first applicant stated that he had assisted the ORG and that because of several occurrences he felt persecuted by NORP authorities . Fearing for his life he found it necessary to flee in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant , PERSON , married the first applicant in DATE . She and the third applicant , their son PERSON ( born in DATE ) , continued to live with the first applicant \u2019s parents in GPE . After the latter \u2019s house was set on fire , she and the son spent a period as refugees in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over a period of DATE , the first applicant sojourned at several locations in GPE . He had some contact with his wife and son and applied for visa to visit GPE , where his older brother had obtained asylum ( in DATE ) . Only the first applicant obtained a visa . In DATE he arrived in GPE and applied for asylum . His wife and son went back to PERSON , where she gave birth to the couple \u2019s second son , PERSON , in DATE ( the fourth applicant ) .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s asylum application in GPE was refused . He then stayed in several NORP countries and returned to GPE where his second asylum application was refused in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he applied for asylum in GPE . ORG rejected the application on DATE . His appeal to ORG was rejected by a decision of DATE , according to which he was under a duty to leave the country and measures were to be taken to implement this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( tingrett ) convicted the first applicant on charges of aggravated assault and sentenced him to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment , of which DATE were suspended . He was found guilty of having inflicted with a kitchen knife a cut in the shoulder of another man which had been mended with CARDINAL stiches . Even though the extent of the injury was not considerable , the offence was deemed very serious and could easily have had great consequences for the victim . In mitigation , ORG had regard to its finding that , whilst it was uncertain who had started the row , the victim had gone further than the applicant and had provoked him by hitting his face with his palm and by uttering serious insults against his family . The victim had also withdrawn his criminal complaint against the applicant . The judgment was transmitted to ORG for consideration of whether there was a ground for ordering his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to revise its earlier rejection ( of CARDINAL DATE ) of the first applicant \u2019s asylum application and asked ORG to implement the decision . It contained no mention of the judgment of DATE , but on CARDINAL DATE the ORG also forwarded a copy to ORG requesting it to assess whether there was a basis for expulsion . The applicant did not leave the country , and the authorities took no specific measures to deport him until he received a warning to this effect issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was fined for driving too fast , and in DATE and DATE for driving without a license .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant arrived in GPE with the couple \u2019s CARDINAL sons and applied for asylum on DATE , which ORG rejected on DATE . ORG upheld the rejection on DATE , stating that unless they left the country voluntarily , the expulsion was to be forcibly implemented , if possible in coordination with that of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a daughter of the couple , GPE , was born ( the fifth applicant ) .", "CARDINAL . Pending amendments to ORG , ORG decided on DATE to stay the implementation of the decision of CARDINAL DATE regarding the wife and the sons but in a separate decision , referring inter alia to his conviction of DATE , rejected the first applicant \u2019s request to stay the implementation of the refusal of CARDINAL may DATE to grant him asylum .", "CARDINAL . Following the warning of DATE , the first applicant was on DATE arrested and detained for DATE with a view to deportation . On DATE ORG decided , under LAW of LAW DATE , to order his expulsion and to prohibit his re - entry in GPE for an indefinite duration . This was because of his criminal conviction and of his long illegal stay and work in GPE . On appeal , the decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the first applicant requested ORG ( tingrett ) to issue an order that he be granted a residence- and work permit and an interlocutory injunction to stay his deportation pending the outcome of the judicial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Following a request by the first applicant to ORG , the latter granted him on DATE a stay of implementation of his expulsion until ORG had decided on his request for an interim measure to stay his deportation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected a request to revise its earlier rejection ( of DATE ) as there were not sufficient reasons to grant the wife and the children a residence permit on humanitarian grounds .", "CARDINAL . NORP In an appeal of DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyer challenged the lawfulness of the decision of CARDINAL DATE on the ground that ORG had been diagnosed as suffering from child autism and had special needs .", "CARDINAL . In the light of this information the parties agreed before ORG that the immigration authorities should consider the matter anew for all the family members .", "CARDINAL . After having decided on DATE not to implement the expulsion with respect to the wife and the children , ORG on DATE decided ( with CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL ) to alter its decision of CARDINAL DATE and granted the second applicant , with the children , a residence- and work - permit under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( according to which such a permit could be granted if warranted by weighty humanitarian considerations or particular links to the country , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The majority attached decisive weight to the new information concerning the daughter \u2019s health together with the length of the children \u2019s residence in GPE ( DATE and DATE in the case of the sons ) . It also had regard to more recent practice of ORG . The permit was granted for DATE and could on certain conditions be renewed , constitute a ground for settlement permit and for family reunification . A prerequisite for the permit was that the wife continued to live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG carried out a new assessment of the first applicant \u2019s immigration status . It did not alter its decision of DATE upholding the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE to order his expulsion , stating inter alia the following reasons .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , the ORG could in principle have responded more rapidly with regard to the question of expulsion in connection with the applicant \u2019s conviction . The ORG had had an occasion to bring this matter up as early as in DATE , when ORG by a letter of CARDINAL DATE forwarded a copy of the judgment with a request for assessment of the question of expulsion ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . By the fact that counsel for the applicant was sent a copy of the ORG \u2019s letter , the applicant had been made aware that the offence could constitute a ground for expulsion . The specific procedural rules concerning expulsion of convicted foreign nationals indicated in principle that a decision to expel should be made as soon as possible after conviction with no further right of appeal or after the serving of a sentence had been commenced ( section CARDINAL of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . There was nevertheless nothing to prevent that the offence be taken into account at DATE together with any other factors militating in favour of expulsion in a global assessment . In the ORG \u2019s view , it could not be decisive for the applicant \u2019s expulsion from the country pursuant to LAW ) of LAW that his DATE conviction had not been raised until DATE . In this connection , it referred to the fact that at the date of the ORG \u2019s expulsion decision the applicant had resided unlawfully in GPE for DATE and had in addition worked without a work permit for large parts of this period . In addition , since his conviction in DATE , he had on CARDINAL occasions been fined for violation of LAW ( on the latter two occasions for driving without a driving license , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Whilst these offences were regarded individually and on principle as being relatively minor , they ought to be viewed in connection with the applicant \u2019s previous conviction for bodily harm , in addition to his failure to respond to the order to leave the country as well as his prolonged unlawful residence and employment throughout DATE . These offences , when considered as a whole , indicated a lack of respect for NORP law and for NORP authorities\u2019 decisions .", "The ORG further observed that intentional or negligent violations of LAW of DATE of the nature involved in the instant case in principle constituted a criminal offence ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW of DATE ) . It reiterated that the legislative bill to ORG ( GPE . MONEY ( DATE ) ) stated inter alia the following with regard to expulsion on the grounds of violations of LAW ( page CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c Although such violations [ i.e. gross violations of LAW ] normally also may lead to criminal liability , in terms of prosecution costs , it would be advantageous if an expulsion order could be made without requiring a legally enforceable criminal judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , the ORG altered its decision of DATE prohibiting the first applicant to return to GPE indefinitely and limited the prohibition to DATE . A decisive consideration for this change was that his spouse and children had been granted a residence permit . ORG observed that as a starting point the first applicant \u2019s expulsion would mean that the family would be split . However , the right of the other family members to reside in GPE did not imply any corresponding duty to do so . The whole family originated from GPE , where the older children had been born and lived during their childhood . Their family life could in principle be secured either by the whole family moving to GPE or through the visits of the wife and children of the husband in GPE . His expulsion was of limited duration and at the expiry of the period it would be possible to apply for a residence permit on family reunification ground . Whether such a permit would be granted would depend on future circumstances . However , an expulsion for DATE did not imply a permanent splitting of the family .", "CARDINAL . The Board had particular regard to the daughter \u2019s situation , which was followed up and was to be the subject of measures in GPE , and to the scarcity and low quality of public assistance in GPE to children suffering from handicaps and other types of illnesses affecting their functional capacities , where assistance to children suffering from autism and their parents was provided primarily by private institutions . Bearing in mind especially the daughter \u2019s interests , ORG had understanding for the fact that the family as a whole did not prefer to return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , ORG discontinued , by decisions of DATE and DATE , the proceedings in so far as the spouse and the children were concerned . As regards the first applicant , ORG found for ORG and rejected his request for an interlocutory injunction to stay his deportation , by a judgment and a decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( lagmannsrett ) rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision not to grant an interlocutory injunction , as did ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , ORG , by a judgment of DATE , quashed ORG decision of DATE as being unlawful .", "CARDINAL . ORG had no doubt , nor was it disputed , that the objective conditions set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) and ( c ) of the DATE LAW for ordering the first applicant \u2019s deportation had been fulfilled ; the only question was whether the measure would be proportionate as required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . In this regard , ORG observed that his conviction in DATE for having caused physical injury to a third party with a knife was serious , even though there had been mitigating circumstances and the sentence ( DATE of which CARDINAL were suspended ) had been relatively short . General considerations of crime prevention suggested that one ought to react to violence of this character .", "CARDINAL . However , the expulsion of a convicted person ought to be effected as soon as possible after the criminal judgment had become enforceable . The fact that DATE had elapsed before concrete measures had been taken to expel him , which could hardly be due to anything else than a lack of coordination on the part of the immigration authorities , weakened the significance of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , the fact that the first applicant for DATE had stayed and worked unlawfully in GPE was very serious and was not altered by the authorities\u2019 passiveness . ORG had not incorrectly assessed his attachment to GPE and lack of legitimate expectations of being able to stay there . The fact that his spouse and children had been granted a residence permit would not hinder his expulsion , as this would not in the circumstances be a disproportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis him . Another question was whether his DATE daughter PERSON with her special care needs ought to be viewed as such extraordinary circumstances as could warrant his being able to stay in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On the evidence ORG found that ORG chronic and very serious degree of child autism and need for follow - up would affect the other family members strongly in DATE to come and entail a burden on them far beyond the normal level . Her functional incapacity meant that she would always be dependent on her GPE resources . Her mother was exhausted and had a marginal level of functioning . It was the father who had activated GPE on a DATE basis and she was particularly attached to him . Should he be deported it was likely that the disturbance to her development would be aggravated and would cause a further burden to the mother , to the brothers and to others who assumed responsibilities for her .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the first applicant \u2019s expulsion would expose GPE to an extraordinary burden that would not be justified by general considerations of crime prevention or immigration policy and would constitute a disproportionate measure . In this context ORG had regard to the importance of the fact that the residence permit to the mother and the children had so far been limited to DATE at a time .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld ORG findings that the first applicant had not made it sufficiently probable that he upon return to GPE would risk such persecution as could justify granting him a refugee status or would otherwise face a real danger of loss of life or exposure to inhuman treatment .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG dismissed the claim for a residence- and work permit from the courts .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) challenging ORG proportionality assessment under section CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( PERSON ) ( NORP Supreme Court Law Reports \u2013 \u201c ORG . \u201d p. CARDINAL ) ORG observed inter alia that considerable time had elapsed from the rejection of his asylum application in DATE until the expulsion decision of DATE and further to the present review of the case by ORG . Throughout this time , the first applicant had resided in GPE unlawfully , of which he had also been aware . The time factor could thus not be given particular weight in the assessment . Whilst his residence had naturally resulted in strengthening his attachment to GPE , it had equally aggravated his violations of LAW . This point of view was particularly valid in a case such as the present one , where the applicant had been aware throughout that he was required to leave the country .", "CARDINAL . Nor had the first applicant had any legitimate expectation of being allowed to remain in the country . Also , his criminal conviction meant that an instruction of DATE issued by ORG to put certain cases in abeyance , notably cases concerning applications for asylum or residence , involving or relating to children , made by persons who had resided in GPE for DATE , did not apply to the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG found it established that the first applicant had committed serious violations of LAW DATE which of their own clearly constituted a sufficient ground for expulsion . An additional ground were the offences he had committed under Article CARDINAL , cf . Article CARDINAL , of LAW and , albeit of lesser importance , under LAW . ORG had in its decision of DATE pointed out that immigration policy considerations then ought to militate strongly in favour of upholding the expulsion order . Also the background \u2013 his unlawful stays in other NORP countries with unsuccessful asylum applications , including once under a false name \u2013 was a factor that to some extent went in the same direction .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that the first applicant lacked a legal basis for residing in GPE and therefore ought to leave the country in any event . What the likely outcome could be of an application for residence permit in the current situation could not enter into the consideration of the case . The disputed decision entailed the consequence for him that he would be expelled from the country for a period of DATE and he could not apply for a residence- or work permit during this period . GPE \u2019s participation in the GPE cooperation meant as a rule that an expulsion from GPE also implied a prohibition to enter the entire LOC . In the case of a foreigner , whose unlawful residence had been so extensive and so long and who had been convicted of violence , it could not be said that an expulsion in such circumstances would constitute an extraordinary burden .", "CARDINAL . The interests pertaining to his wife and his CARDINAL eldest children could hardly speak in favour of making a different assessment than that which applied to the first applicant . They had for DATE lived on their own in GPE . That the first applicant in the event of an expulsion could not come for visit for DATE was a normal consequence of expulsion and did not constitute an extraordinary burden . The family life could be maintained by his wife and children travelling to GPE for shorter or longer periods .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that , whilst ORG had relied on the consideration that GPE was suffering from a chronic and serious degree of child autism , the first applicant had submitted a medical statement of DATE from which it appeared that her current diagnosis was \u201c unspecified far - reaching developmental disturbance \u201d . The expulsion applied for DATE during which the first applicant would not have the opportunity to help his daughter upon visits in the country . As already mentioned , the family contact would instead be maintained through visits in GPE . Nor in this respect could there be a question of any extraordinary burden .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having regard the ORG \u2019s case - law , notably PERSON and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE ) and the criteria of \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d and \u201c insurmountable obstacles \u201d relied on there , concluded that the first applicant \u2019s expulsion would not give rise to a violation of LAW . His expulsion would not constitute a disproportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis the other family members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was expelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The second to fifth applicants were granted NORP citizenship on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
