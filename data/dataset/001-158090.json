On DATE ORG approved the introduction of a scheme of aid for displaced persons and war victims . Under the scheme , displaced persons were entitled to refugee cards . The holders of such cards were ( and still are ) eligible for a range of benefits including housing assistance . For the purposes of the scheme the term \u201c displaced \u201d was determined as being any person whose permanent home was in the areas occupied by the NORP armed forces , in an inaccessible area , or in an area which had been evacuated to meet the needs of ORG .", "CARDINAL . To implement the scheme , the Director of the Care and Rehabilitation of Displaced Persons Service ( \u201c SCRDP \u201d ) issued a circular on DATE . The circular provided that non - displaced women whose husbands were displaced could be registered on the refugee card of their husbands . It also provided that children whose fathers were displaced could be registered on the refugee card of their fathers ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . No provision was made for the children of displaced women to be registered on the refugee cards of their mothers .", "CARDINAL . Although the term \u201c displaced \u201d was extended by ORG on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , at the time of the facts giving rise to the present application it had not been extended to allow children whose mothers were displaced but whose fathers were not , to qualify for refugee cards .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s mother has been a refugee since DATE . Her mother is the holder of a refugee card .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant married and began looking for a house for her family in GPE . She wished to obtain housing assistance and so , on DATE , applied to ORG of ORG for a refugee card with occupied PERSON , the place from which her mother was displaced , as her place of displacement .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the request was rejected on the basis that the applicant was not a displaced person because , while her mother was a displaced person , her father was not .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a recourse before ORG challenging the above decision . She claimed , inter alia , that the decision was in violation of the principle of equality safeguarded by LAW and in breach of LAW taken in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL . She claimed that it also breached LAW .", "CARDINAL . A single judge of ORG dismissed the recourse on DATE , finding that , on the basis of the relevant case - law , the extension of the applicable criteria so as to cover the children of displaced women was not possible . The question of extending the term \u201c displaced \u201d to cover the children whose mothers were displaced but whose fathers were not had been repeatedly discussed before the ORG of Representatives\u2019 Committee for Refugees . A proposal to change the law to that effect had been placed before the ORG but was never approved . Furthermore , because of the consequences which would ensue from such an extension of the term \u201c displaced \u201d , the Minister of the ORG had referred the question to ORG for its consideration and , on DATE , ORG had decided not to extend the term in this manner ( see the relevant domestic law and practice set out at DATE and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal before ORG .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the findings of the first instance court .", "CARDINAL . ORG held as follows :", "\u201c [ In the present appeal ] an attempt was made to demonstrate that we must depart from the above [ first instance ] decision , since ORG can , in the present case , proceed to the so - called \u201c extended interpretation \u201d and , by invoking the principle of equality , widen the application of the criterion to the children of displaced mothers as well .", "...", "The proposed extension of the plan was placed before ORG in Proposal no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which was submitted by ORG to amend the criteria for providing assistance to displaced persons . However the decision taken refers only to amendments which do not concern the present case . Despite the fact that , on DATE , by decision no . CARDINAL of ORG , further amendments were made by which the term \u2018 ORG was extended and now includes other categories of those entitled , the point which concerns us in this case remains unchanged .", "...", "In accordance with the case - law ( ORG v. The Republic , [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.A.D. CARDINAL ) , the non - existence of a legislative provision can not be remedied by judicial decision because , in such a case , the constitutional control which ORG exercises would be turned into a means of reshaping or supplementing the legislation .", "...", "We have given this matter very serious consideration in view also of the position that , in the case of an arrangement favouring CARDINAL sex only , the extended application of the provision also finds support in NORP Community Law ...", "However this may be , we can not depart from the prevailing case - law . ORG v. The Republic , cited above , fixed the framework of the jurisdiction of ORG . ORG has , in accordance with Article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the power to uphold in full or in part the decision appealed against or to declare the act or omission invalid . It does not have jurisdiction to legislate by extending legislative arrangements which did not meet with the approval of parliament . This would conflict with the principle of the separation of powers . We note that ORG can not of its own accord enact legislation which would incur expenditure . If ORG , the constitutionally appointed legislative organ , does not have such a right , ORG has even less of a right .", "In agreement with the principles set out above , we conclude that ORG does not have the competence to proceed to an extended application of a legislative arrangement . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The same issue of the non - extension of refugee cards to the children of displaced women was also considered by ORG in GPE GPE v. the Republic ( case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . That challenge was rejected at first instance on DATE ( ( DATE ) CARDINAL A.A.D. CARDINAL ) , the court finding that , while it was difficult to understand why there should not be uniform treatment between the children of displaced men and displaced women , on the basis of PERSON , cited above , it was unable to grant the relief sought . This was because PERSON was , in effect , asking the court to extend the relevant legal framework so that the benefits provided to children of displaced fathers would be provided to children of displaced mothers . An appeal against that judgment was dismissed on DATE by the same bench which dismissed the present applicant \u2019s appeal ( the appeal judgment in GPE is reported at ( DATE ) CARDINAL \u0391.\u0391.D. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "14", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
