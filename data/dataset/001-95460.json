He is represented by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON PERSON , of ORG , and their Co - agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant , who was DATE at the time , and his sister entered GPE with their mother . The mother had a valid passport and a visa for DATE to visit the applicant \u2019s sister and brotherin - law , who had been granted permanent residence permits in GPE in DATE and DATE respectively .", "Shortly thereafter , the applicant \u2019s mother requested asylum . Her request also applied to the applicant and his sister who were minors at the relevant time . According to a registration report of DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother submitted that she had been an active member of a monarchist organisation called GPE . She had printed leaflets about the king and distributed them in her home town . In so far as her statement involved the applicant it concerned a demonstration in which she and the applicant had participated on DATE . The applicant , who at the relevant time was DATE , had been arrested , detained and subjected to torture for DATE . The applicant \u2019s mother had never been convicted but feared being persecuted by the authorities because of the said activities . Allegedly , she had recently learned that all members of the organisation had been arrested .", "DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother explained that she had been a member of GPE since DATE . On DATE , due to their participation in the demonstration , the applicant was arrested , tortured and detained for DATE . The applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s home was seized DATE after the demonstration , but thereafter the authorities had not made further contact with the family . When the applicant \u2019s mother left GPE , the organisation had still been active , but subsequent to her entry into GPE she had learnt that it had been uncovered , that its members had been arrested and that she was wanted by the authorities .", "The immigration authorities held further interviews with the applicant \u2019s mother on DATE and DATE , during which she elaborated on her personal situation . As to the applicant , she explained that he had been detained for DATE in connection with the demonstration in DATE . The applicant \u2019s mother also submitted various documents in support of her request for asylum .", "On DATE ORG ) refused to grant the applicant , his mother and sister asylum , finding that the applicant \u2019s mother lacked credibility and that the family did not fulfil the requirements for obtaining asylum .", "The applicant , his mother and sister appealed against the decision to ORG ( PERSON ) , before which the applicant confirmed that he had been arrested in DATE for DATE .", "On DATE ORG upheld the refusal to grant the family asylum . It noted that the applicant \u2019s mother had provided various divergent and unreliable versions of events and considered that she had failed to substantiate that the family had fulfilled the criteria to be granted asylum .", "On DATE , a representative for the applicant \u2019s mother requested a re - opening of the proceedings which was refused by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , having reached the age of majority , the applicant requested that the proceedings be re - opened . He alleged that he had been politically active in GPE and recently learnt that he was wanted by the authorities . By decision of DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request finding that he had failed to add significant new information or viewpoints to the case . The applicant was deported the following day .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE a representative for the applicant informed ORG that the applicant had been picked up by CARDINAL men in civilian clothing in GPE on CARDINAL DATE and that nobody had heard from him since . Accordingly , the representative requested a re - opening of the proceedings , which was refused by ORG on DATE .", "Another request for a re - opening of the proceedings was lodged with ORG on DATE and refused by the latter on DATE .", "A third request for a re - opening of the proceedings was lodged with ORG on DATE and refused by the latter on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant re - entered GPE and applied for asylum . He maintained that , due to his previous political activities and asylum request , upon return to GPE he had been detained and subjected to torture for DATE . According to medical statements , inter alia by ORG dated DATE , the applicant suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and depression which , it was assessed , was consistent with his claim that he had been subjected to torture .", "By letters of DATE and DATE the applicant requested that ORG acknowledge liability in damages for the suffering inflicted on him as a consequence of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . By letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant that it could not acknowledge such liability .", "On DATE , ORG granted the applicant asylum . It found that , although the applicant could not be considered to have been persecuted when he left GPE together with his mother and sister in DATE , it could be considered a fact that the applicant had been arrested by the NORP authorities shortly after his return to GPE at DATE and that he had been detained for a long time . In addition , the applicant had left GPE illegally . Accordingly , ORG found that if returned again to GPE the applicant would have a well - founded fear of persecution because the NORP authorities would incorrectly consider him to be involved in extensive political activities aimed at the regime .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action for damages against ORG before ORG of Eastern GPE ( PERSON Landsret ) , requesting that the former be ordered to acknowledge that it was liable to pay compensation for pain and suffering in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) equal to PERCENT ( ORG ) since by decisions of DATE and DATE ORG had refused to grant the applicant asylum , although allegedly at the relevant time he had amply demonstrated the risk he would face upon return to GPE of being subjected to arrest and torture , which subsequently happened .", "Referring to LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) , according to which no appeal lay against decisions taken by ORG , ORG pleaded as a preliminary issue that ORG should dismiss the case .", "ORG decided to determine the preliminary issue separately and decided on DATE that , despite the invoked provision of LAW , it had authority to examine the applicant \u2019s compensation claim on the merits . The reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c As established , most recently by ORG decision published in ORG ( ORG , p. CARDINAL ) , as a result of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW , according to which ORG decisions are final , the courts\u2019 review of ORG decisions is limited to a review of legal questions , including shortcomings in the basis for the decision and illegal discretion . Consequently , the courts can not determine claims for compensation in so far as the claim in reality is based solely on the assumption that ORG made a mistake in its concrete assessment of the evidence and its discretion .", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] compensation claim concerns the treatment to which he was subjected in GPE upon his return in DATE , and thus relates to ORG decisions of DATE and DATE . [ The applicant ] has maintained , among other things , that ORG failed to decide on the [ the applicant \u2019s ] risk of ill - treatment by the authorities resulting from his being returned [ to his country of origin ] after such a long period of absence .", "Consequently , [ the applicant ] has invoked arguments which do not relate to ORG concrete assessment of the evidence and discretion . \u201d", "ORG appealed to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , submitting anew that the case should be dismissed .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation in its entirety with the following reasoning :", "\u201c The circumstances which [ the applicant ] has submitted in support of his argument that ORG were liable and therefore must grant him compensation , presuppose a review of ORG decisions of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE . ORG agrees that such a review is limited to an assessment of the legality of the administrative decision in question , including shortcomings in the basis for the decision and illegal assessments , also in a case like the present [ concerning a compensation claim ] . In its decision to refuse to grant the applicant asylum , ORG took a stand on the main claim [ submitted by the applicant , his mother and sister ] , namely DATE of alleged membership of an illegal organisation , its being uncovered and the applicant \u2019s participation therein . Although not expressly stated in the decision , ORG finds no reason to assume that ORG did not make an assessment of [ the applicant \u2019s ] personal conditions including his participation in a demonstration in DATE and his subsequent short term detention , which was clearly mentioned in the facts part of the decision . It must also be assumed that ORG did take into account whether [ the applicant ] and his mother and sister personally were at risk upon entry and stay in GPE due to the long absence from their country since DATE . Against this background , ORG finds that the applicant \u2019s objections to ORG decisions in reality amount to a disagreement with ORG assessment of the evidence and its conclusive decision as to whether the facts of the case could justify asylum . \u201d", "Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Erstatningsansvarsloven ) , a person who is responsible for an unlawful infringement of another \u2019s freedom , privacy , honour or person , is liable to pay damages to the injured party . An action for damages in this respect may be instituted before the ordinary courts in accordance with the rules set out in LAW ( Retsplejeloven ) .", "By virtue of section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) , asylum is granted to aliens who satisfy the conditions of LAW . Applications for asylum are determined in the first instance by ORG and in the second instance by ORG , which is not subject to any instructions from ORG .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG comprises a chairman , deputy chairmen ( ORG ) and other members . The chairman and the deputy chairmen must be judges and the other members must be attorneys or serve with ORG . The judges are appointed upon nomination by ORG ) . The other members of ORG are appointed by ORG . The attorneys are appointed upon nomination by ORG ( PERSON ) and the other members are appointed upon nomination by the Minister for ORG . The members of ORG are independent and can not accept or seek directions from the appointing or nominating authority or organization . The term of appointment is for DATE . The members are eligible for re - appointment and the member will be re - appointed if he or she requests re - appointment . The office as member ceases when the member resigns by own wish ; when the member no longer has the organizational affiliation on which the original appointment was based ; or at DATE of the member \u2019s CARDINALth birthday . The members of ORG can only be removed by judgment under the rules applying to the removal of judges . The jurisdiction of ORG ( PERSON ) relating to judges applies equally to members of ORG . Cases tried by ORG are heard by the chairman or a deputy chairman , an attorney and a member serving with ORG .", "Pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of LAW , decisions by ORG are final , which means that there is no avenue for appeal against the ORG \u2019s decisions . Aliens may , however , by virtue of LAW of LAW ( PERSON ) bring an appeal before the ordinary courts , which have authority to adjudge on any matter concerning the limits to the competence of a public authority .", "LAW read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The courts of justice shall be empowered to decide any question relating to the scope of the executives\u2019 authority ; though any person wishing to question such authority shall not , by taking the case to the courts of justice , avoid temporary compliance with orders given by the executive authority . \u201d", "The courts will normally confine the review to the question of deciding on the legality of the administrative decision , including shortcomings of the basis for the decision and illegal assessments , but will generally refrain from adjudging on the administrative discretion exercised .", "The question of the scope of the finality rule set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW has been brought before the courts several times ( see , inter alia , ORG judgments of DATE , published in ORG ( ORG ) , ( UfR DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL DATE ( UfR CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , DATE ( UfR DATE . p CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL DATE ( UfR DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL DATE ( UfR DATE , p. CARDINAL ) and DATE ( UfR DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . Reference was also made to more recent ORG judgments of DATE ( UfR DATE , p. DATE ) , CARDINAL judgments of CARDINAL DATE ( UfR DATE , p. CARDINAL ; GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL ; GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL ; and GPE DATE , p. MONEY ) , a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG case No . CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL judgments of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG cases Nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ) . According to those judgments , judicial review of decisions issued by ORG is limited to a review of issues of law , including an inadequate basis for a decision , procedural errors and unlawful exercise of discretion .", "The Government have also referred to a judgment of DATE from ORG , published in ORG ( DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , which in their view illustrated that ORG does not interpret section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW narrowly . In that case , ORG held that ORG was not entitled to make the granting of asylum status conditional upon the plaintiff being able to render probable that he was at a specific risk of having to carry out or assist in actions that might entail exclusion under international rules pursuant to LAW relating to ORG . ORG noted that :", "\u201c the question of whether it is justified to set up these conditions , which relate to the disputed fact and the burden of proof as well as other issues , is an issue of law subject to judicial review regardless of the finality rule laid down in LAW , subsection CARDINAL of LAW . \u201d", "Thus , the Government pointed out , the national courts can not substitute their own decision on the merits of a case embraced by LAW CARDINAL of LAW for that of ORG . However , if a decision issued by ORG is appealed against to a national court , and if that court finds that ORG decision suffers from material defects of law , including an inadequate basis for the decision , procedural errors or unlawful exercise of discretion , the court may remit the case to ORG for reconsideration .
