He stated that PERSON had been on the list of missing persons since DATE and that there were grounds to believe that she had been a victim of loan sharks to whom she had not repaid the debt .

The defendant did not deny that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with PERSON on DATE ] in the day - time at the following address ... The findings of a forensic biology report ... corroborated the fact of sexual intercourse by PERSON and PERSON The following evidence confirms the non - consensual and violent nature of the intercourse between PERSON and PERSON : the statements by the victim PERSON made during the pre - trial investigation and read out in court ; the statements by the witnesses PERSON and PERSON . made during the pre - trial investigation and read out in court ; the testimony by the witness PERSON and the witness PERSON which were logical and consistent and which the court finds no reason to doubt .

PERSON replied : [ PERSON ] is a smart girl , she \u2019s got it right , - and took her to the GPE which implies the non - consensual nature of the intercourse between PERSON and K.

The fact that the forensic study did not uncover any injuries to PERSON \u2019s genital or anal area does not exclude the possibility that sexual acts had been performed on PERSON \u2019s against her will ; the expert PERSON explained to the court that a forcible intercourse is possible without injuring the genitals or the anal opening and that she could not categorically exclude that there might be some indications of violent sexual intercourse . The scene of the offence ( a fourth - floor flat ) , the identity of the participants ( CARDINAL men , both recently released from penitentiary facilities , CARDINAL of them infected with tuberculosis , and a young woman ) , the number and frequency of sexual intercourse and violent acts demonstrate that the intercourse was carried out against the victim \u2019s will . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
