GEORGIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing;Equality of arms)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Mits;Yonko Grozev;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was dismissed from a printing company . He brought proceedings against his employer .", "CARDINAL . At the preparatory hearing of DATE the ORG in GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) scheduled the main hearing for TIME on DATE . The preparatory hearing was attended both by the applicant and his lawyer . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer wrote to the court informing that he was due to attend a hearing for an appeal on points of law before ORG of GPE at TIME on DATE and therefore could not be present . He requested that the hearing be adjourned . No reply followed .", "CARDINAL . ORG held the hearing on DATE as planned . The applicant appeared and submitted that , as he was not a lawyer , he would be unable to argue his case in the absence of his representative . He requested that the hearing be adjourned so that he could be represented by his lawyer . Counsel for the opposing party objected to the request and asked the first - instance court to issue a default judgment against the applicant . The record of the hearing shows that the judge warned the applicant that , if he refused to take any further part , \u201c the court would give a decision in absentia \u201d . The applicant , however , repeated that he would be unable to present his case without his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . According to the record of the hearing , ORG did not consider the applicant \u2019s request for an adjournment . It ruled that his refusal to participate in the hearing equated to a failure to appear in court within the meaning of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In view of the above , and concluding that the applicant had been duly summoned to the hearing in accordance with Articles DATE of the ORG , the judge issued , in accordance with Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , a default judgment rejecting the applicant \u2019s action without examining it or giving any reasons .", "CARDINAL . The decision stated in its operative part that an application to set aside the judgment could be made to the same court within DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer filed an application to set aside the judgment , enclosing a letter from ORG dated DATE confirming that he had participated in the hearing of an appeal on points of law at TIME on DATE . He argued that his involvement in the examination of another case was a \u201c valid reason \u201d for his absence ( see ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG as cited in paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same ORG judge confirmed his own decision of DATE . He found that the applicant had been summoned to the hearing in accordance with the rules set out in Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the ORG , and pointed out that there was no legal requirement to also summon a party \u2019s lawyer . When he had appeared before the court , the applicant had stated that he objected to the examination of the case without his lawyer present and had refused to take part in the hearing . As conduct of that sort equated to a failure to appear under LAW ORG and none of the circumstances provided for by LAW ORG had been established , the judge decided that LAW ORG should not be applied to set aside the default judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision of DATE . On DATE the ORG ( \u201c the Regional Court \u201d ) found that , in breach of Article CARDINAL ) of the ORG , the applicant and his lawyer had not been properly warned of the consequences of not appearing before the court . Moreover , at the hearing on DATE ORG had not properly explained to the applicant what a default judgment would mean for him . ORG considered that , as the applicant was not a lawyer , he could not have known that a decision in absentia would necessarily be to his detriment . Therefore , as the caution provided for in Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL had not been issued in the present case , ORG held that there were grounds , under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG , for setting aside the decision of DATE . The applicant \u2019s appeal was thus remitted to ORG for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s former employer lodged an appeal on points of law against the appeal judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE found that , contrary to ORG assertion , the applicant had been informed in the hearing notice of the consequences of a failure to appear . There had therefore been no violation of LAW ORG . ORG also found that , according to the record of the hearing of DATE , the judge had warned the applicant that \u201c in the event of a refusal to take part in the hearing , a decision [ would ] be given in absentia \u201d . The applicant had therefore been sufficiently informed of the consequences of his conduct . Lastly , ORG pointed out that a court could give a decision in absentia if a lawyer or a party failed to appear at a hearing , on condition that the party had been summoned in accordance with the rules set out in Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the ORG . Consequently , ORG set aside ORG judgment of DATE and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG followed ORG reasoning and added that the applicant \u2019s lawyer \u2019s involvement in another hearing was not a \u201c valid reason \u201d for setting aside the decision in absentia , given that LAW ORG did not specify on what grounds a party could refuse to take part in a hearing . According to ORG , this meant that any refusal to take part in the hearing was unjustified . It therefore upheld the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . An appeal on points of law by the applicant was dismissed on DATE . ORG ruled that Article CARDINAL contained an exhaustive list of the grounds on which a default judgment could be set aside . It further concluded , in contrast with the finding of ORG on DATE , that the applicant had been duly informed of the consequences of his failure to appear at the hearing . Thus , this argument could not have served as a valid basis for a re - examination of the case in accordance with LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . Nor did the applicant \u2019s refusal to participate in a trial for whatever reason , according to ORG , merit a re - examination of the case . It emphasised in this connection that the refusal to participate equated to a failure to appear in terms of its legal consequences .", "CARDINAL . No appeal lay against the above decision of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
