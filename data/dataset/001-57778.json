Mr PERSON de la GPE is a NORP national and practises as a lawyer ( avocat ) . He lives in GPE , where he has his chambers .", "He owns an estate of QUANTITY in the d\u00e9partement of ORG . ORG crosses the property , which lies within the administrative districts ( communes ) of FAC and PERSON . In order to provide an electricity supply for the ch\u00e2teau of FAC , which was on his land , he envisaged converting a long - disused hydroelectric dam into a self - contained miniature power - station . On DATE \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France gave its approval . On DATE and DATE ORG of PERSON consented in principle .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for the Environment and ORG decided to set in motion proceedings to designate the land in the LOC as an area of outstanding beauty and of public interest ; an area of QUANTITY was affected , most of it belonging to the applicant .", "The Prefect of PERSON informed the applicant of this in a letter of CARDINAL DATE ; pursuant to section CARDINAL of the LAW DATE on the conservation of natural monuments and places of interest ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which prohibits for a period of DATE any alteration of the state of a site that is in the process of being designated , he also refused the application for permission to undertake hydroelectric works .", "CARDINAL . Together with the CARDINAL other property owners affected , the applicant was invited to submit any comments he might have on the designation proposal ( section CARDINAL of the LAW DATE - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and he indicated his objections in a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the Prefect of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . A public inquiry was opened by a prefectoral decision of DATE , which was notified personally to the parties concerned ( LAW no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Mr de Geouffre de la Pradelle sent the ORG a statement of his objections in which he challenged the point of designating the land in the first place and suggested organising an inspection of the site by all the parties concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a favourable report by ORG , the Prime Minister , after consulting the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat , issued a decree ( section CARDINAL of the LAW DATE -see paragraph CARDINAL below ) designating the Montane valley . On DATE ORG ) published the following extract :", "\" By a decree dated DATE , the area formed by that part of the Montane valley situated within the administrative districts of GPE and PERSON is designated as CARDINAL of the areas of outstanding beauty in the d\u00e9partement of ORG . \"", "The present decree shall be notified to the ORG , Commissioner of GPE PERSON , and to the mayors of the districts concerned .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant , acting through his lawyer , applied to the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat for judicial review of the decree of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . As his main submission , the Minister for ORG argued that the application was \" apparently made out of time \" ; as the designation decree did not contain any \" special directions \" , the time within which any appeal had to be brought ran from its publication in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In his reply the applicant began by challenging the administrative authorities\u2019 interpr\u00e9tation of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the decree of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , according to which , in the absence of any special directions , the time within which any appeal had to be brought ran from the publication of the designation decision in ORG . He regarded the approach adopted by the administrative authorities as being a likely source of difficulties for members of the public . Could it reasonably be asked of people , he continued , to envisage exceptions being made to the normal rule , namely that the time allowed for appealing should begin to run from publication in the case of general regulatory decisions and from notification in the case of individual decisions ? Where appeals and the procedures for bringing them were concerned , things should be simple . And if , as in the instant case , there was no good reason for making an exception , it was only right to retain a practice consistent with ordinary law .", "He added that , at all events , if the authorities\u2019 interpr\u00c9tation were to prevail , Articles DATE and CARDINAL would have to be considered unlawful as being contrary to the principle of equality in that an owner of property covered by such a decision would be less favourably treated than other persons affected by individual measures .", "In the alternative , he complained of the incompleteness and irregularity of the publication of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which did not enable the persons concerned to acquaint themselves with the exact scope of the designation . In his submission , the time allowed for appealing had begun to run only when the full text of the decree was made available to the public at the NORP prefecture ; and the administrative authorities had not shown that the application registered on DATE had been registered DATE after the full text had been made available . Mr de Geouffre de la Pradelle alleged , lastly , that the impugned measure was a naked misuse of power designed to frustrate his modernisation scheme ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the exercise of the water rights associated with his status as a former producer of electricity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat , accepting the submissions of the Government Commissioner ( commissaire du gouvernement ) , declared the application inadmissible for the following reasons :", "\" ...", "By DATE the Ordinance of DATE , \u2018 unless otherwise provided by legislation , an application to the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat against a decision by an authority , court or tribunal within its jurisdiction shall be admissible only within DATE ; this period shall run from the date of publication of the disputed decision unless it has to be notified or served , in which case the period shall run from the date of notification or service\u2019 .", "By the provisions of LAW of CARDINAL DATE , decisions whereby a natural monument or a place of interest is designated are published in ORG . Although , LAW , these decisions are notified to the property owners concerned where they contain special directions designed to alter the state or change the use of the site , and although the time within which any appeal to the courts must be brought runs in that case only from the notification of the designation decree or order , this latter provision applies only where it is necessary to give notice to the property owner to alter the state or change the use of the site . In other cases , however , the time in which any appeal to the courts has to be brought runs from the publication of the designation decision in ORG , even if after that publication the decision was notified to the property owner .", "It appears from the evidence that the impugned decree designating the area formed by the Montane valley in the d\u00e9partement of ORG did not include any notice to the property owners to alter the state or change the use of the site . It follows that , in accordance with the provisions referred to above , the time within which any appeal to the courts against the said decree had to be brought ran from the date of its publication in ORG .", "An extract from the decree was published in ORG of DATE , together with the information that the full text could be consulted at the NORP prefecture . That being so , the applicant is not justified in contending that the publication was incomplete or irregular and consequently not such as to make time begin to run for the purposes of bringing an appeal . The application for review of the impugned decree was registered only on DATE , that is to say after the expiry of the time allowed for appealing under the provisions of the decree of CARDINAL DATE that have been examined above .", "In order to overcome the fact that his application was out of time , Mr de Geouffre de la Pradelle maintained that these provisions were unlawful because they gave rise to discrimination to the detriment of the property owners of designated places of interest , seeing that these property owners did not have the same time - limits for appealing against designation decisions as other recipients of individual decisions .", "But a decision to designate an area of outstanding beauty is not in the nature of an individual decision . Accordingly , the ground based on the argument that the impugned decree infringed the rules on the notification of individual acts and decisions fails .", "It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the application is out of time and therefore inadmissible .", "... \"", "CARDINAL .
