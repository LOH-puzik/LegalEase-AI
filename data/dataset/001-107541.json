De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an article , entitled \u201c CARDINAL \u201d , was published in a LOC DATE magazine , the NORP , in circulation at the time , which was opposed to the Government . The article , which appeared to have been written by a special correspondent from GPE , reported that many journalists from the former GPE were going to be tried for incitement to war before ORG for the former GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , including CARDINAL journalists from GPE . The article named the CARDINAL ORG officials who had allegedly prepared the file and then went on to list the names of the CARDINAL journalists in question . The applicant in the present case was the editor - in - chief of the NORP and its founder was a prominent opposition party at the time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the CARDINAL journalists whose name had appeared in the article ( \u201c the plaintiff \u201d ) , and who had himself been an editor of a major ORG - owned media outlet , filed a compensation claim against the applicant and the magazine \u2019s founder . The plaintiff claimed that the assertions contained in the article , which were later repeated through other media both within the country and abroad , were untrue and that they were harmful to his honour and reputation . He enclosed a copy of a NORP DATE newspaper , the ORG , published on DATE , in support of his claim that the assertions had been transmitted by other media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE that it had no information whatsoever concerning the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the civil proceedings , the applicant maintained that he had relied on the information provided by the magazine \u2019s special correspondent . Commenting on the ORG \u2019s statement , however , the applicant said :", "\u201c I \u2019m not interested in there being no proceedings against [ the plaintiff ] , the contents of the ORG ... letter , or whether [ the plaintiff ] is on that list . I have personally witnessed [ his ] work as the editor - in - chief of the [ media outlet in question ] during the reporting on the GPE operation .... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled partly in favour of the plaintiff , ordering the applicant and the magazine \u2019s founder , jointly , to pay him the sum of MONEY ( \u201c EUR \u201d ) for the non - pecuniary damage suffered . On the basis of the ORG \u2019s statement , the court found that the published assertions had not been true and , in particular , that the applicant had not been interested in their veracity . The court refused to hear the author of the article , considering it unnecessary in the light of the information provided by the ORG . It considered that the applicant \u2019s proposal that the author be heard was also aimed at delaying the proceedings as the applicant did not know his exact address . In any event , the author had not mentioned in his text the number of the case file , dates or any other data which would in a convincing manner support the veracity of the information . The court held that the applicant should not have allowed the publishing of untrue information , as it represented a misuse of freedom of expression , and that he should have attempted to check its accuracy first instead of trusting his correspondent unreservedly . The court further held that personal beliefs and convictions could not justify the publishing of such information and concluded that the assertions in question had harmed the honour and the reputation of the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . Both the plaintiff and the applicant appealed against the judgment . The plaintiff , in particular , complained that the compensation awarded was too low . The applicant , for his part , disputed that he , as the editor - in - chief , should be held responsible for the publishing of information of dubious veracity . He submitted that the information was of particular importance to the public and proposed additional evidence , namely that the court hear a colleague of his as an additional witness , as he was present when the fax with the impugned information was received and whom he consulted on whether to publish the information or not , as well as to see a documentary film broadcast in DATE by the same media outlet whose editor - in - chief in DATE had been the plaintiff himself , and which allegedly contained an unfavourable reference to the plaintiff and his work at the time . The applicant concluded that , in any event , the damages awarded were too high .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE increased the amount of damages to LAW and assessed the litigation costs at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . In so doing , it endorsed the reasoning of ORG , adding that the applicant should have focused on the accuracy of the information in question rather than having it published as soon as possible . The court took the view that the veracity of the assertions could not be established by the applicant consulting the article \u2019s author or another colleague but only by reliable evidence , which was lacking in this case . It further held that , according to the legislation in force at the time the article was published , the editor - in - chief , inter alia , could also be held responsible for publishing untrue information ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court made no reference to the documentary film referred to by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE amended ORG judgment , reducing the damages and costs awarded to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , respectively .", "CARDINAL .
