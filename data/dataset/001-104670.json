The applicant is a company with limited liability , with its registered office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company \u2019s predecessor sued a private limited company for a sum due for construction works carried out by the former .", "CARDINAL . Courts at CARDINAL levels granted the claim in part , but ORG , in proceedings on the defendant \u2019s appeal on points of law , quashed the lower courts\u2019 judgments on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In subsequent proceedings , in DATE , the plaintiff argued that the relevant part of the contract was void , as it had been signed by Mr PERSON , who did not have the authority to act on behalf of the defendant company , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the action . It established that the parties had concluded a contract for the reconstruction of a spa house on DATE . The contract included a provision under which the plaintiff was liable to pay a penalty in case of delay . That penalty amounted to PERCENT of the contractual price for DATE of delay , the maximum amount being PERCENT . The court established that the work under the contract had been completed on DATE instead of CARDINAL DATE as agreed in the contract . The defendant had therefore rightly deducted the sum in issue from the payment of the price .", "CARDINAL . As to the above argument concerning the validity of the relevant part of the contract , ORG held that PERSON had been elected to the company \u2019s board of directors at an extraordinary general meeting held on DATE . He had therefore been authorised to sign the contract on the defendant \u2019s behalf . The fact that he had been entered in that capacity in the ORG register on CARDINAL DATE could not affect the position , as such an entry was of a declaratory nature only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed . Its representative argued that the first - instance court had disregarded the relevant evidence when concluding that PERSON had been authorised to sign the contract for the defendant company . In particular , the applicant company relied on TIME of a meeting of that company \u2019s supervisory board held on DATE . Point CARDINAL on the agenda was entitled \u201c Election of the Board of Directors \u201d and the minutes indicate that \u201c the supervisory board approved PERSON as a new member of the company \u2019s board of directors \u201d . The applicant further argued that there was nothing to prove that PERSON had been effectively appointed to that post at the general meeting held on DATE , contrary to what was stated in ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment of DATE . As regards the standing of PERSON to sign the contract in particular , it held that ORG had correctly established that that person had been elected as a member of the company \u2019s board of directors at the general meeting held on DATE . He had therefore been entitled to sign the contract on DATE . According to CARDINAL of the documents from the court \u2019s file , on CARDINAL DATE the defendant company had requested that the responsible court register PERSON as a member of the company \u2019s board of directors with effect from DATE . The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed on points of law against the judgment of DATE . It maintained that the appeal court had not examined its arguments concerning the evidence in the case and the standing of PERSON to sign the contract in issue on the defendant company \u2019s behalf . The applicant company further complained that at the end of the hearing before the appeal court its representative had not been allowed to sum up the arguments or to submit final comments on the case . The applicant company had thus been prevented from acting before the court , which was a reason justifying the admissibility of an appeal on points of law within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a complaint under LAW . It argued that its right under LAW to a fair hearing had been breached by the conduct of ORG and its decision of DATE . In particular , ORG had disregarded the applicant company \u2019s arguments concerning the standing of PERSON to act on the defendant company \u2019s behalf .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court ( First Chamber ) dismissed that complaint on DATE . It held , with reference to LAW ) of LAW , that an appeal on points of law was available against the appeal court decision and that the applicant company was required to use that remedy first . The relevant part of its complaint was therefore premature .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( chamber dealing with appeals on points of law ) dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal on points of law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as inadmissible . According to the decision , \u201c the applicant company was aware of the fact that the admissibility criteria for an appeal on points of law under LAW and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure had not been met , as it alleged a breach of its right of access to court , which is a ground for an appeal on points of law listed in Article CARDINAL ) of LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG further held that the arguments concerning the assessment of evidence and determination of the point in issue did not permit the conclusion that the applicant company had been prevented from acting before the appeal court within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ) of LAW . Such arguments could be raised only in cases where an appeal on points of law was admissible on CARDINAL of the grounds enumerated in Articles CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure .", "CARDINAL . As to the other argument , that the representative of the applicant company had been prevented from making final submissions at the hearing before the appeal court , ORG held that the plaintiff had had ample opportunity to present its arguments in the course of the hearing . No new evidence requiring comments from the parties had been taken . The applicant company \u2019s procedural rights had therefore not been infringed in the proceedings leading to the appellate court \u2019s judgment of DATE .

In particular , it alleged that the courts at the first and second levels of jurisdiction had disregarded the position in the case and the plaintiff \u2019s arguments that the contract was void . The applicant further complained that its representative had been unable to make final submissions to the appeal court and that it had obtained no redress in that respect in the proceedings on the appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court ( Fourth Chamber ) rejected the complaint on DATE . It held that the complaint about ORG and ORG judgments of DATE and DATE had been lodged after the expiry of the statutory time - limit of DATE . It declared manifestly ill - founded the complaint about the ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . It held , in particular , that ORG had considered the applicant company \u2019s arguments appropriately and had given sufficient and relevant reasons for its decision on the applicant company \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL .
