SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , presently resides in GPE , GPE . In his application form , he states that he has NORP nationality .", "", "a.", "On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and requested asylum . He stated that he came from GPE and that he had fled the country to escape the ongoing war . He had not taken active part in the conflict . He had stayed with his sister in GPE , GPE since DATE . In GPE he had obtained a NORP passport . However , this was to be considered as a travel document only . If sent to GPE , he would not receive any help or protection from NORP authorities and he would risk to be sent back to GPE to serve in the NORP army .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG invandrarverk ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request and ordered his deportation to GPE . Finding that the applicant held both NORP and NORP citizenship , the ORG referred to a decision concerning asylum seekers with such double nationality taken by ORG on DATE . According to the decision , the prevailing situation in GPE rendered deportations to that country impossible . Consequently , in assessing applications from these asylum seekers , the crucial question was whether they could be afforded protection in GPE . ORG noted that , according to available information , persons in the applicant \u2019s situation did not risk to be sent from GPE to GPE against their will . There was no reason to assume that GPE would not afford the applicant protection . Moreover , no acts of warfare had taken place on NORP territory for some time and a cease - fire had been agreed upon by the contending parties . Thus , there was no apparent risk that NORP citizens in general would be forced to take part in armed conflict . Further , the applicant had failed to show that he personally faced such a risk .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) . On DATE ORG granted the applicant a temporary residence permit until DATE and quashed the deportation order . In so doing , the ORG referred to a Government decision of CARDINAL DATE according to which the worsened situation in GPE constituted an impediment to the deportation of asylum seekers to that country .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a new application for a residence permit . He referred to his previous statements . Further , in a statement of DATE he claimed that he should be granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds as , during his long stay in GPE , he had adjusted to NORP society .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s new application and ordered his deportation to GPE . ORG had regard to a guiding decision taken by ORG on DATE . In that decision the ORG stated , inter alia , the following :", "( Translation )", "\u201c Recently , the situation in GPE has improved . After the parties signed a general agreement on peace in GPE there is an ongoing peace process in the country . It has been strengthened by the establishment of Government institutions and the general elections held in DATE . There are still actual restrictions on the movement of people within the territory of the ORG . The possibility to return to the home district without risking harassment and outrage is , in the present circumstances , dependent on the prevailing ethnic composition of the population in the district . In the ORG \u2019s view , it is now possible to return to the home district where one \u2019s own ethnic group is in the majority . This view corresponds to the position taken by the ORG in regard to the return of people to GPE . The relative stability enjoyed by \u201c the majority population \u201d in the respective regions leads to the conclusion that asylum seekers from such places in GPE can no longer be considered as generally being in need of protection .", "\u2026", "As regards the situation in GPE and the region , the ongoing peace process , based on a general agreement on peace in GPE , has lead to stabilisation . The relations between GPE and GPE have improved . GPE has been admitted into ORG . Acts of warfare have not occurred on NORP territory since DATE . The risk of further conflicts appears unlikely . The general situation in GPE has improved in such a way since the Government \u2019s previous assessment in DATE that nowadays NORP citizens can generally be afforded protection in GPE . \u201d", "ORG noted that ORG view , that NORP citizens who are not or have not been residing permanently in GPE are given the same protection as other citizens of that country , had been confirmed by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) and ORG . As regards the applicant \u2019s situation , the ORG found that , being an ethnic NORP , he could not be sent back to his NORP - dominated home district in GPE . With respect to the possible deportation to GPE , the ORG noted that no new circumstances had been invoked by the applicant . Consequently , the ORG reiterated the conclusions drawn in its previous decision . Furthermore , the ORG found that there were no reasons of a humanitarian nature to grant the applicant a residence permit .", "Following the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG , on DATE , quashed ORG decision and referred the case back for re - examination . ORG found that no oral hearing had been held by ORG , as required by law .", "ORG held an oral hearing in the case on DATE during which the applicant stated that his brother , who had also applied for asylum in GPE , had returned to GPE voluntarily , as he could not stand having to wait for his application to be examined . After his return , the applicant had talked to him only once and did not know how he managed in GPE . The applicant claimed that he could not go to GPE , as he was a NORP citizen without connections to GPE . Further , he had lost contact with his parents who remained in GPE .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s new application on the same grounds as those expressed in the quashed decision .", "The applicant appealed and invoked a medical certificate issued on DATE by chief physician PERSON and therapist PERSON at the psychiatric clinic at the hospital in GPE . According to the certificate , the applicant \u2019s mental health was failing . He also invoked his family ties with his uncles and his sister who lived in GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It shared the conclusions drawn by ORG and added that the applicant \u2019s family ties were not sufficient to grant him a residence permit as he had not been living with his relatives .", "The applicant later submitted another application to ORG and requested that the enforcement of the deportation order be suspended . He invoked further medical certificates issued by PERSON and PERSON on DATE and DATE . According to the certificates , the applicant had had regular contact with the clinic since DATE due to a post - traumatic stress syndrome . He had been admitted to the clinic on DATE as his mental state had deteriorated , probably on account of his imminent deportation .", "On DATE ORG rejected the latest application .", "Relevant domestic law", "Under LAW of LAW ( Lagen om psykiatrisk tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd , DATE ) , such care shall be terminated at the request of the competent police authority whenever the person placed in care is ordered to be deported . This presupposes , however , that the chief physician finds that the alien \u2019s condition allows that the deportation takes place . According to LAW , no appeal lies against the chief physician \u2019s decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
