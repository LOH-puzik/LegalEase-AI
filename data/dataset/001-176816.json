The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a former prosecutor . For DATE , until DATE or DATE , he served as district prosecutor for GPE , heading what has been described as the largest prosecution office in GPE . While in that post , he got into a conflict with several of his subordinates , including GPE and PERSON", "CARDINAL . After the applicant left his post , a commission was appointed with the task of looking into the prosecution office \u2019s work under his management . GPE and PERSON were among the commission \u2019s members . The revision carried out by the commission led subsequently to the opening of criminal proceedings against the applicant , as it was alleged that he had exerted pressure on CARDINAL of his subordinates in relation to the outcome of a case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the national daily ORG published an interview with the applicant , where he stated :", "\u201c All my life I have fought against crime . What is more , I have tried to defeat the mafia present in the prosecution services . I admit that I have failed . And now I am bearing the consequences of that . The commission which carried out the inquiry [ at the district prosecutor \u2019s office ] includes exactly those prosecutors , [ GPE , PERSON and a third person ] , who staged a revolt at the time against the working methods I introduced . The aim of those methods was to eliminate any grounds for corrupt arrangements related to the cases . That did not suit those CARDINAL prosecutors and the notorious [ prosecutor PERSON ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Warned by the journalist interviewing him that his words were strong , the applicant nevertheless continued :", "\u201c I am saying things which will not surprise my colleagues . It is a public secret that CARDINAL of the prosecutors I mentioned is known among barristers and \u201c clients \u201d of the prosecution not so much with his own name , but with another one . \u201d", "The applicant then explained that the prosecutor at issue was known as \u201c Prosecutor PERSON ( \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430 PERSON ) , meaning someone who takes bribes , derived from the colloquial word for bribe , rushvet ( \u0440\u0443\u0448\u0432\u0435\u0442 ) .", "CARDINAL . Asked by the journalist whether ORG knew that , the applicant continued :", "\u201c If he does not know , he may ask me . I am knowledgeable about corruption patterns . And because I respect his efforts to defeat these patterns , I will give him a well - meant advice : he should check the properties owned by the people accusing me of having committed an offence while doing my work . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Questioned about a finding by the commission that a \u201c bad psychological atmosphere \u201d existed at the GPE district public prosecutor \u2019s office while it was headed by him , the applicant stated further :", "\u201c The inspection might be right , if by \u2018 bad psychological atmosphere\u2019 they mean my intolerance towards those prosecutors ... , who performed their duties in a sloppy manner , or attended meetings with the lawyers of criminals to decide on the outcome of cases . There were such prosecutors at the [ GPE district prosecutor \u2019s office ] . They became an organised group when the prosecutor [ ORG ] came to work with us . ... The animosity between me and [ ORG \u2019s ] circle , comprising the unhealthiest elements in the prosecution service , is well known . As are known from media publications [ ORG \u2019s ] palaces , the companies owned by his wife in association with criminals . ... It is ironic that exactly those prosecutors which we at the [ district prosecutor \u2019s office ] called \u201c [ ORG \u2019s ] guardsmen \u201d are in the group which is to check my work . Me being checked by Prosecutor PERSON ! Shame ! And have the case files of the checkers also been checked ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . Asked then about the working methods he had introduced , the applicant stated :", "\u201c Instead of commenting on whether the working methods introduced by me have been effective , I will give you simple statistics . I took over [ the district prosecutor \u2019s office ] in DATE . During DATE the prosecutors in it had drawn up CARDINAL acts of indictment . PERCENT of those were remitted by the courts , and the acquittals were PERCENT . This means that the failures were PERCENT . The persons convicted were CARDINAL .", "Now pay attention to the statistics for DATE , after I introduced my working methods . Acts of indictment drawn up : CARDINAL . PERCENT of the cases remitted by the courts . Acquittals : PERCENT . Persons convicted : CARDINAL . I am not being smug about the obvious progress of the prosecution . On the contrary , I thought we could have improved even further . ... \u201d", "Concerning the working methods at issue , the applicants said further :", "\u201c The aim was to make the police officer and the prosecutor work side by side , exactly as NORP experts are recommending . And to reduce the possibilities for corruption deals made in private ... But I do not want to talk any further . My frustration is enormous . You understand why . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a question by the journalist as to why he had not discussed the matter with ORG , the applicant said :", "\u201c I do n\u2019t know if there is any point . In fact , what [ he ] is doing now in [ his office ] is what I tried to do at the time at the [ GPE district prosecutor \u2019s office ] \u2013 to sweep all the trash out of the house . I managed , to a certain extent , but at DATE many pieces of trash came to the surface . They are crushing me now . I hope sincerely that the same fate will not befall [ the Chief Prosecutor ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE published GPE and PERSON \u2019s response to the applicant \u2019s allegations . That article has not been submitted by the parties .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , GPE and PERSON initiated a private prosecution of the applicant , alleging that he had insulted them and had committed the offence under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They found the following statements particularly offensive : \u201c I have tried to defeat the mafia present in the prosecution services \u201d ; \u201c the unhealthiest elements in the prosecution service \u201d ; \u201c many pieces of trash came to the surface ... crushing me now \u201d ; as well as his allegedly calling CARDINAL of them \u201c Prosecutor PERSON . They claimed that the offence was aggravated because the insult had been made through the media and concerned them in their capacity as \u201c public officials \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the criminal proceedings , GPE and PERSON also brought civil claims for damages against the applicant , each of them seeking MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court , ORG , heard a number of witnesses , who described the conflict between the applicant and GPE and PERSON It also heard the applicant , who stated that when making the above statements he had not referred to either of the CARDINAL complainants and pointed out that in the interview he had mentioned the names of CARDINAL other prosecutors , in particular ORG", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG acquitted the applicant and dismissed the civil claims against him . It considered that it had not been established that the expressions complained of had indeed referred to GPE and PERSON It found further that the complainants had seen the statements as being aimed at them , and had felt their reputation and dignity as being harmed , \u201c owing to their strained relations \u201d with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . GPE and PERSON lodged an appeal . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG reversed the lower court \u2019s ruling and convicted the applicant , finding that he was guilty of insult in an aggravated form . It set aside his criminal liability but imposed an administrative penalty on him \u2013 a fine of BGN MONEY ( the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) ) . Furthermore , it ordered him to pay each of the complainants ORG MONEY ( the equivalent of LAW ) in damages , plus interest , and ORG ( the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL ) for the costs and expenses incurred by the complainants .", "CARDINAL . ORG reasoned as follows :", "\u201c It is a fact that the accused uttered the expressions indicated in the private criminal prosecution \u2013 \u201c mafia in the prosecution services \u201d , \u201c PERSON , \u201c the unhealthiest elements in the prosecution service \u201d and \u201c many pieces of trash came to the surface ... crushing me now \u201d . It is also a fact that the expressions were uttered in an interview , which was published and disseminated through the mass media \u2013 the PERSON newspaper ... , in its issue of CARDINAL DATE . It is a fact that the complainants ... were named in their capacity as public officials DATE being prosecutors at the GPE district public prosecutor \u2019s office \u2013 and in relation to their official duties . \u201d ...", "\u201c It has been established that the complainants were aware of those statements , on the basis of the testimony [ of the witnesses ] , as well as on the basis of the article in ORG published on DATE , and presented in the case , which contained ... their response to the interview of CARDINAL DATE .... \u201d", "\u201c It can be seen from the testimony [ of the witnesses ] that after reading the interview given by the accused ... the complainants felt that their honour and dignity had been harmed , which caused a feeling of humiliation ... \u201d", "\u201c The accused \u2019s explanations show that he was aware that the incriminatory expressions were offensive and humiliating to those to whom they were addressed [ and ] the manner in which he disseminated them [ shows ] that he aimed to make them public and that they reach the complainants ... \u201d", "\u201c The accused \u2019s claim in his defence , endorsed by the district court , that the incriminatory expressions were not directed specifically at the complainants ... , can not be accepted by the appeal court .", "The fact that [ the statements ] may have been directed against CARDINAL other [ prosecutors whose names were mentioned in the interview ] , and that those people may have decided not to prosecute the accused for harming their honour and dignity , does not alter the fact that the accused \u2019s criminal liability in respect of the CARDINAL complainants must be engaged . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
