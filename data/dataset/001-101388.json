Since all analyses show a trend of generating loss , while , at the same time , some simulations of potential business activities show that it would be much better to run business in a different way , that is , with our own vehicle fleet , I tried to demonstrate this to the company 's management . Since those people did not show the slightest interest in what I was saying , and even started ignoring or marginalising me , I decided to make the only move possible which would ensure that what I was advocating would not remain at the bottom of someone 's drawer .", "The best option", "What was the exact reaction of your superiors when you tried to acquaint them with the results of your analyses and ideas ?", "I showed the first indicators to [ GPE ] , a member of the management board and Executive Director for ORG .

[ GPE ] then said that he would not allow another call for tenders for hiring external haulage contractors to be issued , but would rather advocate development of [ ORG 's ] own fleet . Everything I told him , I visually illustrated to him as well . That means I showed him how many road tankers ORG could buy for the sum paid DATE to haulage contractors . It was CARDINAL completely new road tankers , fitted out to the most stringent ecological standards . Unfortunately , all this remained at the verbal level , and the idea of purchasing our own fleet was not developed further . Instead of issuing a call for tenders for the purchase of road tankers , on DATE another call for tenders was published for hiring external haulage contractors for road haulage .", "What did you do when you saw that the call for tenders which [ GPE ] had said would not be published was in fact published ?", "I was amazed and surprised . I had at least expected that someone would invite me for a discussion , so that we could again examine together which option would be the best and the most economical for the company .", "Why did they change from being enthusiastic to ignoring you ?", "My proposals were obviously sound and indicated that normal costs had mostly been exceeded during the time of the former management . The problems began when I insisted that my ideas should also be implemented in the areas for which the present management bears the responsibility . I showed them clearly that we had practically commenced tilting at windmills , since in some sectors we were analysing excessive costs in the past , which were still being generated DATE to a greater extent .", "Purchase of road tankers", "Is it not unusual for an employee of ORG to submit a bid in response to a public call for tenders for hiring external haulage contractors , especially because you do not have the required road tankers available ?", "Of course I did not have that number of road tankers . I submitted the bid solely to demonstrate that ORG could itself acquire the required number of vehicles . The deadline for repayment of loans to business banks would not have been DATE . Since it was stated in the call for tenders that vehicles up to DATE were required , it was clear that in the subsequent DATE , after repayment of the loan , the road tankers would only earn money . We are talking about CARDINAL tankers . If you parked them one behind the other , the line would be QUANTITY long . I waited for TIME , until the call for tenders closed , and then , seeing that it was not going to be revoked , as I had asked the chairman of ORG 's management board [ ORG ] and the chairman of the supervisory board and the Deputy Prime Minister of GPE , ORG , to do , I decided to submit a bid which would indicate the detrimental effects of hiring external haulage contractors for road haulage .", "How did the Deputy Prime Minister of GPE , ORG , react when you showed him your analyses ?", "He said that it seemed that I had collected the data very meticulously and that they were frightening . Then I asked him what he intended to do about the public call for tenders , and he answered that it would have to go ahead . What he thought about the work I had done , the results of which I had shown him , is best illustrated by the fact that he drew my attention to a job advertisement which the ORG had published for , as was written there , ' educated , capable and ambitious people ' .
