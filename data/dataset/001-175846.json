The applicant was born in DATE . He is detained in the ORG social - protection institution ( \u201c the ORG EDS \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was convicted of theft and of sexual assault , by ORG and ORG respectively . The prison sentences were due to end on DATE .", "CARDINAL . While imprisoned , the applicant committed offences in respect of which fresh proceedings were brought .

On DATE ORG of ORG upheld that decision . The applicant did not appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , based among other elements on a psychiatric report by PERSON dated DATE , the Minister of ORG also decided that the applicant was to be detained in a psychiatric institution , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , as a continuation of the sentences imposed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant entered the Paifve EDS , located in the LANGUAGE - speaking region , further to a decision of QUANTITY DATE by ORG for the ORG psychiatric wing ( the \u201c CDS \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant made an initial application for release on a trial basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG postponed its examination of the request for release on a trial basis until DATE , and recommended finding an institution that could admit the applicant and provide him with therapy in NORP , the only language he could understand and speak .", "CARDINAL . The application was examined by the ORG on DATE . At the hearing , the head of ORG acknowledged that the institution was unable to provide the therapeutic care recommended by the experts who had already been consulted , given that no NORP - speaking doctor , therapist , psychologist , social worker or warden was employed in the institution .", "CARDINAL . In consequence , the ORG held :", "\u201c It is undisputed that the detainee speaks only NORP , and that the medical , welfare and prison staff in the institution in which he is detained are unable to provide him with any therapeutic or welfare assistance ; he has been abandoned to his fate without any treatment since his arrival in PERSON ( on DATE ) , even if some individuals have , on a voluntary basis , made considerable efforts to explain to him his situation , which he experiences as an injustice ;", "In the present case , the CARDINAL - fold legal aim of the preventive detention , namely protection of society and of the patient \u2019s health , can only be achieved if the deprivation of liberty is accompanied by the treatment necessitated by the detainee \u2019s mental health ; since this double condition is not fulfilled , [ Mr ] ORG \u2019s detention is unlawful ; ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG postponed its examination of the application for release on a trial basis until a hearing in DATE , pending the appointment of NORP - speaking employees to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with an order by the chairperson of the ORG of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was transferred to Verviers Prison so that its NORP - language psychosocial team could assess his mental health and ascertain whether he posed a danger to the public . On DATE the ORG confirmed this order and postponed the case to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the application for release on parole . It had been indicated in a report of DATE , drawn up by the LANGUAGE - language psychosocial team in Verviers Prison , that the applicant had a psychotic personality and paranoid character traits ( high self - opinion , feeling of omnipotence , lack of self - criticism and threatening remarks ) and that he was refusing any treatment . Furthermore , the ORG noted that there was no institution in GPE which could meet the security and language requirements in the applicant \u2019s specific case ; the only LANGUAGE - language hospital which could be considered was an open hospital , and it had thus to be ruled out in view of the applicant \u2019s mental health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for day release . On DATE the ORG noted that it had proved impossible to provide any treatment and that the search for a LANGUAGE - language institution had proved unsuccessful . Accordingly , it ordered the PERSON remand prison to prepare a plan for release on a trial basis , and ordered a new expert report in order to assess the level of danger posed by the applicant . It adjourned examination of the request sine die .", "CARDINAL . Having received a new application from the applicant for release on a trial basis , the ORG held , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE :", "\u201c There has been no progress in PERSON situation ; progress can not occur until he is in a setting where he can be understood in his own language , like any citizen of this country . A single member of the prison staff , a nurse [ ORG ] , is temporarily providing him with social contact , whereas a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist should be available to him .", "The prison authorities have not put forward any kind of solution to this problem , of which its various services are fully aware . Worse , as those authorities are unable to provide him with the necessary treatment , they seem to have resigned themselves to a role that extends no further than an unfair repressive detention .", "The medical reports and [ PERSON \u2019s ] expert report indicate that ORG , who continues to present a danger to society , can not be released without support and preparation in an institutional setting , something that can not currently be provided in GPE , but is available abroad . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In consequence , the ORG invited the PERSON remand prison to prepare , together with applicant , a plan for release on a trial basis , and encouraged the authorities to take , rapidly , the measures necessary to improve the applicant \u2019s situation . It adjourned the case to DATE . CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found :", "\u201c In DATE since this file was opened ( DATE ) , the persons involved in this case have been thwarted by the fact that the detainee speaks and understands only one language , and that the authorities have no LANGUAGE - speaking staff available for him , with the exception of CARDINAL nurse [ ORG ] ( who is apparently due to retire in the near future ) ;", "In DATE Doctor [ Ri . ] , expert , wrote that relaxation of the detainee \u2019s regime \u2018 is possible only in parallel with successful treatment , assessed by predefined steps . The treatment must begin in a secure establishment , then in a closed institution ... \u2019 Given that treatment in GPE is impossible , it was to begin in GPE with NORP - speaking psychiatrists and therapists ;", "Since that time the detainee \u2019s situation has not changed : he converses with and leaves the building only in the company of the sole NORP - speaking member of staff , and a treatment programme has not even been put in place . No satisfactory follow - up has been given to the requests by the [ ORG Board for an end to be put to this unlawful situation for PERSON , who is deprived of his freedom in order , on the one hand , to protect society from possible dangerous conduct by him , and on the other , to provide him with the treatment necessary for his reinsertion ; ...", "In the light of the authorities\u2019 failure , the question now before ORG is whether there exists , outside the social - protection facility , a unit or persons who could provide home - based therapy for PERSON ; ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On those grounds , and pointing out that NORP was one of the national languages and that the applicant was thus entitled to speak , be understood and receive treatment in that language , the ORG asked the PERSON remand prison to search in and around Verviers and PERSON for either a mental health unit , or a doctor or clinic , which could provide home - based therapy for the applicant in his mother tongue . It reserved its decision on the application for release on parole .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted pleadings in support of his application for release . He criticised the failure to provide him with therapeutic care and the effect on his health of any prospect of seeing his situation improve . As his main submission , he requested his immediate release on the grounds of the illegality of his detention . Alternatively , he asked that the ORG impose an obligation on the relevant authorities to take all necessary measures so that he would receive the treatment required by his mental - health condition in his mother tongue .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory decision of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s situation had not changed and that the reply from the PERSON judicial assistance unit left no hope of ensuring that the applicant would receive appropriate treatment , in a secure establishment or elsewhere . The ORG considered that it was necessary to attempt CARDINAL last plea to the Minister of ORG , whose intervention had previously led to some changes , even if they were insufficient to resolve the problem . The ORG accordingly ordered that an \u201c official denunciation \u201d of the applicant \u2019s situation be sent to the Minister of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG noted that the Minister of ORG had not replied to its submission and that the applicant \u2019s situation had worsened , in that he could no longer count on help from the NORP - speaking nurse PERSON , who had left the ORG . The ORG continued :", "\u201c It follows from the report [ from the psychosocial department ] of DATE that , except for occasional meetings with a social worker \u201c who speaks NORP \u201d , the detainee has no social contact in his language and that he has had no opportunity for DATE to converse and to gain a fresh perspective in the outside world ; the doctor and psychologist who signed this report do not seem particularly convinced by the completion of the \u2018 ongoing measures ( taken ) by the department to enable a NORP - language psychologist to intervene occasionally to provide care for the NORP - speaking patients in the EDS\u2019 ;", "PERSON situation is frozen : an ill individual , he is detained in a prison medical institution where no one is able to provide the treatment to which he is entitled ; the Minister and his departments are turning a deaf ear , with no concern for the despair to which this manifestly unjust attitude may give rise ;", "In spite of the unlawfulness of PERSON detention , his health condition means that release can not be envisaged unless it is accompanied by therapy and practical support ;", "The [ ORG has no powers , firstly , to restore the detainee \u2019s basic rights , namely , the rights to liberty , to health care and to respect for his humanity , and secondly , to compel the Minister to put an end to this situation , which his administration has been fully aware of for DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG decided , while \u201c remaining open to any proposals \u201d , to leave the applicant \u2019s situation unchanged ; in other words , it rejected his application for release .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision to ORG ( \u201c the CSDS \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In parallel , the applicant made an urgent application to the President of ORG , in order to have his detention declared unlawful and obtain his immediate release , or , alternatively , to obtain a decision ordering ORG to provide him with the medical care required by his situation .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE , the president of the court held that he did not have jurisdiction , on the grounds that the ORG was the lawful body with power to release the applicant or decide on his continued detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CSDS upheld the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE to maintain the applicant in detention . Unlike the ORG , the ORG held that the applicant \u2019s detention was perfectly legal , given that he had been lawfully detained and that he did not fulfil the conditions for definitive or conditional release . Under section CARDINAL of LAW , release could only be ordered if the detainee \u2019s mental condition had improved sufficiently and if the conditions for his social reinsertion had been satisfied . However , this was not the situation here . The CSDS also considered that the mere fact that the applicant spoke only NORP did not mean that the authorities had not taken all the necessary steps to provide him with the treatment required by his condition .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , alleging a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law . In response to the argument alleging a violation of LAW , it held that legal reasons had been given for the CSDS \u2019s decision and that it had been justified in law . It found :", "\u201c As preventive detention is primarily a security measure , the therapeutic action necessitated by such detention is not legally required in order for the detention to be lawful , even if its aim , secondary to that of protecting society , is to provide the detained person with the necessary treatment .", "The social protection boards derive from section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW the power , rather than the obligation , to order , in a decision giving specific reasons , placement in an institution that is appropriate in terms of the security measures and the treatment to be given . It follows that execution of the preventive detention measure does not become unlawful solely because it is implemented in one of the institutions created by the government for that purpose , rather than in another institution specifically designated for the possible treatment it might provide . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The argument alleging a violation of LAW was declared inadmissible , since its examination would require a factual verification of the conditions in which the preventive detention was being conducted and such an examination fell outside the scope of ORG jurisdiction . For the remainder , ORG considered that the CSDS had replied to the applicant \u2019s complaint in finding that the fact that he spoke only NORP did not mean that the relevant authorities had not taken all the necessary steps to provide him with the care he required .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again applied for release .", "CARDINAL . A report by the psychosocial department of ORG , dated CARDINAL DATE , reiterated that the applicant had a poor command of the NORP language , and spoke only a few words of LANGUAGE , which did not enable him to conduct a conversation ; in consequence , he had very little contact with the other patients and members of staff . The report also referred to a single meeting between the applicant and a LANGUAGE - speaking psychologist in DATE . The report noted an improvement in the applicant \u2019s behaviour ; he was apparently less aggressive and intolerant than before . Further , the applicant had never expressed a wish to meet members of the psychosocial team on a regular basis . The report concluded that he should remain in detention in PERSON , citing among other reasons his \u201c untreated mental health problems \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG noted , firstly , the content of the reports by Dr ORG . , of CARDINAL DATE , and PERSON . , of DATE , which stressed the need for psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment in a secure establishment , then in a closed institution , before an open facility could be envisaged . The ORG noted that , in the interim , the various attempts to find a solution to the language problem had not succeeded in bringing about a significant improvement in the applicant \u2019s health : the rare outings accompanied by a NORP - speaking member of the prison staff had been abandoned when this employee , who was not replaced , became unavailable ; attempts to find a NORP - language institution , doctor or therapist had met with failure ; no follow - up seemed to have been given to the announcement that a minimum number of NORP - speaking staff were to be recruited , and the applicant had , of his own accord , declined the assistance of the NORP - speaking social worker with whom he had occasionally met . The ORG rejected the application for release on parole , finding that the conditions for release ( an improvement in the applicant \u2019s mental state and guarantees for his social rehabilitation ) were not met . With regard to the alleged absence of treatment in NORP , the ORG specified :", "\u201c The detainee claims that he is not receiving the appropriate treatment for his mental health condition in NORP , his mother tongue , without however describing or even mentioning the treatment that he has allegedly been denied and that he would agree to accept or in which he would take part . The mere fact that he only speaks NORP does not mean that the ORG social - protection facility has not taken all the necessary steps to provide him with the care his condition requires .", "While , as the applicant points out in his submissions , it is for the relevant authorities to take all the necessary measures for his health , it is not , however , within the [ ORG powers to release a detainee who claims to be the victim of shortcomings on the part of the authorities ...", "Nor does ORG have jurisdiction to issue orders to the authorities or to third parties , [ or ] to penalise their actions or shortcomings ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the decision by the ORG , finding , among other points :", "\u201c Contrary to what he alleges in his pleadings , the detainee receives all the treatment required by his condition , from competent and qualified staff in ORG , and his specific medical needs are fully taken into account . In spite of the treatment given , the detainee \u2019s mental condition has not yet improved sufficiently , on account of his paranoid and psychopathic character traits , his lack of self - criticism and his constant demand . The detainee is thus clearly wrong in attributing the lack of improvement in his mental condition to the language issue alone .", "The continued preventive detention in a ORG that is adapted to his medical condition of an individual who would represent a danger to the public in the event of release , where his mental condition has not sufficiently improved and the conditions for his social rehabilitation are not met , is not unlawful and does not amount to a violation of the provisions of the [ Convention ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision by the CSDS on the grounds that it had not addressed the applicant \u2019s argument that he was not receiving care appropriate to his situation , in view of the fact that he spoke and understood only NORP and that no NORP - speaking staff members were available in the facility where he was being held . The case was sent back to the ORG with a differently constituted membership .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the ORG issued an interlocutory finding , requesting the ORG to appoint a group of NORP - speaking experts to update the psychiatric report of CARDINAL DATE . It instructed the head of ORG institution to take all the necessary measures to ensure that the requisite care was made available , by at least providing the services of a NORP - speaking psychiatrist and psychologist . It ordered that the case be reopened and scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has not been informed of the progress of those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant brought proceedings against ORG before the President of the LANGUAGE - language ORG of First Instance , as the judge responsible for hearing urgent applications in application of LAW . He asked for his release or , as a subsidiary measure , the imposition of the measures required by his state of health .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory order of DATE , the president of the court asked the head of the ORG and PERSON from the psychosocial unit in that ORG to submit statements concerning the treatment available in the ORG and the treatment that had in fact been provided to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Statements submitted by the head of ORG and by PERSON on DATE indicated that the applicant now had access to consultations with a LANGUAGE - speaking psychologist and that the authorities had made contact with a NORP - speaking psychiatrist who had agreed to meet the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE , the president of the court noted that , until DATE , the applicant had never had access to a psychiatrist who could communicate with him in NORP . He had had access to a NORP - speaking psychologist , outside the ORG , DATE . He noted that the consultations with the psychologist had come to an end not , as alleged by the ORG in its pleadings , because the applicant no longer wished to attend them , but because of late payment by ORG of the psychologist \u2019s fees and expenses . The consultations with the psychologist had , however , resumed in DATE . The president then noted that , until DATE , the applicant had benefitted from the presence of and care provided by a LANGUAGE - speaking nurse , that that nurse had in the meantime left the ORG , but that since DATE he had been authorised to accompany the applicant on outings . Lastly , the order noted that the applicant had had contacts with a LANGUAGE - speaking social worker , but that he had declined the latter \u2019s services in DATE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the main request , the president held that he did not have jurisdiction to order the applicant \u2019s release , as only the social protection bodies had power to do so . With regard to the subsidiary request , the president noted that the applicant had not had access to the mental health treatment required by his condition , and that there was prima facie a violation of his right of access to health care . His situation amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of LAW . In consequence , the president ordered ORG to appoint a NORP - speaking psychiatrist and medical auxiliary for the applicant , subject to a penalty in the event of non - compliance , and to put in place the care routinely provided to LANGUAGE - speaking detainees suffering from a mental illness similar to that of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the information produced , no appeal has been lodged against this order . According to the applicant \u2019s representative , ORG appointed a NORP - speaking psychiatrist and psychologist , who visited the applicant several times . However , these visits stopped at DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant had filed a negligence claim against ORG , on the basis of LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the LANGUAGE - language ORG held the fact of having failed to provide the applicant with psychological treatment in his mother tongue DATE to be negligent . It held , in particular :", "\u201c It is undeniable that the psychiatric and psychological treatment which [ the applicant ] must enjoy must be provided to him in NORP , the only language in which he is fluent and , moreover , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL national languages in GPE .", "However , DATE [ the applicant ] received no medico - psychiatric treatment in his own language .", "Whatever the quality \u2013 which is , indeed , undisputed \u2013 of the care provided to detainees in the ORG [ ORG ] , it is totally inappropriate for [ the applicant \u2019s ] mental - health condition merely on account of the fact that it is not available in NORP .", "In spite of the official and repeated denunciations of this situation by ORG to ORG since DATE , the latter has taken no steps to correct it . In addition , it has produced no evidence of the least action taken by it to that end .", "This failure to act amounts to negligence within the meaning of LAW .", "...", "Moreover , and as [ the applicant ] also submits , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL [ of the LAW ] require ORG to take the necessary measures to provide him with access to the basic care necessitated by his mental health .", "...", "In the present case , the applicant \u2019s vulnerability on account of the very nature of his psychological disorder and the absence of any genuine possibility of contact in his language have necessarily exacerbated his feelings of distress and anxiety .", "It is immaterial that , in any event , the [ applicant \u2019s ] state of mental health does not allow for his release . The mere fact of having been detained for an indefinite period without appropriate care amounts in the present case to a violation of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL [ of the Convention ] .", "Contrary to the submissions of ORG , the fact that [ the applicant ] is not always receptive to psychological , medical and social therapy does not allow for minimisation of ORG negligent attitude towards a person who suffers from a mental disorder , whose discernment is , by assumption , uncertain .", "By the same token , at the risk of setting aside the lived experience of the person suffering from a mental disorder , [ the applicant \u2019s ] stable conduct within the institution does not suffice to establish that he received appropriate care for his condition . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finding that this absence of treatment had caused mental suffering to the applicant , the court ordered the ORG to pay him MONEY ( \u201c EUR \u201d ) , an amount assessed ex aequo et bono , in compensation for the period for DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to information provided on DATE by his representative , the applicant was due to lodge an appeal against this judgment . He challenges the period accepted by the court and argues that the lack of treatment pre - dated DATE ; he also complains about a lack of treatment in DATE and the decision to award compensation ex aequo et bono rather than on a DATE basis ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-e"]}
