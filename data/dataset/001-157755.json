The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant started his compulsory military service in \u015e\u0131rnak . On DATE he contacted the infirmary of his regiment , complaining of severe pain in his left eye . According to the applicant , the military doctor was absent and he was given eye drops by a soldier who had no medical qualifications . According to the Government , the records of the infirmary ( which were not made available to ORG ) showed that the applicant had been examined by a military doctor and given eye drops by that doctor and not by a soldier .", "CARDINAL . The following day the pain became persistent , so the applicant contacted the infirmary once again . He was told that he should go to his dormitory and rest . According to the applicant , despite the pain he was in , he was not relieved of his sentry duties during that period . On DATE he was referred to ORG , where he was diagnosed with a corneal ulcer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to ORG , where his treatment started . However , he completely lost the sight in his left eye . According to the applicant , the doctors informed him that he had lost his eyesight because of the delay in starting the treatment , as in corneal ulcer cases it was essential to start treatment immediately .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to ORG for further treatment . He stayed there until DATE , during which time he underwent several operations . He returned to the hospital for a number of additional operations from DATE to DATE , DATE , DATE , and lastly , CARDINAL to DATE .", "CARDINAL . A medical report issued on DATE concluded that the applicant was no longer medically fit for military service and that he was eligible for an ocular prosthesis . On the basis of that report , the applicant was formally discharged from the army .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG , seeking compensation from ORG for the damage he had suffered to his eye during his compulsory military service as a result of the delay in his treatment . He claimed MONEY ( ORG ; MONEY ( ORG ) ) in respect of pecuniary damage and FAC in respect of non - pecuniary damage . He argued that for DATE after the start of his eye problem , he had been unable to see a doctor because there had been no doctor present at his regiment infirmary during that time . He gave the administrative court the names of a number of his fellow conscripts who had witnessed the fact that he had not been provided with medical treatment by a doctor in DATE but had instead been told to rest and use eye drops , and asked the court to question them .", "CARDINAL . In the written defence submissions that it sent to the administrative court , ORG argued that on CARDINAL and DATE the applicant had been examined at the infirmary of his regiment by military doctor \u0130.H.\u015e. , who had prescribed medication for him .", "CARDINAL . In his observations submitted to the administrative court on DATE in response to those of ORG , the applicant maintained his allegation that on his first visit to the infirmary he had been examined by a soldier because the military doctor , \u0130.H.\u015e. , had been temporarily dispatched to another regiment . He repeated his request that witnesses be summoned to testify before the administrative court and asked the administrative court also to summon and question Dr \u0130.H.\u015e.", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the administrative court appointed CARDINAL university professors from the ophthalmology department of ORG as experts with a view to clarifying whether there had been any medical malpractice in the applicant \u2019s case .

It is understood that , although the problem in the patient \u2019s eye is described in the medical reports as a \u2018 corneal ORG , the cause of the corneal ulcer ( Herpes virus ? Fungal infection ? Bacterial infection ? ) is not known . Furthermore , it is considered that it was not possible to establish with certainty the infection factor at the hospitals where the patient was observed and treated . For this reason , it is not possible to decide whether the eye problem was related to his military service or whether it was idiosyncratic .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , because the problem could not be fully diagnosed , it was not possible to determine the outcome [ of the applicant \u2019s symptoms ] within DATE .", "CARDINAL . [ We are of the opinion that ] there were no delays , shortcomings , mistakes or negligence in the steps taken in transferring the patient to the hospital , diagnosing the problem , treating the problem or treating the patient . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a written statement to the administrative court on DATE , arguing that the medical report contained contradictory conclusions . He pointed out that , although the experts had indicated in the report that the problem had not been fully diagnosed , they had then gone on to conclude that there had been no shortcomings in the diagnosis of the problem . He further argued that the conclusion reached by the experts , namely that \u201c because the problem could not be fully diagnosed , it was not possible to determine the outcome [ of the applicant \u2019s symptoms ] within DATE \u201d , fully supported his allegations . His contention was also that , precisely because the problem had not been diagnosed properly , the treatment had not started in a timely manner . The applicant asked the administrative court to take steps to eliminate the inconsistencies by requesting and obtaining additional reports from a different set of experts .", "CARDINAL . In his written opinion submitted to ORG , the public prosecutor stated that the applicant should be awarded compensation either for the authorities\u2019 negligence if such negligence was established , or on the basis of the no - fault strict liability of the military administration .", "CARDINAL .

Nor did the administrative court respond to the applicant \u2019s requests to have his witnesses heard .", "CARDINAL . A dissenting judge stated in his separate opinion that issues such as the cause of the problem , whether or not it had been as a result of the applicant \u2019s military activities , and what bearing the CARDINAL - to - DATE delay had had on the outcome had not been established in the expert report of DATE . The dissenting judge thus considered that the administrative court should not have decided the case without having obtained a new report and clarified those points .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested a rectification of the administrative court \u2019s decision . He claimed , in particular , that his arguments had not been examined adequately by the court and repeated his arguments regarding the contradictions in the expert report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s rectification request by a majority of CARDINAL to one .", "CARDINAL .
