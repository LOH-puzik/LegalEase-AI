In DATE the applicant and PERSON , his then wife , separated . Since then PERSON has been living with her mother , who was awarded custody of her . On DATE the applicant had his last contact with F.", "On DATE the Berlin Tempelhof - ORG suspended the applicant \u2019s access to F. This judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint lodged against the latter judgment .", "In his first application ( no .

On DATE , the ORG declared admissible these complaints .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged a motion under Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) to order PERSON to provide him with further information about their daughter PERSON , notably her current place of residence .", "On DATE ORG , sitting in guardianship matters , dismissed the applicant \u2019s motions . It rendered its decision following a hearing attended by PERSON and PERSON , then aged DATE . The applicant , who had been duly summoned , had not attended the hearing .", "In its reasoning , ORG referred to its final decision of DATE according to which the applicant was entitled to CARDINAL photograph of PERSON each year together with the final school report in DATE . Furthermore , PERSON had been ordered to supply the applicant with copies of the interim school report of DATE and of any further final school reports or reports on subsequent professional training , respectively .

It noted that the applicant did not have custody of F. and therefore had no power of co - determination in school matters . His right of access to F. had been suspended . In the court \u2019s view , the applicant claimed the information in question only in order to establish access to F. , which was contrary to her best interests . Moreover , PERSON feared reprisals .

It confirmed that the daughter \u2019s interest to avoid the risk of contacts with the applicant outweighed the latter \u2019s interest to be informed of her address pursuant to LAW of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) .", "In this connection , ORG noted that on DATE it had decided in a different set of proceedings instituted by the applicant that his access to F. remained suspended . It had found in that judgment that F. , then aged DATE , had expressly refused any contacts with her father and was crushed between her GPE conflicting interests . In the case before it , the ORG therefore had to avoid a deterioration of PERSON \u2019s tense mental state , which had not least been caused by never - ending court proceedings and examinations by psychological experts .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Referring to its hearing of the parties on DATE in the context of further proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s right of access , it observed that the relations between PERSON and the applicant remained strained . Therefore , the applicant was not entitled to information about his daughter \u2019s whereabouts .

In these circumstances , any risk that the applicant would go to the house where PERSON and PERSON were living had to be avoided .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , comprising CARDINAL pages .
