As the applicant had no valid authorisation to remain in the country he was provided with a transit visa valid from CARDINAL to DATE , to enable him to leave GPE . However , he did not leave the country , because , as he explained , his wife had recently given birth to their second child and he had to take care of their first child .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant stated that CARDINAL he could not make any arrangements to regularise his residence status due to the closure of public offices during the public holidays in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was subjected to an identity check by ORG officers . As he had no valid document , the officers arrested him and took him to the ORG LOC , where they drew up an administrative offence report concerning a violation of residence regulations for foreigners ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The report reads as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] was subjected to an identity check and could not provide evidence of his compliance with the requirement of temporary registration for a period longer than DATE of residence ...", "I have been informed of my procedural rights , including the right to have access to the record and other materials , the right to legal assistance ...

In the applicant \u2019s submission , his language skills were at the time limited : although he could speak and understand some NORP , he had no writing skills .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was taken to ORG . The court held a hearing , at which , however , no lawyer or interpreter was designated to assist the applicant .

The court also ordered the administrative removal of the applicant from GPE , and that he be detained until removal in a special detention facility situated in the village of LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a lawyer appealed on behalf of the applicant against the first - instance judgment , requesting that the administrative removal be annulled . He argued that the administrative offence report was unlawful , as the applicant had not been provided with an interpreter at the ORG . He also mentioned that the removal would affect his client \u2019s family life , arguing as follows :", "\u201c The court failed to examine the entirety of the relevant circumstances ... Since DATE [ the applicant ] has been living with a NORP national , A. , and has CARDINAL children , born in DATE and DATE ... These circumstances show that he has a family life ... The court did not provide reasons for applying a subsidiary penalty of administrative removal in respect of [ the applicant ] and did not take account of the matters relating to his family life in GPE . Nor did the court assess the fact that administrative removal would prevent [ the applicant ] for DATE from obtaining permission for temporary residence in GPE . The court should have provided reasons for considering that removal was the only way of striking a fair balance between the private and public interests at stake . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment . Apparently , no oral hearing had been held . The appeal court stated as follows :", "\u201c The argument relating to the existence of a relationship with A. can not be considered as a ground for residence in GPE without valid permission issued by the competent authority . In addition , [ the applicant ] had already been fined for a similar offence , whilst no administrative removal had been ordered . Taking account of all circumstances , including [ the applicant \u2019s ] personality and both mitigating and aggravating circumstances , it should be concluded that the first - instance court issued a lawful decision . \u201d", "The appeal court further stated that , according to the administrative report , the applicant had been informed of his rights but had not asked for an interpreter and had made a handwritten note in NORP on the report .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer continued to complain about the measure of administrative removal against his client . On DATE ORG informed the lawyer that the removal was lawful .

On DATE ORG informed the lawyer that his complaint had been examined by way of supervisory review and that no violations had been found .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant lodged an application for supervisory review before ORG of GPE . On DATE a judge of ORG rejected it . He stated that the absence of an interpreter could not serve as a reason for quashing the decision , that the applicant had not registered a marriage with PERSON and that the defence had not provided the district court or the supervisory - review court with evidence confirming that the applicant was the father of the QUANTITY children .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the ORG officers repeatedly told him that the ORG authorities had no funds to pay for his expulsion and told him to return to GPE at his own expense . According to the Government , since the applicant \u2019s national passport had expired on DATE it was necessary to make arrangements to renew it .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE ORG informed PERSON that the removal order could not be enforced because no funds had been allocated for this purpose in the federal budget and the applicant \u2019s passport had expired .

A deportation order is enforced by transferring the person concerned to the authorities of a foreign ORG or by the voluntary departure of this person under the supervision of the deporting authority ( LAW ) . A court is empowered to detain the person concerned until his actual deportation ( LAW ) . The detainee should be kept at the place assigned for this purpose or in specialised detention facilities , which should have appropriate sanitary conditions and prevent voluntary departure ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code ) . The detainee should be fed and given medical assistance in compliance with the rules adopted by the Government .", "CARDINAL . NORP In ruling no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ORG held , with reference to LAW , that detention of a person to be removed from GPE for TIME required a court decision , which should establish that detention is indispensable for enforcing the removal ; the court should assess the lawfulness and reasons for detention ; detention for an indefinite period of time would be unacceptable since it would be capable of amounting to a separate form of punishment , which is not prescribed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provided , at the time , that a decision imposing an administrative penalty could not be enforced after the expiry of a DATE period since the date on which this decision had become final .

Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that a temporary residence permit could not be issued to a foreigner who had been deported from GPE within DATE .", "CARDINAL . In decision no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , ORG of GPE considered that it was incumbent on a national court to examine whether enforcement of a deportation order was compatible with LAW . Given that section CARDINAL of LAW prevented a deportee from claiming a temporary residence permit for DATE , \u201c a serious issue [ could ] arise as to an interference with [ the ORG ] right for respect of their family life \u201d . In another decision , ORG varied its reasoning , stating that enforcement of a deportation order \u201c results in the violation of fundamental family ties and impedes the family \u2019s reunification \u201d ( decision no . DATE of DATE ) . ORG subsequently considered that a deportation order should be based on considerations which confirm the necessity of such a measure \u201c as the only possible way of ensuring a fair balance between public and private interests \u201d ( decision no .
