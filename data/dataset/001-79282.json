NORP Since DATE the applicant worked as a cleaner in a home for the care of mentally disabled persons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having sexually abused PERSON , a mentally disabled resident of the said home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant with having attempted to sexually abuse PERSON twice , once on an unspecified date at DATE or DATE ( first charge ) and a second time on DATE ( second charge ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Regional Court II convicted the applicant on CARDINAL charges of sexual abuse of a person unfit to defend herself and sentenced him to a cumulative sentence of DATE imprisonment ( DATE for the first charge and DATE and DATE for the second one ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the applicant 's appeal on points of law , ORG quashed ORG judgment and remitted the case to a different chamber of ORG . ORG found that ORG , in dismissing the defence 's motion to obtain another report of a psychiatric expert , had made a procedural mistake . In view of the fact that witness U. had abused alcohol and tablets at a period in time prior to the offences , it was necessary to have her examined by a medical expert in order to verify whether she suffered from a mental illness affecting her ability to give correct evidence ( PERSON ) . In these circumstances , it was not sufficient , as was done by ORG , to have the witness 's credibility examined by a psychological expert .", "CARDINAL . During an oral hearing on DATE , the sixth hearing in the case , the GPE Regional Court II heard further witnesses . It indicated to the parties that the offences in question could be qualified differently in law as ORG had not proved unable to defend herself . Following a short interruption of the hearing , ORG discontinued the proceedings concerning the first charge preliminarily according to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) upon a motion by ORG . TIME of the hearing do not contain any reasons given either by ORG or by ORG for proceeding in this manner . It had not been possible throughout the proceedings to establish the exact date on which the offence underlying the first charge had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG II convicted the applicant in respect of the remaining second charge of sexual abuse and of bodily injury and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment suspended on probation . ORG based its judgment mainly on the evidence given by PERSON , who was the only eye - witness to the alleged crime . Relying on reports given by both a psychological and a psychiatric expert , the court noted that due to her slight mental disability , Ms U. 's ability to give correct evidence was considerably restricted . Nevertheless , it was convinced that ORG statements were correct . She had not reported the offence on her own motion , but had confessed it to her partner on DATE when the latter had noticed that she felt depressed . Her partner had then convinced her DATE to inform the management of the home of the incident . Numerous other signs , such as the fact that U. had not tried unnecessarily to incriminate the applicant and had no other motives to accuse him demonstrated that the witness was credible . Moreover , CARDINAL further female witnesses had confirmed that the applicant had harassed them .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment , no reasons were given for discontinuing the proceedings in respect of the first charge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG , which he reasoned on DATE . He complained , inter alia , that there was a procedural error as no reasons for discontinuing the proceedings in respect of the first charge emerged either from ORG request to do so or from ORG decision to partly discontinue the proceedings or from its judgment . However , ORG had not found witness U. to be credible in this respect , which was documented by the fact that it had decided to discontinue the proceedings pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure . The reasons for discontinuing the proceedings could be essential for the evaluation of Ms U. 's credibility as both charges concerned similar offences and were primarily based on ORG assertions . If ORG did not follow PERSON testimony with respect to the first charge , it would have been necessary to explain why that court found the same witness 's testimony to be credible with respect to the second charge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the court to dismiss the applicant 's appeal on points of law as ill - founded . He argued in particular that no reasons had to be given for partly discontinuing the proceedings pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions in reply dated CARDINAL DATE , the applicant agreed that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure did not prescribe that reasons had to be given for the discontinuance of the proceedings . However , failure to do so nevertheless rendered the evaluation of evidence defective in the circumstances of the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal on points of law . In respect of the said procedural error complained of , it dismissed his appeal on points of law as inadmissible , finding that the applicant had not sufficiently set out the facts which were relevant for his complaint as required by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court agreed with the applicant 's submission that", "\u201c in cases in which the charges for CARDINAL offences were based on the statement of CARDINAL witness and the proceedings were discontinued pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of CARDINAL of these offences , the reasons to do so can have evidential value for the decisive question of the credibility of the sole witness for the prosecution ; if no grounds for discontinuing the proceedings are given , there is a lack of reasoning ( GPE ) ( see ORG , PERSON ( StV ) DATE , pp . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , what had been discussed in the hearing before ORG discontinued the proceedings pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure could not be known by having regard to the text of the judgment alone , as there was no duty to mention the discontinuance of the proceedings pursuant to that section or the reasons therefor in the judgment . It was true that there were judgments in which courts had set out in detail the reasons for partly discontinuing the proceedings and the influence of that decision on the evaluation of evidence , but this was only done if the court saw reasons to do so .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , ORG was unable to ascertain on the basis of the applicant 's reasoning in his appeal alone whether there had been a procedural error assuming that the facts submitted by him proved to be true ( the court referred to its previous decisions published in the ORG ( ORG ) DATE , p. DATE and StV DATE , p. CARDINAL in this respect ) .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG ,", "\u201c what is missing is a statement as to which reasons , if any , for discontinuing the proceedings were orally discussed during the court 's hearing , because the failure to give reasons for the discontinuance could only constitute a procedural error if these reasons could have had an influence on the outcome of the judgment , such as doubts about the credibility of the statements of the only prosecution witness . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that as a rule , proceedings were not discontinued pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure without any comments , despite the fact that there was no duty to record such statements in the minutes . If , in exceptional circumstances , no comments were made , the appellant was at least obliged expressly to state that the court had not given any other grounds , such as a limitation of the offences at issue in the proceedings for reasons of efficiency , which were irrelevant for the evaluation of evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He argued that his rights to be heard and to a fair trial were violated as in its decision ORG had applied new admissibility criteria which he could not have foreseen . According to the applicant , ORG , in its previous case - law , had demanded an account of the oral statements during the hearing only if the TIME disclosed that there had been such statements at all . Now on the contrary , that same court asked for an account of statements which ( might ) have been made in the course of the hearing and which were not included in the record .", "CARDINAL .

Pursuant to the well - established case - law of ORG , an appellant alleging a violation of a procedural rule must set out the facts which constitute the defect within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW in such a comprehensive and detailed manner that the appellate court is in a position to verify on the basis of the appellant 's reasoning alone whether there would be a procedural error if the alleged facts were proved . It is not only necessary for the appellant not to omit facts weighing against him , but also to submit facts militating in favour of exceptional circumstances which would render his complaint unfounded . Depending on the nature of the violation of the procedural rule , ORG developed special requirements in its case - law on how to reason an appeal on points of law ( see the decision of ORG of DATE , ORG .

ORG found that as a rule , these requirements did not violate the individuals ' right to effective legal protection and did not limit access to ORG in an arbitrary manner ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL of the decision ) .

It found that the appellant failed to set out all the facts which constituted the defect in such a comprehensive and detailed manner that the appellate court was in a position to verify on the basis of the appellant 's reasoning alone whether there would be a procedural error if the alleged facts were proved .

In so far as the appellant based his allegations on statements made by that expert during the hearing , the account given in the judgment of the discussion with the expert in the hearing proved that there was no lack of expertise on his part .

The defendant had been charged with CARDINAL counts of sexual abuse of children , which had all been based on the statements made by the only witness for the prosecution . He was acquitted as the witness had been proved to have invented the incident in respect of CARDINAL count and convicted in respect of CARDINAL other counts ; in respect of CARDINAL counts of sexual abuse the proceedings were discontinued pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure . According to ORG , the evaluation of evidence in ORG judgment was defective , inter alia , because that court had discontinued the proceedings in respect of CARDINAL counts of sexual abuse of children without giving reasons therefore .
