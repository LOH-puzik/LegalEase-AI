The [ applicant ] responded in a positive manner to the request , but said that they would have to ascertain conditions in [ the bay of ] PERSON before receiving Mr PERSON . The nurse and the Chief PERSON , PERSON , were willing to participate in the operation . Mr Svendsen went down to PERSON to check the conditions and reported back to [ the applicant ] that they were satisfactory . [ The applicant ] then contacted the PERSON and agreed that the patient should be brought by a launch close to the beach in PERSON and that a rubber dinghy ... would meet them there . It was further agreed that the transfer of the patient would take place TIME after the conversation between the PERSON and the FAC . They also agreed on a radio frequency on which the parties would communicate .", "...", "While driving to PERSON , the [ applicant ] discovered that he had forgotten his camera . He wondered whether he should return to pick it up , but the nurse insisted that they had no time to lose and that they should therefore drive on . She then offered to collect the camera later , but the [ applicant ] told her that she should not do so .", "On arriving at PERSON they found the [ rubber dinghy ] already there , the Maintenance Chief Officer having fetched it and driven it down to the beach . The Maintenance Chief Officer said that the dinghy ought to be pumped up . The Chief PERSON , however , thought that it was better to leave the dinghy as it was and so do nothing to it . The [ applicant ] and PERSON sat down in the dinghy after having put on survival suits . However , neither of them put on their hoods . They took no radio equipment with them in the dinghy , but PERSON had a radio for the purpose of communicating with the PERSON and its launch .", "As they left the beach , the Polarbas launch with the injured fisherman on board was far out in the approaches to PERSON . Some time after the dinghy had left , the nurse ... returned to the beach with the [ applicant 's ] camera which she had gone back to collect at the administration building ...", "Mr Svendsen rowed the dinghy out from the beach . After having rowed QUANTITY from the shore they waited a while , trying to get the launch to approach them . However , they did not obtain any response from the persons in the launch .", "[ Mr Svendsen ] was tired and he and [ the applicant ] changed places , the [ applicant ] taking over the rowing . They tried several times to contact the launch , but to no avail . They realised that something had gone wrong . They therefore rowed further towards the launch which was still lying far out in the approaches to PERSON . As they came up to the launch they were told that the engine had broken down and that a sea anchor had been deployed . The men in the launch were anxious since , despite the sea anchor , the launch was drifting towards the rocks . None of the persons in the launch were wearing life - jackets or survival suits . Nor was such equipment available in the launch .", "The injured fisherman ... was taken on board the [ rubber dinghy ] . The dinghy was then rowed away from the launch . A breaker capsized the dinghy and the CARDINAL people on board were thrown into the sea . They were not attached to the dinghy with lines nor did they have any lines with them . They did not have life - jackets .", "PERSON , who was standing on the beach , had a portable radio set , but did not have first - aid equipment , such as a stretcher , blankets or the like . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG acquitted the applicant . Its judgment includes the following observations . Although the applicant was in principle under no duty to receive the injured fisherman , such a duty arose from the fact that he agreed to do so . In determining whether the applicant had been guilty of neglect or carelessness in the landing operation or in its preparations , it had to be ascertained whether he had breached any applicable instructions . PERSON breaches or several recurring breaches of instructions could amount to neglect or carelessness within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW . The public prosecutor had argued that the applicant had acted in breach of his duties in CARDINAL instances , of which those indicated below were the subject of argument in the present case :", "\" CARDINAL . ORG It was the duty of the defendant to use the dory once he had decided to receive a patient .", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG It was his duty to ensure that the nurse brought along medical equipment and was present throughout the operation .", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG It was his duty , once he had chosen to use the rubber dinghy , to ensure that the chief engineer was attached to it by a line . Moreover he ought to have returned to the beach earlier , once he realised that the launch did not intend to approach them . \"", "ORG was of the view that the instructions imposing duties on military and civilian personnel on PERSON , in particular Instruction C CARDINAL containing ORG on and around PERSON , were for various reasons unclear . Moreover , many of the provisions in question were designed for the loading and discharging of supply vessels . The relevant instructions could therefore apply to rescue operations only in so far as was appropriate .", "As to the above - mentioned item CARDINAL of the prosecutor 's allegations , ORG held :", "\" ... the [ applicant ] can not be blamed for the fact that the nurse did not remain on the shore throughout the operation . The ORG is satisfied that Botten did not know that she had returned to the Station to fetch his camera . Moreover , the ORG is satisfied that he did not order her to fetch the camera . Anyway , her absence was quite short , lasting TIME . The [ applicant ] knew , however , that [ the ] nurse ... did not bring along first - aid equipment to the shore . In that respect therefore , there is a breach of Instruction B CARDINAL , section CARDINAL . The ORG points out , however , that there are no serious violations of the instructions . The object of the operation was merely to fetch a fisherman who was only suffering from a wrist injury and it would moreover take only a short time to go up to the Station buildings to collect the necessary equipment . \"", "With regard to item DATE , ORG made , inter alia , the following observations :", "\" ... ORG agrees in principle with the prosecutor that it was unsafe to row the rubber dinghy right out to the launch . However , the [ ORG takes into account the fact that the [ applicant ] and [ Mr Svendsen ] , while on their way , admittedly after they had passed the point where they had intended to meet the launch , but while they were still in fairly calm waters , discovered that there were problems on board the launch . Accordingly , the [ ORG can not see here either that the [ applicant ] committed any breach of the instructions since it was highly probable , and gradually became quite obvious , that the launch was in a critical situation . \"", "Finally , with regard to item CARDINAL , the members of ORG were divided :", "\" Assessor PERSON considers that section CARDINAL of Instruction C CARDINAL lays down an obligation for the defendant to use the dory , since the penultimate paragraph of section CARDINAL ... provides that this rule applies to all personnel on GPE . The President of the ORG considers that ... section CARDINAL , which applies to sea traffic , must be applied wherever appropriate . Regarding this special case , where the [ applicant ] was to take ashore a fisherman with an injured wrist , the President can not find any circumstances which could justify setting aside the general obligation to use the dory . The operation was not conducted under such heavy pressure that this provision could be disregarded . PERSON is of the opinion that the provision does not apply in a rescue operation of the kind in issue and that the matter must therefore be assessed in terms of general requirements of care .", "Assessor PERSON considers that the breach of this provision under the very special weather conditions which exist in the ocean area off Jan Mayen is so serious that it qualifies as ` neglect or carelessness ' within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW . He has therefore arrived at the conclusion that the defendant should be convicted for violation of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ...", "The President ... is of the opinion that even if this instruction has been disregarded , it must nevertheless be considered in applying Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ... whether the choice made by [ the applicant ] made the situation worse than would have been the case had he chosen the dory . If it did not , a violation of this instruction can not be described as neglect or carelessness . The majority of ORG and the President ) have found that the use of the dinghy instead of the dory did not lead to reduced safety , having regard to the purpose which the boat was originally supposed to serve . Particular weight is attached to the fact that the parties had agreed to meet close to the beach . Although the precise meeting point had not been agreed , it must at least be accepted that they did not intend to go much further out than QUANTITY from the beach . In this area the waters are calm . Moreover , reference is made to the testimony of the prosecution expert witness , Mr Alv H\u00e5kon Klepsvik , Commander . He testified in court that he saw no safety problems in using the rubber dinghy in , or just outside , PERSON provided it was kept away from breakers or wave peaks . He considered that , if one stayed in the middle of PERSON or on the PERSON side , using the dinghy did not give rise to any problems . Nor would he have had any hesitation in using the dinghy to receive a person from another boat . He further testified that there was less risk of injury in transferring a person from a boat to another when the second was a rubber dinghy , and he thought that it would be preferable to use a rubber dinghy rather than a dory for that purpose . As regards the fact that the dinghy was not fully pumped up , he stated that it was better to use a dinghy that was not fully inflated . Nor did this reduce the dinghy 's seaworthiness .", "The majority of the ORG agrees with the minority that the essential point in this case is whether there was a duty to use the dory and whether any breach of this duty led to reduced safety . The ... majority has accordingly come to the conclusion that such is not the case and that the defendant should therefore be acquitted , ... finding him not guilty of neglect or carelessness as described in the charge . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the public prosecutor appealed from the judgment of ORG to ORG ( PERSON ) . In the first place he maintained that ORG decision was flawed in that it had applied too narrow an interpretation of the statutory offence of neglect in the performance of official duties . In the view of the prosecution , the breach of the duty to use a dory was so serious that it amounted to neglect . ORG view that using a rubber dinghy instead of a dory did not lead to reduced safety was not a sufficient reason for holding otherwise . The instructions had been laid down on the basis of DATE experience and with a view to the particular conditions at PERSON and the fact that the Station officers are not necessarily accustomed to the sea and are only stationed there for a limited period . These considerations suggested that , save in exceptional circumstances , the FAC officer was strictly required to exercise care and to follow the instructions . In the prosecution 's opinion , the instruction could be departed from only if there was an emergency or if the service might thereby be carried out in a better or safer manner ; that , however , was not the situation in the applicant 's case .", "The prosecutor further submitted that the facts as established by ORG were sufficiently clear to allow ORG to give a new judgment under LAW para . CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) convicting and sentencing the applicant , as opposed to quashing ORG judgment and referring the case back for fresh examination .", "In his alternative submission , he argued that ORG judgment should be quashed on the ground of a procedural defect , its reasoning being incomplete . The judgment failed to describe the sea conditions prevailing at the time when the applicant set out in the dinghy and also when he realised that the lifeboat would not arrive at the agreed meeting point , and the distance between the lifeboat and the shore at those times . Nor did the judgment mention what the applicant thought had gone wrong with the lifeboat , which alternatives he had to taking the dinghy further out or how much time it would have taken to prepare the dory for the operation .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts Kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) granted leave to appeal . By letter of DATE ORG informed the applicant of its decision and that it had appointed as his counsel the lawyer who had represented him in ORG . Moreover , ORG invited the applicant to contact his counsel as soon as possible if he possessed any information of relevance to the case which was not apparent from the case file . In addition , ORG stated that it intended to deal with his case in the near future without giving him further notice ( LAW as applicable at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG After the prosecutor and counsel for the applicant had been consulted , ORG , by letter of CARDINAL DATE , advised counsel that it had set the oral hearing for DATE , at TIME", "Subsequently , counsel informed the applicant of the date of the hearing and told him that , if he wished , he could ask ORG for leave to make an oral statement at the hearing but that he would not be heard either as a party or as a witness . Moreover , counsel advised the applicant that it was unusual for a defendant in an appeal personally to address ORG . Accordingly , the applicant did not ask for such leave .", "CARDINAL . ORG An extract of the proceedings in ORG , prepared by the prosecutor ( for further details , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was sent to counsel well in advance of the hearing in ORG . Counsel made no objections to the extract , nor did he make any further submissions to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG At the hearing on DATE the applicant 's counsel was present , but he himself was not . As he was entitled to do , counsel addressed ORG and replied to the prosecutor 's oral submissions in so far as they concerned the latter 's appeal on points of law and procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , in determining liability , ORG was bound by the establishment of the facts concerning the question of guilt in ORG judgment ( LAW as applicable at the relevant time ) .", "After the main pleadings , the prosecution requested ORG to convict the applicant of an offence under Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW and to sentence him to a suspended term of DATE military custody and to a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , failing payment of which he should be imprisoned for DATE . In the alternative , the prosecutor asked ORG to quash ORG judgment .", "Counsel for the applicant requested ORG to dismiss the appeal .", "ORG case file included a CARDINAL-page extract from the proceedings in ORG , containing ORG judgment of DATE , the written evidence used by it , including details of the applicant 's professional and private status and income , his military service card , a statement to the effect that he had no criminal record , the military inquiry report and certain court transcripts . However , it did not include any records of the hearings in ORG , such records not being available . ORG heard no witnesses or experts .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment of DATE , which was final , ORG upheld the prosecution appeal . Mr Justice PERSON , on behalf of a unanimous court , gave the following reasons :", "\" I find that the appeal on the application of the law must be upheld and that the conditions for pronouncing a new judgment convicting the accused pursuant to LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW have been fulfilled .", "...", "The decisive issue in the case is ... whether the applicant 's conduct in connection with the landing operation and the preparations for it constitutes neglect or carelessness under LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW . The grounds cited for this are that he disregarded applicable instructions on several points as specified in the indictment . ORG judgment lists CARDINAL matters which , taken together , are claimed to constitute neglect . Several of these points have not been pursued before ORG .", "The instructions applying to PERSON are comprehensive . This must be viewed in the light of the demanding conditions for those serving there . I would note that the preamble to the instructions for PERSON , which were issued in DATE by ORG and ORG and which are relevant to the present case , states : ' Written instructions are more necessary on GPE , where there is a constant turnover of personnel , than elsewhere . '", "The ' General Provisions concerning Traffic on and around PERSON , which form part of the said instructions , figure centrally in the case . LAW ... , entitled ' Purpose ' , reads : ' These are general provisions which are intended as guidelines for both official and leisure traffic on and around PERSON . ' Even though the provisions initially give the impression of setting out ' guidelines ' , it is clear that they include binding rules , as shown by LAW paragraph of which reads : ' Excursions by boat in the sea around PERSON without seagoing support vessel are generally prohibited . ' However , the rule goes on to list various exceptions . I would point out that the provisions on sea traffic clearly must cover the operation launched to receive the injured fisherman on that occasion , even though it was presumed that the transfer would be conducted relatively close to the shore . I also find it clear that the provisions must apply to the landing operation , even though there is no mention of assistance to the fishing fleet here or elsewhere in the instructions for QUANTITY .", "Section CARDINAL ... includes , inter alia , the following CARDINAL clauses : `", "- Ensure that both dories are used on trips if no other boat is close to the island , or no other boat has been made ready to assist if necessary . ORG", "- When the weather conditions are deemed to be satisfactory , the other dory may be replaced by the dinghy , which may be taken aboard the dory or drawn behind it . '", "In my view , it follows from the rules that there is a requirement to use a dory on occasions such as the one in question here , and that a dinghy could not replace a dory in this situation . It is true that a dinghy could be used in certain circumstances , but only as a backup . I therefore agree with the President of ORG and the one lay judge who , admittedly on somewhat different grounds , found that the provisions imposed an official duty on the [ applicant ] to use a dory instead of a dinghy .", "The President of the [ City ] Court was however of ' ... the opinion that even if this instruction has been disregarded , it must nevertheless be considered in applying Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ... whether the choice made by the [ applicant ] made the situation worse than would have been the case had he used a dory . If it did not , a violation of this instruction can not be described as neglect or carelessness ' .", "I do not agree with this interpretation of the law .", "In my opinion , the duty to use a dory is of such key significance in the provisions relating to traffic that an assessment such as that mentioned by the President is insufficient . I refer to the fact that the duty was imposed in the light of experience and is intended to protect life and health in an area characterised by quite extraordinary weather conditions and in difficult waters , and that it is thus particularly important that the instruction is complied with on this point . The assessment referred to by the President of ORG can not therefore be decisive for whether there was neglect .", "The second lay judge , who together with the President of ORG constituted the majority voting in favour of acquittal , likewise based her decision on an erroneous application of the law . In her opinion , the duty to use a dory did not apply ' to a rescue operation of this kind , and the matter must therefore be considered on the basis of a general assessment of the duty of care ' . I find that she was of the opinion that there was no duty to use a dory , and therefore no neglect within the meaning of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL .", "The majority of ORG ... found that using a rubber dinghy instead of a dory on the occasion did not have the effect of reducing safety given the use for which the dinghy was initially intended , namely reception of the injured fisherman from the shrimp trawler 's lifeboat not ' much QUANTITY from shore ' . However , according to the regulations , this is not decisive .", "Thus the [ applicant 's ] acquittal is based on an erroneous application of the law . In the present case , however , this does not warrant quashing ORG judgment , since I agree with the prosecution 's submission in the notice of appeal that the conditions are satisfied for pronouncing a new judgment convicting [ the applicant ] pursuant to LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW . In this connection , I refer to ORG account of the facts .", "I also refer to what I previously said about the background to and the specific contents of the provisions concerning traffic on and around PERSON , in particular the duty to use a dory . Given the difficult conditions on the island , it is particularly important that rules of this kind are complied with . The [ applicant ] is at fault for having decided , despite the requirement set out in the instruction , to use the rubber dinghy on that occasion and for having done so . I would point out , however , that the situation had changed at the subsequent stages of the operation , when it was clear that the persons in the approaching lifeboat were in danger . In my opinion , however , what had already happened in the earlier stages constitutes such a serious matter that it must be deemed to constitute neglect under LAW para . CARDINAL . I would note that counsel for the defence has contended before ORG that the duty to use a dory could not apply when a lifeboat was launched from the shrimp trawler . I do not find that this [ argument ] can be accorded decisive weight in the present case , as it is clear from ORG judgment that the dinghy was not simply used as a backup on this occasion . Nor could the defendant know whether or not the lifeboat was properly equipped , as subsequently turned out not to be the case .", "As previously indicated , the prosecution has also brought up other matters which , in its opinion , constitute breaches of the applicable instructions . Some of these matters which were submitted to ORG have not been pursued before ORG .", "...", "ORG unanimously concluded that there was a breach of the instruction on account of the fact that the nurse had not brought first - aid equipment down to the shore and that the [ applicant ] was aware of this fact . I find this to be the case . However , the failure to use a dory in the landing operation is the predominant factor in relation to Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL .", "As regards sentencing , I find it appropriate to sentence [ the applicant ] to DATE military custody suspended for a probation period of DATE , in addition to an unconditional fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL or , in default of payment , military custody for DATE .
