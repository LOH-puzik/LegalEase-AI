The proceedings described below have already been examined by ORG from the point of view of the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement .

On DATE the applicant , who was at that time the owner and the president of the management board of the company \u201c Polpure \u201d sued LOC ( PERSON ) in ORG ( PERSON ) , seeking payment for construction works which it had carried out for the defendant .

It declared certain clauses of the contract null and void , as being in breach of a number of substantive civil law provisions .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s appeal , the judgment was later quashed and the case remitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim for payment but declared null and void a clause of the contract that imposed penalties for the breach of contract . The parties\u2019 further appeals were dismissed by ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG filed with ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) an extraordinary appeal on behalf of the company , submitting that ORG judgment had been in flagrant violation of substantive civil law and had unduly restricted the parties\u2019 freedom of contract .

On DATE the court partly granted the application and exempted the company only from a court fee due for lodging the modified claim ( which would normally have amounted to PLZ CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , except for the first PLZ CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that while it was true that the applicant \u2019s company had encountered significant difficulties in recovering payments from third parties , had lost its credit solvency and was charged with debts , it had not yet been declared insolvent and was , accordingly , able to continue its commercial activity . In view of that , the court considered that exempting it from all future court fees would not be justified .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant filed , through ORG , an appeal to ORG . He submitted , among other things , that ORG had for the second time failed to comply with the guidelines given by ORG and ORG in respect of the claim for damages for the defendant municipality \u2019s delay in payment and that it had disregarded the instructions given by ORG in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The value of the claim asserted in the appeal proceedings was ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The applicant asked for an exemption from court fees due for lodging an appeal . The relevant part of his application read :", "\u201c The plaintiff \u2019s application for an exemption from court fees is based on the fact DATE a fact already ascertained by the court \u2013 that its financial situation has not improved but has become more difficult . The entire sum awarded by the previous judgment was , without any basis whatsoever , attached by ORG . The defendant municipality , for its part , unjustifiably deducted its debts ... from the sums awarded . The adjudicated claim was not therefore satisfied and the Bailiff in addition deducted from that sum ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL by way of [ costs of enforcement proceedings ] . In consequence , the plaintiff sustained further loss . Moreover , the plaintiff \u2019s debts have been climbing rapidly due to interest on arrears . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG exempted the applicant \u2019s company from all court fees save for the first ORG CARDINAL and dismissed the remainder of the application . The relevant part of that decision read :", "\u201c ... the applicant has declared that it is still conducting its business activity , although it has limited it considerably . It emerges from entries made in the company \u2019s cash book from DATE that since DATE cash holdings and disbursements exceeded ORG and , in DATE , they reached PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "In the circumstances , exempting the applicant from the entire fee would be unjustified and that court exempts it only from fees exceeding PLN CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision on DATE . The appeal read , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c ... ORG made erroneous findings in respect of the plaintiff \u2019s financial situation :", "CARDINAL . As the plaintiff already stated , its situation , [ assessed as bad by ORG already on DATE ] had not improved but had become worse . [ the applicant further repeated the arguments adduced in the above - cited application ] ;", "CARDINAL . NORP The plaintiff has already produced abundant documentary evidence [ including the DATE balance sheet , cash books , the relevant bank report and documents setting out financial analyses of the company \u2019s standing ] confirming the previously - described financial situation , a situation with which ORG has become well acquainted throughout that lengthy trial . That situation is as follows : in DATE the company sustained losses ; in DATE it sustained losses in DATE ; the income did not cover debts ( the outstanding debt is PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) ; all assets were attached ( see the enclosed list of court files ) ; the bank account is practically empty ( see the bank \u2019s report ) ; ... the outstanding debt of ORG was eventually covered by the partner in order to avoid the institution of winding - up proceedings . ... ;", "CARDINAL . There is no dispute that the defendant ruined the plaintiff company ... which now is able to carry out only casual construction works ;", "CARDINAL . NORP The opinion of ORG expressed in its decision of CARDINAL DATE [ as to the bad financial situation of the applicant \u2019s company ] is therefore still valid", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , considering that the applicant \u2019s company had sufficient means to pay the court fees . The court stressed that , pursuant to LAW , grounds for exempting a legal person from court fees were stricter ; the court \u201c could \u201d but did not \u201c have to \u201d exempt it from such fees even if it proved that it did not have means to pay them . Furthermore , ORG observed that since the applicant \u2019s company still continued its business activity and derived a systematic income from it ( which , recently , had been in excess of the ORG CARDINAL needed for the required court fees ) , ORG had correctly concluded that the applicant could pay that sum . A prospective litigant , the court added , should take into account the need to secure the court fees for the litigation and put aside part of his or its income for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made another application for an exemption from court fees , arguing that in the course of the prolonged litigation his company \u2019s financial situation had deteriorated very significantly . He stressed that DATE the Bailiff had frozen the last CARDINAL of the company \u2019s bank accounts and attached ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL respectively ( those sums had been the applicant \u2019s salaries ) . Furthermore , ORG ( ORG ) had ordered the company to pay immediately ORG in tax arrears , together with default interest . In the circumstances , the company did not have any means whatsoever to pay the court fees . The applicant produced the relevant documentary evidence in support of his application . Those documents showed that the company had incurred a loss of ORG in DATE , a loss of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE and a loss of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed a pleading with ORG and asked it to hear evidence from the applicant in order to establish the current financial standing of the company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court exempted the company from court fees exceeding ORG CARDINAL . It observed that in DATE the applicant \u2019s company had an income of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and that it could therefore pay the court fees previously imposed on it . In the court \u2019s opinion , the documents produced by the applicant showed that since DATE the company \u2019s management could have put aside money for securing court fees . However , having regard to the new facts supplied by the applicant on DATE , the court considered that the original fee should be reduced .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on DATE . He stated , among other things , that he had been a \u201c well - known bankrupt \u201d and that he had no means whatsoever to pay court fees and , by reason of the fact that the company had lost its credit solvency , he could not even obtain a loan for the purpose of securing court fees . Yet as he had obtained a modest financial support , i.e. ORG CARDINAL from a third person , he was prepared to pay that sum to the court . He further criticised the court for having considered only cash reports , which had not reflected the real state of the company \u2019s business , and for having ignored the fact that under the applicable laws his company had a legal duty to disburse all cash in hand for tax arrears . He also stressed that the court had completely overlooked the losses the company had incurred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It considered that despite the losses sustained , the company could have put aside money for the court fees in question . In the court \u2019s view , the company \u2019s cash holdings should , in the first place , have been used for the court fees . The court also observed that the company should have regarded payment of those fees as its priority . Lastly , the court noted that the proceedings relating to the exemption from court fees had lasted for such a long time that the plaintiff could have secured money for the fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made yet another application for an exemption from the court fees for lodging the appeal , save for the first ORG CARDINAL . He asked ORG to obtain expert evidence and to hear evidence from himself as the president of the management board in order to establish the financial standing of his company . He submitted documents showing that he had in the meantime applied to CARDINAL banks for loans to secure the court fees but that his applications had been rejected because of the very bad financial situation of the company . On DATE the applicant filed a pleading and produced further documentary evidence . It emerged from the relevant documents that from CARDINAL January to DATE the applicant \u2019s company had incurred a loss of ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant paid ORG CARDINAL to the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the plaintiff any further exemption from court fees . The court reiterated the grounds already cited in its previous decisions . It rejected the application for evidence to be obtained from the applicant and the expert proposed by him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision , but on DATE ORG rejected his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to allow him to pay the fee in instalments but his application was refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused to proceed with the appeal against the judgment of DATE and rejected it for non - compliance with the court \u2019s decision ordering the company to pay the court fees for lodging the appeal .", "CARDINAL . From DATE both ORG and ORG considered the applicant \u2019s subsequent , repeated and eventually unsuccessful applications for an exemption from court fees .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision rejecting his appeal of CARDINAL DATE on formal grounds .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged with ORG a cassation appeal against that decision on DATE . The company was ordered to pay a court fee of ORG CARDINAL for proceeding with the cassation appeal . That sum was paid on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant first submitted that the company had never paid a court fee to proceed with the cassation appeal since it could not afford it . Subsequently , he stated that that amount was paid by his friends on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . The cassation appeal was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
