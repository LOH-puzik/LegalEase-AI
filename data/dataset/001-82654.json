Mr PERSON is charged with serious and particularly serious crimes carrying a penalty of DATE imprisonment . His name is on the international list of fugitives from justice .

ORG further found that , in granting the extradition request , the deputy Prosecutor General had failed to consider whether the applicant could be prosecuted for an offence connected with a political offence , whereas LAW prohibited extradition in such situations . As the applicant 's extradition was sought in connection with offences allegedly committed from DATE to DATE , ORG determined that his prosecution had been initiated in breach of LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and was therefore politically motivated . Moreover , the applicant was eligible for amnesty under LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL .
