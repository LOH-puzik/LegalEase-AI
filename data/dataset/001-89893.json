These time - limits should be much shorter than those set for adults .

Following its visit to GPE in DATE , the ORG published its report dated DATE ( CPT / Inf(CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) . It stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Despite the many changes to legislation in DATE , certain weaknesses remain as regards formal safeguards against ill - treatment . Perhaps the most important shortcoming is that persons detained on suspicion of collective offences falling under the jurisdiction of ORG are still not entitled to access to a lawyer during DATE of their custody . Further , despite earlier affirmations to the contrary , the NORP authorities made clear in their response to the report on DATE visit that such persons are being denied during DATE of their custody the possibility to inform a relative of their situation . Such incommunicado detention can only facilitate the infliction of ill - treatment .", "The ORG must therefore reiterate once again the recommendation that all persons deprived of their liberty by the law enforcement agencies , including persons suspected of offences falling under the jurisdiction of ORG , be granted as from the outset of their custody the right of access to a lawyer . The ORG recognises that in order to protect the legitimate interests of the police investigation , it may exceptionally be necessary to delay for a certain period a detained person \u2019s access to a lawyer of his choice ; however , in such cases , access to another independent lawyer should be arranged .", "The implementation of the above recommendation will require legislative measures . However , in the meantime , immediate steps should be taken to ensure that existing legal provisions are complied with . Indeed , the information gathered during the DATE ad hoc visit clearly indicates that even after DATE of police custody , access to a lawyer for persons suspected of ORG offences is in practice the exception rather than the rule . The ORG recommends that the officials responsible for carrying out checks and inspections under the previously - mentioned compliance monitoring procedure be instructed to pay particular attention to whether persons suspected of collective offences falling under the jurisdiction of ORG are being informed of their right to have access to a lawyer after DATE of their custody and are being placed in a position effectively to exercise that right . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The ORG trusts that the NORP authorities will in the near future implement the ORG \u2019s long - standing recommendation that all persons deprived of their liberty by law enforcement agencies , including persons suspected of offences falling under the jurisdiction of ORG , be granted as from the outset of their custody the right of access to a lawyer .", "...", "CARDINAL . Reference has been made earlier to recent positive legislative developments concerning the rights of access to a lawyer and to have one \u2019s custody notified to a relative ( cf . paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . They have further improved an already impressive legal and regulatory framework to combat torture and ill - treatment . Nevertheless , the ORG remains very concerned by the fact that persons detained on suspicion of collective offences falling under the jurisdiction of ORG are still denied access to a lawyer during DATE of their custody ; its position on this point has been made clear in paragraph CARDINAL .", "Further , the actual content of the right of access to a lawyer for persons suspected of ORG offences remains less well developed than in the case of ordinary criminal suspects . In particular , as far as the ORG can ascertain , it is still the case that such suspects are not entitled to have the lawyer present when making a statement to the police and that the procedure allowing for the appointment of a lawyer by ORG is not applicable to them . Similarly , the provision making obligatory the appointment of a lawyer for persons DATE still does not apply to juveniles who are detained on suspicion of ORG offences .
