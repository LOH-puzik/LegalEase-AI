{"ITEMID": "001-22316", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "DANCY v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , born in DATE and currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment in FAC Full GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant had a history of psychiatric illness . On DATE , he went to the police station where he confessed that he had attacked a man , PERSON , in the building where he lived as he thought the man had accused him of stealing his television . PERSON was found dead with multiple depressed skull fractures consistent with use of a hammer .", "On DATE , the applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility and was sentenced by the judge to a term of life imprisonment . The judge declined to set a relevant period for deterrence and retribution ( the \u201c tariff \u201d ) . His sentencing remarks were", "\u201c ... you have pleaded guilty to the crime of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility . It was a horrendous crime committed with great violence . I bear in mind everything which I have read about you in the reports . I accept that your distress when you realised what you had done was genuine and that your remorse for it is genuine . Nevertheless , it is a very serious crime indeed and your mental state is such that though you are not a mentally sick person you present a continuing danger to the public because of your liability to fits of explosive temper unless you take regularly your proper medication . I am satisfied therefore that a sentence longer that would be necessarily appropriate to punish you having regard to the seriousness of the offence , is necessary to protect the public from serious harm . The sentence of the court upon you therefore is CARDINAL of life imprisonment .", "[ Addressing leading counsel for the applicant ] I have considered the question of making it a discretionary life sentence under LAW . I do not consider that appropriate for the reasons which I have explained . \u201d", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was informed by ORG that as a tariff had not been set under LAW of LAW DATE by the trial judge he was to be treated as a mandatory life prisoner and the Secretary of ORG would proceed to fix his tariff . He was informed of the trial judge \u2019s view , given in a recent report , that DATE was an appropriate period and was given an opportunity to make written representations to the Secretary of ORG .", "In or DATE , the Secretary of ORG set the applicant \u2019s tariff at DATE . He had been advised that the applicant should originally have been treated as a discretionary life prisoner by the trial judge who should himself have fixed as tariff at trial . For that reason , he regarded himself as bound to follow the trial judge \u2019s view .", "On DATE , the applicant was informed of this decision and told that as his tariff had already expired ( in DATE ) it was no longer a factor in his continued detention .", "On DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal against sentence , alleging that the trial judge should have specified the DATE tariff at the time the sentence was passed and that had the period been so specified he would have been treated as a discretionary life prisoner and not a mandatory life prisoner . Permission to appeal was granted on DATE .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the appeal . Lord Justice PERSON said :", "\u201c It seems to this ORG , from the sentencing observations of the learned judge , that , although he referred to the gravity of the offence and the danger then presented by the appellant , he was not seeking to say that , in this case , life should mean life . Indeed , his recent recommendation to the ORG Secretary that a period of DATE would be appropriate for retribution and deterrence is quite inconsistent with such having been his intention at that time .", "It is not clear whether the judge \u2019s attention was drawn to ORG and , in any event , he certainly did not have the advantage of the observations of this Court in GPE , which was decided in DATE , after the learned judge passed sentence . Had he had that advantage , it seems to us very unlikely that he would have expressed himself quite as he did in his sentencing remarks . The consequence , in our judgment , is that a period of DATE ought to have been expressed by the learned judge at the time sentence was passed , in accordance with ORG and in accordance with what now appears in the judgment of this Court , in GPE . Accordingly , this appeal will be allowed , to the extent that a DATE tariff period will be specified ... The consequence of this is , for the avoidance of doubt , that he will become a discretionary life prisoner and can and should be treated by ORG accordingly . \u201d", "The applicant was immediately re - categorised as a discretionary life prisoner by ORG .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s case was reviewed by ORG , at an oral hearing . He appeared in person and was represented by his solicitor . He was entitled to adduce evidence and to cross - examine witnesses . It did not direct release , finding that the applicant remained a risk . It did recommend to the Secretary of ORG that his case be reviewed in DATE as he had nearly completed the recommended offence related programmes and as he had been disadvantaged in not obtaining a review DATE before the expiry of the tariff as his tariff had only been fixed recently .", "The applicant \u2019s case was reviewed by ORG at an oral hearing held on DATE . By decision dated DATE , ORG declined to direct the applicant \u2019s release as it concluded that the applicant remained a danger to the public . It recommended that the next review take place in DATE as considerable further offence - related , treatment / work programmes still needed to be undertaken e.g. further work on anger management and relationship issues as well as attendance on an Extended Sex Offender Treatment Programme . It noted that the applicant had acknowledged during the proceedings that neither release nor transfer to open conditions was appropriate at this stage . It did recommend that he be transferred to a Category C prison ( lower security ) to facilitate further treatment work and this was implemented . The applicant \u2019s next review was scheduled for DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant signed the DATE review board summary setting out proposals for further treatment , indicating that he fully agreed with the recommendations .", "The applicant has now been transferred to a Category C prison .", "LANGUAGE law imposes a mandatory sentence for the offence of murder in respect of offenders under the age of CARDINAL known as detention during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) ; in respect of offenders between the age of DATE , custody for life ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ) , and in respect of offenders aged CARDINAL and over , life imprisonment ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Murder ( Abolition of Death Penalty ) Act DATE ) .", "Mandatory life sentences are fixed by law , in contrast to discretionary life sentences which can be imposed at the discretion of the trial judge on persons convicted of certain violent or sexual offences ( e.g. manslaughter , rape or robbery ) . The principles underlying the imposition of a discretionary life sentence are :", "Discretionary life sentences are indeterminate in order that \u201c the prisoner \u2019s progress may be monitored ... so that he will be kept in custody so long as public safety may be jeopardised by his being let loose at large \u201d ( R v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . Rep. CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "Persons sentenced to mandatory and discretionary life imprisonment , custody for life and those detained during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure have a \u2018 LOC set in relation to the period of imprisonment they should serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence . After the expiry of the tariff , the prisoner becomes eligible for release on licence . Applicable provisions and practice in respect of the fixing of the tariff and release on licence have been subject to change , most notably following the coming into force on DATE of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which was in force at the relevant time . The provisions of the DATE Act were replaced by ORG LAW ) from DATE .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , the trial judge in sentencing a person to a term of discretionary life imprisonment in open court after a trial was given the power to fix the tariff .", "The role of the trial judge in this respect was clarified by ORG in a Practice Direction ( Crime \u2013 Life sentences ) [ DATE WLR CARDINAL ] . Paragraph CARDINAL stated :", "\u201c The judge is not obliged by statute to make use of the provisions of section DATE when passing a discretionary life sentence . However the judge should do so , save in the very exceptional case where the judge considers that the offence is so serious that detention for life is justified by the seriousness of the offence alone , irrespective of the risk to the public . In such a case , the judge should state this in open court when passing sentence . \u201d", "In DATE , the case of NORP v. PERSON ( CARDINAL ORG R(S ) ORG said concerning ORG and the DATE Act :", "\u201c The scheme of the LAW is that the judiciary should specify the period which the prisoner should serve , and that period should be appropriate to the punishment or retribution required and the need to deter the prisoner and others from committing similar grave offences . This period is usually referred to as the tariff period . Once that period has expired the prisoner can expect to be released on licence if ORG is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)b ) . There is thus a clear division of function . The judges are to decide the period which the prisoner is to serve by way of punishment and deterrence . ORG must decide whether he still presents a danger to the public and , if he does not , he must be released . That means , save in cases of most exceptional gravity , where the judge thinks that a prisoner should remain a prisoner for the rest of his normal life , he should specify a period under the LAW . \u201d", "In cases of mandatory life sentences , it is for the Secretary of ORG to fix the tariff after consulting the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice . He is entitled to depart from the judicial view .", "Pursuant to section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act , ORG had a duty to advise the Secretary of ORG with respect to any matter referred to it by him which was connected with the early release or recall of prisoners .", "ORG Chairman appointed CARDINAL members of ORG to consider discretionary life cases . They comprised the Discretionary Lifer Panel ( \u201c DLP \u201d ) . Pursuant to ORG DATE which came into force on DATE , a discretionary life prisoner was entitled to , amongst other things , an oral hearing , disclosure of evidence before ORG and legal representation . He was also entitled to call witnesses on his behalf and to cross - examine those who had written reports about him . A reasoned decision by the ORG was delivered within DATE of the hearing . Prior to DATE , the duty to release discretionary life prisoners was dealt with by LAW , which provided that where a discretionary life prisoner had served his tariff and ORG had directed his release , it was the duty of the Secretary of ORG to release him on licence .", "Section CARDINAL ) provided :", "\u201c The ORG shall not give a direction ... unless \u2013", "( a ) NORP the Secretary of ORG has referred the prisoner \u2019s case to the ORG ;", "( b ) ORG is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined . \u201d", "A discretionary life prisoner may require the Secretary of ORG to refer his case to ORG , after the end of the period of DATE beginning with the disposal of a previous reference to ORG ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of the DATE Act , now LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW ) .", "The regime applicable to mandatory life prisoners was , however , preserved within LAW .
