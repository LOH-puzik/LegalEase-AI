Accordingly , it found no basis for awarding him any compensation .", "ORG amended the judgment and granted the applicant MONEY ( MONEY at the material time ) in compensation . It further reiterated a number of principles relevant for the determination of claims for the infringement of personal rights .", "First , ORG stressed that under LAW a plaintiff was not obliged to prove that he had suffered any damage to his health but to show that he sustained non - material damage caused by the infringement of his personal rights . Second , he had to produce evidence demonstrating the extent of the damage suffered . In determining an award , the court , for its part , should take into account such factors as the intensity of the suffering , whether the damage was permanent or irreversible and whether it was possible for a plaintiff to reverse its consequences by recourse to other civil remedies . It should also have regard to the nature of the right infringed , the degree of culpability on the part of the defendant and the defendant 's financial situation . The ratio of LAW was not purely compensatory \u2013 another aim was to provide the plaintiff with satisfaction , which meant that an amount awarded should constitute a tangible financial sanction for the defendant . However , the court explained further that , in general , sums awarded under LAW should be moderate and reflect the prevailing national financial circumstances . They should not be a source of enrichment for the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined , and allowed , a cassation appeal ( skarga kasacyjna ) lodged by a certain PERSON against the judgment of ORG of DATE ( case no . IACa CARDINAL ) upholding the first - instance dismissal of the plaintiff 's claim for compensation for the infringement of his personal rights caused by overcrowding in prison .", "The lower courts established that from DATE to DATE , that is to say for DATE , the applicant had been held in a cell designed for QUANTITY persons with QUANTITY or even more inmates . However , they considered that those conditions had not been in breach of LAW torture , cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ) , LAW ( duty to treat detained persons in a humane manner ) and LAW ( right to protection of private life ) of the LAW but had been a normal consequence of the execution of a penalty and constituted a form of suffering normally associated with serving a prison sentence . The prison authorities had informed the penitentiary court of the overcrowding in their establishment and the need to apply the measures foreseen by LAW . It was true that no specific term had been fixed for the application of those measures but Article CARDINAL did not oblige them to set any specific time - frame . The applicant had not made any complaints about the conditions of his detention to the relevant authorities . Moreover , he had refused a proposal of transfer to a \u201c half - open \u201d prison , thus renouncing the possibility of improving his situation .", "In view of the foregoing , the courts found that the actions taken by the defendant authorities had been legitimate and could not be considered unlawful for the purposes of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG quashed ORG judgment and remitted the case .", "Referring to its earlier judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs PERSON above ) , it restated the principle that the right to be detained in conditions respecting one 's dignity undoubtedly belonged to the catalogue of personal rights and that actions infringing this right could involve ORG liability for the purposes of ORG and CARDINAL of LAW .", "ORG observed that ORG , in determining the lawfulness of the defendant 's actions , had failed to consider whether the requirements of Article CARDINAL of the Code had been complied with . First , it had not established whether there had been a \u201c particularly justified case \u201d as required under this provision , allowing the authorities to place the plaintiff in a cell below the statutory minimum size of QUANTITY . The fact that there had been a temporary overcrowding in prison , without any explanation of the cause of this situation , was not sufficient to justify the application of Article CARDINAL . The notion of \u201c particularly justified case \u201d should be understood as an exceptional or special circumstance and not simply any given situation . It could conceivably include such situations as an increase in crime and in sentences of imprisonment , imposition of martial law , emergency , epidemics or natural disasters . Accordingly , in order to establish whether there was a \u201c particularly justified case \u201d the court could not rely on a general phenomenon of overcrowding in prisons within the whole country .", "Moreover , ORG had been wrong in finding that the absence of any specific time - frame in Article CARDINAL absolved the authorities from setting a precise period for which the measures would be applied in the plaintiff 's case . Thus , the relevant rule spoke of a \u201c specified period of time \u201d , which by no means meant an indefinite and unforeseeable term .", "Finally , ORG referred to the argument that the plaintiff , by his refusal of a transfer to another prison , legitimised the authorities ' decision to continue his placement in a reduced - size cell . This , ORG stressed , could not eliminate the unlawfulness of their actions . In that respect , it reiterated that , pursuant to LAW , the inherent and inalienable dignity of the person was inviolable and the respect and protection thereof was a duty incumbent on the authorities . This principle had a particular meaning in situations where the ORG imposed repressive measures . The exercise of this power could not restrict the right to dignity and the right of persons detained to be treated in a humane manner as these rights had an absolute character .", "CARDINAL . Data relating to the total capacity of NORP detention establishments published by ORG ( available on ORG official website ORG ) show that those establishments can admit CARDINAL persons ( the figures given by the authorities range from CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) .", "According to DATE statistical reports published by ORG , as of CARDINAL DATE the number of persons detained in NORP prisons stood at CARDINAL , of whom PERCENT were serving their sentences and PERCENT were detained on remand ; the remaining persons served short sentences of imprisonment imposed for commission of administrative offences .
