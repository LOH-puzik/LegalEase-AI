The second applicant is the first applicant \u2019s daughter , Miss GPE PERSON , a NORP and NORP national who was born out of wedlock on DATE in GPE . They both live in GPE and are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in Donaueschingen .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , in GPE , the first applicant met the father of the second applicant , their daughter . From DATE until DATE the first applicant lived some of the time in GPE and some of the time with the father in GPE . After the birth of the second applicant in DATE in GPE , she returned with the child to GPE in DATE . DATE and from DATE she lived with the child in GPE again . After the GPE separation in DATE , the applicants lived in a women \u2019s refuge in GPE . The father deposited the applicants\u2019 passports with an NORP court and introduced custody proceedings with ORG . On DATE ORG provisionally ordered joint legal custody and allowed the first applicant to leave GPE with her daughter for a journey to GPE on or CARDINAL June CARDINAL but ordered them to return not later than DATE . On DATE the applicants left to GPE and did not return to GPE . At first , the first applicant submitted sickness certificates , the last of which was valid until DATE . The custody proceedings in GPE are still pending .", "On DATE the father made an application to ORG for the return of the second applicant under LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) .", "The father argued in particular that according to NORP law and the provisional order of CARDINAL DATE of ORG of GPE they had joint legal custody rights and that he had agreed to the ORG leaving GPE only until DATE . The second applicant had been habitually resident in GPE since DATE , when the applicants had come to GPE to live there and there had always been merely temporary reasons for the first applicant to return to GPE with their daughter . After their separation and according to the decision of CARDINAL DATE the second applicant had lived DATE a week with him and the rest of DATE with her mother . He claimed that the first applicant \u2019s allegations that he had violence and drug problems were wrong . They had only had frequent relationship problems and had therefore started couple therapy . His relationship with the second applicant was good and no psychological harm for the child was to be expected in the event of a relocation to GPE .", "The first applicant opposed the father \u2019s application and claimed that she had sole custody of the second applicant and that NORP law was applicable . She argued in particular that she and her daughter had never been habitually resident in GPE in the sense of LAW . From the child \u2019s birth until DATE the child had lived DATE in GPE and only CARDINAL days in GPE . She had in fact only returned CARDINAL times to GPE , to give them another chance as a family and due to empty promises by the father . In the end this had not worked out , inter alia due to his serious drug problems . He had also massively threatened her in front of their daughter . After their separation she had only remained in GPE because she was forced to , as the father had taken away their passports . The father had also never exercised any custody rights , nor had he bonded with the child . The child refused to return and was afraid of her father . An obligation to return would thus be detrimental to the child \u2019s wellbeing and would destroy her emotionally . Finally , she put forward that the child \u2019s therapist was also opposed to contact between the father and the child as long as the child refused such contact .", "ORG heard the parents , ORG and the child \u2019s curator ad litem ( PERSON ) . ORG and the curator ad litem both reported that the child had fears in connection with the father and a possible relocation to GPE . The curator ad litem held that a relocation of the second applicant to GPE without the mother would endanger the child \u2019s well - being .", "On DATE ORG ordered the first applicant to immediately return her daughter to GPE . In the event of noncompliance by DATE , the first applicant or any other person with responsibility for the child would be obliged to hand over the child to the father or to a person named by him for the return of the child . Moreover , it allowed direct enforcement ( unmittelbarer PERSON ) , access to and search of the house in which the child would remain and the support of the police for the enforcement of the decision . It also threatened the first applicant with the payment of a coercive fine of MONEY ( ORG ) or with coercive detention of DATE .", "In application of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , ORG found that a ) even if the applicants had spent a bit more time in GPE up to DATE , the child had been \u201c habitually resident \u201d in GPE at that time , that b ) under NORP law the parents had joint custody , which followed from LAW DATE and from the decision of the Cairns Federal Magistrate Court of Australia of CARDINAL DATE , and that c ) the first applicant had breached the father \u2019s custody rights in DATE by retaining their daughter in GPE and that therefore the first applicant was to be ordered to return the child to GPE . It also held that the first applicant had not established that there was a grave risk that her daughter \u2019s return would \u201c expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation \u201d in the sense of LAW of LAW . Firstly , the first applicant \u2019s allegation that the father had been violent and aggressive and that the daughter was afraid of him would not collide with the obligation to return the child as she could be expected to accompany her daughter , take care of her in GPE and await the outcome of the pending custody proceedings there . Secondly , the fact that in the meantime the child had settled very well in GPE could not be decisive , as taking such factors into account would render LAW futile . Thirdly , the fact that the first applicant could not make a living in GPE and would be dependent on social welfare would not conflict with the obligation to return either , as she was on social welfare in GPE as well .", "The first applicant appealed against the decision of ORG . She argued in particular that LAW was not applicable , as she and her daughter had never been habitually resident in GPE in the sense of that ORG , and submitted further details regarding the conditions and the reasons for their stays in GPE and GPE during the relevant time . Moreover , she argued that as she had left GPE in DATE with the intention of never coming back , DATE had elapsed before the father made his application for the return of the child pursuant to LAW . Therefore , LAW CARDINAL and not \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW was applicable . She also requested ORG to obtain an expert opinion on the question whether it would harm the child \u2019s well - being if the child was forced to relocate to GPE . Furthermore , the applicant stressed that the father was still addicted to drugs and that he had already spent DATE in jail for drug trafficking . After she had pressed charges against him in DATE for taking away her passports , drugs were found in his house again and he received a further conviction . Finally , the first applicant argued that in the meantime she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ( GPE ) and that it was therefore impossible for her to live in tropical countries .", "The father argued , inter alia , that the time - limit of DATE according to LAW only started to run on DATE , the date the first applicant did not return to GPE as stipulated . He claimed that the first applicant \u2019s allegations that he had drug problems were false . It was true that he had been convicted for using drugs in DATE , but he had been rehabilitated in DATE . Voluntary drug use screenings in DATE and DATE had been negative .", "The second applicant \u2019s curator ad litem pointed out that the child was well integrated in GPE . The curator ad litem also referred to an expert opinion that had been obtained by the NORP court in DATE , which reported social isolation , the lack of a stable framework and lack of support from the father as regards integration . In this expert opinion it had been found that DATE the development of the second applicant was at risk . In addition to these aspects it was the clear wish of the second applicant to remain in GPE . The father and the possible relocation to GPE caused anxiety to the second applicant . However , the curator ad litem was not sure if these aspects were sufficient to speak of a grave risk of harm in the sense of LAW of LAW . Having regard to the warm relationship between the second applicant and the father , as described in the expert opinion , it would be in the interests of the child to re - establish contact .", "On DATE ORG , after hearing the parents , the curator ad litem and the second applicant on DATE and having obtained an expert opinion on the applicant \u2019s ability to return to GPE with regard to her illness , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed the ORG decision .", "ORG firstly held that the second applicant had had \u201c habitual residence \u201d in GPE when the applicants left for GPE in DATE . It pointed out that it was decisive where a person actually lived the central part of their life , and that habitual residence was in general established after a stay of DATE . It found that it could not be said that the second applicant had been habitually resident in GPE before the applicants came back to GPE in DATE . However , after the separation in DATE , when the first applicant realised that she was unable to leave GPE because the father was in possession of the passports , she abandoned her apartment and domicile in GPE on DATE and registered in GPE . Thereafter , regular contact took place between the father and the second applicant and the child was socially integrated through the father . Although the applicants had initially planned to stay in GPE only temporarily , they established a habitual residence there after DATE in DATE . The fact that the applicant only remained in GPE because she was forced to do so was not decisive , because after abandoning her residence in GPE she no longer had any other home and she was also free to move and choose her residence within GPE .", "ORG secondly found that the first applicant had breached the father \u2019s custody rights by not returning to GPE with their daughter on DATE . It referred to LAW of LAW to LAW ( see relevant domestic law ) and to ORG decision of DATE provisionally ordering joint custody upon approval by both parties .", "ORG thirdly held that LAW was not applicable as the applicants\u2019 leaving GPE on DATE was still covered by ORG permission to leave \u201c on or CARDINAL June CARDINAL \u201d . The wrongful retention thus only began in DATE when the applicants did not return to GPE as stipulated .", "ORG fourthly found that the requirements for an exception according to LAW had not been met in the instant case . Contrary to the first applicant \u2019s allegations , the father had not tacitly agreed to the second applicant \u2019s staying in GPE . The mere fact that he initially kept up contact with the second applicant until he requested them to return to GPE for the first time explicitly in DATE could not be interpreted as approval . As regards LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL b ) of LAW and the alleged existence of a \u201c grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation \u201d , ORG held that with regard to the purpose of that LAW this provision required a narrow interpretation . Referring to the expert opinion ORG held that even if a rapid deterioration of the first applicant \u2019s state of health did happen , there were no grounds which made a return impossible . There was also no indication that it was not possible to adequately treat her condition in GPE . Hence , she was able to accompany her daughter and could thus not claim that the return of the second applicant to GPE would be harmful to the child \u2019s well - being .", "Finally , with regard to the fact that one of the judges who had taken part in the oral hearing of CARDINAL DATE had been replaced by a new judge , ORG referred to LAW ) and in particular to the relevant case - law . It underlined that its decision had to be taken by those judges who were competent to do so at the time of the decision and not at the time of the oral hearing .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the ORG constitutional complaint for adjudication , in which they had complained about their obligation to relocate to GPE , the first applicant \u2019s possible coercive detention and ORG judge \u2019s non - attendance at the oral hearing . It also rejected their request for an interim injunction . It held that there was no appearance of a violation of the applicants\u2019 fundamental rights . These NORP decisions were based on an arguable interpretation of LAW , in so far as they found that the provision allowed the person who has wrongfully removed or retained the child to be obliged to return the child personally . The hardships of such an interpretation for the parent being ordered to return the child had to be accepted as the consequence of the illegal abduction or retention .", "On DATE ORG after hearing the parents , the child \u2019s curator ad litem and ORG , again pointed out to the first applicant the possible consequences of non - compliance , namely the imposition of a coercive fine or coercive detention or the direct enforcement of the obligation . Referring to LAW of GPE in Family Matters and in Matters of Non - contentious LOC ( see Relevant domestic law ) , ORG underlined that direct enforcement could be ordered in an explicit court decision , but that direct enforcement in respect of a child would be admissible only where this was justifiable with a view to the child \u2019s well - being and where no less restrictive measures were available to enforce the obligation .", "According to LAW to the German Civil Code ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz zum PERSON ) \u201c the legal relationship between a child and its parents is governed by the law of the country in which the child has his or her habitual residence \u201d .", "According to LAW ) \u201c a judgment may be delivered only by those judges who were present at the proceedings upon which the judgment is based \u201d .", "According to LAW and in ORG ( ORG \u00fcber PERSON in GPE und in den Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen PERSON ) the court may order direct enforcement in an explicit court decision , if CARDINAL ) compulsory measures remained unsuccessful ; CARDINAL ) compulsory measures have no prospects of success ; CARDINAL ) the immediate enforcement of a decision is imperatively necessary . Under LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL direct enforcement in respect of a child shall not be allowed , where the order is aimed at delivery of the child for the purpose of contact . Moreover , direct enforcement in respect of a child shall be admissible only where this is justifiable in due consideration of the child \u2019s well - being and where less restrictive measures are not available to enforce the obligation .", "The relevant parts of LAW ( ORG \u00fcber die ORG der freiwilligen PERSON ) are set out in the case of GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "As regards LAW the relevant provisions are described in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of ORG and GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no .
