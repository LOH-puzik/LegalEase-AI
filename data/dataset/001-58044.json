In it he said that all soldiers , including those in the NORP army , had fought for peace and freedom and that people should therefore not differentiate between \" good \" and \" bad \" soldiers of that generation but should rather be grateful to all of them for having founded and built DATE \u2019s affluent , democratic society . Mr PERSON then criticised an NORP writer who had , in his view , disparaged all those killed in the Second World War , and continued as follows :", "\" Ladies and gentlemen , freedom of opinion is taken for granted in a democracy , but it reaches its limits where people lay claim to that spiritual freedom they would never have got if others had not risked their lives for them so that they may now live in democracy and freedom . \"", "CARDINAL .

ORG On DATE the court allowed the application for an announcement to be published , but on CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the court found the applicant guilty under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) of having insulted Mr PERSON and sentenced him to pay DATE - fines of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) , with CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default . In the court \u2019s view , the word GPE was an insult ( PERSON ) and could only ever be used as a disparagement ( GPE ) ; it therefore could never be used for any objective criticism ( sachliche ORG ) . In the written version of the judgment the court ordered the seizure of the relevant issue of Forum .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal ( GPE ) against that judgment . In his submission , the court had held that the expression in question constituted an insult to Mr PERSON because it had disregarded the context in which it had been used . If the court had taken into account the whole of the article and its line of argument , it would have realised that the term complained of was justified since it served as a conclusion to the finding that Mr PERSON had in his speech excluded himself from the enjoyment of freedom of opinion .", "Mr PERSON also complained that the seizure of the relevant issue of Forum had not been ordered when judgment was given .", "CARDINAL .

Only those who had read not just the lines written by the applicant but also PERSON PERSON \u2019s speech and the comments accompanying it in Forum would understand that Mr PERSON had called the speaker an \" idiot \" as , in his view , he had in his speech excluded himself and the vast majority of NORP from the enjoyment of freedom of opinion . Those who had not would link the term GPE not with the conclusion that could be drawn from Mr PERSON \u2019s words but with his own person . It thus amounted to an insult that overstepped the limits of acceptable objective criticism ( die PERSON sachlich zul\u00e4ssiger ORG ) and PERSON must have been aware of that .
