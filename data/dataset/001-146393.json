The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She has suffered since her early childhood from cerebral palsy and uses a wheel chair . In DATE she was deprived of her legal capacity on account of \u201c her physical illness and intellectual underdevelopment \u201d . On DATE her legal capacity was fully restored by a ruling of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c FAC ) asked ORG to institute proceedings with a view to partially depriving the applicant of her legal capacity in order to prevent her from disposing of her assets . They relied on a previous ruling of DATE by the same court by which the applicant had been deprived of her legal capacity ( see the preceding paragraph ) . They further asserted that the applicant had been suffering from \u201c grave bodily damage \u201d ( velika tjelesna o\u0161te\u0107enja ) since early childhood , as she had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy and various chronic illnesses such as diabetes , high blood pressure and defective eyesight .", "CARDINAL . They further asserted , relying on a statement given by the applicant \u2019s son at the ORG and a report by the ORG \u2019s social worker , that the applicant \u2019s condition had worsened after she had undergone an operation on her head on DATE . Since then she had suffered from personality changes , manifested in managing her money in an irrational manner , such as by not paying the DATE instalments for the purchase of her flat , electricity , water and other bills , and by purchasing mobile telephone cards instead of food . This could have led to the applicant \u2019s eviction from the flat she occupied , as she had already received a final warning that a civil action in that respect was to be lodged .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s request was supported by evidence , such as an electricity bill of CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) dated DATE , a copy of a final demand for payment of DATE instalments for the purchase of the applicant \u2019s flat , with the debt amounting to HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL as at DATE , a notice that the water supply for the applicant \u2019s flat would be stopped as of CARDINAL DATE on account of non - payment of a debt in the amount of HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , and a debt recovery notice for the amount of HRK CARDINAL payable to ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appointed its employee , PERSON , as the applicant \u2019s legal guardian in the proceedings before ORG . In the proceedings before that court the guardian gave her full consent to the ORG \u2019s application . The applicant was represented by a lawyer of her own choosing .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the applicant on DATE and established that :", "\u201c The respondent was found at her address in a wheelchair . She gave very meaningful answers ; [ she ] stressed that she acted autonomously , kept her flat tidy , prepared her meals and was provided with help by her son and a tenant . She moved about independently in her wheelchair and did her own shopping , [ and ] paid [ her own ] bills , which gave rise to difficulties during DATE . She stated that in the period when she had underwent a head surgery in DATE [ DATE ] , she had been late with paying her utility bills ... She did not agree with the proceedings [ being brought ] and considered that she did not need a guardian . She stressed that she regularly took [ her ] prescribed medication ... It is to be noted that the respondent was presentable and her home was tidy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In her written submissions the applicant explained that during her hospitalisation she had empowered her son to retrieve money from her bank account and pay the utility bills , which he had not done but had instead taken the money for himself . She asked that her son be examined by the court .", "CARDINAL . A psychiatric report commissioned for the purposes of the proceedings , drawn up on DATE by PERSON and GPE , in so far as relevant reads as follows :", "\u201c A psychiatric examination of the respondent was carried out on DATE at her home ... She stated that she had completed elementary school and had been an average pupil , that she had studied law for DATE and knew all about the law . To me she said : \u2018 You know how it was when you operated on me.\u2019 She is dissatisfied with the court proceedings [ being brought ] : \u2018 I dislike the PERSON [ ORG ] because they attempted to send me to [ a home in ] ORG And in respect of her son she said : \u2018 I am sorry when someone blackmails him\u2019 . She stated that she had been paying all her bills and that \u2018 I previously had a huge negative [ balance ] , [ because ] I had to pay for the hospital\u2019 . She stated that she had a lot of acquaintances who were her former lodgers , whom she saw regularly when out and about in her wheelchair in her neighbourhood and \u2018 they all respect me\u2019 . Upon a direct question she denied having any mental problems .", "Psychological status : conscious , contact easily established , uncertain about time , in other respects well oriented . Has a wide and viscous ( viskozni ) thought process , with loss of determining tendency . Interacts without distance . In thought content confabulatory with a paranoid position , projections and infantile explanation . Basic disposition is elevated . Intellectually \u2013 memory functions are primarily insufficient at the ORG level , additionally compromised with psychoorganic type . Lacks insight into her condition .", "ORG suffers from ORG . Little , parapresis spast . , monoparesis ext . sup . spast . sin . , ORG , condition after brain haemorrhage , condition after stroke , condition after meningoencephalitis , with a lack of insight into her condition [ and ] the need for and purpose of treatment . Owing to this , she is not able to entirely look after her personal needs , rights and interests . Also , because of her state of health and lack of insight she may jeopardise the rights and interests of others . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged written submissions whereby she objected to the psychiatrists\u2019 findings , stating that it was not clear how they had concluded that she was unable to properly dispose of her money , given that the debts referred to had been incurred by her son when she had been hospitalised .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE the psychiatrists gave the following opinion evidence :", "\u201c We entirely endorse our written report of DATE and to the objections filed by the respondent we would state the following : on the basis of the enclosed medical records , social history and our own examination we have established that the respondent suffers from PERSON . She also suffers from triparesis with preserved functions of her right hand , mild mental retardation , and conditions following a brain haemorrhage and meningoencephalitis . Her intellectual capabilities are , owing to the above - mentioned [ conditions ] , additionally compromised on the psychoorganic type . During the interview we noticed confabulations in the content of her thoughts , that is to say fabricated content , a paranoid position , in particular as regards her close family and the employees of the social welfare centre , and infantile explanation . The respondent lacks insight into her condition . All this led us [ to conclude ] that the respondent does not possess sufficient intellectual capacity to adequately protect her own rights and interests , and because of her lack of insight she might also jeopardise the rights and interests of others . We therefore consider that the application for deprivation of the respondent \u2019s legal capacity as regards disposing of her money and assets and as regards taking decisions about her medical treatment , is appropriate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partially deprived the applicant of her legal capacity , thereby stopping her from disposing of her money and other assets and from making independent decisions concerning her medical treatment . The ruling relied exclusively on the opinion given by the CARDINAL psychiatrists and extensively repeated their findings stated in their written report and their oral evidence given at the hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on DATE , in which she argued that partially depriving her of her legal capacity solely on the basis of the psychiatric report had not been justified , because the psychiatrists had lacked knowledge of how she spent her money and how she disposed of her assets . She argued that she had purchased the flat where she lived herself and there was no danger that she would give it up . The assertion that she was paranoid as regards her close family members was not correct . She had had troubled relations with her son at times because he had moved into her flat with his girlfriend and her daughter and had had an interest in having her removed from the flat and placed in a home . Therefore , she had successfully sought their eviction from her flat . She had also changed her bank and her son no longer had authority to use her credit card . She lived a peaceful life , and was a member of ORG and Poliomyelitis . The court conducting the proceedings had had the chance to establish that normal communication with her was possible and that she lived in a tidy flat . The ORG had not proven the need for her to be partially deprived of her legal capacity . Only a bookkeeping expert could have established the facts concerning her debts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE , which again relied extensively on the psychiatric report . The appeal court added that the applicant had been hospitalised DATE and DATE and DATE , whereas the unpaid bills ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were dated DATE ( electricity bill of HRK CARDINAL ) , DATE ( HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL in DATE instalments for the purchase of the flat ) and CARDINAL DATE ( water bill of HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , which indicated that the debts concerned a much longer period than the applicant \u2019s hospitalisation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint , in which she repeated the arguments from her appeal , stressing that the debts in question had been incurred during the period in which she had been hospitalised and her son had had her bank card . Instead of paying her bills he had used the money from her account for his own needs . She added that CARDINAL of the psychiatrists who had drawn up the report on her mental state had interviewed her . She also stressed that it was entirely unclear what rights and interests of others she might jeopardise .
