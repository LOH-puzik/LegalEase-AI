The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants have been employed in the duty - free shops at ORG since DATE . They are members of ORG , which had signed a collective labour agreement with ORG on Spirits and Tobacco , the ORG employer and formerly a ORG - run enterprise .", "CARDINAL . During their employment the applicants operated in \u201c work and rest cycles \u201d . Accordingly , in DATE they worked continuously for TIME and rested the next TIME . For DATE , DATE , they worked for TIME and rested for the next TIME . Their work schedule did not take account of DATE or DATE as the dutyfree shops remained open TIME a day , DATE a week . As regards rest breaks and periods , section CARDINAL of their collective labour agreement provided that such periods would be counted as working time and that they could not be subject to wage deductions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , with the assistance of their lawyer , instituted individual and separate proceedings against their employer before ORG . They claimed compensation for TIME they had worked beyond the legal working time for DATE of their employment . They referred to LAW in force at the material time and to their collective agreement . Both documents defined overtime as work in excess of the regular DATE working week and provided for remuneration for such work at CARDINAL times the regular hourly rate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants instituted new proceedings against their employer before ORG and requested further remuneration for work done on DATE and public holidays and compensation for DATE leave that they had not taken .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the common background of the ORG complaints in both sets of proceedings , ORG decided to join each applicant \u2019s proceedings and to seek an expert report concerning the calculation of their claims for overtime , DATE and public holiday pay and remuneration for unused DATE leave .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert submitted a report in which he noted , inter alia , that clause CARDINAL ( c ) of the collective agreement concluded between the parties provided for an entitlement to overtime pay , calculated on the basis of CARDINAL times the TIME rate . He further referred to an official audit report by ORG , dated DATE , which noted that during DATE , DATE , workers at the company in question had worked overtime of TIME in DATE which had DATE and TIME in DATE . In DATE , DATE , they had worked TIME and TIME of overtime respectively . TIME worked in excess of the legal working time should have been remunerated accordingly . According to the expert report , the applicants\u2019 employer had previously been cautioned , on DATE , by ORG concerning its practices on TIME .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of his examination of the company \u2019s timekeeping records , the expert calculated TIME worked as overtime in respect of each applicant , deducting TIME of rest per DATE worked .", "CARDINAL . The expert determined that the employer did not owe anything to the applicants for DATE and public holiday work as the remuneration for DATE had been in accordance with the applicable regulations . The expert also noted that the applicants could not claim any compensation for unused DATE leave as they were still working at the company and such leave was only payable at the end of a contract .", "CARDINAL . The applicants raised a number of objections to the expert report . They stated that the timekeeping records used for the calculation did not reflect TIME worked as they were unofficial copies kept by the employer , which were not signed by employees . In that regard , the applicants submitted that they had worked for TIME than established by the expert . They requested that the court take other evidence into account , including the defendant employer \u2019s shift orders , which detailed who would work when and for how long , as well as reports from ORG . They also submitted that the deduction of TIME of rest per day was not based on fact but was an assumption by the expert . The applicants submitted that in any event the expert \u2019s hypothetical conclusion on rest periods could not be relied on because the collective agreement had expressly provided for the inclusion of such periods as a part of working time . The applicants raised no objections to the expert \u2019s conclusion on the dismissal of their claims for pay for work at DATE and on DATE and for unused DATE leave .", "CARDINAL . In submissions of DATE , the defendant employer raised objections to the expert report and also argued that the timekeeping documents could not be relied on as they were unofficial copies . It also maintained that it had been unable to pay overtime in full owing to a lack of funds from the ORG . It submitted that the applicants had in any event been aware of the working arrangements and had never requested a transfer to another unit of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG asked the expert to supplement his report with findings concerning the parties\u2019 objections .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the expert submitted a supplement to his report , in which he corrected his findings concerning the rest periods in the light of the applicants\u2019 objection and calculated the hours they had worked as CARDINAL in the course of a QUANTITY shift . He maintained his findings regarding the timesheets , submitting that his in situ examination of the workplace and comparisons between the official record and the employer \u2019s copies had not revealed any inconsistencies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found in favour of the applicants in part and awarded them the amounts given in the expert \u2019s report in respect of the unpaid overtime . It rejected their claims for pay for DATE and public holiday work and for unused DATE leave .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision and remitted the case . It found that ORG had not taken into account any time that could have been used for rest periods and that therefore the calculation of overtime could not be deemed accurate . It also stated that the overtime calculation should be based on DATE TIME rather than the DATE working time used in the expert report .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , ORG requested that the expert amend the report in light of ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the expert revised the findings as ordered and concluded that the applicants were likely to have had a minimum of TIME for rest during a QUANTITY shift . The expert therefore recalculated their entitlement to overtime on the basis of QUANTITY of actual work and compared it with the legal working week of fortyfive TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG awarded the applicants compensation for overtime as determined in the revised expert report .", "CARDINAL . The defendant employer appealed , arguing that the presumption established in the case - law of ORG that a person could not work TIME in the course of a QUANTITY shift should be applied to the facts of the dispute . ORG then quashed the first - instance judgment on DATE and remitted the case on the following grounds :", "\u201c It can be seen from the case file that during DATE [ the applicants ] worked for TIME and subsequently rested for TIME ; and in DATE they worked for TIME and subsequently rested for TIME . However , as determined by the well - established case - law of FAC of ORG , in workplaces where there are CARDINAL-hour shifts , after the deduction of time spent on certain activities such as resting , eating and fulfilling other needs , a person can only work for TIME a day ... This approach must also be followed in the present case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , ORG decided to follow the decision of ORG and another expert report was drawn up for that purpose . The report , dated DATE , calculated the applicants\u2019 DATE working time TIME , in line with ORG presumption of fact . The calculation in the new report led to no overtime being found for DATE in which the applicants had worked DATE as the working time was less than the legal limit of TIME . For DATE in which the applicants had worked DATE , the report calculated the total working time as TIME , leading to an assessment in the report of TIME of overtime . On DATE ORG rendered a final judgment in the applicants\u2019 case , based on the expert report of DATE . As a result of that interpretation , some of the ORG claims were dismissed entirely , while the others were awarded PERCENT less than the previous expert report had calculated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against the decision and maintained that the fact that they had worked continuously for TIME had already been confirmed by the legal records of ORG , both parties\u2019 witness statements and other evidence in the file , including the expert reports overturned by ORG . Although they had proven that fact , the judgment had been based on the presumption that working for TIME a day was physically impossible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision without responding to the applicants\u2019 objections ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
