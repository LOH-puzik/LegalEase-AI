The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police arrested the applicant . He was accused of planning a robbery and remanded in custody from that date .", "CARDINAL . Several decisions extending the applicant \u2019s detention were made . In particular , on DATE ORG extended his detention in the context of the pre - trial proceedings until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor indicted the applicant and several other persons before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested to be released , arguing that ORG had not extended his detention after the expiry of the period indicated in the ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release . Upon a complaint lodged by the public prosecutor ORG decided on DATE that the applicant should remain remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release . On DATE ORG dismissed a complaint by the applicant against that decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that his detention in the period after DATE and ORG above decision of CARDINAL DATE were both unlawful . In a separate complaint lodged on DATE the applicant complained about the refusal to release him in the proceedings leading to ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the applicant \u2019s right under LAW had been violated as a result of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . There had been no judicial decision extending his detention after DATE , and there existed no justification for that situation .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE in so far as it concerned the applicant and ordered ORG to reimburse the applicant \u2019s costs in the constitutional proceedings . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for just satisfaction with reference to a conclusion which a different chamber of the LAW court had reached in the case of CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - accused . According to that conclusion , ( i ) the finding of a violation of LAW provided appropriate redress to the plaintiff and ( ii ) ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE was based on that court \u2019s earlier practice , which , however , was not in accordance with practice under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG found that by its decision of DATE ORG had breached the applicant \u2019s right under LAW . In particular , ORG should have remedied the situation resulting from the applicant \u2019s unlawful detention from DATE by ordering his release .", "CARDINAL . The judgment stated , in particular :", "\u201c In ORG view , the jurisdiction of the court involved at the pre - trial stage ended with the filing of the indictment on DATE . The indictment as such is not a ground for continued detention of a person , as it does not explicitly follow from the law , and it is inadmissible to extend the possibilities of restricting a person \u2019s liberty by extensive interpretation of several provisions of LAW .", "However , a court \u2019s decision on detention of a person given at the pre - trial stage can constitute a ground for such person \u2019s detention for a short period following the indictment . Otherwise it would be practically impossible to ensure continued detention of a person after an indictment has been filed . In the circumstances , a ground for the applicant \u2019s detention existed until DATE . The detention should have been extended by a decision given no later than DATE if it was to continue after that date . In the absence of any such decision , the restriction of the applicant \u2019s liberty after DATE was unlawful .", "The unlawfulness of the applicant \u2019s deprivation of liberty after DATE can not be justified retrospectively , not even by a judicial decision . Subsequent judicial decisions could not have extended the applicant \u2019s detention , as it had ended on DATE . The only existing possibility was to remand the applicant in custody again . As this was not done , his subsequent deprivation of liberty had no legal ground . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court quashed ORG decision of DATE , granted the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) to the applicant as just satisfaction and ordered ORG to reimburse the applicant \u2019s costs .", "CARDINAL . The following provisions of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , in force until DATE ) are relevant in the present case .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a person \u2019s detention in the context of both pre - trial proceedings and during proceedings before a trial court may only last as long as necessary . Where detention in the context of pre - trial proceedings is to exceed DATE , it may be extended at a public prosecutor \u2019s request up to DATE by a judge or to a maximum of DATE by a court \u2019s chamber .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that a person \u2019s detention in the context of both pre - trial proceedings and during trial must not exceed DATE . In justified cases ORG may extend its duration to a maximum of DATE and in cases of particularly serious offences DATE . Under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , a proposal for extension of a person \u2019s detention is to be submitted by a public prosecutor in the pre - trial proceedings and by the president of the court \u2019s chamber during the trial .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL obliges investigators , prosecutors and judges to examine , at each stage of criminal proceedings , whether reasons for the accused person \u2019s detention persist . In pre - trial proceedings a judge is obliged to do so only when deciding on a public prosecutor \u2019s proposal to extend detention or to modify the reasons for it or when deciding on an accused person \u2019s application for release . Where a reason for an accused person \u2019s detention no longer exists , the accused must be released immediately .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL entitles an accused to apply for release at any time . When the public prosecutor dismisses such an application in the course of pre - trial proceedings , he or she must submit it immediately to the court . The decision on an application for release must be taken without delay . If an application is dismissed , the accused may only renew it DATE after the decision has become final unless he or she cites other reasons justifying his or her release .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , where the court carries out a preliminary examination of the indictment of a person who is detained , it shall also decide whether that person is to remain in custody .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with ORG practice , the time - limits mentioned in LAW concerned exclusively situations where a decision on a public prosecutor \u2019s proposal was to be made in the context of pre - trial proceedings . However , where an indictment had been filed within a shorter time than the DATE period mentioned in LAW , the law did not require that a request for continued detention of the accused persons be made or that a separate decision should be made on their continued detention , with the exception of cases where the indictment had been filed DATE before the expiry of the DATE maximum period of detention .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to a ORG standpoint of DATE ( Rt CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , LAW requires a court to decide on further detention of the accused where it carries out a preliminary examination of the indictment . Accordingly , where the presiding judge concludes , on the basis of the file , that a preliminary examination of the indictment is not required and considers the detention of the accused to be lawful , there is no need for a separate decision of the court chamber on continued detention of the accused . However , where the accused applies for release , that application must be decided upon without delay , in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . In judgment ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG noted that LAW did not explicitly require that a decision on extension of an accused person \u2019s detention be given in cases where an indictment had been filed and where the detention , both at the pre - trial stage and during the trial , had not exceeded DATE .", "CARDINAL . It held , however , that the filing of an indictment alone did not as such justify a person \u2019s continued detention . The court dealing with the case was required to decide explicitly on further detention of the accused prior to the expiry of the period for which the detention had been extended in the context of pre - trial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG referred in particular to the guarantees laid down in LAW and the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In that case ORG found no breach of LAW as the ordinary court involved , both in the context of a preliminary examination of the indictment and in reaction to the accused person \u2019s request for release , had decided that the reasons for the latter \u2019s detention persisted . That decision had the same effect as a decision to extend the accused person \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . In the above case , which concerned CARDINAL of the present applicant \u2019s co - accused , the detention in the context of pre - trial proceedings had been extended until DATE . Prior to its expiry , on DATE , the accused was indicted . In its judgment ORG found that ORG had breached the plaintiff \u2019s right under LAW , in that there had been no judicial decision extending his detention after DATE and there existed no justification for that situation . It was irrelevant that courts at CARDINAL levels had dismissed the accused person \u2019s application for release on DATE and DATE respectively , as those decisions related to detention in the context of pre - trial proceedings , that is prior to the filing of the indictment . In those circumstances , any relevant decision on further detention of the accused could have been taken only by the criminal court before which the accused had been indicted .", "CARDINAL . With reference to its judgment ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , ORG held that for a detention to be lawful it must always rely on a court decision . Since DATE ORG has confirmed that opinion in a number of judgments , including the cases of the applicant and another CARDINAL of his co - accused .", "CARDINAL . In judgment PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL the Constitutional Court confirmed that the filing of an indictment alone does not suffice for continued detention of an accused to be lawful . The court dealing with the criminal case which follows an indictment is required to take a decision on the accused person \u2019s detention prior to the expiry of the period for which the latter had been remanded in the context of pre - trial proceedings . ORG found a breach of the accused person \u2019s right under LAW and ordered his immediate release .", "CARDINAL . The new Code of Criminal Procedure ( Law no . PERSON . ) entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that a court is obliged to decide on further detention of an accused within DATE of his or her indictment ( or submission for its approval of an agreement between the prosecution and the accused on guilt and punishment ) unless it has already decided on detention of the accused under provisions which govern the examination of indictments .", "CARDINAL . The explanatory report to the draft Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE indicates that the above provision accentuates the judicial control of a person \u2019s detention following his or her indictment and that the amendment is also in reaction to the Constitutional Court judgment I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE was enacted with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL , where a decision on arrest , detention or any other deprivation of liberty was quashed as being unlawful or where there was wrongful official action in that context , a person affected by it is entitled to compensation for damage .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is liable for damage caused by wrongful official action which comprises , inter alia , a public authority \u2019s failure to take action within a set time - limit , inactivity , or any other unlawful interference with rights and legally recognised interests of individuals and legal entities ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW the compensation is to cover pecuniary damage , including loss of profit , and , where appropriate and necessary , non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( in case no . CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG allowed an action for damages by CARDINAL individuals against the ORG under LAW DATE and ordered the defendant to pay the costs of their defence in a criminal trial on charges of DATE which had ended with their acquittal with final and binding effect in DATE . On DATE the Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Regional Court upheld that judgment following an appeal by the defendant .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( in case no . CARDINALC CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) the GPE I ORG granted an action for damages by an individual against the ORG under LAW DATE and awarded the claimant a sum in compensation for non - pecuniary damage caused by wrongful official action in connection with his detention pending a criminal trial . The impugned wrongful official action concerned the extension by a decision of CARDINAL DATE of the claimant \u2019s detention pending trial , until DATE . The action was preceded by a judgment of ORG of DATE ( in case no . I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in which ORG had found a violation of the plaintiff \u2019s rights under LAW and CARDINAL in connection with the same facts . However , ORG had made no award to the claimant of just satisfaction as he had made no claim to that effect ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
