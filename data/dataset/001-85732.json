The applicant company , ORG SRL , is a company incorporated in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events the applicant company was the largest Internet service provider in GPE . According to the applicant company , it held PERCENT of the market of Internet services . While agreeing that the applicant company was the largest Internet service provider in the country , the Government disputed the ratio of its market share without , however , presenting any alternative figures .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company had CARDINAL licences issued by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) for providing Internet and fixed telephony services . The licences were valid until DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively and the address CARDINAL ORG was indicated in them as the applicant company \u2019s official address .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company had CARDINAL offices in PERSON . On DATE its headquarters was moved from its FAC office to its GPE cel FAC office . The change of address of the headquarters was registered with ORG and ORG were informed . However , the applicant company failed to request ORG to modify the address of its headquarters in the text of its licences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company requested a third licence from ORG indicating in its request the new address of its headquarters . ORG issued the new licence citing the old address in it , without giving any reasons for not citing the new address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE held a meeting . According to the minutes of the meeting , it found that CARDINAL companies in the field of telecommunications , including the applicant company , had failed to pay an DATE licence fee and/or to present information about changes of address within the prescribed time - limits . ORG decided to invite those companies to eliminate the irregularities within DATE and to warn them that their licences might be suspended in case of non - compliance .", "CARDINAL . NORP On unspecified dates the CARDINAL companies , including the applicant company , were sent letters asking them to comply within DATE of the date of receipt of the letter . They were also warned that their licences might be suspended in case of non - compliance in accordance with section CARDINAL of the ANRTI Regulations . The applicant company was sent such a letter on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG \u2019s letters , CARDINAL companies , including the applicant company , complied with the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant company lodged documents with ORG indicating its new address , together with a request to modify its licences accordingly , and paid the licence fee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant company that it had some questions concerning the documents submitted by the applicant company . In particular , it had a question concerning the lease of the applicant company \u2019s new headquarters and about the name of the applicant company . ORG informed the applicant company that the processing of its request concerning the amendment of its licences would be suspended until it had submitted the requested information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE held a meeting at which it adopted a decision concerning the applicant company . In particular , it reiterated the content of section CARDINAL of the Law on Licensing and of section QUANTITY of the ANRTI Regulations , according to which licences which had not been modified within DATE pursuant to section CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the ANRTI Regulations should be declared invalid . ORG found that those provisions were applicable to the applicant company \u2019s case , and that its licences were therefore not valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG wrote to ORG , ORG , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and ORG stating that the applicant company had modified its address on DATE but had failed to request ORG to make the corresponding change in its licences . In such conditions , the applicant company had traded for DATE with an invalid licence . ORG requested the authorities to verify whether the applicant company should be sanctioned in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the Regulations concerning the issuance of licences in order to provide that an entity whose licence was withdrawn could reapply for a new licence DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE held a meeting at which it found that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL companies which it had warned , in accordance with its decision of DATE , had failed to comply with the warning . It decided to suspend their licences for DATE and to warn them that in case of non - compliance during the period of suspension , their licences would be withdrawn . It appears from the documents submitted by the parties that the applicant company was the only one to have its licence invalidated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company brought an action against ORG arguing , inter alia , that the measure applied to it was illegal and disproportionate because the applicant company had always had CARDINAL different offices in PERSON of which ORG had always been aware . The change of address had only occurred because the applicant company \u2019s headquarters had been transferred from CARDINAL of those offices to another . ORG had been informed promptly about that change and thus the change of address had not led to a failure to pay taxes or to a drop in the quality of services provided by the applicant company . Moreover , ORG \u2019s decision of DATE had been adopted in breach of procedure , because the applicant company had not been invited to the meeting and ORG had disregarded its own instructions given to the applicant company on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered a stay of the execution of ORG \u2019s decision of DATE . It also set DATE as the date of the first hearing in the case . Later , at the request of ORG , that date was changed to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the representative of the applicant company lodged a request for adjournment of the hearing of DATE on the ground that he was involved in a pre - arranged hearing at another court on DATE and at the same time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing in the absence of the representative of the applicant company and dismissed the latter \u2019s action . The court considered , inter alia , that since the applicant company had failed to inform ORG about the change of address of its headquarters , the provisions of section CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the ANRTI Regulations were applicable .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company appealed against the decision arguing , inter alia , that it had not been given a chance to participate in the hearing before the first - instance court . It submitted that , according to LAW , the court had the right to strike the case out of the list of cases if it considered that the applicant had failed to appear without a plausible justification , but not to examine the case in its absence . It also submitted that , by declaring the licences invalid , ORG had breached its own decision of CARDINAL DATE . It was ORG \u2019s usual practice to request information concerning changes of address and to sanction companies which did not comply by suspending their licences . The applicant company drew attention to CARDINAL other decisions of that kind dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE . In this case , however , the applicant company had fully complied with ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE by submitting information about the new address within the prescribed time - limit . Notwithstanding , ORG had asked for supplementary information on DATE and , without waiting for it to be provided by the applicant company , had decided to declare the licences invalid on DATE .", "The applicant company also argued that ORG \u2019s decision of DATE had been adopted in serious breach of procedure because the applicant company had not been informed DATE in advance about the meeting of DATE and had not been invited to attend .", "Lastly , the applicant company argued that ORG \u2019s decision to declare its licences invalid was discriminatory since the other CARDINAL companies listed in ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE had not been subjected to such a severe measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal and found , inter alia , that it had been summoned to the hearing of DATE and that its request for adjournment could not create an obligation on the part of ORG to adjourn the hearing . Moreover , the decision of DATE was legal since the applicant company admitted to having changed its address , and according to section QUANTITY of the ANRTI Regulations a failure to request a modification of an address in a licence led to its invalidity . ORG did not refer to the applicant company \u2019s submissions about its discriminatory treatment , ORG \u2019s usual practice of requesting information about changes of address and ORG \u2019s breaching of its own decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . One of the members of the panel of ORG , Judge NORP ORG , disagreed with the opinion of the majority and wrote a dissenting opinion . He submitted , inter alia , that the first - instance court had failed to address all the submissions made by the applicant company and had illegally examined the case in its absence . Moreover , CARDINAL provision of ORG had been applied , whereas it was necessary to examine the case in a broader light and to apply all the relevant legislation . Finally , ORG \u2019s decision of DATE contravened its decision of CARDINAL DATE . Judge PERSON considered that ORG should have quashed the judgment of the first - instance court and remitted the case for a fresh re - examination .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant company transferred all of its contracts with clients to a company which was part of the same group , ORG , which had valid licences . However , the ORG - owned monopoly in telecommunications , ORG , refused to sign contracts with the latter company and made it impossible for it to continue operating .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and PERSON informed the applicant company \u2019s clients that on DATE their Internet connection would be cut off and offered them Internet services from Moldtelecom without any connection charge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Moldtelecom carried out the disconnection of the applicant company and of ORG from the Internet and all of their equipment on the Moldtelecom premises was disconnected from the power supply .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the licences of ORG were withdrawn by ORG .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the above , the applicant company and ORG were forced to close down the business and sell all of their assets . DATE , the applicant company \u2019s chairman , Mr PERSON , was arrested for peacefully demonstrating against his company \u2019s closure .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG \u2019s letter of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG imposed a fine on the applicant company for having operated for DATE without a valid licence and the ORG initiated an investigation as a result of which all the accounting documents of the applicant company were seized .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the embassies of GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , as well as ORG , ORG and ORG missions in GPE , issued a joint declaration expressing concern over the events surrounding the closure of the applicant company . The declaration stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c Alleged contraventions of registration procedures do not appear to justify a decision to put a stop to the functioning of a commercial company . ... We urge PERSON and the relevant authorities to reconsider this question . This seems all the more important in view of the commitment of the public authorities of GPE to NORP norms and values . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the ANRTI Regulations provides that in the event of non - compliance by a licence beneficiary with the conditions set out in the licence , the licence can be suspended for DATE .
