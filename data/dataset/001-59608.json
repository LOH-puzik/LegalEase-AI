The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant served a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for the theft , possession and sale of firearms . On an unspecified date in DATE he was transferred from FAC to FAC ( NORP CARDINAL-oji sustiprintojo re\u017eimo pataisos darb\u0173 kolonija ) .", "CARDINAL . From the moment when the applicant arrived in FAC he was placed in the separate segregation unit of the prison ( PERSON aukl\u0117jam\u0173j\u0173 b\u016brys \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , located in FAC of the prison ( V lokalinis sektorius ) . On DATE the applicant was released from the ORG and detained under normal conditions in LAW and later in LAW ( CARDINAL ir CARDINAL brigados ) , located in FAC of the prison ( I lokalinis sektorius ) . DATE the applicant was detained in solitary confinement ( PERSON izoliatorius ) . He was again placed in the ORG on DATE . The applicant stayed in FAC until his release on DATE following a presidential pardon .", "CARDINAL . The present case concerns the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention in FAC and his treatment there from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The evidence of the applicant was taken by ORG delegates in GPE on DATE and then in GPE on DATE . The applicant \u2019s statements may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The unit consisted of a dormitory where CARDINAL inmates were held , a small kitchen , a relaxation room and a shower cubicle . In the applicant \u2019s view , CARDINAL persons could be held in the ORG , and it was accordingly seriously overcrowded . Only the dormitory had windows . There were no windows or ventilation in the kitchen and the relaxation room . A window was installed in the kitchen during renovations in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG had a corridor leading to the small courtyard outside . The yard was closed off above with wire netting , which was covered with snow in the wintertime . As a result there was a lack of light in the courtyard during the DATE .", "CARDINAL . The toilets consisted of CARDINAL NORP - type \u201c squat \u201d holes , which lacked partitions . Inmates in the ORG used the toilets one by one in order to respect each other \u2019s privacy . There were no windows , and a ventilation system was installed in the toilets only after renovations in DATE . As a result the toilets smelled terribly .", "CARDINAL . There was no access to the prison laundry for washing private clothes ; it therefore had to be done by hand in bowls in the shower . Drying such items in the small courtyard was complicated . In addition , no private bedding was allowed . Every inmate received from the prison administration bed linen and towels , which were regularly washed in the prison laundry .", "CARDINAL . NORP The administrative officers visited the ORG only during the distribution of meals and check - ups . The prison governor used to visit the unit from time to time . Doctors went to the ORG very rarely . The only way of communicating with the outside world was by telephone . On DATE the applicant felt that he had a fever . His condition was so serious that he missed the regular check - ups at the ORG and lay in bed . He asked the guards to send for a doctor . He also used the special telephone line connecting the ORG to the prison medical service . However , no one answered , as it was lunchtime . The applicant did not telephone the medical service again . Instead , he orally asked the ORG guards for a doctor several times a day . The medical staff only arrived on DATE and confirmed that he had caught a cold . He was told to stay in bed .", "CARDINAL . No work , recreation or other meaningful activities were organised in the unit . The only reasonable activity permitted in the ORG was playing chess . The applicant conceded that there were no restrictions on watching television , reading or listening to the radio .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained in LAW and DATE located in FAC of the prison . Each of the CARDINAL wings of the prison was intended to hold CARDINAL prisoners . The prison was seriously overcrowded . There were CARDINAL detainees in CARDINAL , which consisted of CARDINAL sections \u2013 namely dormitories with adjacent toilet areas \u2013 where CARDINAL prisoners were held . A total of CARDINAL inmates were sleeping in LAW at the time of the applicant \u2019s placement there . LAW accommodated DATE inmates . In the applicant \u2019s view , a maximum of CARDINAL people could be held in LAW and CARDINAL people in LAW . The sections lacked air , especially at TIME , due to overcrowding . CARDINAL - tier bunk beds were installed in the dormitories and the windows were almost completely hidden by these beds , thus obstructing the flow of fresh air from the outside . During DATE , prisoners were allowed to circulate freely within the wing and its outside stroll yard .", "CARDINAL . Sanitary conditions were deplorable . Toilets , sinks and shower facilities were infested with germs . There were various leaks and the water pipes were very old , rusty and covered with mould . The toilets in the sections consisted of several NORP - type \u201c squat \u201d holes with no partitions between them . Toilet paper was only provided sporadically . The applicant stated that it was very difficult to keep himself clean as he was only allowed to shower once DATE on designated DATE . Showering on an unspecified DATE was penalised . Shower facilities only worked DATE , and were always overcrowded . During the summer , hot water was only available at DATE . The applicant \u2019s bedding was washed in the prison laundry . Private items such as clothes had to be washed by hand in a sink .", "CARDINAL . Food was served CARDINAL times a day . CARDINAL litai ( LTL ) per prisoner per day were allocated by the authorities for the catering in FAC . The food was always cold , and there were no facilities to heat it . Vegetables were only added to a course once DATE . Lunch was impossible to eat due to its awful taste CARDINAL times a week . Overall , food was not prepared in a sanitary manner . At times the applicant had found wood shavings , little stones and pieces of metal in his food . Supplementary food could be provided by the prison canteen only when a special diet had been recommended by a doctor . As the prison canteen was not big enough for all prisoners , catering was organised in shifts . However , the number of inmates at each shift was always greater than the number of places in the canteen . A prisoner who arrived late would be left without food . There was a prison shop where detainees could obtain additional food . The applicant acknowledged that he regularly had CARDINAL litai on his account in the prison shop . There was also a limited list of items that could be given by ORG relatives during personal visits . The applicant was permitted to receive additional food from his relatives .", "CARDINAL . Qualified doctors only visited the prison occasionally . It was therefore impossible to have permanent , professional medical assistance at the prison infirmary . The infirmary lacked medication , especially painkillers . All illnesses were treated with aspirin and paracetamol . The applicant stated that he had a heart disease . He admitted , however , that he had not undergone an appropriate cardiology test at the infirmary . The applicant also alleged that he had a knee problem due to his huge overweight . The prison administration had not performed a knee operation due to a lack of facilities . The applicant acknowledged , however , that the knee operation was not a matter of primary urgency . Once out of prison , he had not sought a knee operation due to its high cost . The applicant further stated that he had had gastritis , but the prison doctors had refused to prescribe a better diet for him in the prison canteen .", "CARDINAL . Following an order of the Minister of the ORG , from DATE , all prisoners were subjected to a \u201c standing regime \u201d . No prisoner was permitted to lie in bed from the wake - up call at TIME to lock - in at TIME , that is TIME a day . Exceptions to the order were permitted only upon recommendation by a doctor . The applicant complained that many detainees , himself in particular given his weight and heart problems , were unable to endure this regime . The prison doctors found , however , that the applicant was fit to comply with the order . Upon various complaints by the applicant and other prisoners , the Ombudsman recommended that the order be revoked . The applicant alleges that it was nevertheless maintained .", "CARDINAL . There was no work provided within the prison , and the number of meaningful activities was very limited . Weather permitting , it was possible to engage in open - air sports in the exercise yard ; however , no such possibilities existed in DATE . There were also few concerts or cinema shows . No retraining or educational programmes were organised in the prison .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant had initially complained about an interference with his right to receive visits from his relatives . During the interview with the Court delegates he admitted , however , that he had been afforded sufficient opportunities to receive visits , particularly following an intervention by the ORG further to a complaint on his part .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was placed in a solitary confinement cell of QUANTITY m where he was held with another person . There was an NORP - type toilet , a sink for washing , and a table in the middle of the room .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had a personal visit when he was given some additional food . Afterwards he was stopped in the access zone for the usual security check to establish whether he had been given any illegal items . The chief guard , P. , conducted the search , while CARDINAL other officers looked on . PERSON told the applicant to take off his clothes . When the applicant was only in his underwear , a female prison officer , J. , came into the room . P. then told the applicant to strip naked . The officer threatened him with a reprimand in case of non - compliance . The applicant submitted to the order , taking off his underwear , in the presence of PERSON was watching the check with the rest of the officers and was smoking . The applicant \u2019s body , including his testicles , was examined by the male officers . The officers wore no gloves , touching the applicant \u2019s sexual organs and then the food given to him by his relatives , without washing their hands . The applicant was also ordered to do sit - ups to establish whether he had concealed anything in his anus . No unauthorised item was found on him . He alleged that the purpose of the check had been to ridicule him in front of the woman .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the lower - ranking prison staff were very poorly qualified , had an inferiority complex , and showed their authority in a degrading manner . The administration tolerated the constant consumption of alcohol by the prison staff during TIME . Many prisoners were allegedly employed as secret informers by the administration , in return for promises of parole or conditional release . The actions of the prison staff concerning the applicant were provocative . The applicant received DATE abuse because of his firm opposition to and the criticism of the general policies of the penitentiary system in GPE , as well as his specific criticism of the conditions of detention at the prison . He gave the following examples of his alleged victimisation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s placement in the ORG in DATE had been arbitrary , as he had had no disciplinary record before DATE . Following his release from the ORG on DATE , he was detained under the normal regime and even afforded better conditions of detention . On DATE some prisoners established an association for their mutual assistance and support called ORG . The applicant was elected President of that association . On DATE the administration imposed on the applicant a disciplinary penalty , depriving him of the better detention conditions . The official ground for that penalty , imposed on the basis of information given to the administration by a secret informer , was the fact that the applicant had beaten another prisoner . The applicant denied the beating , stating that he had been present at the incident without intervening . The applicant \u2019s complaints to ORG and the ORG about the unlawfulness of the penalty were rejected as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s right to buy food at the prison shop was suspended for DATE , and on DATE he received a disciplinary warning for threatening other prisoners with force . The administration rejected his complaints against these penalties . His application against a staff member , Officer PERSON , who had allegedly initiated these penalties , was not examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was penalised for leaving the territory of FAC . He was ordered to wash the windows of LAW . The execution of this penalty was to be controlled by Officer PERSON . The applicant initially refused to wash the windows in the presence of the said member of staff and other prisoners , as this allegedly meant the manifest abuse of his right to complain about that member of staff . The applicant later washed the windows while not being observed . Officer PERSON refused to accept that the work had been done .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as the prison governor was absent , Officer PERSON ordered the applicant \u2019s solitary confinement . He was instantly conveyed to the solitary confinement cell in handcuffs . Within TIME , the prison governor returned to the prison . After hearing the applicant and certain prison officers , the prison governor decided that the applicant had not been in breach of duty on DATE and the applicant was immediately released from solitary confinement .", "CARDINAL . In his written submissions to the ORG , the applicant stated that on DATE he had been warned for still being asleep at TIME , this being TIME after the regulation wake - up call . During the meeting with ORG delegates he insisted that the officers had arrived and found him in his bed at TIME On DATE he received a further disciplinary warning for queuing beyond the privacy line while waiting to call his relatives on the telephone .", "CARDINAL . In DATE \u201c confidential sources \u201d informed the applicant that CARDINAL member of staff , PERSON , was involved in criminal activities relating to the falsification of documents . On DATE the applicant lodged a specific complaint against B. on behalf of ORG . The complaint was given to the administration in order to be transmitted to the ORG . On DATE a high - ranking member of the prison administration allegedly requested the applicant not to send the complaint , promising that B. would be dismissed , and that the applicant would be afforded better detention conditions . The applicant refused to do so and insisted on the onward transmission of the complaint . According to the applicant , PERSON was forced to leave the prison service as a result of the ORG \u2019s investigation . In DATE the applicant also filed with the ORG a complaint against another staff member , P. , for allegedly abusing his authority . The applicant claimed , in particular , that P. had deliberately provoked conflicts with the applicant and other prisoners . This complaint was dismissed as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant met the prison governor , who granted him permission to visit detainees in other wings to greet them for DATE on behalf of ORG . According to the applicant \u2019s written submissions to the ORG the permission was oral , but he also stated during the meeting with the ORG delegates that the permission had been posted in writing on the special information board . The permission was valid from DATE . On DATE the applicant tried to go from FAC to Wing CARDINAL . At a special check - point between these wings , the applicant was stopped by the guards and told that he did not have permission to enter FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as a disciplinary sanction for \u201c trespassing \u201d on DATE , the applicant was ordered to clean up the area around his bed in LAW . As FAC did not require that cleaning be done in the presence of a member of staff , he performed the work unseen . The staff member , Officer PERSON , who was to supervise the work , did not accept that the job had been done .", "CARDINAL . As a result , on DATE the applicant was punished with CARDINAL days\u2019 solitary confinement . He immediately announced a hunger strike as he considered the sanction arbitrary . On DATE the applicant wrote complaints to various ORG authorities and the media . On DATE the applicant \u2019s sister called the prison governor , who allegedly lied to her that the applicant was not on a hunger strike . On DATE the biggest NORP DATE , ORG , wrote an article on page CARDINAL , stating that the applicant was on a hunger strike . On DATE of the hunger strike , on DATE , a prosecutor arrived and advised the applicant to seek a compromise with the administration . On DATE the applicant discontinued the hunger strike . On DATE the prison governor gave an interview to a newspaper , ORG , which was printed with the title \u201c Stirring up trouble without reason \u201d . In the interview the prison governor said that the applicant was \u201c doing nothing [ to conform to the prison regime ] but lodging various complaints \u201d . According to the applicant , the prison governor thereby expressed his biased attitude towards him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL disciplinary sanctions were imposed on the applicant for the unlawful hunger strike . His access to the prison shop and the right to be given additional food during personal visits were suspended . He was also transferred to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant considered that these penalties , taken as a whole , revealed the ineffectiveness of any internal efforts to review allegations of ill - treatment . His complaints about the disciplinary penalties against him were rejected by the ORG with sole reference to the statements of the prison administration , without due regard to the actual circumstances . According to the applicant , his treatment in the prison was degrading because he had no access to an independent and impartial authority to complain about his conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . There was no information about any effective review of the general treatment of prisoners or the specific treatment of the applicant because ORG ( Pataisos darb\u0173 \u012fstaig\u0173 laikinosios taisykl\u0117s ) had not been published . The Rules defined the legal basis for the prison regime and the administration \u2019s actions . The absence of publicity of such an important legal document gave the administration the right to act arbitrarily . This document was lacking both at ORG and in prisons . In the applicant \u2019s view , every section of the prison should have had a copy of the Rules . However , CARDINAL copy of the Rules was in his prison .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant stated that the first letter addressed to him from ORG , dated DATE , was shown to him when it had already been opened . He was only allowed to write down its contents , and had to give it back to the administration . Subsequent letters from the Convention organs were opened by the administration and given to the applicant DATE after their arrival at the prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prison governor wrote a letter to the ORG , stating , inter alia :", "\u201c On DATE the prison administration received a letter by [ the applicant ] addressed to [ the ORG ] . Having acquainted myself with the contents of the letter ... I would like to set out certain considerations as to the facts alleged [ therein ] ...", "It is true that pursuant to the order of DATE of the Minister of the Interior ... it is prohibited for convicted persons to lie in bed save during TIME as specified in the schedule , if there is no special permission to do so from the administration ... , [ but ] it is not true that all convicted persons have been prevented from lying in bed during DATE , as PERSON says in the letter ... because elderly , handicapped [ prisoners ] have been afforded [ that ] opportunity ...", "[ The applicant ] alleges that some wings in the prison accommodate CARDINAL convicted persons in breach of LAW of ORG requiring that \u2018 CARDINAL persons should be held in a wing\u2019 . [ However , ] there is no practical possibility to implement the above Rule in view of the rapid increase in the number of convicted persons ( the limit is CARDINAL [ detainees ] , [ but ] on DATE there were CARDINAL ) .", "As regards the education of convicted persons ... , from DATE the administration of GPE is prepared to set up an education point for adults in the prison ...", "On DATE [ the applicant ] founded an association of mutual assistance and support , \u2018 Aim\u2019 ... We think that the establishment of this association is to be welcomed ... However , in practice , from the moment when it was set up , this association and its President , PERSON , only defended the interests ... of the \u2018 authorities\u2019 of the underworld ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the ORG dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s sister complained that the applicant had told her by telephone on DATE that he had been prohibited from pursuing correspondence with the ORG , and that his letters to the ORG dated DATE and DATE had not been sent by the prison administration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the administration sent to the Registry the applicant \u2019s letters of CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE . They also included a transcript of the administration \u2019s meeting of DATE in which the question of the applicant \u2019s correspondence with the ORG was discussed . The acting governor of the prison said in the transcript that he", "\u201c explained to [ the applicant ] that he has to apply first to certain authorities of GPE , that is : ORG , ORG , ORG , the ORG , ORG and other institutions . [ The applicant ] is familiar with this procedure ... but he categorically required that his letter to [ the ORG ] be sent ... [ The applicant ] asked me the question whether I had a right to have access to the contents of [ his ] letter ... I explained that I had such a right under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW [ stating that ] \u2018 the letters of convicted persons ( except those to a prosecutor ) that are sent or received are subject to censorship\u2019 . Given the categorical request by [ the applicant ] , [ his ] complaint shall be sent to the addressee \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG received CARDINAL more letter from the applicant , sent on DATE . According to him , this letter was not sent through the prison administration . He enclosed therewith an original of the ORG \u2019s letter of DATE as evidence that the correspondence with the ORG had been censored : on the ORG \u2019s letter was a prison stamp with the date of receipt , CARDINAL DATE , a handwritten remark of the same date by the prison governor ordering that the applicant be acquainted with the letter , and the applicant \u2019s written confirmation that he had had such access on DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the meeting with ORG delegates , the applicant also stated that in DATE he had handed to the prison administration a further letter to the ORG dated DATE . No such letter reached ORG .", "CARDINAL . The witness was the prison governor at the time of the applicant \u2019s detention there .", "CARDINAL . The witness admitted that there had been no partitions between the squat holes in the toilets until DATE . In DATE renovations were carried out , during which each toilet hole was separated by cement partitions covered with ceramic tiles .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the applicant \u2019s detention under the normal conditions in CARDINAL , each prisoner was allocated QUANTITY m in the dormitory in LAW , and QUANTITY m in the dormitory in LAW . The Prison Code ( Pataisos darb\u0173 kodeksas ) required a minimum space of QUANTITY m in sleeping areas , while a special ORG sanitary norm of DATE required CARDINAL sq . m. The witness considered that the prison had not been seriously overcrowded at the time of the applicant \u2019s detention , at least within the meaning of the domestic requirements valid until DATE . The situation improved following LAW in DATE ; while the total occupancy of the prison was CARDINAL detainees in DATE , CARDINAL prisoners were detained in DATE , the lowest level in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prisoners were provided with bed linen , which was washed and dried in the prison laundry free of charge once DATE . Once a week inmates had access to the shower . Sinks in the shower facilities could also be used to wash personal items . Each prisoner was provided free of charge with CARDINAL g of soap DATE , and was able to buy more in the shop .", "CARDINAL . Inmates could buy various products , including food and items of personal hygiene , in the prison shop CARDINAL times a month . Prices in the shop were not excessive , and were regularly reviewed by the administration in the light of regional price levels . While no cash was used in the prison shop , every inmate had an account to which resources from his family , his salary at the prison , or a financial benefit in the case of an orphan , were transferred . These accounts were debited upon a purchase at the shop .", "CARDINAL . The witness admitted that the canteen , which could normally accommodate CARDINAL prisoners at once , had been overcrowded at times . He denied , however , that any prisoner had missed a meal due to overcrowding . CARDINAL shifts were organised in the canteen to enable every prisoner to have CARDINAL meals a day . The witness had never received a complaint from any prisoner that he had been deprived of a meal because of an overcrowded canteen . The witness had not heard of any complaint about the quality of the food . He said that the prison medical service checked the quality of the food DATE and that the sanitary norms in the canteen were being met .", "CARDINAL . The witness had not received any complaint from the applicant about a lack of medical assistance in the prison . The witness also said that the prison doctor and the health authorities had confirmed that a knee operation had not been necessary during the applicant \u2019s detention . The witness had never received a complaint from the applicant that he had been supplied with a food item incompatible with the sanitary norms . Nor had the applicant complained that he had lacked a special diet in the prison or needed supplementary food to be provided free of charge .", "CARDINAL . Previously , there were no partitions between the squat holes in the toilets ; they were installed during the DATE renovations . Currently all toilets were equipped with partitions . The witness said that a special government decree of DATE required that all inmates be given toilet paper . However , the prison administration had budgetary difficulties in complying with this decree . Toilet paper had not been distributed during DATE . The prison lacked money even for the postal service . The witness considered that the lack of free toilet paper was not an essential problem in the prison , as he had heard no complaint in this connection from any prisoner . according to the witness , it had to be noted that toilet paper was always available in the prison shop at about LTL CARDINAL.CARDINAL to CARDINAL per roll . In addition , toilet paper could be given by relatives . At worst , other kinds of paper could be used , such as newspapers , which were supplied to prisoners free of charge . The witness drew a parallel between toilet paper and other items of personal hygiene , such as toothpaste and toothbrushes . While such items were not distributed free of charge , prisoners could obtain them from their relatives or the prison shop .", "CARDINAL . The prison had a wood - processing factory , but only a small proportion of prisoners worked there due to the lack of commercial orders . However , a recent government contract would permit an increase in production and create more employment for detainees . A total of CARDINAL prisoners also worked at the service department of the prison , including the laundry and the canteen . The applicant did not work during the time of his detention .", "CARDINAL . After a personal visit , a prisoner and any items he has received from his visitor must be checked in accordance with ORG . Such a check could include stripping the prisoner naked . LAW provide that only a person of the same sex may conduct a strip - search .", "CARDINAL . The witness said that he was not present at the time of the alleged event . He was informed about it by the applicant . The witness acknowledged that the female officer PERSON worked at the prison and supervised personal visits . Her functions included accompanying prisoners to and from the visitors\u2019 area and handing the prisoner over to the male officers conducting the search . The ORG was unable to interview Ms J. as she was not in the prison on DATE of the delegation \u2019s visit .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL male officers who conducted the body search were interviewed by the witness immediately following the applicant \u2019s complaint in DATE . They denied that a woman had been present . No record of the applicant \u2019s complaint or of any investigation of the incident was made .", "CARDINAL . The witness said that he did not know whether PERSON took part in the search . If the applicant was stripped naked in the presence of a woman , it was a violation of ORG . However , given PERSON functions , the witness conceded that both theoretically and practically she could have attended the search .", "CARDINAL . The witness described the procedure for disciplinary offences established under LAW . According to this system , FAC had a ORG consisting of the prison governor , his deputies and the heads of sections . The commission was in charge of examining all alleged violations of prison discipline . When a particular incident occurred or specific information about such an incident reached the administration , a senior staff member such as a head of section wrote a report on the facts and stated his opinion as to whether those facts disclosed a breach by a detainee of the provisions of LAW . The report was normally shown to the detainee , who had the right to submit observations . The detainee was informed about the contents of the report if it could not be presented to him , for example , where there were statements by anonymous witnesses concerning the incident . However , even in such exceptional cases , the prisoner had the right to know about such accusations without having access to the ORG names .", "The report and the detainee \u2019s observations were sent to ORG , which decided whether or not to impose a disciplinary penalty . It was an absolute requirement that the prisoner appeared in person before the commission prior to its reaching its decision . Witnesses who were detainees were not normally heard in person at the hearing , their evidence being included in the report in written form . However , any officer involved in the incident had to be heard in person by the commission , together with the alleged perpetrator .", "CARDINAL . It was possible to appeal against the commission \u2019s decision . Where a report on the incident had been filed by a staff member no higher in rank than a deputy governor , the prison governor could quash the penalty . Where the report had been filed by the governor himself , the detainee could appeal to the director of ORG . From there an appeal lay to the Minister of the ORG or the ORG . Although the ORG could not revoke the penalty , he could recommend that the prison authorities do so . In most cases the ORG \u2019s recommendations were followed . In general , prisoners were not prohibited from complaining to any authority concerning any aspect of their detention . However , the internal hierarchical procedure was the principal remedy for prisoners .", "CARDINAL . The procedure for complaints against staff members was similar to that for disciplinary offences . The witness was not aware of any specific complaint by the applicant against a staff member . He said however that , if the applicant had lodged any such complaint , it had been sent to the competent authority .", "CARDINAL . All detainees were familiar with LAW , which established this procedure and set out other provisions pertaining to the regime in all NORP prisons . A copy of the LAW and of FAC was in the prison library . Every detainee had unlimited access to those documents . In addition , upon the arrival of a new prisoner , a head of section must inform him of the rules , which had to be confirmed by the detainee \u2019s signature .", "CARDINAL . The witness hardly knew the applicant personally until DATE . The applicant had had no disciplinary record during the period of his placement in the prison before that . The witness had participated in the foundation meeting of ORG in DATE . He considered that the purposes of the association as stated in its statute , namely mutual assistance and support to defend ORG rights and better conditions of detention , were to be welcomed . There had been no interference by the administration with the functioning of the association . However , according to the witness , after becoming the leader of ORG , the applicant forgot that he himself was a prisoner and that he had not only rights but also obligations . He ignored lawful orders from staff and on various occasions seriously breached prison discipline .", "CARDINAL . The witness confirmed that the applicant had received CARDINAL disciplinary punishments during his time at the prison , namely on DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE . As to the nature of these punishments , the witness stated that CARDINAL of them had been minor . The deprivation of better detention conditions on DATE involved the temporary removal of the applicant \u2019s entitlement to certain socio - economic benefits , such as the right to receive additional personal visits , to make purchases in the prison shop , or to receive parcels from relatives . The disciplinary warnings of CARDINAL , DATE and DATE meant essentially remarks in the applicant \u2019s prison file . The chores ( bud\u0117jimas be eil\u0117s ) imposed on DATE and DATE were insignificant cleaning jobs . These penalties were minor , as the applicant \u2019s breaches of discipline had not been serious .", "Only the penalty of DATE , namely the applicant \u2019s solitary confinement , was to be considered serious , in the opinion of the witness . It was imposed for non - compliance with the legitimate order of a prison officer , namely the failure of the applicant on DATE to wash the area around his bed . In any event , none of those penalties humiliated the applicant , in the view of the witness , but amounted to the normal enforcement of prison discipline .", "CARDINAL . The witness asserted that good reasons had been given for each of the punishments . In every case the prison management carefully assessed the facts about alleged disciplinary breaches by the applicant and properly weighed the evidence before them . The validity of the conclusions of the prison management was confirmed by the ORG . The witness mentioned as an example the events of DATE , when it was not clear whether or not the applicant had personally performed the chore imposed on DATE . Regardless of the statements of Officer PERSON alleging that the applicant had not performed the task himself , the witness decided that the applicant should have the benefit of the doubt , and that there had been no breach of discipline . However , in another case , concerning the chore imposed on DATE , the overwhelming evidence suggested that the applicant had indeed breached discipline by ordering another detainee to perform his task . As a result the applicant was punished with solitary confinement .", "CARDINAL . The witness admitted that he had said that the applicant \u201c was doing nothing but lodging complaints \u201d in an interview published on DATE in GPE , a special newspaper on matters of crime , law and order . The witness did not consider that he had in any way humiliated the applicant by that statement . He said that he had no personal prejudice towards the applicant because of his activism amongst prisoners , his presidency of PERSON , his complaint to ORG , or any other reason . The sole basis for the measures restricting the applicant \u2019s rights was his failure to comply with prison discipline , which was applied equally to all .", "CARDINAL . The witness said that the reasonable nature of the applicant \u2019s treatment in the prison was reflected by the fact that he had expunged the applicant \u2019s disciplinary record in DATE . Thereafter they had found a common ground and cooperated in organising various cultural events in the prison . Furthermore , in view of the applicant \u2019s improved behaviour , the witness intervened on the applicant \u2019s behalf to obtain a presidential pardon , which was eventually granted . Their cooperation continued after the applicant \u2019s release , particularly regarding the organisation of cultural activities in the prison .", "DATE . The witness acknowledged that until DATE the prison administration had checked the applicant \u2019s letters to the Convention organs in accordance with FAC and LAW . The witness stated that he had never prevented the applicant from complaining to the ORG . His remarks about the exhaustion of domestic remedies were made to explain to the applicant the relevant procedural requirements , but not to hinder his right to pursue his Convention application . All letters to the ORG handed in by the applicant to the prison administration were sent , and all letters from the Convention organs were received by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The witness was a staff member and a head of section .", "CARDINAL . The witness stated that the applicant belonged to the so - called \u00e9lite of prisoners , and other inmates would normally perform jobs for him . This is why he did not think that the applicant had personally performed the chore imposed on DATE . The officer did not consider that the obligation to clean the area around his bed whilst supervised by the witness was degrading for the applicant . While the applicant had asked the witness in advance for permission to perform the task unsupervised , the applicant had not explained why he did not want to be observed or whether he considered the order degrading . The applicant \u2019s request had clearly been an attempt to get others to do the job for him . Therefore the witness did not give his permission . The applicant \u2019s subsequent refusal to perform the job in the presence of the witness amounted to a breach of duty .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the delegates visited the prison .

The sanitation area consisted of toilets and a shower . Prisoners could use the shower at any time between wake - up at TIME and lock - in at TIME The area had been tiled and partial partitions installed between the NORP - type toilets since the applicant \u2019s detention there . The partitions were waist high , CARDINAL walls , with no doors in front of them . In the applicant \u2019s time there had just been the squat holes . There was no toilet paper in sight . The sanitation area was somewhat muddy but not unduly smelly . The delegates learnt that people were paid to do the cleaning , and that prisoners were asked to clean only as a disciplinary punishment .", "CARDINAL . Food was brought from the main prison into a small kitchen CARDINAL times a day . There was a courtyard , approximately the same size as the dormitory , with grass , plants , outdoor tables and benches and some weight - lifting equipment .

Section CARDINAL had a dormitory of QUANTITY . m holding CARDINAL beds ; some were double bunk beds . The beds had metal frames and springs , standing on CARDINAL legs QUANTITY high . Each prisoner had QUANTITY . m in the dormitory . The room had windows and did not lack light or air . Several prisoners were in the dormitory during the daytime as inmates were entitled to circulate freely throughout the whole building and yard from TIME until TIME There were CARDINAL stools in the room . The delegates were told by a staff member that detainees were allowed to sit or lie on the beds during DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL had a dormitory of QUANTITY m holding CARDINAL beds placed side by side . Each prisoner was allocated approximately QUANTITY . m of space in the dormitory . There were CARDINAL large windows but the applicant nevertheless complained about the lack of ventilation . The windows were open during the delegates\u2019 visit , but the applicant said they remained shut in DATE or if someone was ill .", "CARDINAL . The toilets in both sections were located in separate areas closed off from the dormitories . There were partitioned NORP - type holes , which did not seem to be in a bad or dirty condition . There was no particular smell or lack of air in the toilets . The applicant said that the walls had been painted since his time and partitions had been installed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The general shower room allowed CARDINAL prisoners to shower at the same time ; this was not a renovated area . The installations were rusty and there was mould on the walls , but hot water was available and the area was generally functioning adequately . The room next to the showers had deep basins for prisoners to wash their own clothes . Prisoners were allowed access to the showers DATE .", "CARDINAL . The canteen consisted of CARDINAL big rooms with seating arrangements for CARDINAL people . The food was prepared in large ovens and saucepans where huge quantities of soup ( sometimes with meat ) , vegetables and porridge were cooked .

Food was dished out in metal bowls for CARDINAL people and served through CARDINAL hatches in the canteen .", "CARDINAL . The infirmary had several consultation rooms , a dentist \u2019s chair and other equipment being in CARDINAL of them . All the equipment seemed old - fashioned but functional . Since DATE there had been a doctor on duty TIME a day . The doctor on duty said that if someone had a fever he would get help from the infirmary .", "CARDINAL . The delegates next visited the solitary confinement cell in a separate building , where the applicant was detained from CARDINAL to DATE . This consisted of a narrow room in which CARDINAL people could be detained . During DATE the beds are locked up against the wall like a couchette on a train . The cell had low benches and a cupboard . It also had a separate closed toilet and washbasin . The applicant said that during his placement there the walls had not been painted , there had been no cupboard , and the bedding was taken out of the cell in the daytime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant \u2019s complaint against the disciplinary penalty of CARDINAL DATE depriving him of better conditions of detention . The ORG noted that the applicant solely contested the facts of the incident leading to the penalty , arguing that he had not beaten up another prisoner . On the basis of written observations by the prison management , the statement of an anonymous witness and the applicant \u2019s explanations , the ORG established that the applicant had participated in the beating and that the administration had duly imposed the penalty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of written observations by the prison administration and the applicant , the ORG rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant \u2019s complaints against the penalties of CARDINAL DATE . The ORG noted that the applicant solely contested the facts as established by the prison administration and had provided no plausible evidence to cast doubt on the validity of the conclusion that he had threatened other prisoners with force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG also dismissed as unfounded the applicant \u2019s complaint about the penalty of DATE . On the basis of written observations by the prison administration and the applicant , the ORG found that the applicant had trespassed into the territory of FAC without permission . According to ORG , a detainee must obtain the permission of the prison governor to visit other wings . Such a decision was valid only if it was published on the special information board . The applicant had not contested that he had had no permission to leave FAC on DATE or that he had not known of the relevant internal requirements prohibiting trespass . He was therefore justifiably ordered to perform a chore on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant \u2019s complaints against the disciplinary warnings of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE . The ORG noted that the applicant solely contested the facts as established by the prison administration and had provided no plausible evidence to cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions that he had been sleeping after the regulatory wake - up call , or that he had been queuing beyond the privacy line .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG also dismissed complaints by the applicant and another CARDINAL prisoners , PERSON and PERSON , against the penalties of CARDINAL DATE , imposing chores . By reference to written observations by the prison administration and the detainees\u2019 comments , the ORG established that the applicant , together with B. and P. , all of whom were FAC inmates , were stopped by guards when trespassing into the territory of FAC . The detainees claimed that they had oral permission from both the prison governor and other guards to go to FAC , and that the penalties had thus been arbitrary . The ORG found that no valid permission had been given to these men , and that the penalties of DATE had therefore been justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected complaints by the applicant and PERSON against the disciplinary penalties of CARDINAL DATE ordering their solitary confinement for non - compliance with the duties imposed on DATE . By reference to written observations by the prison administration and the detainees\u2019 comments , as well as the material collected on the spot by a representative of the ORG \u2019s office in DATE , the ORG established that the applicant and PERSON had been ordered to clean the areas around their own beds by Officer PERSON , in execution of the duties imposed on DATE . The ORG held that the applicant and PERSON , owing to their authority over other prisoners , could indeed have ordered other prisoners to clean up for them , thereby avoiding executing personally the penalties of CARDINAL DATE . According to the ORG , it was therefore reasonable for Officer PERSON to want to supervise the task himself . Such supervision could not amount to an unjustified interference with their honour . The Ombudsman established that the detainees had refused to perform the job under the supervision of Officer PERSON and another staff member at TIME on DATE . Some time later they informed Officer PERSON that they had nonetheless performed the task whilst alone . The ORG held that both the refusal of the detainees to perform their duties , and their subsequent statements that they had performed the jobs in the absence of staff , testified to their non - compliance with the penalty of DATE . The ORG concluded that the penalties of CARDINAL DATE had therefore been justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG examined the applicant \u2019s complaints against CARDINAL members of staff , on the basis of an on - the - spot investigation conducted by a representative of the ORG \u2019s office in DATE . In his complaints the applicant alleged that CARDINAL member of staff , PERSON , did not know the NORP language , did not have NORP citizenship , and could not work at the prison . He also alleged that a staff member , ORG , had provoked conflicts between the applicant and other prisoners . The Ombudsman held that there were no grounds to examine the complaint in so far as it concerned PERSON , who had meanwhile left the prison . The ORG established no wrongdoing or intent to provoke conflicts on the part of P. ; in this regard the ORG held that the applicant \u2019s complaints had been of a general nature , and that , during the meeting with the representative of ORG , the applicant had been unable to specify a single incident when PERSON had breached his rights .", "CARDINAL . According to the Prison Code , a prison is headed by a governor . The prison administration is responsible to ORG .
