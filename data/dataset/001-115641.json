He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON who was granted leave to represent the applicant by the President of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Rules of Court ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant became a civil servant employed by ORG ( ORG , ORG ; henceforth \u201c the GPE \u201d ) where he worked until his retirement on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Trustees of the ORG ( pankkivaltuusto , bankfullm\u00e4ktige ) introduced an equal retirement DATE for all men and women who entered the service of ORG that date or later . The retirement age for women was thereby raised from DATE to DATE while for men the retirement age remained unchanged . As the rule was not retroactive , the different retirement ages for men and women still applied to those persons who had started employment before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Trustees of the ORG ( pankkivaltuusto , bankfullm\u00e4ktige ) amended the pension rules of the ORG so that men who had joined the ORG prior to CARDINAL DATE and who continued their employment until retirement were also granted an opportunity to lower their retirement age from DATE . For DATE the retirement age was lowered , and the pension accrued prior to DATE was reduced by PERCENT . At its highest the early retirement reduction was PERCENT for DATE . Under the pension rules of CARDINAL DATE the retirement age for women who had joined the ORG prior to CARDINAL DATE was DATE and no reductions applied to pension accrual .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the pension rules of the ORG had provided that a civil servant who applied for early retirement , who had been employed by the ORG prior to CARDINAL DATE and who had DATE of service behind him , had a right to a pension guarantee ( takuuel\u00e4ke , garantipension ) which was PERCENT of the salary . This pension guarantee was increased by PERCENT for DATE the person \u2019s personal retirement age ( henkil\u00f6kohtainen el\u00e4keik\u00e4 , individuell pensions\u00e5lder ) , which was DATE for men and DATE for women , fell short of DATE ( the personal retirement age before DATE ) . This guarantee was significantly reduced as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to his retirement the applicant applied twice for a preliminary ruling from the ORG on how his pension would be calculated . His application was rejected twice by ORG ( johtokunta , direktionen ) in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted a pension , which was calculated with a PERCENT pension guarantee which included the increase of PERCENT as his personal retirement age was DATE . This method of calculation was chosen as it was more beneficial to the applicant than the method by which the pension was reduced by PERCENT , or MONEY ( ORG ) per month , on the ground that he had retired at DATE . The pension so calculated amounted to ORG DATE , starting from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant submitted a letter of appeal to the ORG , requesting that his pension be recalculated so that DATE from CARDINAL to CARDINAL brought him an additional pension of PERCENT per year , altogether PERCENT . He claimed that the amendments made to the pension guarantee on DATE had led to discrimination between men and women due to the fact that the theoretical personal retirement age for men was DATE , even if they had retired earlier , whereas for women it was always DATE . In the applicant \u2019s situation the percentage for accrued pension was PERCENT while for a woman in the same situation it would be PERCENT higher , namely PERCENT . He also complained about the fact that his pension had been reduced by PERCENT , or ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL per month , on the ground that he had retired at DATE . As the ORG could not rectify the pension decision , it referred the case on appeal to ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly accepted , partly rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . As concerned the percentage for accrued pension , the court accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal and ordered that the percentage be PERCENT instead of PERCENT . It found that in this respect the pension was not calculated in an equitable manner with regard to men and women , and that women were placed in a more favourable position than men . The applicant \u2019s personal retirement age should also have been DATE , as was the case for women in the same position . As this inequality affected also the time after DATE , the date on which the ORG rules on equal pay became applicable in respect of GPE , the applicant \u2019s pension had been calculated in a manner contrary to ORG law during the period starting from DATE until DATE . In this respect the case was referred back to the ORG for a new decision . As to the rest of the applicant \u2019s complaints , they were rejected . As concerned the reduction of PERCENT due to early retirement , the court found that as the reduction concerned the time before DATE , it was not contrary to ORG law .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the ORG issued a new pension decision to the applicant . The percentage for accrued pension was now PERCENT , increasing his personal pension guarantee percentage to PERCENT . The pension calculated in this manner amounted thus to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL per month .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant submitted an appeal to the ORG , requesting that the pension decision of DATE be recalculated as his pension guarantee still remained at PERCENT when it should have been CARDINAL.CARDINAL/CARDINAL x PERCENT = PERCENT on the ground that he had DATE of service . He noted that ORG had already , on DATE , amended a similar pension decision in the case of Mr GPE and granted him a pension right amounting to PERCENT on the ground that he had fulfilled the pension guarantee requirement as he had completed DATE of service . Moreover , the applicant complained about the amendment to ORG on DATE which introduced the reduction system in cases of early retirement . He claimed that it was discriminatory and unconstitutional and that therefore it should be declared null and void or at least left unapplied . Such practice was not in use in the ORG pension system and under LAW ( valtion el\u00e4kelaki , lagen om statens pensioner ) , which LAW were intended to follow . The applicant also pointed out that ORG had also found in this respect that the NORP system was contrary to ORG law . Finally , the applicant complained about lack of transparency in the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL .
