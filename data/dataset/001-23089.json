THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and ORG , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE , GPE .", "From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the first applicant was permitted by the NORP authorities to spend his holiday in GPE . The second applicant obtained the same permission for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . As the first applicant had to undergo surgery in GPE , the applicants did not return before the end of the authorised period . On DATE the first applicant asked ORG in GPE whether his permission to stay in GPE could be extended . He was served with a reply stating that his stay in GPE was illegal and was notified that his property would be immediately confiscated as a consequence . He was also notified that he had to file a request for permission to return to GPE . The applicants did not file a request .", "On DATE the NORP authorities made an inventory of the applicants\u2019 property . They subsequently sold all the movable items and transferred their flat owned by a co - operative , and in respect of which the applicants had a right of beneficial use , back to the co - operative . The co - operative then allocated their flat to a third person .", "On DATE the applicants brought proceedings before the GPE nad ORG seeking damages of CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL from the ORG for having deprived them of their property and for having prevented them from returning to GPE in DATE . They relied on Act No . TIME . They claimed that their property , which they assessed at CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , had been confiscated contrary to the law in force at the material time .", "On DATE the GPE nad ORG rejected the ORG claim . The court held that the applicants had lodged neither a request for an extension of their permit to stay abroad nor a request for permission to return to GPE . In its view , the NORP authorities had not proceeded contrary to the relevant law . The court concluded that there was nothing to indicate that the ORG was liable for any illegal measure .", "In DATE the applicants appealed , challenging ORG material and legal consideration of their case . On DATE the PERSON Regional Court quashed ORG judgment and remitted the case to it . The court stated that the applicants , who had stayed abroad after the expiry of their permits , had not acted illegally and that there was no causal link between their stay abroad and the fact that they had no possibility of using their property . It held that the obligation to request permission to return to GPE had prevented them from exercising their property rights . The court concluded that the national authorities had seized and disposed of the applicants\u2019 property illegally .", "On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the applicants extended their original claim for damages to CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , claiming that the inventory of their movable property had not been complete and that the value of many objects had been underestimated . On CARDINAL DATE ORG , after having assessed additional evidence including several expert reports concerning the damage incurred by the applicants , and being bound by ORG legal opinion , held that the ORG was to pay damages in the sum of CZKCARDINAL,CARDINAL to the applicants . The court rejected the remainder of their claim . It stated that there was nothing to prove that there had been any movable assets other than those which had been included in the inventory .", "On DATE ORG , upon the defendant \u2019s appeal , upheld this judgment , slightly modifying the rate of the default interest .", "On DATE ORG , upon the defendant \u2019s appeal on points of law , quashed the lower courts\u2019 judgments and remitted the case to ORG for further consideration . ORG held that the applicants\u2019 claim fell within the scope of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act which was a lex specialis compared to Act No . PERSON and to LAW provisions on liability .", "On DATE ORG , being bound by ORG judgment , rejected the applicants\u2019 action for damages in the amount of CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The court stated that the applicants should have lodged their claim under LAW .", "The applicants appealed , claiming that their flat had been allocated to a third person after the expiry of the relevant period set out in the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act ( i.e. after DATE ) and that many objects had not been included in the inventory .", "On DATE ORG upheld the first instance judgment . The court added that the applicants had wrongly lodged their claim under LAW . TIME . It ruled that the ORG could not be held liable under LAW as it had transferred the property to third persons .", "The applicants filed a request for the re - opening of the proceedings prior to the delivery of ORG judgment of DATE . They claimed that the courts , being bound by ORG decision of DATE , had failed to consider assets which had not been recorded in the inventory . On DATE ORG rejected their request as there were no facts , decisions or evidence which could not have been assessed and used in the previous proceedings in the applicants\u2019 favour .", "The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law , requesting ORG to adjudicate on whether the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act was applicable to events which had occurred after DATE . They claimed that ORG officials had acted contrary to the relevant law , and that the ORG was liable to pay damages under LAW No . TIME which , they claimed , was a lex specialis compared to the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act .", "On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal on points of law , quashed ORG judgment of DATE and ORG judgment of DATE to the extent that they concerned the extended claim of CZK CARDINAL filed by the applicants in DATE , and discontinued the proceedings in this respect . It stated that ORG in its judgment of DATE had repeatedly adjudicated on their extended claim despite the fact that the former decision had become res iudicata . The court further examined the lower courts\u2019 legal consideration of the ORG case and concluded that there had been no shortcomings . It added that the legal question of the application of the Extra - Judicial Rehabilitation Act to the applicants\u2019 property , which had been disposed of by the ORG after the relevant period ( i.e. after DATE ) , had not been the subject - matter of the proceedings . It referred in this connection to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional appeal , requesting ORG to hold that they were entitled to damages in the amount of CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected their appeal on the ground that it did not satisfy the formal requirements of LAW . It stated that the applicants had submitted a claim for damages , a matter which was outside ORG jurisdiction ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
