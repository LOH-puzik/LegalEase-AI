In DATE the first applicant began treatment at a gender identity clinic in GPE and , on a date unspecified , successfully underwent sex reassignment surgery and treatment . She changed her name by deed poll to her present name . The change of name was recorded on her passport and driving licence .", "CARDINAL . Miss GPE refers to the difficulties which she has encountered as a result of her decision to undergo gender reassignment surgery and her subsequent change of sex .", "CARDINAL . She states that she was informed by her consultant psychiatrist and her surgeon that she was required to obtain a divorce as a precondition to surgery being carried out . Following the divorce , the applicant \u2019s former spouse applied to the court to have her contact with her daughter terminated .

The applicant has not seen her daughter since then , a period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Although her new name has been entered on her passport and driving licence , her birth certificate and various records including social- security and police records continue to record her original name and gender .

On DATE and CARDINAL DATE Miss GPE attended court to stand surety in the sum of QUANTITY for a friend . On both occasions she was required , to her great embarrassment , to disclose to the court her previous name .

Following comments of police officers indicating that they were aware that the applicant had undergone a sex - change operation , the applicant sought to discover whether these personal details were held on police computer files . She discovered that the official request for information made under the provisions of LAW DATE required her to state her sex and other names . She did not pursue the enquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant entered into an insurance contract in respect of her car . The form which she was required to fill in as the basis of the contract required her to state her sex . Since she continues under GPE law to be regarded as male she was obliged to give her sex as male .", "She also notes that she is obliged under LAW DATE to disclose her former sexual identity in certain contexts under pain of criminal sanction .", "CARDINAL .

She is a pilot by profession . She states that she was dismissed by her employers in DATE as a direct consequence of her gender reassignment and has found it impossible to obtain employment in the respondent ORG in her chosen profession .

She has been living in the GPE since DATE and acquired GPE citizenship by naturalisation in DATE .", "The second applicant was registered at birth as being of the male sex .

On DATE Miss ORG obtained an order from ORG that she be issued a birth certificate by ORG in GPE recording her new name and the fact that she was of the female sex .

On DATE the second applicant requested that her original birth certificate in GPE be amended to record her sex as female . By letter dated DATE , ORG ) replied that there was no provision under GPE law for any new information to be inscribed on her original birth certificate .", "CARDINAL . Miss ORG states that she is forced to live in exile because of the legal situation in GPE . She has a male partner whom she plans to marry . She states that they would like to lead their married life in GPE but has been informed by the ORG by letter dated CARDINAL DATE that as a matter of LANGUAGE law , if she were to be held to be domiciled in GPE , she would be precluded from contracting a valid marriage whether that marriage \u201c took place in the GPE or elsewhere \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

Such names are valid for purposes of identification and may be used in passports , driving licences , medical and insurance cards , etc . The new names are also entered on the electoral roll .", "CARDINAL . Under LANGUAGE law , marriage is defined as the voluntary union between a man and a woman . In the case of PERSON v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] Probate Reports CARDINAL ) , Mr Justice PERSON ruled that sex for that purpose is to be determined by the application of chromosomal , gonadal and genital tests where these are congruent and without regard to any surgical intervention . This use of biological criteria to determine sex was approved by ORG in NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] ORG ) and given more general application , the court holding that a person born male had been correctly convicted under a statute penalising men who live on the earnings of prostitution , notwithstanding the fact that the accused had undergone gender reassignment therapy .", "Under section CARDINAL(b ) of LAW DATE any marriage where the parties are not respectively male and female is void . The test applied as to the sex of the partners to a marriage is that laid down in the above - mentioned case of PERSON v. PERSON . According to that same decision a marriage between a male - to - female transsexual and a man might also be avoided on the basis that the transsexual was incapable of consummating the marriage in the context of ordinary and complete sexual intercourse ( obiter per Mr Justice PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . Registration of births is governed by ORG \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that LAW requires that the birth of every child be registered by ORG for the area in which the child is born . An entry is regarded as a record of the facts at the time of birth . A birth certificate accordingly constitutes a document revealing not current identity but historical facts .", "CARDINAL . The sex of the child must be entered on the birth certificate . The criteria for determining the sex of a child at birth are not defined in the LAW . The practice of the Registrar is to use exclusively the biological criteria ( chromosomal , gonadal and genital ) as laid down by Mr Justice PERSON in the above - mentioned case of PERSON v. PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The DATE LAW provides for the correction by the Registrar of clerical errors or factual errors . The official position is that an amendment may only be made if the error occurred when the birth was registered . The fact that it may become evident later in a person \u2019s life that his or her \u201c psychological \u201d sex is in conflict with the biological criteria is not considered to imply that the initial entry at birth was a factual error . Only in cases where the apparent and genital sex of a child was wrongly identified or where the biological criteria were not congruent can a change in the initial entry be made . It is necessary for that purpose to adduce medical evidence that the initial entry was incorrect . No error is accepted to exist in the birth entry of a person who undergoes medical and surgical treatment to enable that person to assume the role of the opposite sex .", "CARDINAL . The Government point out that the use of a birth certificate for identification purposes is discouraged by ORG , and for DATE birth certificates have contained a warning that they are not evidence of the identity of the person presenting it . However , it is a matter for individuals whether to follow this recommendation .", "CARDINAL . A transsexual continues to be recorded for social security , national insurance and employment purposes as being of the sex recorded at birth . A male - to - female transsexual will accordingly only be entitled to a ORG pension at the ORG retirement DATE and not DATE which is applicable to women .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , in the case of PERSON and ORG , ORG ( ECJ ) held that discrimination arising from gender reassignment constituted discrimination on grounds of sex and accordingly LAW of DATE on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment , vocational training and promotion and working conditions precluded dismissal of a transsexual for a reason related to a gender reassignment . The ECJ held , rejecting the argument of ORG that the employer would also have dismissed PERSON if PERSON had previously been a woman and had undergone an operation to become a man , that", "\u201c ... Where a person is dismissed on the ground that he or she intends to undergo or has undergone gender reassignment , he or she is treated unfavourably by comparison with persons of the sex to which he or she was deemed to belong before undergoing gender reassignment .", "To tolerate such discrimination would be tantamount , as regards such a person , to a failure to respect the dignity and freedom to which he or she is entitled and which the ORG has a duty to safeguard . \u201d ( paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . The ruling of the ECJ was applied by ORG in a decision handed down on DATE ( ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Industrial Law Reports ) .", "CARDINAL . In their written observations on the legal recognition of transsexuals in comparative law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG suggested that over DATE there has been an unmistakably clear trend in the member ORG towards giving full legal recognition to gender reassignment . According to the study carried out by ORG , the majority of member GPE now make provision for such recognition . For example , out of CARDINAL countries analysed , CARDINAL ( including GPE ) do not permit a change to be made to a person \u2019s birth certificate in CARDINAL form or another to reflect the re - assigned sex of that person ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["12", "14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
