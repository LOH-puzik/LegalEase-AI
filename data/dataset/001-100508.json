The GPE of GPE ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) owned a number of properties which were unsuitable for normal housing use . The properties formed part of the \u201c short life \u201d property of GPE , meaning that they were scheduled for demolition , redevelopment or works . Following aggressive squatting , which exacerbated the poor condition of the properties , and an increase in responsibilities on local housing authorities to provide shelter for homeless people , PERSON began to consider a scheme under which housing associations would take over short life property and find and manage tenants until the property was required by GPE for demolition or redevelopment . In around DATE , PERSON began informally licensing short life property to the GPE and ORG ( \u201c LQHT \u201d ) , a charitable housing trust , in order that the latter could provide temporary accommodation for homeless people to whom GPE owed a statutory duty to arrange accommodation . However , some of the short life property could not be made suitable for use by homeless families and so , in a separate arrangement in DATE , PERSON began to pass properties to LQHT and other bodies to use as housing for those to whom no statutory duty was owed and who would not generally be allocated housing by GPE . This was called the \u201c singles scheme \u201d . The applicants were all provided with housing under the singles scheme .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , LQHT had an informal arrangement with GPE which covered the properties occupied by the applicants . This arrangement was replaced by a licence in DATE , reflecting the previous arrangement and terminable on DATE notice . In DATE , the licence arrangement was replaced by individual DATE leases of each property granted to LOC GPE . The leases were subject to a break clause allowing either party to terminate the leases early on DATE notice . CARDINAL purpose of the grant of the individual head leases was to allow LQHT to replace its licences to the applicants with assured shorthold tenancies , which would prevent them from acquiring security of tenure under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . In fact , few of the applicants agreed to enter into assured shorthold tenancies with LQHT .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , GPE gave notice to terminate the head leases to LQHT .

At paragraph CARDINAL , Lord Hope set out the test to be applied :", "\u201c ... Subject to what I say below , I would hold that a defence which does not challenge the law under which the possession order is sought as being incompatible with the article CARDINAL but is based only on the occupier 's personal circumstances should be struck out ... Where domestic law provides for personal circumstances to be taken into account , as in a case where the statutory test is whether it would be reasonable to make a possession order , then a fair opportunity must be given for the arguments in favour of the occupier to be presented . But if the requirements of the law have been established and the right to recover possession is unqualified , the only situations in which it would be open to the court to refrain from proceeding to summary judgment and making the possession order are these : ( a ) if a seriously arguable point is raised that the law which enables the court to make the possession order is incompatible with article CARDINAL [ \u201c gateway ( a ) \u201d ] , the county court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under LAW DATE should deal with the argument in CARDINAL or other of CARDINAL ways : ( i ) by giving effect to the law , so far as it is possible for it do so under LAW , in a way that is compatible with article CARDINAL , or ( ii ) by adjourning the proceedings to enable the compatibility issue to be dealt with in ORG ; ( b ) if the defendant wishes to challenge the decision of a public authority to recover possession as an improper exercise of its powers at common law on the ground that it was a decision that no reasonable person would consider justifiable [ \u201c gateway ( b ) \u201d ] , he should be permitted to do this provided again that the point is seriously arguable ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Discussing the implications of the ORG 's judgment in ORG on the decision of ORG in PERSON , he later added ( at paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c There may , however , be cases like ORG where the incompatibility with the article LAW right lies in primary legislation which the county court is being asked to apply to the case by the public authority ... In such a case it would be open to ORG to make a declaration of incompatibility , if it was not possible to read or give effect to the legislation under LAW DATE in a way which was compatible with the Convention right . But the legislation would nevertheless still have to be enforced , unless the decision of the public authority to seek to enforce it when faced with that incompatibility could be said , when judicially reviewed , to be arbitrary , unreasonable or disproportionate . The decision could not be held in the county court to be an unlawful act within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act : see section CARDINAL ) . The fact that the question of incompatibility that was raised in PERSON was not capable , under the domestic system , of being dealt with effectively in the county court because of the limits on its jurisdiction reinforces , rather than detracts from , the proposition that a defence which is raised in that court under article CARDINAL should be struck out unless the legislation can be read and given effect in a way that is compatible or it raises an issue as to its incompatibility that ought to be considered in ORG .", "The appellants ' right to continue in occupation of LOC over which they never had any rights granted to them by the landowner was brought to an end by the operation of law when PERSON gave notice terminating the leases to LQHT . They have no right to remain there indefinitely , which would be the effect of denying to LOC its unqualified right to possession of the LOC on the ground that to give effect to this right would be incompatible with article CARDINAL . Their interests will be sufficiently protected by the fulfilment of the formal requirements for the eviction , which demand proof by the public authority landowner of its entitlement to obtain an order for possession in the exercise of its property rights . I would dismiss this appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , also for the majority , expressed the following view ( at paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c As to ' procedural safeguards ' , each of the [ appellants ] filed a pleading setting out the basis on which his LAW defence , as well as his domestic law defence , was based . The article CARDINAL defences were given due judicial consideration but were struck out as being incapable of constituting a defence to GPE 's possession claim . Whatever ' procedural safeguards ' are requisite , they can not bar a court from ruling in a particular case that the pleaded facts and matters relied on are not capable of outweighing in the balance the contractual and/or proprietary right to possession of the owner of the property in question . If the home occupier thinks the judge 's ruling to be in error , the ruling can ... be reviewed on appeal , or on an application for permission to appeal .", "...", "... The possession orders sought by GPE engage the article CARDINAL right to respect for the home of the respective occupiers from whom possession was sought . But an order for possession was in accordance with domestic law . As against LOC the occupiers had become trespassers with no right to remain in occupation . There was nothing discriminatory or unusual about the statutory and common law framework that produced that result nor about the absence of any statutory protection given to the occupiers by the housing legislation . I respectfully agree with my noble and learned friend Lord PERSON of PERSON 's remarks in para CARDINAL of his opinion that the balance required by article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) to be struck was struck by the general law , that the public authority owner had a right to manage and control its property within the bounds set by statute , that the occupier acquired only a limited right to occupy and that on due determination of that right , a claim by the owner must ordinarily succeed . The appellants ... could not resist PERSON 's possession applications on LAW grounds unless either they mounted an article CARDINAL attack on the legal framework that entitled GPE to possession or they attacked on LAW grounds LOC 's decision to seek possession . The first attack was not attempted , and , if it had been , would in my opinion have been bound to fail . There is nothing the matter , from an article CARDINAL standpoint , with a common law rule which gives the owner of property , which is occupied as a home by a person who has no right as against the owner to remain there , the right to recover possession of the property . ORG 's omission to provide any statutory security of tenure for home occupiers in the position in which the [ appellants ] found themselves is well within the wide margin of appreciation referred to in Blecic .", "As to the decision of LOC to seek possession of the properties occupied by the [ appellants ] , I agree with and adopt the conclusion expressed by Lord PERSON in para CARDINAL of his opinion . No facts have been pleaded or alleged by the appellants which outweigh the right and the duty of GPE to manage its housing stock . The wide margin of appreciation referred to in GPE must be accorded to GPE .", "The article CARDINAL defences were struck out by Judge PERSON . They were in my opinion rightly struck out . If a defendant does not plead or allege sufficient facts which , if made good , could constitute a defence , the defence can be struck out . On the facts pleaded and alleged in the article CARDINAL defences the defences could not have succeeded .", "Nor , in my opinion , where a home occupier has no contractual or proprietary right to remain in possession as against the owner of the property , could an article CARDINAL defence based on no more than the personal circumstances of the occupier and his family ever succeed . ORG is no authority to the contrary . The successful article CARDINAL defence in ORG was founded on a combination of Mr ORG inability to enjoy the security of tenure advantages afforded by statute to occupiers of privately owned caravan sites and on the GPE court 's perception ( which I think was an unjustified perception ) of a lack of sufficient procedural safeguards enabling him to dispute the grounds which had led the council to terminate his site licence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON agreed with the majority , noting ( at paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ... as I understand it , some of your Lordships would go further and accept that there may be highly exceptional cases in which the occupier could argue that his individual personal circumstances made the application of the general law disproportionate in his case . When , if at all , should the court be able to say that , even though there is no obligation to continue to provide housing in these circumstances , it is not ' necessary in a NORP society ' to permit the landowner to assert its property rights ?", "My ORG , I myself do not think that the purpose of article CARDINAL was to oblige a social landlord to continue to supply housing to a person who has no right in domestic law to continue to be supplied with that housing , assuming that the general balance struck by domestic law was not amenable to attack and that the authority 's decision to invoke that law was not open to judicial review on conventional grounds . It should not be forgotten that in an appropriate case , the range of considerations which any public authority should take into account in deciding whether to invoke its powers can be very wide : see eg R v ORG and ORG , ORG , GPE and GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL Admin LR CARDINAL , R ( PERSON and others ) v ORG [ DATE ] FAC ( Admin ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She concluded ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c Each of the cases before us is a classic example of CARDINAL in which a defence based upon article CARDINAL would have no real prospect of success ... In the LOC cases , the occupiers had undoubtedly established homes in the dwellings but they had done so on terms which made them vulnerable , like many sub - tenants , to the superior claims of the landowner . PERSON 's attempts to evict them were in accordance with the law and in pursuit of the legitimate aim of regaining control over this short life housing stock . All the [ appellants ] were offered alternative accommodation . It would take a very different case from that pleaded to give their claims to remain in the particular dwellings occupied a real prospect of success . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON of PERSON - under - Heywood ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) was of the following view :", "\u201c For my part I would accept that the recent GPE jurisprudence requires some qualification to be placed on the PERSON principle ; I can not , however , agree that it requires , as the minority in PERSON suggested , the consideration ( even if usually only the most cursory consideration ) of an article CARDINAL defence every time it is raised . My opinion is rather , and at this stage I state it very broadly , that although article CARDINAL is clearly engaged in every home repossession case , its requirements are satisfied provided only and always , first , that the substantive domestic law under which the order is sought strikes an acceptable balance between the competing needs and rights at stake and , secondly , that that law is properly applied by the domestic court with the occupier being given a fair opportunity to invoke any defence available to him under it . If either of those CARDINAL conditions is not satisfied then , I accept , a complaint would properly sound under article CARDINAL . But , as I shall seek to show , it by no means follows that article CARDINAL provides the occupier in such cases with a freestanding defence independent of whatever rights he may have under domestic law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded ( at paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c Of course , where the domestic law requires the court to make a judgment ( most notably perhaps in those cases ... where repossession can only be ordered if the court considers it reasonable ) , or to exercise a discretion , the judge will bear in mind that he is performing this task in the context of the defendant 's article CARDINAL right to respect for his home . But where under domestic law the owner 's right to possession is plainly made out ... , the judge in my opinion has no option but to assume that our domestic law properly strikes the necessary balances between competing interests ( as envisaged in paras CARDINAL and CARDINAL of my noble and learned friend Lord PERSON 's judgment ) and that in applying it properly he is accordingly discharging his duty under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ... Where no statutory protection is afforded to occupiers that should be assumed to be ORG 's will : sometimes that will be clearly evident from the terms of the governing legislation ... ; even , however , where the owner 's rights arise at common law , the absence of statutory protection must surely be , as my noble and learned friend Lord Hope suggests , the result of a deliberate decision by ORG to leave the owner 's right to recover possession in these cases unqualified . As Lord PERSON observes at para DATE , it is not unrealistic to regard the general law as striking the required balance .", "CARDINAL of the difficulties I have with the appellants ' contended for application of article CARDINAL in these cases is in understanding what sort of ' highly exceptional circumstances ' ( Lord PERSON 's expression at paras CARDINAL and DATE ) could possibly entitle the county court judge to disregard a clear provision of domestic law so as to deprive the owner ... of his apparently clear entitlement to possession ; another is in understanding what are supposed to be the parties ' respective rights and interests in the LOC once the judge has felt obliged under article CARDINAL to set aside the dictates of domestic law .", "...", "I too , therefore , would dismiss both these appeals but I would do so for a reason more fundamental than that suggested by certain others of your Lordships . These appellants ' defences must fail , not because they disclose no sufficient ( highly exceptional ) personal merit but because they depend upon establishing a freestanding LAW right to remain in possession incompatible with the respective claimants ' clear entitlement to possession under domestic property law . I would hold that no such freestanding right exists . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the availability of a defence based on conventional judicial review grounds , Lord PERSON added ( at CARDINAL to CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c There is , however , a quite different basis upon which an occupier could challenge a public authority 's claim for possession , namely on the conventional public law ground that the decision to bring the claim was itself so unreasonable as to be unlawful . Such a defence can clearly be advanced in the county court ...", "The difficulty with such a defence , however , is that it would be well nigh impossible to make good , the challenge necessarily postulating that under domestic property law the claimant authority was entitled to possession . Accordingly the argument could only be that no reasonable public authority could properly invoke that domestic law right . This would be a more stringent test than would apply were the court , as the appellants assert , under a primary duty to reach its own judgment on the justifiability of making a possession order .", "..", "It is difficult to suppose , however , that a defence based on a public law challenge of this character to a public authority 's decision to pursue its domestic law rights could properly succeed except in such an infinitely rare case as ORG itself . Manifestly it could not have succeeded in either of the present cases which doubtless explains why defences of this particular character were not advanced . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The minority ( Lords GPE of PERSON , PERSON of GPE and ORG ) considered that occupiers should be able to plead Article CARDINAL as a defence in possession proceedings , although such a defence would only be successful in highly exceptional cases . Lord GPE ( at paragraph DATE ) described the minority approach as follows :", "\u201c The practical position , in future , in possession proceedings can be briefly summarised as follows . ( CARDINAL ) It is not necessary for a local authority to plead or prove in every case that domestic law complies with LAW Courts should proceed on the assumption that domestic law strikes a fair balance and is compatible with LAW . ( CARDINAL ) If the court , following its usual procedures , is satisfied that the domestic law requirements for making a possession order have been met the court should make a possession order unless the occupier shows that , highly exceptionally , he has a seriously arguable case on CARDINAL of CARDINAL grounds . ( CARDINAL ) The CARDINAL grounds are : ( a ) that the law which requires the court to make a possession order despite the occupier 's personal circumstances is Convention - incompatible ; and ( b ) that , having regard to the occupier 's personal circumstances , the local authority 's exercise of its power to seek a possession order is an unlawful act within the meaning of section CARDINAL . ( CARDINAL ) Deciding whether the defendant has a seriously arguable case on CARDINAL or both of these grounds will not call for a fullblown trial . This question should be decided summarily , on the basis of an affidavit or of the defendant 's defence , suitably particularised , or in whatever other summary way the court considers appropriate . The procedural aim of the court must be to decide this question as expeditiously as is consistent with the defendant having a fair opportunity to present his case on this question . ( CARDINAL ) If the court considers the defence sought to be raised on CARDINAL or both of these grounds is not seriously arguable the court should proceed to make a possession order . ( CARDINAL ) Where a seriously arguable issue on CARDINAL of these grounds is raised , the court should itself decide this issue , subject to this : where an issue arises on the application of section CARDINAL [ of LAW DATE ] the judge should consider whether it may be appropriate to refer the proceedings to the High Court \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As for the disposal of the appeal , however , he considered that on the facts of the present case the matter need not be remitted to the county court , concluding ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The question then arises whether these cases should , even after this lapse of time , be remitted to the county court for consideration whether eviction is necessary in a NORP society , as that expression has been defined in the GPE jurisprudence . I would favour that course if there appeared any reasonable prospect of the court deciding that it was not necessary . But it is clear that under domestic property law the appellants have no right to occupy their respective LOC , of which the local authority has an unqualified right to possession . The appellants fall outside the categories to which ORG has extended a measure of protection . The local authority has no duty to accommodate the appellants , but has a power and duty to manage its housing stock . The appellants have not pleaded or alleged facts which give them a special claim to remain . I am satisfied that if these cases were remitted , possession orders would necessarily be made ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG handed down its decision in PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL shortly after the ORG 's judgment in ORG v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE . The ORG affirmed PERSON and sought to clarify the position set out in that judgment , in light of the ORG 's decision in GPE . Lord PERSON ( at paragraphs CARDINAL to DATE and DATE ) provided , in particular , the following clarifications of the \u201c gateways \u201d available for defendants to challenge possession orders , as explained in PERSON :", "\u201c As I said earlier , the speeches in PERSON show that the route indicated by [ gateway ( b ) ] is limited to what is conveniently described as conventional judicial review . In para CARDINAL , for example , Lord PERSON indicated that he had in mind a challenge in accordance with ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL on grounds which , he said , had nothing to do with LAW DATE . In para CARDINAL Lord PERSON too acknowledged that this was a quite different basis from that which the LAW provides upon which a public authority 's claim for possession could be challenged . In para CARDINAL of my own speech I described this as a challenge that would be made at common law , on the ground that the decision was one that no reasonable person would consider justifiable . In para CARDINAL I said that the grounds on which the decision to claim possession could be judicially reviewed were whether it was arbitrary , unreasonable or disproportionate .", "ORG ( b ) then asserts that in possession cases brought by a public authority a defence which takes the form of a challenge to its decision to seek possession may be available . The court is not bound to make the order if the decision to seek it can be challenged on the ground that it was an improper exercise of the respondent 's powers . In this respect the CARDINAL routes , or ' gateways ' , may be said to work together to address the incompatibility due to the lack of a procedural safeguard , which is the fundamental point that is at issue in this case . FAC ( a ) addresses the question whether the court can read and give effect to the statutes in a way that is compatible with article CARDINAL . If it can not do this , it will be open to the defendant by way of a defence to argue under gateway ( b ) that the order should not be made unless the court is satisfied , upon reviewing the respondent 's decision to seek a possession order on the grounds that it gave and bearing in mind that it was doing what the legislation authorised , that the decision to do this was in the ORG sense not unreasonable . This route offers a procedural protection under the common law . If taken , it will enable the grounds on which the respondent based its decision to be scrutinised . It might , on the facts of this case , provide the appellant with an effective defence to the making of the possession order . The fact that it is available as a defence seems to me to strengthen the argument , should it be needed , that it also provides him with the protection which he seeks against an infringement of his Convention right .", "...", "I think that in this situation it would be unduly formalistic to confine the review strictly to traditional ORG grounds . The considerations that can be brought into account in this case are wider . An examination of the question whether the respondent 's decision was reasonable , having regard to the aim which it was pursuing and to the length of time that the appellant and his family have resided on the site , would be appropriate . But the requisite scrutiny would not involve the judge substituting his own judgment for that of the local authority . In my opinion the test of reasonableness should be , as I said in para CARDINAL of PERSON , whether the decision to recover possession was one which no reasonable person would consider justifiable \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Clarifying the difference between the minority and minority approaches in PERSON , he said ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c As I said in para CARDINAL of my opinion in PERSON , and again at the outset of para CARDINAL , a defence to a possession order which does not challenge the law under which it is sought but is based only on the personal circumstances of the occupier should be struck out . The personal interests safeguarded by article CARDINAL must be taken to have been sufficiently safeguarded by the fulfilment of the requirements for the recovery of possession by the landowner laid down by the statute or by the common law . That is the basic law that was established in PERSON and it is the point on which the majority in PERSON differed from the minority : see ground ( CARDINAL)(b ) in para CARDINAL of Lord PERSON 's opinion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON also considered the minority view in PERSON , as set out by Lord PERSON , and compared it to Lord Hope 's test in PERSON , concluding ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c ... The only proposition which is in any respect inconsistent with the majority opinions is proposition CARDINAL(b ) and the inconsistency there is slight though important . Proposition CARDINAL(a ) covers the same ground as Lord PERSON 's paragraph CARDINAL gateway ( a ) . But proposition CARDINAL(b ) attributes to the occupier 's personal circumstances a central importance that the majority opinions did not accept . The view of the majority , as expressed by Lord Hope in his gateway ( b ) , was , as I have explained , that a local authority 's decision to recover possession would be open to challenge on public law grounds and that the challenge could be raised as a defence in the possession proceedings . The personal circumstances of the defendant might well be a factor to which , along with the other factors relevant to its decision , a responsible and reasonable local authority would need to have regard . The question for the court would be whether the local authority 's decision to recover possession of the property in question was so unreasonable and disproportionate as to be unlawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He disagreed with a passage in the decision of ORG in the case under consideration , noting ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c ... the sentence ' Under gateway ( b ) the council 's action was open to challenge on conventional judicial review grounds , but not on the grounds that it was contrary to LAW suggests a disharmony between ' conventional judicial review grounds ' on the one hand and LAW other hand that I do not accept . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an addendum prepared following the release of the ORG 's judgment in GPE , Lord PERSON emphasised ( at DATE ) that :", "\u201c ... Local authorities , being public authorities , are obliged by section DATE ) of LAW DATE to act in accordance with the Convention rights incorporated by the LAW into domestic law . They are obliged when deciding to terminate tenancies and recover possession of residential properties to act consistently with article CARDINAL . If a decision , for example to serve a notice to quit , is inconsistent with the article CARDINAL rights of the person on whom it is served the decision would be unlawful and the notice to quit devoid of effect . Lord PERSON 's paragraph CARDINAL establishes that a point of that sort can be raised as a defence to the possession proceedings . Such a defence would , if raised , be dealt with by a county court judge as part of the possession proceedings ...", "... An article CARDINAL defence requires the judge to review the lawfulness of the local authority ' 's decision could be shown to be outside the range of reasonable decisions that a responsible local authority could take , having regard both to the circumstances of the defendant as well as to all the other relevant circumstances , the decision would be held to be unlawful as a matter of public law . But in a case in which it is not reasonably arguable on the face of the pleadings , or from the contents of the affidavits that have been filed , that that is so , the judge can be expected to make a summary order for possession . The adjective ' summary ' in this context does not mean that the judge would not have considered the proportionality of the requested possession order . It means that the article CARDINAL case put forward by the defendant for a conclusion that a possession order would be disproportionate is not , in the opinion of the judge , capable of being sustained by serious argument . The notion that a defence based on an article CARDINAL right to respect for a home requires the case to proceed to a full trial even though it is apparent that the defence can not succeed is clearly absurd . An application for a summary judgment does require the defendant 's contention that a possession order would be disproportionate to be given proper attention and , if reasonably arguable , to be permitted to proceed to a full trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lords Walker and PERSON both drew attention to the fact that the majority in PERSON had drawn an important distinction between human rights and traditional judicial review challenges . Lord PERSON noted ( at paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c ... As CARDINAL of the minority in PERSON , I must accept the decision of the majority , which distinguishes between grounds of judicial review which are based on the ORG [ LAW ] and grounds ( ' common law ' or ' conventional ' grounds ) which are not based on the ORG . The minority accepted the view of Lord PERSON of GPE ... that article CARDINAL might , highly exceptionally , provide a tenant or licensee with additional protection . Lord Hope , in the leading speech for the majority , disagreed ( para CARDINAL ) . So did Lord PERSON ( para CARDINAL ) , ORG ( paras CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and ( most emphatically ) PERSON ( paras CARDINAL ) .", "... I think that I may properly express unease and indeed incomprehension at the suggestion , which is at least implicit in this part of the decision , that ORG grounds and traditional judicial review grounds can always be separately identified . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON observed ( at CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c ... ORG ( b ) , as expressed in paragraph CARDINAL in PERSON was , as I see it , phrased so as to exclude any direct application of the Convention rights or of ORG test of proportionality , and to confine attention to common law grounds for judicial review , informed though they may increasingly be by ideas of fundamental rights : see also per ORG of GPE at paragraph CARDINAL and Lord PERSON of ORG - under - Heywood at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL , and contrast the approach of the minority as set out in paragraph CARDINAL of Lord GPE of PERSON 's speech in PERSON .", "The general distinction which thus emerges is recognised and described in R ( PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ... per Lord PERSON ( para . CARDINAL ) and Lord PERSON of ORG ( para . CARDINAL , recognising though regretting the distinction ) and in R ( ORG ) v. Secretary of ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ... paragraphs CARDINAL to DATE , where ORG , giving the judgment of ORG , said that any abandonment of the common law 's ORG unreasonableness test for a proportionality test was a step which could only be taken by this ORG . Other potential differences between conventional ( or ' domestic ' ) judicial review were discussed in R ( ORG ) v. Governors of ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ... ( see in particular per Lord PERSON at para . DATE ) and ORG v. Miss ORG [ DATE ] UKHL CARDINAL ...", "The difference in approach between the grounds of conventional or domestic judicial review and review for compatibility with Human Rights Convention rights should not however be exaggerated and can be seen to have narrowed , with ' the \u201c ORG \u201d test ... moving closer to proportionality [ so that ] in some cases it is not possible to see any daylight between the CARDINAL tests ' ( ORG , para . CARDINAL , citing an extra - judicial lecture by Lord PERSON ) ... Even so , as the subsequent history of ex p . PERSON demonstrates , the result may not always achieve the degree of protection for Convention rights which ORG requires : PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL . So there remains room in another case to reconsider how far conventional or domestic judicial review and Convention review can be further assimilated , and in particular whether proportionality has a role in conventional judicial review . This was not , however , argued on the present appeal , and , in common I understand with the majority of your Lordships , I do not consider that it is appropriate to embark on such a review on this appeal .", "On this basis , in circumstances such as those in PERSON , the only question under gateway ( b ) as expressed in PERSON is whether the public authority 's decision can be challenged on domestic judicial review grounds , in particular as having been based on material misconceptions or improper considerations or as unreasonable , either in the PERSON sense or in a more relaxed sense which takes full account of the basic interest which any occupant has in his or her home . In other words , in circumstances such as those in PERSON , a full Convention review is not , at least nominally , possible on the majority view taken in PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON concluded ( at paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c However , I for my part regret that it has not been possible on this appeal to agree to modify gateway ( b ) in paragraph CARDINAL more generally , so as to allow express regard to be had to Human Rights Convention principles in relation to any defence raised against a public authority under the rule in ORG v. ORG , whether in circumstances such as those in PERSON , ORG , PERSON and PERSON or in circumstances such as the present . In DATE of his speech my noble and learned friend Lord Hope mentions the need to take account of any judgment of ORG and to give practical recognition to the principles that it lays down , and states that this can be done in the present circumstances by to some extent modifying the reasoning of the majority in PERSON . At the same time , he rejects the suggestion that the ORG should depart from the majority view in PERSON in favour of the minority , believing that this would create very real practical problems : paragraphs CARDINAL .", "For my part , I am not persuaded that any significant problems would or need arise , as Convention - compliant statutory schemes are developed and public authorities become accustomed to tailoring their performance of their duties to Convention values . In a large number of cases , ORG already tackle sensitive issues of reasonableness , as well as issues regarding breach of conditions of occupancy , when deciding whether to make or suspend possession orders ; The limited modification that my noble and learned friend Lord Hope would make to gateway ( b ) of paragraph CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) would add to such cases a further category in which review on traditional ORG grounds was relaxed to become a more straightforward examination of reasonableness . If ORG can handle such issues in possession claims , there is no reason to doubt their ability to tackle , robustly and with due despatch , the largely parallel issues which would arise from any direct application of the Convention principles in cases of challenges to public authority decisions to seek possession . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has recently considered the application of the gateway ( b ) defence in CARDINAL cases : PERSON v ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ; PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ; and ORG v. PERSON and others [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL . In PERSON , considering the effect of the ruling in PERSON , Lord Justice PERSON stated ( at DATE ) :", "\u201c First , there is no formulaic or formalistic restriction of the factors which may be relied upon by the licensee in support of an argument that the council 's decision to serve a notice to quit , and seek a possession order , was one which no reasonable council would have taken . Such factors are not automatically irrelevant simply because they may include the licensee 's personal circumstances , such as length of time of occupation . In PERSON , where the family had been in occupation for a substantial time without causing any trouble , but the council wanted to use the site in a different way , it might also be thought relevant whether the council had taken any steps to offer the family , or help them to acquire , alternative accommodation .", "Secondly , the question whether the council 's decision was one which no reasonable person would have made is to be decided by applying public law principles as they have been developed at common law , and not through the lens of the Convention .", "...", "Having said that the question whether the council 's decision was unreasonable has to be decided by applying public law principles as they have been developed at common law , it is to be remembered that those principles are not frozen . Even before the enactment of the ORG , our public law principles were being influenced by Convention ways of thinking . Since its enactment , the process has gathered momentum . It is now a well recognised fact that the ORG is influencing the shape and development of our domestic public law principles , whether one uses the metaphors of embedding , weaving into the fabric , osmosis or alignment . ( See the judgment of Lord PERSON in PERSON at para CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG in PERSON v. ORG reiterated ORG interpretation of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in ORG v. PERSON , Lord Justice PERSON noted , at paragraphs CARDINAL , as follows :", "\u201c But it is important to keep in mind that in PERSON the court was concerned with a traveller and his eviction from a caravan site ; the circumstances were thus similar to those being considered in PERSON but are far removed from the circumstances of the instant cases , which are very close to those which existed in PERSON . I emphasise that point because although it can be said that PERSON encourages the view that the personal circumstances of PERSON may not be irrelevant in considering a local authority 's decision to serve a notice to quit , it will be necessary to go back to PERSON and consider PERSON 's impact on PERSON where the circumstances are as in PERSON and as they are in the instant cases . PERSON would however suggest that in conducting a review of the council 's decision PERSON has held that something wider than the ORG rationality test was appropriate . In PERSON ( it is right to say ) despite similarities with the circumstances in PERSON , unlike ORG in PERSON , the court of appeal found that there was no purpose in remitting the matter because it was not arguable that the council acting reasonably could have come to any different decision .", "In PERSON the court was concerned with the termination of a tenancy by a local authority on the grounds of anti - social behaviour . The court held it was ' an unusual case ' and that PERSON had a seriously arguable public law defence based on it being arguable ( i ) that a reasonable council would after service of the notice to quit have made further investigations as to whether there was further anti - social behaviour and ( ii ) that there had been a failure by the local authority to make those further investigations . The circumstances of PERSON are far removed from the instant cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL things are not in dispute which I emphasise at the outset . The decision of a public authority can be made the subject of judicial review and in the context of possession claims in the county court , the correct forum for that review , if an arguable point is raised , is the county court itself . Second even if in PERSON intended gateway ( b ) to be confined to what I might term a ' rationality ' challenge , in his speech in PERSON intended to extend to some extent the scope of judicial review beyond rationality even if not as far as a straightforward challenge by reference to the convention . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON set out the position as follows ( at paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c An authority such as the council in the instant appeals may make a decision on the facts as known to it to send a letter seeking possession . Prima facie it has no obligation to find out what the true facts are and the burden is going to be on the occupier to demonstrate any grounds relied on as providing an LAW . If the occupier informs the public authority of relevant circumstances , the public authority will have to take a further decision as to whether to commence proceedings . If no letter is received and the facts are only divulged just prior to the hearing , the public authority in reality has to take a further decision as to whether to proceed . Indeed if the revelation is only during the hearing , the council in deciding to continue to press for an order takes yet a further decision . I do not see why if any one of these decisions could be shown to be ' unreasonable ' whatever that means ( and I will come back to that ) , it could not be attacked .", "If that is an appropriate analysis , because the county court is seized of the matter , it will be able to see whether there is an arguable case that in deciding even with the revelation of further facts to continue to seek possession is unreasonable . If ' reasonableness ' connotes something wider than rationality , that will be very close in reality to the court itself examining a defence based on LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded ( at CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The law gives an owner of land the right to obtain possession against a trespasser . But the owner , if the occupier has his home on the land in question , can not obtain possession other than through proceedings in court . The court has to satisfy itself as to the owner 's rights but can in making an order for possession pay regard to the personal circumstances of the occupier . Statute circumscribes the court 's powers in certain cases ... and in others does not do so . In cases such as the present and PERSON , the court simply has a discretion whether to suspend the order for possession for a short period .", "It follows that I would accept that the question whether a decision of a public authority is ' reasonable ' post - Doherty goes beyond the question whether it is rational . I would also accept that a public authority should take account of the personal circumstances of the occupier known to it , but it does not follow from this that there will ever be circumstances in which it will be unreasonable to seek possession against trespassers in situations similar to those in PERSON . Those situations may make it unreasonable not to allow a period of time to bring the possession order sought into effect but that is something which the court oversees and which the law allows for .", "...", "Ought we to remit in this case ? In my view it would , just as in PERSON , not be appropriate to do so . To echo the words of Lord PERSON in PERSON , it is clear that under domestic property law the appellants have no right to occupy their respective premises , of which the council has an unqualified right of possession . The appellants fall outside the categories to which ORG has provided protection . The council has no duty to accommodate the appellants and has a duty to manage its assets . The appellants have put in a draft pleading before us , but it does not allege any facts which provide some special claim to remain . If the matter were remitted the court would be bound to make an order for possession , although it would be entitled to take account of the personal circumstances in considering the time at which the order would be effective . That latter is something we could do without remission . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In Associated Provincial Picture Houses v Wednesbury Corporation [ DATE ] CARDINAL KB CARDINAL , Greene MR noted as follows :", "\u201c It is true the discretion must be exercised reasonably . Now what does that mean ? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology commonly used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word ' unreasonable ' in a rather comprehensive sense . It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description of the things that must not be done . For instance , a person entrusted with a discretion must , so to speak , direct himself properly in law . He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider . He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider . If he does not obey those rules , he may truly be said , and often is said , to be acting ' unreasonably ' . Similarly , there may be something so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority .", "...", "... the task of the court is not to decide what it thinks is reasonable , but to decide whether what is prima facie within the power of the local authority is a condition which no reasonable authority , acting within the CARDINAL corners of their jurisdiction , could have decided to impose ...", "... The court is entitled to investigate the action of the local authority with a view to seeing whether they have taken into account matters which they ought not to take into account , or , conversely , have refused to take into account or neglected to take into account matters which they ought to take into account . Once that question is answered in favour of the local authority , it may be still possible to say that , although the local authority have kept within the CARDINAL corners of the matters which they ought to consider , they have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it . In such a case , again , I think the court can interfere . The power of the court to interfere in each case is not as an appellate authority to override a decision of the local authority , but as a judicial authority which is concerned , and concerned only , to see whether the local authority have contravened the law by acting in excess of the powers which ORG has confided in them . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
