The applicant is a limited liability company with its seat in GPE . On DATE it applied to ORG , \u2018 ORG ) for GPE , GPE and ORG for a licence to set up and operate a television transmitter in the GPE area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . It referred to LAW DATE guaranteeing the independence of broadcasting ( GPE \u00fcber die GPE der ORG , ' LAW ) , which provides that broadcasting shall be authorised by federal legislation and noted that such legislation had only been enacted in respect of ORG ( \u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk , \u2018 the ORF\u2019 ) and within the field of regional radio broadcasting . However , no legislation had been adopted in respect of regional television . It followed that the authorisation could not be granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Bundesministerium f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliche ORG ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG ) . Referring to the judgment by ORG in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , the applicant argued that the ORG 's decision was in breach of its right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by LAW . In particular , it submitted that LAW , if interpreted in a way compatible with LAW , allowed everyone to broadcast freely unless restrictions were laid down by law . As no law regulating private television broadcasting had been enacted , the refusal of an authorisation to set up and operate a television transmitter lacked a legal basis . Alternatively , if one followed the approach of ORG judgment of DATE , namely that any broadcasting had to be explicitly authorised by federal legislation , the current legal situation was unconstitutional as the legislator had failed to enact legislation except for the ORG and private regional radio broadcasting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint . Confirming its decision of DATE , it repeated that , according to LAW , broadcasting had to be authorised by federal legislation . So far federal legislation had been enacted for radio and television broadcasting by the ORG and for terrestrial broadcasting of regional radio programs . ORG ( PERSON ) contained the legal basis for passive and , following ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , also active cable broadcasting of radio and television programs as of CARDINAL DATE . However , no legislation had been enacted for terrestrial broadcasting of television programs , apart from the legislation referring to the ORG . As a result of this legal situation other broadcasters than the ORG were not allowed to organise terrestrial television broadcasting .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court observed that , in the present case , this licensing system was directly prescribed by constitutional law and therefore not subject to review by ORG . Moreover , the unlawfulness of terrestrial broadcasting of television programs by private broadcasters originated from the legislator 's failure to enact the corresponding implementing legislation . Since this failure was comprehensive and did not only refer to specific areas or questions , ORG had no power to review the constitutionality of the legislator 's failure to enact the implementing legislation . Only ORG was competent to find in a legally binding way whether or not the impossibility of terrestrial television broadcasting by stations other than the ORG was in breach of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG ) of CARDINAL DATE the \" right to set up and operate telecommunications installations is vested exclusively in the federal authorities ( GPE ) \" ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . The latter may however confer on natural or legal persons the power to exercise that right in respect of specific installations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . No licence is required in certain circumstances , including the setting up of an installation within the confines of a private property ( section CARDINAL ) .", "The Telecommunications Law of DATE was annulled by LAW ( section CARDINAL in conjunction with section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) with effect of DATE . According to section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW , the DATE Telecommunications Law continued to apply to requests for setting up and operating telecommunications installations which were made before its entry into force .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW provides that radio signals must be retransmitted in full to users immediately after being picked up .", "Under section CARDINALa of the Ordinance , in the amended version in force since DATE ( Official Gazette - Bundesgesetzblatt - no . CARDINAL ) the bearers of a licence to operate a shared aerial may , without having to seek further permission , send text via the cable network , using their own equipment ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . By means of this type of teletext it is possible , inter alia , to impart information to the members of a community or the population of a region in the form of alphanumeric symbols , other graphical signs or pages of teletext .

According to LAW", "\" ...", "CARDINAL . Broadcasting shall be governed by more detailed rules to be set out in a federal law . Such a law must inter alia contain provisions guaranteeing the objectivity and impartiality of reporting , the diversity of opinions , balanced programming and the independence of persons and bodies responsible for carrying out the duties defined in paragraph CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Broadcasting within the meaning of paragraph CARDINAL shall be a public service . \u201c", "CARDINAL . The Law of DATE on ORG ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber die LOC die ORG PERSON ) established ORG with the status of an autonomous public - law corporation .", "It is under a duty to provide comprehensive news coverage of major political , economic , cultural and sporting events ; to this end , it has to broadcast , in compliance with the requirements of objectivity and diversity of views , in particular current affairs , news reports , commentaries and critical opinions ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) ) , and to do so via CARDINAL television channels and CARDINAL radio stations , CARDINAL of which must be a regional station ( section CARDINAL ) .

It is composed of CARDINAL independent members , including CARDINAL judges , appointed for terms of DATE by the President of the Republic on the proposal of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG held that the freedom to set up and operate radio and television broadcasting stations was subject to the powers accorded to the legislature under paragraph CARDINAL in fine and paragraph CARDINAL of LAW . LAW had instituted a system which made all activity of this type subject to the grant of a licence by the federal legislature . This system was intended to ensure objectivity and diversity of opinions , and would be ineffective if it were possible for everybody to obtain the requisite authorisation . As matters stood , the right to broadcast was restricted to the ORG , as no implementing legislation had been enacted in addition to the law governing that organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that LAW of DATE did not cover \u201c passive \u201d broadcasting via cable , in other words the broadcasting in their entirety by cable of programmes picked up by an aerial . Consequently , the mere fact that such programmes originated from a foreign station and were directed principally or exclusively at an NORP audience could not constitute grounds for refusing the licence necessary for this type of operation .", "CARDINAL . The Regional Broadcasting Law of DATE ( ORG - gesetz ) , which came into force on DATE , governs the licensing of local and regional terrestrial radio stations .", "It provides for the allocation of CARDINAL regional radio licence for each of the ORG and of CARDINAL such licences for GPE and for the allocation of local radio licences as required by local demand ( section CARDINAL ) . Any programme has to comply with the principles of objectivity and diversity of opinions ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG set aside with effect from DATE , a passage in the second sentence of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG and its section CARDINALa , i.e. the rules limiting cable distribution to the retransmission of programmes produced by others ( \" passive cable broadcasting \" ) and the transmission of text , on the ground that it was contrary to LAW . In that connection ORG referred explicitly to the judgment given by ORG DATE in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( loc . cit . ) . Since DATE the transmission via cable of original programmes ( \" active cable broadcasting \" ) has accordingly been legal , just as passive cable broadcasting already was .", "CARDINAL .
