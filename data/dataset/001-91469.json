Referring to the evidence obtained during the investigations , ORG found that the applicant was strongly suspected of CARDINAL counts of fraud and of CARDINAL counts of breach of trust . Furthermore , it found that the applicant had fled to or was hiding in GPE within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "On the basis of that warrant , the applicant was arrested in his habitual residence in GPE on DATE .", "On DATE he was extradited to GPE and remanded in custody .", "On DATE the NORP authorities presented the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE to the applicant .", "On DATE ORG issued a new arrest warrant adapted to the recent results of the investigations charging the applicant with , inter alia , CARDINAL counts of fraud . That arrest warrant was not executed . It was issued with a view to gaining the approval of ORG for the applicant \u2019s extradition in respect of further charges against him which had not been the object of the initial warrant of CARDINAL DATE .", "Accordingly , on DATE ORG requested ORG to approve the applicant \u2019s extradition also concerning the further charges specified in the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s case files were sent to ORG with a view to seeking a decision on an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention .", "On DATE ORG upheld the arrest warrant of DATE . Based on the investigations and in particular on documentary evidence and on evidence given by the co - suspected and several witnesses , the court held that the applicant was under strong suspicion of having committed fraud in numerous cases . It found that there was now a risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . In particular , he was charged with serious offences and risked not only incurring a lengthy prison sentence but also losing his licence to practise as a lawyer . Furthermore there was a strong incentive to abscond as he had good connections with GPE and NORP states and an excellent command of LANGUAGE .", "The court also pointed out that the detention had been proportionate , as the instant proceedings , which concerned large - scale fraud , were extraordinarily complex . Given the constant new findings of the investigation authorities it was necessary to investigate a further CARDINAL cases of possible fraud . Thus , the investigations required , amongst other elements , the hearing of numerous witnesses , who were in fact heard without any delays . It was also necessary to evaluate the computers , CD - ROMs , discs and numerous other documents seized in GPE , GPE and the LOC . Furthermore , the investigation authorities had requested the authorities of several states for legal assistance to obtain further documents . CARDINAL of those very time - consuming procedures was still pending .", "On DATE the ORG remanded the applicant in custody for a further period , holding that the strong suspicion and a risk that he would abscond persisted . His very good command of LANGUAGE and his close connections with the GPE and the LOC provided him with the realistic opportunity to move to one of these countries with his family and to evade the proceedings . Furthermore the possible consequences for the exercise of his profession gave a strong incitement to abscond which could not be countered by any alternative measures such as conditions or guarantees .", "It also pointed out that the proceedings had been conducted with the required diligence , given that since DATE numerous witnesses had had to be identified and heard ( also abroad ) , that ORG had been asked for legal assistance on DATE , that on DATE the investigating authorities had received a report concerning data seized on the NORP island of GPE and that the co - suspected had had to be reheard several times .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against ORG decision with ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint as being unfounded . It confirmed ORG findings that the applicant \u2019s bonds with non - NORP countries and the legal consequences of his conviction had been sufficient to justify the risk of his absconding . Furthermore the Court of Appeal did not violate the applicant \u2019s right to expeditious proceedings as guaranteed by LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the LAW of ORG ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . ORG had convincingly held that the investigations had been extraordinarily complex given the existence of LAW files with CARDINAL pages and CARDINAL files of related files and the necessity to ask several states for legal assistance .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) submitted its final report as to the investigations .", "On DATE ORG upheld the arrest warrant . Referring to the reasons stated in its previous decisions and taking account of the new evidence obtained , it held that the applicant was still strongly suspected of numerous counts of fraud . In view of his personal contacts to the GPE and the LOC and given that it was very likely that he had further funds of MONEY , the danger of his absconding persisted .", "It also found that the exceptional circumstances in the instant case warranted a further extension of the applicant \u2019s detention given in particular the extraordinary complexity of the investigations , the high number of aggrieved parties and the extensive evidence seized .", "It further observed that since DATE the investigating authorities had received substantial documentary evidence in LANGUAGE , translations of which had been prepared DATE . Furthermore the authorities commissioned a further expert report on data received in DATE , heard numerous further witnesses and reheard both co - suspects . The evidence obtained gave constantly new leads for enquiries . Therefore it was impossible to speed up the taking of evidence . For the same reasons the employment of further staff could not have contributed to a faster termination of the investigations . In these circumstances the authorities had complied with the obligation to conduct the proceedings speedily .", "Finally , it pointed out that following the submission of the final report of ORG , the prosecution would now proceed with the elaboration of the indictment concerning the charges covered by the first extradition request as there had still been no reaction from ORG concerning the request for legal assistance .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG complaining that the continuation of his detention was disproportionate , that the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE was based on wrong information and that he had been discriminated against on grounds of his domicile in GPE when compared to the co - defendants .", "On DATE ORG severed the investigations in so far as they were not covered by the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE . In so far as they were covered by the warrant , the prosecution filed a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts of fraud . The reasons for the applicant \u2019s indictment were set out on CARDINAL pages .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . As to the alleged discrimination , it declared the complaint inadmissible as the applicant had failed to substantiate his allegation . As to the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention , the court found that ORG had convincingly held already , on DATE , that the applicant had been strongly suspected of numerous counts of fraud . Furthermore , the latter court comprehensively argued that the special conditions for continued detention as required by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) had been fulfilled . In this connection , it was unobjectionable that ORG had referred to the extraordinary complexity of the case , the high number of victims involved and the amount of documents to be examined . Furthermore , after DATE a substantial number of new evidence had to be taken . Finally , ORG was bound by the findings of ORG that it had been impossible to time the taking of evidence in a more concentrated way and that the investigations could not have been finished earlier if more staff members had dealt with the applicant \u2019s case .", "On DATE ORG , without stating further reasons , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint about the length of his detention .", "On DATE the ORG replaced the arrest warrant of DATE with a new warrant , which took into account the recent results of investigations . Referring to the evidence obtained during the investigation it found that the applicant was strongly suspected of CARDINAL counts of fraud . Under the given circumstances and with regard to the heavy sentence which might be imposed , there was a persistent risk that he would abscond . Furthermore , it decided to open the trial against the applicant and other persons .", "On DATE ORG again ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request for review of his detention order ( Haftpr\u00fcfung ) ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , with ORG .", "On DATE ORG upheld the arrest warrant , arguing that the strong suspicion and the risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding would persist .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , and on DATE it rejected his objection ( Gegenvorstellung ) .", "DATE and DATE ORG held CARDINAL hearings , during which the applicant , represented by CARDINAL counsel , lodged numerous requests to obtain further evidence . With CARDINAL decisions altogether ORG rejected these requests as being irrelevant or unnecessary .", "On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL offences of fraud and sentenced him to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment . ORG set out the reasons for the applicant \u2019s conviction on CARDINAL pages . In establishing the relevant facts , ORG had regard to documentary evidence , to the confessions of the CARDINAL co - accused , the statements of numerous other witnesses and the applicant \u2019s own statements . The court considered the length of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention a mitigating factor .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant on points of law .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG in which he complained about the refusal of his numerous requests to obtain further evidence .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit his constitutional complaint without giving any further reasons .", "LAW of LAW ) and LAW provide as follows :", "\u201c Every person shall have the right to life and physical integrity . Freedom of the person shall be inviolable . These rights may be interfered with only pursuant to a law . \u201d", "According to the NORP ORG well - established case - law , pre - trial detention is only permissible under exceptional circumstances , having special regard to the presumption of innocence . The domestic authorities constantly have to weigh the public interest in criminal prosecution against the individual \u2019s right to liberty . The length of the detention has to be proportionate to the likely penalty , if the individual is convicted . Furthermore , the prosecution authorities and criminal courts are required to expedite proceedings by taking all feasible steps swiftly to terminate the investigations and to reach a judicial decision . In case of an avoidable delay in the criminal proceedings , continued pre - trial detention can generally not be justified ( see , most recently , the decision of ORG dated DATE , no .
