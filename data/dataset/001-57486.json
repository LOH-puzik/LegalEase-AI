She appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE .", "The President of ORG sought the opinion of CARDINAL of the permanent medical experts attached to ORG , a gynaecologist practising at GPE , who examined the patient and gave her the opportunity to comment . After consulting CARDINAL other doctors ( a gynaecologist and CARDINAL general practitioners , including Mrs. ORG \u2019s ) , the expert concluded on DATE that , gynaecologically speaking , she had been fit for work since DATE ; however , he felt it necessary also to consult an orthopaedic specialist .", "On DATE , another permanent medical expert , an orthopaedic surgeon , examined the applicant and offered her the opportunity to comment . He also sought the views of the CARDINAL practitioners mentioned above .

They are subject to approval by the Minister for ORG and Employment on the basis of their representative character . The Minister may also decide of his own motion to set up such an association ; in that event , he determines and amends their articles of association as needed and he appoints , suspends and dismisses the members of their governing boards .

Unless ORG declares the appeal inadmissible or unfounded , the normal procedure applies . The parties then have the opportunity of studying the case - file on the premises of ORG at a time determined by the clerk or of receiving copies . The President may however decide , in the mental or physical interest of the appellant , that he or she shall not have access to the medical reports but shall be informed of their contents and may designate a competent person , such as his or her private practitioner or lawyer , to inspect them on the LOC ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) in conjunction with LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "ORG gives its ruling after written pleadings have been filed and oral submissions heard .", "CARDINAL .
