{"ITEMID": "001-83544", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "HEIMANN v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who lives in PERSON .", "The applicant is a practising lawyer and member of ORG ( Rechtsanwaltskammer ) . His professional letterhead used to refer to him as a \u201c specialised lawyer in labour and criminal law \u201d ( GPE f\u00fcr GPE ) and \u201c specialist in traffic law \u201d ( \u201c Verkehrsrechtsspezialist \u201d ) . In a footnote annexed to the latter reference , the applicant stated that he was a certified graduate of a specialisation course run by ORG ( PERSON ) . On a complaint from a fellow lawyer , ORG requested the applicant to refrain from using the term \u201c specialist in traffic law \u201d . When the applicant refused , ORG brought a claim against the applicant under LAW ( see Relevant domestic law and practice part , below ) .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to refrain from using the term \u201c specialist in traffic law \u201d on his letterhead failing which he would be liable to a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) . It found that the term \u201c specialist in traffic law \u201d amounted to unfair and misleading advertising within the meaning of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . ORG noted that NORP law provided for different categories of specialisation . A lawyer could refer on his professional letterhead to a \u201c main focus of interest \u201d if he or she had gathered particular knowledge in a particular field of law . A lawyer could refer to a \u201c main focus of practice \u201d if he or she had extensively worked in a particular field of law for DATE . Moreover , a lawyer could be granted the right to call himself or herself a \u201c specialised lawyer \u201d ( GPE ) if he had special expertise and experience in a particular field of law , which required inter alia participation in special training courses with exams and DATE of practice with a minimum number of relevant cases . ORG stressed that a lawyer had to overcome high hurdles before being granted the right to call himself or herself a \u201c specialised lawyer \u201d . From the perspective of an ordinary client , the term \u201c specialist \u201d would suggest an even higher degree of specialisation than a \u201c specialised lawyer \u201d . This would however be a mistake in view of the high requirements to obtain the right to refer to oneself as a \u201c specialised lawyer \u201d . If a lawyer were to refer to himself or herself as \u201c specialist \u201d , he or she would therefore mislead ordinary clients by creating an erroneous impression . This would lead to a competitive advantage as against those lawyers who complied with the hierarchy of specialisation as provided for by NORP law .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . It referred to the reasoning of ORG and found that mere participation on a course on traffic law was not sufficient to justify the reference as a \u201c specialist in traffic law \u201d . The applicant had failed to demonstrate that he had worked on an above - average number of cases . He had submitted a list of cases without any indication that these cases required particular knowledge of traffic law . The list was therefore not apt to demonstrate that the applicant indeed specialised in traffic law . The applicant bore the burden of proof in this respect .", "On DATE , ORG refused , without giving any reasons , to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint because it was inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Relevant provisions of LAW ( PERSON gegen den unlauteren PERSON ) :", "\u201c Any person who , in the course of business activity and for purposes of competition , commits acts contrary to honest practices may be enjoined from performing those acts and held liable for damages . \u201d", "\u201c Any person who , in the course of business activity and for purposes of competition , makes misleading statements concerning business matters , in particular concerning the nature , the origin , or the manner of manufacture , or the pricing of individual goods or commercial services or of the offer as a whole , concerning price lists , the manner or the source of acquisition of goods , concerning the possession of awards , concerning the occasion or purpose of sale , or concerning the size of the available stock , may be enjoined from making such statements . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to LAW for ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) , a lawyer may refer in his professional letterhead to a \u201c main focus of interest \u201d ( ORG - schwerpunkt ) if he or she has gathered particular knowledge in a particular field of law through studies , publications or former professional work . If the lawyer has extensively worked in a particular field of law for DATE , he or she may refer to that field as a \u201c main focus of practice \u201d ( PERSON ) . Moreover , if a lawyer has special expertise and experience in a particular field of law , he or she may be granted the right to call himself or herself a \u201c specialised lawyer \u201d ( GPE ) by the Bar to which he or she belongs ( Section CARDINALc of LAW , GPE ) . According to LAW ) , such special expertise and experience requires inter alia participation in special training courses with exams and DATE of practice with a minimum number of relevant cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG found in a different case that the decision of ORG for ORG ( Anwaltsgerichtshof ) not to permit a lawyer in GPE to use the term \u201c specialist in traffic law \u201d in his letterhead violated that lawyer \u2019s freedom to choose an occupation ( PERSON ) under LAW ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ORG , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . In that case , the lawyer had been working in the field of traffic law in several practical and theoretical functions for DATE and wanted to refer to that expertise in his letter head . ORG took the view that it was doubtful whether the Rules for ORG sufficiently satisfied the interests of both lawyers and their clients . The sequence of \u201c main focus of interest \u201d , \u201c main focus of practice \u201d and \u201c specialised lawyer \u201d could be justified in fields of law that recognised \u201c specialised lawyers \u201d . The term \u201c specialised lawyer in traffic law \u201d did however not exist under NORP law and could consequently not be confused with the term \u201c specialist in traffic law \u201d . The danger of misleading clients would therefore exist only if the lawyer was not in fact a specialist in the general meaning of the word ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
