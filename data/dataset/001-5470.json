{"ITEMID": "001-5470", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NOR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "THUNES v. NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and resident at Fyllingsdalen . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , Attorney , Office of the Attorney ORG ) , as Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant and W were arrested on suspicion of having handled QUANTITY of salmon stolen by J. ( on DATE ) . On DATE the police searched the premises of the company owned by the applicant and PERSON and detained them on remand . They both confessed to the offence on DATE and DATE respectively . The applicant also confessed to having been in possession of narcotic tablets . Both suspects were then released .", "When the applicant was later convicted , it was established that he had supplied the narcotics to J. The latter had requested the drugs to calm him down before committing the theft which the applicant had instigated and planned . The applicant did not appeal against this part of ORG judgment .", "On DATE J. was convicted of the theft committed on DATE .", "In the meantime , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the police interrogated the applicant as a suspect with respect to certain offences related , inter alia , to the book - keeping of his and PERSON \u2019s company . The applicant confessed to these offences on DATE . PERSON had made a confession earlier on CARDINAL DATE . In DATE and DATE the police heard CARDINAL further persons and obtained additional material from ORG ( fylkesskattekontoret ) .", "On DATE the police interrogated the applicant as a suspect in relation to an illegal sale of alcoholic beverages carried out by H. On being further interrogated on DATE , the applicant also confessed to this offence . PERSON was apparently suspected of a different transaction concerning alcoholic beverages and it appears that he also confessed .", "H. was convicted of the illegal sale of alcoholic beverages committed at DATE or at DATE .", "On DATE ORG sent the case - files of the applicant and PERSON to ORG with an apology for the fact that no action had been taken for DATE due to a backlog of pending investigations and the priority given to other cases . ORG replied on DATE that the delay in question was unacceptable .", "On DATE the applicant and PERSON were formally charged and summoned to appear before ORG ( forh\u00f8rsrett ) . After a hearing on DATE , the latter concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to determine the charges since the applicant \u2019s confession had not been without reservation . Under the particular procedure applying to summary proceedings before this court , an unreserved confession was a prerequisite for its jurisdiction .", "On DATE the applicant and PERSON were summoned to appear before ORG ( byrett ) which heard the case from CARDINAL toCARDINAL DATE . The applicant pleaded guilty to the charges except for those related to the evasion of value added tax ( ORG ) and book keeping . By judgment of DATE , ORG acquitted the defendants of the charge concerning negligent book - keeping but convicted them of having handled stolen goods , of having been in possession of narcotic tablets , of having made use of and sold the alcoholic beverages illegally sold to them , and of having attempted to avoid paying ORG on their company 's transactions .", "ORG rejected the GPE argument that LAW had been violated on account of the length of the proceedings . It observed that the period to be taken into consideration , which started with the GPE arrest in DATE and ended with the judgment in the instant case , amounted to DATE . Under any circumstances , the delay was too short to run counter to this provision . It was therefore not necessary to consider further the period of inactivity in question . However , in sentencing , the court held that considerable weight ( \u201c vesentlig vekt \u201d ) must be attached to the fact that the case had become old and that the accused could not be blamed for this . The time element must - the court reasoned - have caused prejudice to the defendants and the imposition of a sentence so long after the commission of the crime would be particularly burdensome , given their work and/or social situation . ORG sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , of which DATE were suspended with CARDINAL years\u2019 probation . ( PERSON was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , of which DATE were suspended with CARDINAL years\u2019 probation . )", "Both the prosecution and the defence appealed to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) . The applicant appealed against the conviction on the VAT offence , invoking an error of law , and against the sentence , pleading that he was not guilty as described in the indictment . On DATE , after a hearing , ORG upheld the earlier conviction , having found aggravated circumstances relating to the ORG conviction . ORG rejected the defence \u2019s allegation of a violation of LAW , subscribing to ORG reasoning and conclusions , and referring to ORG case - law , notably the DATE decision mentioned CARDINAL paragraphs below . ORG , whilst recalling the aggravated nature of the ORG conviction , decided nevertheless , in view of the time element , not to increase the sentences imposed by ORG .", "The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE ORG of ORG ( kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) refused the applicant leave to appeal against the sentence imposed . As regards the alleged violation of LAW , the ORG noted that ORG had taken the length of the proceedings into account in sentencing .", "In a decision of DATE concerning , inter alia , the issue of sentencing in another case , ORG rejected a claim by a convicted appellant that the requirement of an effective remedy under LAW had not been met where the duration of the proceedings had been taken into account in sentencing . It did not accept his view that LAW required the court to decide whether the LAW had been violated . In the view of ORG , it would be sufficient if it appeared from the reasoning that the convicted person \u2019s submissions regarding the length of proceedings had been considered and had been taken into account in sentencing . The NORP rules on sentencing were so flexible that it would always be possible to have due regard to delays in the proceedings . Even for the most serious offence , it was possible to impose a suspended sentence or conditionally to postpone the issue of sentencing . In sentencing it was also possible to have regard to delays which were not serious enough to violate LAW . The distinction between relatively modest and very serious delays could not be defined precisely . For sentencing it was not important where exactly the limit was drawn . Normally , the matter would be considered as a whole on the basis of a variety of factors . Opinions would differ as to where to draw the limit . It was therefore of little interest , and even superfluous , to attempt to draw such limits when it did not affect the outcome ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
