The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Bad PERSON ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . At about the age of DATE or CARDINAL the applicant began to be aware of his sexual orientation . While other boys were attracted by women , he realised that he was emotionally and sexually attracted by men , in particular by men who are older than himself . At DATE he was sure of his homosexuality .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that he lives in a rural area where homosexuality is still taboo . He suffers from the fact that he can not live his homosexuality openly and - until he reached DATE - could not enter into any fulfilling sexual relationship with an adult partner for fear of exposing that person to criminal prosecution under LAW ) , of being obliged to testify as a witness on the most intimate aspects of his private life and of being stigmatised by society should his sexual orientation become known .", "CARDINAL . Any sexual acts with persons DATE are punishable under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , in the version in force at the material time , read as follows :", "\u201c A male person who after attaining DATE fornicates with a person of the same sex who has attained DATE but not DATE shall be sentenced to imprisonment for DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This provision was aimed at consensual homosexual acts , as any sexual act of adults with persons DATE are punishable under LAW if the adult abuses a position of authority ( parent , employer , teacher , doctor , etc . ) . Any sexual acts involving the use of force or threats are punishable as rape , pursuant to LAW , or sexual coercion pursuant to LAW . Consensual heterosexual or lesbian acts between adults and persons DATE are not punishable .", "CARDINAL . Offences under LAW were regularly prosecuted , an average of QUANTITY criminal proceedings being opened per year , out of which a third resulted in a conviction . As regards the penalties applied , a term of imprisonment usually exceeding DATE was imposed in PERCENT of the cases , of which PERCENT were not suspended on probation . According to information given by the Federal Minister for ORG in reply to a parliamentary request , in DATE CARDINAL persons were serving a term of imprisonment based only or mainly on a conviction under LAW and CARDINAL others were held in detention on remand in proceedings relating exclusively to charges under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following ORG judgment of DATE ( see below ) , ORG decided to repeal LAW . In addition , it introduced LAW , which penalises sexual acts with a person DATE if that person is for certain reasons not mature enough to understand the meaning of the act and the offender takes advantage of this immaturity or if the person DATE is in a predicament and the offender takes advantage of that situation . Further Article PERSON penalises inducing persons DATE to engage in sexual activities by payment . Article CARDINALb applies irrespective of whether the sexual acts at issue are heterosexual , homosexual or lesbian . The above amendment , published in ORG ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of PERCENT , ORG found that LAW was compatible with the principle of equality under constitutional law and in particular with the prohibition on gender discrimination contained therein . That judgment was given upon the complaint of a person who subsequently brought his case before the Commission ( PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of CARDINAL DATE , unreported ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant passage of ORG judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The development of the criminal law in DATE has shown that the legislature is striving to apply the system of criminal justice in a significantly more restrictive way than before in pursuance of the efforts it is undertaking in connection with its policy on the treatment of offenders , which have become known under the general heading of \" decriminalisation \" . This means that it leaves offences on the statute book or creates new offences only if such punishment of behaviour harmful to society is still found absolutely necessary and indispensable after the strictest criteria have been applied . The criminal provision which has been challenged is included in the group of acts considered unlawful in order to protect - to an extent thought to be unavoidable - a young , maturing person from developing sexually in the wrong way . ( ' Homosexual acts are only offences of relevance to the criminal law inasmuch as a dangerous strain must not be placed by homosexual experiences upon the sexual development of young males ... ' PERSON in NORP / PERSON ( publishers ) , GPE commentary to LAW , DATE , para . CARDINAL on Article CARDINAL ... ) . Seen in this light , it is the conviction of ORG that from the point of view of the principle of equality contained in section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW and LAW those legislating on the criminal law can not reasonably be challenged for taking the view , by reference to authoritative expert opinions coupled with experience gained , that homosexual influence endangers maturing males to a significantly greater extent than girls of the same age , and concluding that it is necessary to punish under the criminal law homosexual acts committed with young males , as provided for under LAW . This conclusion was also based on their views of morality , which they wanted to impose while duly observing the current policy on criminal justice which aims at moderation and at restricting the punishment of offences ( while carefully weighing up all the manifold advantages and disadvantages ) . Taking everything into account , we are dealing here with a distinction which is based on factual differences and therefore constitutionally admissible from the point of view of section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW , in conjunction with LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed ORG request to review the constitutionality of LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG had argued , inter alia , that Article CARDINAL violated Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention as the theory that male adolescents ran a risk of being recruited into homosexuality on which ORG had relied in its previous judgment , had since been refuted . ORG found that the issue was res judicata . It noted that the fact that it had already given a ruling on the same provision did not prevent it from reviewing it anew , if there was a change in the relevant circumstances or different legal argument . However , ORG had failed to give detailed reasons for its contention that relevant scientific knowledge had changed to such an extent that the legislator was no longer entitled to set a different age limit for consensual homosexual relations than for consensual heterosexual or lesbian relations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon a further request for review made by ORG , ORG found that LAW was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . ORG had argued , firstly , as it had done previously , that LAW violated Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and , secondly , that it was incompatible with the principle of equality under constitutional law and with LAW , as a relationship between male adolescents DATE first legal , but became punishable as soon as one reached DATE and became legal again when the second one reached DATE . ORG held that the second argument differed from the arguments which it had examined in its judgment of DATE and that it was therefore not prevented from considering it . It noted that Article CARDINAL concerned only consensual homosexual relations between men aged DATE and adolescents DATE . In the DATE age bracket homosexual acts between persons of the same age ( for instance CARDINAL DATE ) or of persons with a QUANTITY DATE age difference were not punishable . However , as soon as CARDINAL partner reached DATE , such acts constituted an offence under LAW . They became legal again when the younger partner reached DATE . Given that LAW did not only apply to occasional relations but also covered ongoing relationships , it led to rather absurd results , namely a change of periods during which the homosexual relationship of CARDINAL partners was first legal , than punishable and then legal again and could therefore not be considered to be objectively justified .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG , ORG and ORG brought motions in ORG to repeal LAW . They argued in particular that the legislator in DATE had justified this provision on the theory that male adolescents were at a risk of being recruited into homosexuality while female adolescents were not . However , modern science had shown that sexual orientation was already established at DATE . Moreover , different ages of consent were not in line with NORP standards . In this respect they referred in particular to Recommendation CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG of ORG which had advocated equal ages of consent for heterosexual and homosexual relations . Protection of juveniles against sexual violence and abuse was sufficiently afforded by other provisions of LAW , irrespective of their sexual orientation .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , a sub - committee of ORG of ORG heard evidence from CARDINAL experts in various fields such as medicine , sexual science , AIDS prevention , developmental psychology , psychotherapy , psychiatry , theology , law and human - rights law . CARDINAL were clearly in favour of repealing LAW , an important argument for the experts in the fields of medicine , psychology and psychiatry being that sexual orientation was , in the majority of cases , established before DATE , which disproved the theory that male adolescents were recruited into homosexuality by homosexual experiences . Another recurring argument was that penalising homosexual relations made AIDS prevention more difficult . CARDINAL experts were in favour of keeping LAW : CARDINAL simply stated that he considered it necessary for the protection of male adolescents ; the other considered that despite the fact that there was no such thing as being recruited into homosexuality , not all male adolescents were already sure of their sexual orientation and it was therefore better to give them more time to establish their identity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a debate on the motion to repeal LAW . Those speakers who were in favour of repealing LAW relied on the arguments of the majority of the experts heard in the sub - committee . Of those speakers who were in favour of keeping LAW , some simply expressed their approval while others emphasised that they still considered the provision necessary for those male adolescents who were not sure of their sexual orientation . There was an equal vote at the close of the debate ( CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . Consequently , Article CARDINAL remained on the statute book .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again brought a motion before ORG to repeal LAW . The ensuing debate followed much the same lines as before . The motion was rejected by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to repeal LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
