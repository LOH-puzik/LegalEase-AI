{"ITEMID": "001-24037", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "RAMOS ANDRADE v. the NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , has both GPE and GPE nationality . She was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON Schrevelius , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant moved from LOC to the GPE on DATE . Her daughters PERSON , born in DATE , and LOC , born in DATE , stayed behind in the care of the applicant \u2019s mother . According to the applicant , the ORG biological father , Mr T. Fortes Nascimento , has never had any involvement with his daughters\u2019 lives ; he is currently living in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant applied for a residence permit ( verblijfsvergunning ) enabling her to reside in the GPE with her partner PERSON , a GPE national . This request was refused . The applicant \u2019s subsequent objection ( bezwaar ) and appeal ( beroep ) were declared inadmissible on CARDINAL May and CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "Since DATE the applicant has been living with PERSON , a GPE national . On the basis of this relationship she was granted a residence permit on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) on behalf of her daughters NORP and GPE . Such a visa is normally a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit which confers more permanent residence rights . The applicant submitted that she had visited the girls in DATE , together with her partner PERSON On this occasion she had had to conclude that her mother was physically and mentally no longer capable of looking after GPE and PERSON : the girls were being left to their own devices and were , even by local standards , living in unfavourable conditions . The applicant referred to a doctor \u2019s declaration according to which her mother was suffering from a chronic illness and was indeed incapable of looking after children . She further submitted that she had no other relatives living in LOC .", "The requested provisional residence visa was refused by the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON ) on DATE . The Minister was of the opinion that from DATE GPE and GPE no longer actually belonged to the applicant \u2019s family unit ( gezin ) . It was further held that the refusal of the visa did not constitute a breach of LAW . The applicant \u2019s objection against this decision , filed on her behalf by a lawyer , was declared inadmissible by the Minister on DATE as no grounds for the objection had been submitted . Although possible , no appeal was lodged against this decision .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a new request for a provisional residence visa on behalf of her daughters . She argued that the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between her daughters and herself had always continued to exist : she had remained in contact with them , both through letters and through telephone conversations , and she had also contributed financially and materially to her daughters\u2019 care and upbringing . The reason she had not asked to be reunited with her children soon after her arrival in the GPE was due to the fact that her then partner , PERSON , had informed her that this would not be possible . The applicant submitted another medical declaration , dated DATE , according to which her mother was suffering from advanced spondylarthritis of the spine as a result of which she was incapable of caring for minor children .", "Considering that the new application for a provisional residence visa contained neither new facts nor new circumstances , the Minister of ORG rejected it on DATE with reference to his previous decisions .", "The applicant and PERSON were married on DATE .", "On DATE a hearing on the applicant \u2019s objection against the Minister \u2019s decision was held before an official committee ( ambtelijke commissie ) . At this hearing , the applicant stated that when she had visited her daughters in DATE , they had only just left hospital where they had been admitted after their grandmother had used massage oil in the preparation of food \u2013 this had happened because the applicant \u2019s mother was illiterate . She further clarified that it had always been her intention to send for her children as soon as she had a residence permit . Her first partner in the GPE had not wanted her to bring the girls to the GPE , in addition to telling her that it would not be possible .", "The applicant \u2019s objection was rejected on DATE . The Minister held that children who had stayed behind in the country of origin could only then be considered as continuing to belong to their parent \u2019s family unit if that parent had attempted as soon as reasonably possible to have the children join him or her by means of an application for family reunion . The applicant had not provided a plausible explanation as to why she had waited until DATE before applying for a provisional residence visa . It had further not been established that the applicant had made a substantial contribution to the cost of her daughters\u2019 care and upbringing . Neither had it appeared that the applicant \u2013 who had only once visited her children since moving to the GPE DATE had continued to exercise parental authority or that she had taken any important decisions relating to their upbringing . For these reasons , the Minister concluded that the children had become integrated in the family unit of their grandmother . The refusal of a provisional residence visa was not contrary to LAW there was no interference with the right to respect for family life since the applicant \u2019s children were not deprived of a residence permit which had enabled them to exercise family life in the GPE , and neither was the ORG under a positive obligation to grant the girls residence so as to enable the applicant to develop family life with them in the GPE .", "On DATE the applicant obtained GPE nationality .", "The applicant appealed the Minister \u2019s decision of DATE to ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE sitting in GPE . Following a hearing , ORG rejected the appeal on DATE . It agreed with the Minister that the close family ties between the applicant and her daughters had ceased to exist . According to ORG , the period of time between the applicant \u2019s departure from LOC and the first application for a provisional residence visa for her daughters had been of such duration that it could not be said that the situation of the children living with their grandmother was only temporary . The fact that she had not applied for family reunion sooner because her first partner in the GPE was opposed to it , indicated that the applicant had let the relationship with PERSON V.V. prevail over her ties with her daughters . ORG also found that the refusal of a provisional residence visa was not contrary to LAW , having regard to the fact that it had not appeared that there were any objective impediments preventing the applicant and her daughters from continuing their family life as they had already been doing for a considerable number of DATE . In this context it attached relevance to the fact that the manner in which the applicant and her children exercised family life was due to the applicant \u2019s own choice to leave her daughters behind in LOC .", "Since moving to the GPE , the applicant has regularly transferred money to her mother in LOC in order to pay for her daughters\u2019 upbringing . In addition , once DATE she has sent goods such as clothing , shoes , food , materials for use in school and , on CARDINAL occasion , glasses . She has kept in contact with her daughters by telephone and , less frequently , by mail .", "At the time relevant to the present application , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d - Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) . On DATE a new Aliens Act entered into force but this has no bearing on the present case .", "As a rule , anyone wishing to apply for a residence permit in the GPE must first apply from his or her country of origin to the GPE Minister of ORG for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) . Only once such a visa has been issued abroad may a residence permit for the GPE be granted . An application for a provisional residence visa is assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit .", "The Government pursue a restrictive immigration policy due to the population and employment situation in the GPE . Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of obligations arising from international agreements , or if their presence serves an essential national interest , or on compelling humanitarian grounds .", "The admission policy for family reunion purposes was laid down in LAW of the Aliens Circular CARDINAL ( \u201c the FAC \u201d - Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE ) . It provided that the following persons , where relevant , may qualify for family reunion if certain conditions ( relating to matters such as public policy and means of subsistence ) are met :", "\u2013 a person \u2019s spouse ,", "\u2013 a minor child born of the marriage who actually belongs to the family unit ( gezin ) , and", "\u2013 a minor child born outside the marriage who actually belongs to the family unit ( e.g. a child of CARDINAL of the spouses from a previous marriage or a foster child ) .", "The phrase \u201c actually belonging to the family unit \u201d ( \u201c feitelijk behoren QUANTITY \u201d ) used in GPE law only partly overlaps with the term \u201c family life \u201d in LAW . The former is understood to mean , for instance , that the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between the child and its parents whom it wishes to join in the GPE already existed in another country and have been maintained . For the rest , the question of whether the close family ties should be deemed to have been severed is answered on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each specific case . Factors taken into consideration include the length of time during which parent and child have been separated and the reasons for the separation , the way in which the relationship between parent and child has been developed during the separation , the parent \u2019s involvement in the child \u2019s care and upbringing , custody arrangements , the amount and frequency of the parent \u2019s financial contributions to the child \u2019s care and upbringing , the parent \u2019s intention to send for the child as soon as possible and his / her efforts to do so , and the length of time that the child has lived in a family other than with the parent . The burden of proving that the close family ties between parent and child have not been severed rests with the parent residing in the GPE . The longer the parent and child have been separated , the heavier the burden of proof on the person in the GPE becomes . It is then incumbent on the parent to present sound reasons as to why he or she did not seek to bring the child to the GPE sooner ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
