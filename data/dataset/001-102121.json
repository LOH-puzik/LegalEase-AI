The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has been serving an DATE prison sentence imposed by ORG following his conviction for rape .", "CARDINAL . He was previously held in FAC . On several occasions he requested to be served meat - free meals on account of his religious dietary requirements . He submitted that he was a NORP and that he adhered strictly to the Mahayana NORP dietary rules which required refraining from eating meat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prison dermatologist recommended that the applicant be placed on a meat - free diet in view of his health problems . For DATE he was granted a \u201c no pork \u201d diet ( ORG diet ) that included very little meat and was also applied to CARDINAL NORP detained in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a doctor who examined the applicant considered that there were no medical grounds to continue granting the ORG diet to the applicant . Consequently , the diet was discontinued . The applicant objected and threatened to go on a hunger strike .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to institute criminal proceedings against the employees of FAC . The applicant claimed that despite having requested on several occasions to be provided with a meat - free diet , he was receiving meals containing meat products . Since he could not eat meat for religious reasons he depended on food parcels from his family . He was forced to accept the meals and then throw them away . The refusal to accept them would have been regarded as a decision to start a hunger strike and would have entailed disciplinary punishment . On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant 's allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE in GPE sent a letter to the prison authorities supporting the applicant 's request for a meat - free diet . They submitted that the Mahayana NORP had a serious moral problem when they were forced to eat meat . According to the rules , a Mahayana NORP should avoid eating meat to cultivate compassion for all living beings . They further asked the authorities simply to eliminate meat products from the applicant 's meals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the Director of Goleni\u00f3w Prison to be served meat - free meals in view of his religious dietary requirements . He noted that the ORG diet contained meat products and therefore it did not satisfy his needs . The applicant 's request was refused on DATE . That decision did not contain any reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant asked ORG to institute criminal proceedings against the prison guards . He alleged that there had been an interference with his religious convictions , in particular as the guards had referred to LOC in GPE as \u201c a sect \u201d . They had also thrown religious publications belonging to the applicant into a toilet . On DATE , after receiving a family visit , he was ordered to undergo a body search . The applicant took off his clothes except for his underwear , whereupon the prison guard allegedly touched his private parts . He was further ordered to squat and other prison guards ridiculed him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings against the persons concerned . It considered that the applicant 's allegations were unfounded . The applicant was entitled to exchange correspondence with GPE in GPE and he could also telephone them . In addition , he was entitled to a diet that roughly corresponded to his religious requirements . However , the prosecutor stressed that as the applicant was kept in a single cell , there were no witnesses to the alleged ill - treatment by the prison officers and it was impossible to establish whether the events described by the applicant had actually taken place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's interlocutory appeal against the decision of DATE . The court held that the applicant , when refusing to accept meals containing meat , had referred to his alleged vegetarianism . The court considered that there was no information in the prison files showing that the applicant was a NORP , and in addition for DATE he had agreed to the ORG diet even though it was not a completely meat - free diet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in reply to the applicant 's further complaints , ORG informed the applicant that the only special diet available in FAC was the \u201c ORG \u201d diet . That diet , with the exception of pork , consisted of various meat products , namely beef and poultry , as well as fish . A meat - free diet was not available in that prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , in reply to yet another complaint from the applicant , again confirmed that the only special diet which took into account religious beliefs was the ORG diet . In addition , he explained :", "\u201c A convict has a right to change religion while serving a prison sentence and to profit from freedom of religion if he / she feels like that . However , this does not mean that the prison authorities are obliged to provide an individual with special food in order to meet the specific requirements of his faith . The question of food related to religion or cultural background should not lead convicts to manipulate the prison authorities in order to secure personal advantages . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's interlocutory appeal against the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE in GPE again sent a letter to the Director of Goleni\u00f3w Prison asking him to provide the applicant with a meat - free diet .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a complaint lodged with ORG on DATE the applicant argued that the diet he had been granted in PERSON did not take into account his religious beliefs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint . The court held that the applicant had been granted a special diet since DATE . It further noted that given the technical conditions in the prison kitchen , the transporting of meals and understaffing in the kitchen , it was not possible to provide each prisoner individually with food in conformity with his or her religious dietary requirements . The court also confirmed that meals without pork were prepared .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was transferred to FAC . On DATE he applied to be served meat - free meals in view of his religious dietary requirements . The applicant 's request was refused on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in reply to the applicant 's complaint , the ORG informed him that the prison authorities had not been obliged to prepare special meals taking into consideration different dietary requirements . In addition , since the applicant was the only NORP in this prison , it would have put too much strain on the prison authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP The situation of prisoners and persons detained on remand is governed by LAW DATE .", "Under LAW , prisoners should receive meals taking into consideration their employment , age and where possible religious and cultural beliefs . On the basis of that Article the Minister of ORG issued the LAW of DATE on the rules to be followed by the relevant authorities when determining DATE meals and different diets to be allowed to persons detained in prisons ( ORG w sprawie okreslenia wartosci dziennej normy wyzywienia oraz rodzaju diet wydawanych osobom osadzonym w zakladach karnych I aresztach sledczych ) .
