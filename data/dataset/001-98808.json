GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant , in his capacity as a member of the management board of a stock corporation established under NORP law , was involved in the preparation and conclusion of an agreement between the corporation and ORG in DATE on the delivery of CARDINAL tanks to GPE .", "In DATE the GPE public prosecution authorities initiated an investigation against the applicant on charges of breach of trust and evasion of income tax in connection with the said deals ( file No . CARDINAL KLs CARDINAL GPE DATE ) . He was suspected of having accepted for his own benefit - within the scope of a so - called kick - back procedure on the basis of a collusive agreement with a separately prosecuted arms lobbyist - the return flow of part of the commission payments made by the corporation and affiliated companies to an enterprise of which the said arms lobbyist was the beneficial owner ( wirtschaftlicher PERSON ) . He had thereby allegedly acted in breach of his fiduciary duties vis - \u00e0 - vis his employer and without declaring the funds received in his income tax return .", "In the course of the investigations the suspicion arose that in the period from DATE further executive staff of the said stock corporation and affiliated companies , including the applicant , had jointly evaded corporate and trade tax ( K\u00f6rperschafts- und GPE ) by declaring commission payments as deductible expenses in breach of applicable tax law . The GPE public prosecution authorities severed this part of the investigations and they were subsequently conducted by the local public prosecution authorities with jurisdiction at GPE ( file No . CARDINAL Js CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In the course of the severed preliminary proceedings ( ORG ) documents were confiscated from the corporation 's and affiliated companies ' LOC as well as from the applicant , on the basis of a search warrant of ORG dated DATE .", "By a decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL ORG ( Landgericht ) ordered the seizure of the documents that had previously been confiscated by the GPE public prosecution authorities in the separate preliminary proceedings . ORG provided some of the documents , including analysis reports .", "On DATE the main hearing against the applicant and a co - accused member of the managing board on charges of income tax evasion and breach of trust was opened before ORG ( file No . CARDINAL ORG ) . On the same date defence counsel lodged a first application to obtain the entire file in the separately conducted investigation proceedings from the GPE public prosecution authorities and requested that the hearing be adjourned .", "On DATE ORG refused to adjourn the hearing , and dismissed the applicant 's request to obtain the file in the parallel proceedings as premature .", "On DATE defence counsel again lodged an application to obtain the file in the parallel proceedings . He claimed that the content of the file would demonstrate that the applicant had not played a significant role in the transactions at issue . He further pointed out that further members of the management of the affiliated group who were suspects in the parallel proceedings together with the applicant had been summoned as witnesses in the proceedings before ORG . Effective questioning of these witnesses would only be possible if the defence was previously granted access to the file in the parallel proceedings . By a decision of DATE ORG ordered that the file be obtained .", "By a letter dated DATE ORG stated that while there was no concern about granting the acting ORG at ORG access to the file , the request for the applicant 's counsel to have access to it had to be dismissed pursuant to LAW below ) on the ground that the preliminary investigations in the separate proceedings were ongoing and disclosure of the remaining documents might put the purpose of the investigations at risk . This was particularly the case because defence counsel was representing the applicant in both proceedings . ORG therefore refrained from obtaining the file .", "On the occasion of hearings that took place on DATE and CARDINAL and DATE the applicant 's counsel lodged further applications for an adjournment of the hearing of the witnesses who were at the same time suspects in the parallel preliminary proceedings until the defence had had the opportunity to examine the file in those proceedings . He claimed that this was necessary with a view to preparing the questioning of the witnesses and in order to determine the scope of the witnesses ' privilege to refuse evidence and not to incriminate themselves on the ground that they were also suspects in the parallel preliminary investigations . Referring to the GPE public prosecution authorities ' refusal of access to the file , ORG rejected these requests and heard the witnesses . The ORG pointed out that it would always be possible to summon the witnesses again at a later stage .", "On DATE ORG dismissed requests lodged on DATE by the applicant and the co - accused member of the management board for the file in the parallel proceedings to be seized . ORG held that it followed from the legal principle established in LAW read in conjunction with LAW ( Grundgesetz - see Relevant domestic law below ) that a seizure of the files would only be possible in the event the public prosecution authorities had not sufficiently reasoned their refusal of access to the file . However , in the case at hand the GPE public prosecution authorities had based their decision on LAW , stipulating that counsel may be denied access to files in ongoing preliminary investigations if their disclosure might put the purpose of the investigations at risk . This provision constituted a lex specialis in relation to LAW . Furthermore , there was nothing to establish that the decision of ORG to deny access had been arbitrary or unlawful . Given ORG refusal to make the file available to defence counsel , ORG had refrained from obtaining the file altogether , specifying that consultation of the file by the court alone would be in breach of the rights of the defence .", "A further application to adjourn the hearing lodged on DATE by the applicant was rejected by ORG on DATE . The court held that the fact that it was not possible to obtain the entire file did not justify an adjournment of the hearing , since the GPE proceedings related to different tax evasion charges and different tax debtors . ORG however pointed out that while it was not possible to obtain the entire file in the parallel proceedings , nothing prevented the applicant and the prosecution authorities from lodging applications in line with the formal requirements to obtain specific documents and other means of evidence included in the file .", "On DATE the applicant again requested the seizure of the entire file in the parallel proceedings , but this time alternatively limited his request to those documents that had been seized from the applicant on the basis of the search warrant issued by ORG on DATE , as well as all documents compiled within the scope of an independent investigation of the case by an accounting firm and a law firm . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicant 's alternative application and asked the GPE public prosecution authorities to examine whether disclosure of the said documents was possible .", "On DATE the ORG agreed to disclose the requested documents and further announced that access to the entire file and residual documents would be granted in DATE .", "By a decision of DATE ORG ordered the seizure of the documents specified in its decision of DATE on the ground that they could be of importance as evidence in the proceedings and counsel subsequently had the opportunity to examine the requested documents .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG convicted the applicant of tax evasion in CARDINAL cases as well as of breach of trust and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "By written submissions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed against ORG judgment to ORG ( ORG ) . He complained , inter alia , that ORG refusal to seize the file and to adjourn the proceedings until the entire file had been made available prevented him from effectively defending himself in breach of his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by LAW . Pursuant to LAW , ORG would have been under an obligation to obtain a decision by ORG of the GPE in its capacity as ORG superior authority on whether the refusal of access to the file was justified . LAW CARDINAL of LAW did not deal with a refusal of access in separately conducted proceedings and was not applicable in the case at hand . The question of whether LAW was lex specialis in relation to its LAW was of significant importance . He further alleged that the information contained in the file would have demonstrated that the applicant had not played a responsible role in the transactions at issue , contrary to what had been established in ORG judgment .", "By a decision of DATE ORG ( file No . CARDINAL StR CARDINAL ) , following a statement by ORG ( ORG ) , quashed ORG verdict as regards the assessment of the scope of the applicant 's guilt ( GPE ) and to this extent remitted the case to ORG . At the same time ORG dismissed , inter alia , the applicant 's complaint that due to the failure to obtain the file in the parallel proceedings his defence had been restricted in a decisive point as ill - founded .", "It found that it was doubtful whether the applicant had sufficiently substantiated this complaint pursuant to LAW CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW of LAW . The applicant had not established that there was a link between the alleged procedural flaw and the grounds on which the judgment of ORG had been based . Once the applicant had been granted access to part of the files he would have been under an obligation to specify what missing information would be significant for his defence . Furthermore , defence counsel would have been under an obligation to continue his efforts for a disclosure of the entire file within the time - limit for lodging his appeal on points of law with a view to establishing in his submissions to ORG that the non - disclosed parts of the file contained information that was significant for the defence . However , the applicant 's submissions contained only theoretical conclusions on the possibly relevant content of the file .", "ORG further confirmed that LAW was lex specialis in relation to LAW of LAW . When taking a decision on whether to grant access to files ORG had to weigh the interest of the accused to effectively defend himself in the proceedings before ORG against the necessity to keep the file in the preliminary investigations secret and might for instance grant access to parts of the file . In the case at hand a judicial review of the prosecution authorities ' denial to grant access to the files in analogous application of , inter alia , LAW might be considered . ORG on itsRegional Court until disclosure of the entire file .", "By a decision of DATE ( file No . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) which was served on the applicant on DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint .", "It found that his complaint about ORG refusal to seize the documents retained by ORG was inadmissible since the applicant had not exhausted the appropriate procedural domestic remedies in this respect . He had failed to lodge applications for the taking of particular evidence , even though ORG had indicated this possibility and even though the applicant had been granted access to parts of the files by ORG . He had in particular been able to consult all the documents which had been the subject of his requests dated CARDINAL DATE and DATE . From the material that had been made available to him he must have been in a position to reason what other specific means of evidence would be needed for his defence . Given the fact that the proceedings had lasted until DATE he could have lodged further corresponding applications for the taking of evidence . However , allegations in respect of specific means of taking evidence had been made by the applicant for the first time during the proceedings before ORG .", "ORG further pointed out that the GPE public prosecution authorities had announced that the entire file would be released in DATE and that the judgment of ORG had been pronounced on DATE . The applicant would have had the opportunity to lodge an application for an adjournment of the hearing of DATE thereby avoiding the alleged violation of his basic rights instead of subsequently lodging an appeal against the first - instance judgment .", "In addition , ORG found that the applicant 's complaint was inadmissible on the ground that he had not established that the contested judgment was based on the alleged violation of his basic rights as required by Sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and LAW ( Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz ) . In his submissions before ORG and ORG he had not sufficiently substantiated that the consideration of the parts of the file that had not been available during the proceedings before ORG would have led to a different assessment of the case by the latter , even though he obviously had access to the retained parts of the file after termination of the main proceedings before ORG .", "The separately conducted preliminary proceedings regarding the evasion of corporate and trade tax ( file No . CARDINAL PERSON ) were stayed by the GPE public prosecution authorities on DATE .", "Following remittal of the proceedings concerning the charges on breach of trust and evasion of income tax as regards the assessment of the scope of the applicant 's guilt by ORG , ORG , by a judgment of DATE ( file No . CARDINAL ORG ) reduced the applicant 's sentence to DATE and DATE imprisonment .", "Following a further appeal lodged by the applicant , ORG by a decision of DATE amended ORG judgment of DATE and reduced the applicant 's sentence to DATE imprisonment on probation . It dismissed the remainder of the applicant 's appeal as ill - founded .", "By written submissions of DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint alleging , inter alia , a violation of his right to a fair trial on grounds different from those being the subject of the instant application . The latter proceedings are still pending before ORG .", "Pursuant to LAW all federal and authorities of the L\u00e4nder shall render legal and administrative assistance to one another .", "LAW stipulates that access to files or other documents kept by public authorities or public servants may not be requested if their superior authority declares that the publication of these files or documents would be detrimental to the welfare of the Federation or of a NORP Land .", "LAW provides that defence counsel is entitled to consult the files which have been presented to the trial court or which would have to be presented to the trial court in case of indictment and to inspect the exhibits . LAW of this provision allows access to part or all of the files or to the exhibits to be refused until the preliminary investigation has ended if it might otherwise be at risk . Pending the termination of the preliminary investigation , it is for ORG to decide whether to grant access to the files or not ; thereafter it is for the president of the trial court ( LAW ) .", "Pursuant to LAW be considered to be based on a violation of the law if the defence has been inadmissibly restricted by a decision of the court on a topic which was decisive for the judgment . Pursuant to LAW , in the event an applicant complains of procedural flaws , he has to establish the facts as regards such flaws .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG requires that applications for the institution of proceedings lodged with ORG must be lodged in writing , state the reasons for the complaint and specify the requisite evidence . LAW stipulates that the right which has allegedly been violated has to be specified , as well as the action or omission of the organ or authority which has allegedly been at the origin of the violation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
