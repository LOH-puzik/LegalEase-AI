The court reasoned , inter alia , that a valuation under section CARDINAL of LAW had to be based , as a rule , on the market prices at the time of the expropriation . However , no evidence about these prices had been adduced by the municipality . The only data available was that in the expert 's report drawn up during the proceedings before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which indicated that the value of the property at the time of the mayor 's order DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) \u2013 was BGN CARDINAL . The court instructed the mayor that this new valuation only replaced the original valuation made at the time of the expropriation , but did not change the manner of compensation .
