Relying on that information , the applicant argued that the ORG had acknowledged the debt within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW and that the running of the statutory limitation period had thus been interrupted .", "CARDINAL . The court heard the applicant 's commanding officer PERSON and the head of ORG of ORG , Brigadier I.P.", "CARDINAL . B.B. , who had been the commander of the CARDINALth ORG DATE and DATE , testified that lists of servicemen who carried out demining work , together with DATE worked and the corresponding amount of allowances , had been submitted to him by platoon commanders within the brigade . As the commander of the unit , he had signed them after checking them for accuracy and had then submitted them for certification to the commander of FAC . After the commander of ORG had signed the lists , they had been submitted for payment to ORG in ORG . He had informed the applicant that the lists had been submitted for payment . When the allowances were not paid , the applicant and other members of the unit had approached him , as their commanding officer and the only person they were authorised to approach under internal regulations , asking him when the payment would be made . In their name he had then contacted the commander of ORG . Each time he had been informed that the right to receive payment and its amount were not being disputed and that payment would follow after the funds had been allocated for that purpose . Each time he had transmitted that information to the members of his unit , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . I.P. had since DATE been the head of ORG of ORG , which was in charge of financial matters for the CARDINALrd LOC . He testified that he had been aware that members of ORG had been carrying out demining work up to DATE and that the commander of FAC had been submitting lists of servicemen who carried out demining work for payment . Since payment was not forthcoming when the allowances fell due , ORG had informed the relevant financial departments that the allowances had not been paid because no funds had been allocated in the budget for that purpose , whereas no instructions had been given to dispute the right to receive allowances or their amount .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the ORG to pay him the allowances he sought . The relevant part of that judgment read as follows :", "\u201c [ It ] is undisputed that ... when each instalment became due , up to DATE , the plaintiff asked his commanding officer when the payment would be made , because according to the internal organisation of [ ORG ] that was the only person he was authorised to approach , and that [ his ] commanding officer took this up on behalf of the plaintiff with the ORG of the CARDINALrd LOC and that the commander of FAC informed [ the plaintiff 's ] commanding officer that the right to receive payment and its amount were not in dispute , and that payment would follow after the funds had been allocated in the budget , because currently there were none ; the commanding officer passed this information on to the plaintiff .", "The foregoing , in the view of this court , represents acknowledgement of the debt within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , because ... the plaintiff was informed by the person authorised to act on behalf of the respondent that the right to receive payment and its amount were not in dispute and that payment would follow once funds had been allocated in the budget . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the ORG , on DATE the ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u PERSON ) quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case . It held that the first - instance court had failed to establish : ( a ) who in this case was the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of ORG , and ( b ) whether the signed and certified lists of the members of the applicant 's unit who had carried out demining work , indicating DATE on which they had done such work and the corresponding amount of DATE allowances , processed by ORG , in fact constituted requests for payment and therefore an indirect acknowledgment of the debt .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , ORG again heard the head of ORG of ORG , Brigadier I.P. , who testified that the certified lists of servicemen who had carried out demining work constituted requests for payment of the allowances . He further stated that after receiving the lists ORG had checked them for accuracy and submitted them together with the requisite form , which in fact constituted a request for payment , to ORG of ORG in GPE . According to ORG , ORG had been authorised to check the lists and could have returned them to ORG if the request for payment of allowances or their amount had been invalid , which they had not done . After ORG had submitted the lists and request for payment , the head of ORG had informed him that payment would follow once funds had been allocated in the budget for that purpose . Had there been funds , no further action would have been required for the amount requested to be transferred to the applicant 's bank account .", "CARDINAL . In these resumed proceedings , the respondent argued for the first time that , in accordance with the internal regulations of ORG , the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of ORG was the head of its ORG before a court action had been brought , and afterwards the head of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again ruled in favour of the plaintiff . The relevant part of that judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ORG certified the above - mentioned payment lists ... by first checking that the payment and its amount were justified , and then sent it , together with the [ requisite ] form , namely the payment request form , to ORG ... in GPE . [ That GPE ] , by not returning the lists and the request for payment to ORG , accepted them as justified and well - founded . [ ORG ] had to pay the amounts [ sought ] because ORG did not have ready money . After receiving those [ lists and ] the request for payment , ORG had informed ORG that payment would follow once funds had been allocated in the ORG budget , of which the plaintiff was notified and which was explained to him by his commanding officer between the [ time the instalments ] became due and DATE .", "The foregoing , in view of this court , represents acknowledgement of the debt because , by certifying the payment lists with the payment request form and informing the plaintiff thereof as well as of the fact that payment would follow once funds had been allocated in the ORG budget , the plaintiff , as the creditor , was informed by the respondent , as the debtor , in a clear and unequivocal manner , that the claim at issue , that is , the respondent 's debt , was being acknowledged . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the ORG , on DATE the ORG again quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case . It held that from the case file it followed that in accordance with the internal regulations of ORG the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of ORG had been the head of its ORG before the action was brought , and afterwards the head of ORG . Therefore , the applicant 's commanding officer could not have acknowledged the debt on behalf of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , ORG , in order to establish who was the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of ORG , heard the head of ORG of ORG , and examined the internal regulations of the Ministry .", "CARDINAL . NORP The head of ORG , GPE , testified that the person authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of ORG had indeed been the head of its ORG before the action was brought and the head of its ORG afterwards . He also testified that ORG request for payment of DATE allowances for demining work had been deemed invalid by a letter of CARDINAL DATE because ORG of DATE applied only to the GPE region of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled for the third time in favour of the plaintiff . The relevant part of that judgment read as follows :", "\u201c In line with the internal organisation of [ the Ministry ] , the plaintiff , after [ the DATE allowances had become due but ] payment had not been forthcoming , had been addressing his requests for payment to his immediate superior , that is to the commander of his unit , whereupon he [ the commander ] had on behalf of the plaintiff been contacting the commander of FAC of ORG . The commander of LOC had been forwarding such requests to ORG , which had been replying that the right to receive payment and its amount were being acknowledged , and that payment would follow once funds had been allocated for that purpose . The commander of FAC had been sending that information to the commander of the [ plaintiff 's ] unit , who had been notifying the plaintiff of this DATE and DATE , when the commander of the unit received the last information from the commander of the CARDINALrd Operational Zone .", "In this way authorised and responsible persons and the department [ within the Ministry ] , in particular the commander of the CARDINALth ORG , the commander of LOC ... and the competent ORG , which certified and acknowledged the amounts of DATE allowances as costs of [ the Ministry ] , and in the form of a request for transfer of funds corresponding to the amounts sought ... , submitted them to [ ORG ] , acknowledged the debt to the plaintiff in a clear and unequivocal manner .", "Accordingly , the respondent 's argument raised in the course of the proceedings that only the head of [ ORG ] or the head of ORG were authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of ORG , is unfounded because this does not follow from the evidence taken , especially from the documents provided by the respondent , in particular from [ the internal regulations of ORG ] , and [ because ] the time - limits fixed by the court at the request of the respondent 's representative for furnishing evidence [ in support of that argument ] had expired .", "...", "... from the letter of DATE it does not follow that the request of the [ Split ] ORG had been regarded as invalid . [ Rather ] , it was only returned to the [ ORG ] GPE for additional examination and checking , and it was suggested that afterwards ORG should decide on the right to receive payment of the allowances at issue .", "Consequently , in the light of the foregoing , this court indisputably established that authorised persons of the respondent had continued , throughout the entire period in dispute , that is , from the time the claims had become due until DATE , to inform the plaintiff in a clear and unequivocal manner that the respondent did not dispute [ his ] right to receive DATE allowances in the amount sought . [ T]hereby , the respondent acknowledged the debt to the plaintiff within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , so it is clear that the statutory limitation period did not expire , because its running was interrupted by the acknowledgment of the debt . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the ORG , on DATE the ORG reversed the first - instance judgment by dismissing the applicant 's action . The relevant part of that judgment read as follows :", "\u201c On the basis of the evidence taken , the first - instance court established the following relevant facts :", "- that the plaintiff , as a member of the CARDINALth ORG of ORG at the material time , under the command of the CARDINALrd Operational Zone of ORG , had occasionally carried out demining work during DATE ;", "- that the Decision [ of the Minister of Defence of DATE ] had established the right of the ... members of ORG to a special DATE allowance for demining work ;", "- that , in accordance with the [ above ] Decision , the commander of the CARDINALth ORG had been compiling DATE lists of members of the unit who in DATE had carried out demining work , and had specified DATE spent on demining work and the corresponding amounts of DATE allowances due , and that [ those lists ] had been certified and co - signed by the commander of FAC of ORG and submitted to ORG of the [ ORG ] ;", "- that the plaintiff , when the special DATE allowances were not paid , on numerous occasions approached the commander of his unit , in accordance with the hierarchical organisation of the [ Ministry ] ... with a query as to when the payment would be made , and that [ his commander ] , after making enquiries of the command of FAC , informed him that his claims were not in dispute ... and that payment would follow after funds had been allocated for that purpose .", "Relying on these facts , the first - instance court found that that the authorised persons of the respondent ( the commander of the CARDINALth ORG , the commander of LOC of ORG , as well as ORG \u2013 which had certified and acknowledged the amount of the plaintiff 's special DATE allowances as costs of the respondent and had submitted it in the form of a request to the [ ORG of the [ Ministry for transfer of the amount sought ] ) DATE had , throughout the entire period in dispute , until DATE , unequivocally informed the plaintiff that the respondent did not dispute [ his ] right to receive DATE allowances in the amount sought , and that the respondent had thereby acknowledged the debt to the plaintiff within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , so the statutory limitation period had not expired .", "However , having regard to the evidence taken before the first - instance court , this court considers the above finding of the first - instance court erroneous . [ This is so ] because , contrary to the view of the first - instance court , and in accordance with the hierarchical organisation of the [ Ministry ] , the persons authorised to acknowledge the debt on behalf of the [ Ministry ] were the head of [ its ORG \u2013 which ORG , in accordance with the [ ORG ] internal regulations , was authorised to ultimately process and check the requests for payment of the plaintiff 's claims submitted by ORG ( until the action was brought in this case ) DATE and the head of the [ ORG ( during the present proceedings ) , as the respondent correctly argued ... as well as the other authorised persons who were , in accordance with the hierarchical organisation of the [ Ministry ] , superior to [ them ] .", "That being so , and having regard to the facts established in the proceedings before the first - instance court , it does not follow that it was precisely those authorised persons mentioned above who acknowledged the debt by making a declaration to the plaintiff as the creditor , nor that the debt was acknowledged in some indirect manner within the meaning of paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of LAW . [ O]n the contrary , the request of ORG to transfer funds [ corresponding to the amounts of DATE allowances sought ] ( which request , together with signed and certified lists compiled by ORG , can not be considered an acknowledgement of the debt within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW ) ... was regarded as invalid by ORG and returned to ORG for further checking and additional examination ( ... ) . [ T]herefore , in the instant case the respondent did not acknowledge the plaintiff 's claims in any manner prescribed by law that would lead to an interruption of the statutory limitation period . [ S]ince DATE instalment of special DATE allowances had become due in DATE , and the action in this case had been brought on DATE , the [ respondent 's ] plea that the claims at issue were statute - barred , ... is well - founded because the DATE statutory limitation period set forth in section CARDINAL of LAW in respect of the plaintiff 's claims , which arose from his employment relationship with the respondent , had expired in the instant case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint against the second - instance judgment , alleging violations of his constitutional rights to equality before the courts and to a fair hearing . He argued that his claim for special DATE allowances for demining work was not statute - barred , because ORG had on several occasions acknowledged the debt , thereby interrupting the running of the statutory limitation period , and that the \u0160ibenik ORG had not relied on any provision of substantive law which would justify dismissal of his action .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG delivered a judgment , no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL , in a case in which the plaintiffs sued the ORG seeking payment of unpaid salaries for the period during which they had been receiving medical treatment and held captive by the enemy , respectively . The question arose whether the letter of ORG , in particular , the General Staff of ORG , of CARDINAL DATE , confirming that the plaintiffs had been members of their military unit and had appeared on its payroll but had not collected their salaries in the above - mentioned period , constituted acknowledgment of the debt . The lower courts dismissed the plaintiffs ' action , finding that the letter had not constituted acknowledgement of a debt capable of interrupting the statutory limitation period . In dismissing an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) by the plaintiffs and upholding the lower courts ' judgments , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c From [ the letter of CARDINAL DATE ] it only follows that the plaintiffs were members of a certain unit at a certain time and that they did not receive a salary for that period . Such [ a letter ] can not per se constitute an acknowledgment of the debt within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW and interruption of the statutory limitation period . That is a general statement which can not be considered as an acknowledgment of the debt . The ... letter indicates that the debt may exist but it does not constitute an acknowledgement by the debtor that the debt [ indeed ] exists , that is , acknowledgment that the debtor has [ an obligation ] to settle the debt or that the debtor will settle it . The statement of facts by the debtor , on the basis of which it could be concluded that the debt exists , does not constitute acknowledgment of the debt [ capable of ] interrupting the statutory limitation period . For the acknowledgement of the debt to result in the interruption of the statutory limitation period , it has to be explicit and specific so that the debtor 's will to settle the existing debt is unequivocally expressed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a decision , no . Rev-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL , in a case where the plaintiff company sued the ORG seeking payment of a certain amount of money . The question arose whether a letter of CARDINAL DATE signed on behalf of ORG of ORG by the head of its ORG informing the plaintiff that its claim had been recorded with ORG but that funds had not been allocated to satisfy that claim , as well as a letter of DATE signed on behalf of ORG of ORG by the head of its ORG notifying the plaintiff that ORG would settle its debt by transferring the money to the plaintiff company 's giro account upon transfer of the funds to ORG from the ORG budget , amounted to acknowledgment of the debt . The lower courts ruled in favour of the plaintiff , finding that the above - mentioned letters had constituted acknowledgement of a debt capable of interrupting the statutory limitation period . ORG allowed an appeal on points of law by the ORG , quashed the lower courts ' judgments and remitted the case . In so deciding ORG held as follows :", "\u201c In the contested judgments no reasons were given for the finding that the head of ORG , who had signed the letter of CARDINAL DATE , would be authorised to acknowledge the debt ( even assuming that the mere recording of the claim and its amount with ORG of ORG could be considered an acknowledgment of the debt ) .", "... the letter of DATE [ containing ] the statement that its [ the ORG 's ] debt would be settled by transferring the money to the [ plaintiff company 's ] giro account , but without establishing the amount of the debt that the respondent considered well - founded , and without establishing whether ... the head of ORG ( who signed the letter ) was authorised to give such a statement , can not , at least for the time being , be considered an acknowledgment of the debt .", "In this court 's view , an acknowledgement of a debt within the meaning of section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of LAW can be made by the debtor personally or through an authorised person ( if the debtor is a legal entity ) . It follows from the foregoing that declarations of unauthorised persons acknowledging a debt on behalf of a debtor can not produce for the debtor any legal effects of a valid acknowledgement of a debt . It also has to be noted that an acknowledgement of a debt must not be contrary to peremptory norms [ jus cogens ] .", "For these reasons , until it is established whether , and on the basis of which legal document , the head of ORG and the head of ORG were persons authorised to acknowledge the debt , there can be no conclusions as to the legal significance of the letters of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the views expressed in NORP legal doctrine , a right is not extinguished by the expiration of a statutory limitation period .
