The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE the applicant met with her friend .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant took a taxi to go home and refused to pay the allegedly exorbitant fare without obtaining a proper bill . As a result , the driver did not let the applicant out of the taxi in front of her house but took her to a soberingup centre in ORG . The applicant called the police from the taxi as she felt threatened by the driver \u2019s behaviour . So did the driver as regards the applicant \u2019s behaviour .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant was detained in the soberingup centre . She refused to undergo a breathalyser test . The applicant submitted that she had had CARDINAL beers . The ORG maintained that she had been in a state of \u201c average intoxication \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the staff of the centre had insulted her and that she had been brutally manhandled and beaten . She had also been forcibly stripped naked by CARDINAL men and a woman . Afterwards , she had been forcibly put into a disposable gown .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that it was the applicant who had been aggressive towards the staff and had verbally insulted them . They had therefore had no choice but to undress her by force as she had refused to undress herself and had subsequently resisted their legitimate efforts to dress her in a disposable gown .", "CARDINAL . They further argued that she had had to be placed in restraining belts because after being put to bed she had been kicking the doors of the room and screaming abuse , waking other patients .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parties\u2019 submissions are concordant as to the fact that the applicant was subsequently restrained by belts , tied to a bed and locked in a cell until TIME of DATE , when she was released .", "The applicant submitted that she had remained in the cell , restrained by the belts , for TIME . The Government did not challenge this submission .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant obtained a medical certificate concerning her condition .", "The relevant part of the certificate read :", "A bloody bruise on the left hip , at the front , of QUANTITY in diameter , abrasion at the wrist at the elbow side ; mobility and rotation of the shoulder limited ( unclear whether passive or active movements concerned ) ; the [ applicant ] complained of pain in her jaw at the left side ; the jaw at that side swollen .", "CARDINAL . Shortly afterwards the applicant filed a complaint against the staff of the centre with the head of the district police in ORG . She submitted that she had not been intoxicated , that nothing in her conduct had justified the decision to deprive her of her liberty and that she had been brutally manhandled and undressed by the staff of the centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the district police refused to institute an investigation in her case . The grounds of the decision read :", "On CARDINAL PERSON complained to ORG that on DATE a taxi driver and the staff of the sobering - up centre had used physical force against her and insulted her . In her formal complaint that a criminal offence had been committed , which she submitted on DATE , she [ explained ] that on DATE at TIME approximately a driver of a taxi No . [ ... ] had first insulted her verbally and afterwards had taken her to the sobering - up centre where she had been detained against her will and physical force , resulting in bruises and scratches , had been used against her by the staff . A number of persons were requested to provide information , but no one confirmed the applicant \u2019s allegations . The taxi driver stated that PERSON had been taken to the sobering - up centre because she had not wanted to pay the fare or to leave the taxi and that she had herself agreed to be taken there ; while she could have left the taxi at any time ; she was detained at the centre by the police , not by the taxi driver himself as she says ; furthermore she did not want to have a breathalyser test but when she was already in the centre she did not want to undress herself and when she was put in the room for the patients she was hitting the door with her hands and other parts of her body inflicting injuries on herself so that restraining belts had to be used for fear that her life and health might be endangered . \u201d", "On DATE the ORG district prosecutor upheld this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . In particular , she reiterated that her detention had been completely unjustified as she had not been intoxicated . She had had CARDINAL beers on TIME of DATE which by no standards could be described as intoxication , still less as intoxication justifying deprivation of liberty in a soberingup centre . She had been illtreated by the staff of the centre after her arrest , but the decision of CARDINAL DATE had obviously failed to elucidate the facts of the case . She submitted that during her detention she had been stripped naked . She stressed that the police had failed to grant her access to the file concerning her detention and that the investigation had been superficial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the district police in ORG decided to investigate the applicant \u2019s allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert prepared an opinion as to the applicant \u2019s health upon her release on the basis of the file of the investigation . The opinion reiterated the findings of the certificate of CARDINAL DATE and stated that the injuries could have been sustained both as a result of the use of force against the applicant or of her behaviour after she had been undressed and put into the cell .", "CARDINAL . The investigation was subsequently discontinued by the police and on DATE the district prosecutor confirmed this decision . The written grounds of the decision read :", "\u201c During the investigation factual findings were made , witnesses were questioned , the [ applicant \u2019s ] medical records were examined and a medical expert was appointed with a view to establishing the injuries and circumstances in which they might have been sustained . It was established on the basis of this material that on DATE CARDINAL PERSON , having drunk alcohol and having refused to pay for the taxi , had been taken by the taxi - driver to [ the sobering - up centre ] . Afterwards she was taken , in the presence of a police patrol , to the building of the centre . Once she was inside , a decision was taken to detain her in the centre , regard being had to her behaviour which was vulgar and offensive towards those who were present there . As she did not want to comply with the regulations in force by taking a breathalyser test and by voluntarily undressing and changing into a gown , the staff used force against her in order to make her change her clothes and put her in a room for detainees . As she continued to be aggressive and to destroy property and could have harmed herself , she was put in restraining belts so that she could calm down .", "The applicant \u2019s complaints were not confirmed by the witnesses . Her behaviour was reprehensible and it was necessary to put her in the sobering - up centre . It has not been established that physical force was used against her over and above what was necessary to calm her down . Hence , as there was no indication that a criminal offence had been committed the investigation has to be discontinued . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant , represented by a lawyer , appealed to the regional prosecutor . She submitted that she had not been intoxicated and that the actions of the employees of the centre had infringed her personal rights , her dignity and her bodily integrity . She also submitted that her procedural rights had been breached in that the police had failed to inform her representative about any of the investigative measures that had been taken during the proceedings . It was also submitted that during the investigation the applicant should have had an opportunity to confront the employees of the centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG regional prosecutor , having regard to the applicant \u2019s procedural arguments , quashed the contested decision of DATE . He noted that there had been significant discrepancies between the applicant \u2019s testimony and that given by other persons , which had to be elucidated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the LOC district prosecutor discontinued the proceedings , finding that no criminal offence had been committed . The written grounds of the decision read :", "\u201c In TIME of DATE [ the applicant ] called a taxi [ ... ] After the trip a disagreement as to the amount of the fare to be paid arose between her and the driver . As the parties disagreed , [ the driver ] decided to solve the problem with the assistance of the police . After he had called the dispatch centre [ of the taxi company ] , he drove to the vicinity of the sobering - up centre and waited for the police to come . They then waited for the patrol to come ; at that time the driver entered the building of the centre , while the applicant stood by the taxi and also called the police from her mobile phone .", "It is noted that the driver did not commit the offence of unlawful deprivation of property against the applicant , given that at that time both parties wanted to solve the problem with the assistance of the police ; it is also noted that at that time the applicant could simply have walked away or used her phone .", "After police officers PERSON and PERSON arrived at the scene , they tried to obtain a friendly resolution of the situation , but to no avail . Having regard to the vulgar and aggressive behaviour of the applicant , who smelled of alcohol , the officers decided that she should be detained in the sobering - up centre , where she refused to take a breathalyser test . Hence , the doctor on duty decided , on the basis of a general examination , that the applicant was in a state of intoxication justifying her detention for TIME .", "Staff member ORG [ a woman ] subsequently tried to make the applicant change into a disposable garment .", "As the applicant offered stubborn resistance , ORG requested other members of staff , PERSON and T.P. [ men ] to help her ; the applicant was dressed in a gown with their assistance and put into the room for intoxicated persons .", "The applicant continued to be aggressive ; therefore physical force against her was used and she was put in restraining belts .", "It transpires from the provisions governing the organisation of the sobering - up centres and job descriptions of the members of staff , the staff acted in compliance with law on the basis of the applicable legal provisions and there is therefore no basis for a well - founded suspicion that a criminal offence of unlawful deprivation of liberty or coercion had been committed .", "On the basis of section CARDINAL of the PERSON on Education ... in GPE and the Fight against Alcoholism and sections CARDINAL of the ... ordinance a bill for ORG was drawn for the applicant to pay for the costs of her detention .", "It should be unequivocally stated that the conduct of the staff toward the applicant was lawful .", "During the investigations all persons involved in the applicant \u2019s arrest and detention were questioned . The ample evidence gathered in the case did not give rise to a suspicion that a criminal offence had been committed .", "Subsequently , the decision reiterated the findings of the medical report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The decision further read :", "In her submissions the applicant complained that the staff of the centre had breached her dignity and ... Having in mind that the injuries which the applicant suffered and the insults can be examined in proceedings instituted by a private bill of indictment , it is open to the applicant to bring such a bill within DATE from the service of the present decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , reiterating the arguments she had submitted in her previous appeal . She also submitted that she had been humiliated by the staff of the centre as she had been forcibly undressed and tied to a bed with restraining belts until TIME of DATE . This had made it impossible for her to go to the toilet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision to discontinue the proceedings . In its decision , which consisted of CARDINAL lines , the court observed that the evidence gathered in the case had led it to the logical conclusion that the applicant had been intoxicated and that therefore her detention in the sobering - up centre and the use of force against her had been justified .", "CARDINAL .
