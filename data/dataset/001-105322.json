De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant and her former husband purchased from the local municipality a CARDINAL - bedroom flat of QUANTITY in a QUANTITY building . The municipality had owned the building and the plot of land ( part of which served as a yard ) since DATE , when it was nationalised .", "In accordance with the usual practice in cases of sale of flats on municipal land , the buyers also obtained a PERCENT portion of the construction rights over the entire plot . Following the applicant \u2019s divorce in DATE she became the sole holder of the title obtained in DATE .", "In DATE the applicant requested from the local municipality an authorisation to construct a small house of QUANTITY on a portion of the yard .", "The municipality processed the request . On DATE the competent official issued an authorisation to proceed with the elaboration of a plan by an architect . The document containing the authorisation referred to the \u201c construction rights conveyed on PERSON \u201d under the DATE contract . It appears that no consideration was given to the fact that these rights did not entitle the applicant to construct a house in the yard .", "On DATE a building permit was issued .", "When issuing the authorisation and the permit , the relevant officials apparently overlooked or disregarded the fact that on DATE the land at issue had been denationalised pursuant to a DATE law on the restitution of nationalised property and had become the property of a Mr T. , the heir of the person from whom it had been nationalised in DATE .", "The applicant became aware that the property had been denationalised on an unspecified date .", "In DATE Mr T. asked the municipal authorities to order the suspension of the construction works undertaken by the applicant . In reply the municipality informed him that a building permit had been issued to the applicant .", "The house was constructed rapidly and on an unspecified date in DATE the applicant requested from the local municipality approval of the construction works and authorisation for the use of the house .", "This was refused on the grounds that the applicant had never had construction rights over the entire plot and that in any event the land had been private property at the time when the DATE building permit had been issued . It followed that the permit had been issued unlawfully .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action against the municipality under ORG ( the ORG , the LAW \u2019s title having been amended later ) claiming that she had suffered damage occasioned by unlawful acts on the part of the municipality . Her initial claim was for CARDINAL \u201c old \u201d NORP levs ( ORG ) . Later , she increased her claim to ORG CARDINAL .", "The ORG admitted documentary evidence and commissioned expert reports on the value of the house . The court asked the experts to determine its market value as of DATE , when the action was brought .", "In their report of DATE the experts concluded that that value was BGL CARDINAL . At the hearing held in DATE , in reply to additional questions , the experts added that the up - to - date market value of the house was ORG CARDINAL . The difference was the result of the approximately CARDINAL - fold devaluation of the NORP currency DATE .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG found that the municipality had acted unlawfully in that it had issued a building permit in disregard of the fact that the property had been denationalised and that the applicant had never been authorised by the owner to build on his land . Since the denationalisation had been ordered by the same municipality , the relevant officials had known about it . The applicant had incurred expenditure to build a house but could not become its owner . The municipality was therefore liable to compensate her for the damage directly related to the unlawful act . The assessment of that damage , in accordance with the relevant law , had to be based on the market value of the house as of DATE , when the claim had been brought , plus interest since DATE . The value in question was BGL CARDINAL , as established by the experts . The court awarded that sum to the applicant , plus interest .", "Noting that the applicant had claimed BGL CARDINAL and applying section CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the ORG , the court ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL in court fees ( the equivalent of CARDINAL new NORP levs ( ORG ) ) , which represented a fixed PERCENT fee on the rejected part of the claim .", "As the municipality did not appeal , the award of LAW ( the equivalent of ORG ) in the applicant \u2019s favour became enforceable towards DATE .", "The applicant appealed , claiming , inter alia , that she was entitled to compensation for her actual loss and that ORG had awarded an amount which did not reflect her actual loss . The applicant also challenged the ORG decision concerning court fees and costs .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld GPE judgment .", "The court noted that since the municipality had not appealed it could not re - examine the question as to whether the municipality was indeed liable in the particular case , and had to proceed on the basis that it was .", "As to the amount of compensation , the relevant principles in tort law mandated that it had to be determined by reference to the moment when the loss had occurred . In the applicant \u2019s case the loss had occurred no later than the date on which the applicant had brought her action against the municipality . In a separate decision dated DATE , the court ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL in court fees in respect of the appeal proceedings .", "The applicant \u2019s ensuing appeal on points of law was rejected by ORG on DATE . The court stated , inter alia , that the lower courts had applied correctly the relevant law concerning the relevant date for the assessment of the actual damage . Their conclusions were in conformity with the settled judicial practice .", "The applicant has not submitted a calculation on the final amount of the compensation and interest due to her under the final judgment of ORG . Seeing that DATE the statutory interest rate in GPE was very high , reaching PERCENT per annum in DATE , that amount must have been not lower than the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
