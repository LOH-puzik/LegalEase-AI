At TIME on DATE the CARDINAL members of the rapid response force of ORG were training just outside town . They spotted at a distance Mr PERSON , aged sixtytwo at the time , and PERSON , who were testing a homemade metal detector . The leader of the team , lieutenant PERSON , assumed that the CARDINAL were treasurehunters and sent a party to verify his suspicion . CARDINAL police officers approached PERSON , while CARDINAL others , chief sergeants PERSON and PERSON , moved towards Mr PERSON . None of the officers was in uniform . Chief sergeants PERSON and PERSON reached Mr PERSON as he was trying to hide a hoe in nearby bushes . Surprised by the sudden appearance of the CARDINAL men , Mr PERSON did not throw the hoe away , but held it in front of him , taking a defensive posture . Chief sergeant PERSON brusquely pulled it out of his hands and threw it to a safe distance . Each of the officers then proceeded to deliver blows to PERSON PERSON 's head . They then brought him to the ground , handcuffed him , and took him to their colleagues . A car was called and Mr PERSON and Mr GPE , who had also been apprehended , were taken to the LOC of ORG . At TIME , while waiting to be questioned on the precinct LOC , Mr PERSON fainted . An ambulance was subsequently called and he was taken to hospital , where it was found that he had slipped into a coma .", "CARDINAL .

He noted , inter alia , that all of the officers had denied any wrongdoing , in spite of the evidence to the contrary , had drawn no lessons from their act and had shown no signs of remorse . He also noted that chief sergeant PERSON and one of the officers who had assaulted Mr N.R. had been charged with inflicting light bodily harm on another person on DATE , DATE before the act in issue in the proceedings . Reflecting on the conditions which had led to the perpetration of the alleged offences , the investigator expressed the opinion that these were \u201c the recent increase in crime which ha[d ] led lawenforcement officers to suspect a criminal intent in all citizens until proven otherwise ; the physicality of their training at the [ police officers ' school in the town of GPE ] , where DATE , they [ we]re instructed in how to deal with violent resistance but [ we]re inadequately trained on the legal aspects of law enforcement , a practice that ha[d ] been maintained within the newlyformed rapid response force centre in GPE , as evidenced by the curriculum attached to the case file : it abound[ed ] in physical training classes and lack[ed ] any classes in legal training ; the sense of authority that the law - enforcement officers ha[d ] over the public , who [ were ] expected to show unconditional submission with no regard to their own rights and interests and with no regard to their dignity and inviolability as citizens ; the sense of impunity ; the absence of any eyewitnesses to the CARDINAL offences , committed in a forested area out of the public 's sight , and the hope that all [ would ] be covered up \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE the military investigator in charge of the case was transferred to another post . For this reason , on DATE the case was assigned to another military investigator .", "CARDINAL . Having concluded his work on the case , on DATE the investigator drew up his final report , proposing that chief sergeants PERSON and PERSON be committed for trial .

On DATE ORG issued an indictment against chief sergeants ORG and PERSON It noted , inter alia , that on DATE chief sergeant PERSON had resigned from the police force and that chief sergeant PERSON was still on the force , assigned as a guard in a commercial bank . Concerning the factors which had led to the perpetration of the offence , the prosecutor observed that these were \u201c the defendants ' sense of impunity as officers of the special force of the [ ORG ] , their lack of respect for human dignity and the health and inviolability of citizens and their habit of treating citizens as dummies for testing their physical force and abilities , which [ were ] only needed for apprehending dangerous criminals \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The trial at ORG started on an unspecified date in DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In his argument the public prosecutor noted that no disciplinary proceedings had taken place against chief sergeants PERSON and PERSON He requested that immediate custodial sentences , ranging CARDINAL imprisonment , be imposed . In their final statement the defendants said that they were not guilty and asked the court to acquit them .", "CARDINAL .

It also awarded the first applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , the second applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , and Mr PERSON 's son BGN CARDINAL,CARDINAL , payable jointly and severally by the CARDINAL officers . The court described in detail the events of DATE and held , as relevant :", "\u201c ... the act was committed negligently ... The case at hand concerns a complex offence , where the intention in respect of the lesser outcome is combined with negligence in respect of the more serious outcome , in other words , the offence was committed with both forms of mens rea ... The court is of the opinion that both of the defendants wilfully inflicted grievous bodily harm on [ Mr PERSON ] , which later brought about his death . The intentions must be judged through their actions . Taking into account the subjective attitude of the defendants towards their act , the court deems that their intention did not go beyond inflicting bodily harm . They merely behaved negligently in respect of the ensuing death . The objective analysis of the defendants ' conduct shows that they did not foresee the imminent death of [ Mr PERSON ] and neither wished nor envisaged a fatal outcome , their intention being solely to inflict bodily harm ...", "... The evidence in the case suggests that no persons other than the defendants were in physical contact with [ Mr PERSON ] ... All the traumatic injuries which were established were inflicted at the same time , in quick succession . The evidence shows that CARDINAL TIME on DATE in the area of LOC the defendants , ... , in their capacity as officers of ORG , arrested [ Mr PERSON ] using physical force , and in the process delivered numerous blows to his body , some of which were strong , as a result of their prior training in arrests . There is a direct and proximate causal link between the beating and [ Mr Nikolov']s traumatic injuries and the ensuing fatal outcome . In pursuing their direct aim of inflicting bodily harm on [ Mr PERSON ] , the defendants did not envisage the end result , but DATE in view of the force and the direction of the blows , they could have . It must however also be noted that , as members of the rapid response force , the defendants had acquired special skills for subduing and apprehending offenders . They were executing an order given by their immediate superior ... which included the arrest of [ Mr PERSON ] ... In this connection , the court finds that the conduct of the head of the team , lieutenant PERSON , is also reprehensible , because he was the individual who could and should have determined whether Mr PERSON and Mr GPE were offenders who had to be apprehended without fail . ...", "The causes and the conditions for the commission of the offence are the defendants ' feeling of impunity as members of the special force of ORG .", "In determining the type and the quantum of the penalty the court had regard both to the defendants ' young age and to their good character as mitigating circumstances .", "The court deemed the unlawful use of physical force as an aggravating circumstance .", "The court imposed the penalties having regard to the preponderance of mitigating circumstances ...", "Taking into account the personality of the offenders , the gravity of the offence , and the fact that the defendants have no prior convictions , and bearing in mind the aims of punishment ... the court considers that the penalties do not need to be served immediately . For this reason ... the serving of the sentences is postponed ... The main purpose of punishment in our law is general deterrence , which is achieved through the imposition of just punishment . In matching the severity of the punishment to the gravity of the offence [ the court ] must have regard to the personality of the offender as an additional factor . In the case of a suspended sentence , [ the court ] must put the emphasis on individual deterrence , namely reform of the offender . In the instant case , the court , having regard to the facts as established above , the type of mens rea involved DATE , and the low level of public threat of the QUANTITY offenders , who perpetrated their act in the relatively distant past , concludes that there is no need for the penalties of imprisonment to be served immediately in order to achieve the aims of the criminal law . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Both the applicants and the officers appealed to ORG . The applicants submitted that the sentence was too lenient and that the compensation awarded was too low . They argued that the lower court had erred in assessing the gravity of the offence and had wrongly opted for the minimum possible penalty . In their view , the officers ought to be sentenced to an effective prison term of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having held a hearing on DATE , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG partly upheld and partly reversed the lower court 's judgment . It increased the amount of compensation to BGN CARDINAL for the first applicant , ORG CARDINAL for the second applicant and ORG CARDINAL for Mr PERSON 's son , but upheld the sentence . The court described in detail the events of DATE and held that \u201c in view of the police officers ' numerical superiority , their younger age , their special training , the proximity of their colleagues , and the fact that in his further actions [ Mr ] PERSON [ had not ] resisted or refused to obey their lawful orders , the physical force used had been in breach of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW [ DATE ] , in force at the material time \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The court 's opinion continued , as relevant :", "\u201c The factual findings of the [ lower ] court are based on the evidence gathered and are fully accepted by [ this ] court . In view of the facts , the acts committed by the defendants were properly characterised as an offence under LAW ...", "I. Concerning the defendants ' appeal", "In the indictment the prosecution brought charges against the CARDINAL defendants for an offence ... committed in concert . The prosecution has not taken into consideration that the offence under LAW ORG is only negligent as regards the graver consequence [ death ] . Complicity in a criminal offence is only possible in respect of wilful offences , as it presupposes the joint wilful participation of CARDINAL or more persons , whose actions lead in their entirety to the perpetration of the offence , provided always that these persons realise that they are acting in concert with others . The actus reus of the offence under LAW [ LAW ] is complex . The intention to achieve the lesser outcome [ bodily harm ] is combined with negligence in respect of the graver outcome , i.e. the offence is committed with differing types of mens rea , which excludes the possibility of complicity .", "...", "The defendants ' objection concerning the unfoundedness of the lower court 's judgment as regards the authors of the offence is groundless . The experts ' conclusion is that the cranial and cerebral traumas were caused by CARDINAL separate blows to the head , with or against a solid object , delivered with considerable force . The experts provide CARDINAL explanations as to its possible source . According to the first explanation , CARDINAL blow was to the head , either on the left temple or on the right occiput , followed by DATE to the ground and a further blow to the opposite side . According to the second explanation , the CARDINAL injuries may be due to CARDINAL separate consecutive blows with a blunt , solid object . The experts categorically exclude the possibility that the blows were inflicted with the sharp ( metal ) part of the hoe ...", "The [ lower ] court was correct in accepting the second explanation , which is supported by the remaining evidence ... In their statements , including those made at the trial , the CARDINAL defendants admit the fact that they acted violently in apprehending [ Mr ] GPE . ... [ B]oth defendants state that the victim did not fall on the ground at any point . Both aver that [ Mr ] PERSON was standing or squatting . It was therefore impossible for one of the injuries ... to have been the result of a fall to the ground .", "The defendants ' assertion that the victim 's death was the result of light and not grievous bodily harm , as accepted by the [ lower ] court , is groundless and completely unsubstantiated . The conclusions of both medical expert reports are categorical on the point that the heavy cranial and cerebral trauma has in itself resulted in a continuing overall lifeendangering disruption to health , i.e. it corresponded to the medical and biological indications of grievous bodily harm .", "The [ lower ] court has correctly found that the CARDINAL defendants wilfully inflicted grievous bodily harm resulting in death . Its reasoning regarding the intention to inflict bodily harm and the negligence as regards the final result \u2013 death DATE are convincing and fully accepted by [ this ] court , so there is no need to repeat them .", "...", "II . Concerning the [ applicants ' ] appeal", "The appeal is partially well - founded . The punishments imposed DATE imprisonment \u2013 although the minimum possible by law , are not disproportionately lenient . The [ lower ] court has examined and taken account of all the factors which are material in determining the sentence . On the one hand , it is true that a human life was taken in a situation which did not call for the use of such intense physical violence in respect of [ Mr ] PERSON . On the other hand , the defendants have no prior convictions , are of good character , each of them administered CARDINAL blow to the head of the victim , the death was caused negligently , the [ defendants ] acted with a view to arresting an offender pursuant to the direct orders of their immediate superior , [ Mr ] PERSON did not initially obey and did not throw away the hoe which he was holding and the defendants were discharged from the [ police ] . In view of all this the [ court ] finds that the [ lower ] court 's conclusions as to the quantum of the penalties are wellfounded , as is its conclusion that the correction and reform of the defendants do not call for the imposition of an immediate custodial sentence .", "The appeal is ... wellfounded as regards [ the amount of compensation awarded ] . The quantum of the compensation for non - pecuniary damage is to be determined at the time of delivery of the judgment . At present the courts ' practice is to allow claims in respect of nonpecuniary damage for amounts higher than the claims submitted by the [ applicants ] . For this reason the [ court ] finds that the judgment should be revised , by increasing the sums awarded to each of the applicants up to the full amount of their claims . This level of compensation will reflect the actual pain and suffering which [ the applicants ] have sustained from the loss of their relative . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Both the applicants and the police officers appealed to ORG . The applicants again submitted , inter alia , that the suspended sentence was too lenient . They argued that the lower court 's characterisation of chief sergeant PERSON as a person \u201c of good character \u201d was questionable as he had been charged with the battery of a detainee DATE before the beating of PERSON . The police officers submitted , inter alia , that the lower courts had imposed a very severe punishment .", "CARDINAL . Having held a hearing on DATE , in a final judgment of DATE ORG upheld the lower court 's judgment in the following terms :", "\u201c As regards the [ applicants ' ] appeal :", "It is being argued that the [ lower ] courts have erred in ordering the suspension of the sentences of the CARDINAL defendants , and a request is made to order that they serve their sentences .", "This ground of appeal ... is not supported by the materials in the case file and is illfounded . In applying LAW , [ the lower courts ] have weighed all the factors relating to the individual and general deterrence functions [ of the criminal law ] . Taking into consideration [ the defendants ' ] clean criminal record , their good character , the manner in which the offence was committed , namely CARDINAL blow each , the form of the mens rea , namely , negligence by each of the defendants , the behaviour of the victim , and in view of the aims of the punishment ... , the conclusion that the correction and reform of the defendants does not call for the sentence is lawful . This court fully shares it ...", "As regards the appeal by the CARDINAL defendants :", "The grounds of appeal are a breach of the substantive law and the obvious inequity of the sentences imposed and compensation awarded", "Bearing in mind the [ lower courts ' ] findings of fact , which are not subject to review [ by this court ] , this court is of the view that the argument of a violation of the substantive law is unfounded and not supported by the materials in the case file . The authorship of the offence has been proven beyond doubt , and the legal characterisation is correct . Each of the accused ... has executed all the elements of the offence under LAW . The evidence \u2013 the statements of the defendants , the witness testimony , combined with the medical expert report and the other written evidence , correctly assessed by both levels of jurisdication ... has led them to hold that the CARDINAL have committed the offence independently of each other , in their capacity of police officers on active duty , in connection with the performance of their duties , thus negligently bringing about the death of [ Mr PERSON ] by wilfully causing him grievous bodily harm . The personal conviction of the courts has been based on objective , comprehensive and complete assessment of all the facts of the case , which have been subjected to a serious and through analysis . In view of the facts , as thus established by the appellate court , the conclusions concerning the actus reus and the mens rea are lawful .", "In this connection , the defendants ' objection that death resulted from light bodily harm is unfounded . An identical objection was made before the appellate court , which reviewed it and ultimately rejected it . The reasons given are detailed and based on the evidence , and therefore shared by this court .", "...", "The arguments concerning the obvious inequity of the sentences imposed and compensations awarded are likewise groundless . In determining the punishment of the CARDINAL defendants , [ the lower courts ] analysed all the mitigating and aggravating circumstances . They correctly found a preponderance of the former and have imposed [ a minimal suspended sentence , within the bounds provided for by law ] . Extra lenience would be unwarranted , as it would not further [ the deterrent and reforming purposes of the criminal law ] .", "The amounts of compensation are likewise equitable . The reparation of the nonpecuniary damage resulting from the offence is assessed by the court on the basis of the facts of the case and the principles of equity ... Taking into account the pain and suffering as well as the irreversibility of the loss sustained , this court considers that the amount set by the [ lower ] court is just and would recompense the [ applicants ] to the utmost degree . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants obtained writs of execution against the QUANTITY police officers on DATE . As the latter apparently refused to pay the applicants of their own accord , on DATE the applicants issued enforcement proceedings against them . During the period DATE the enforcement judge at ORG tried to collect the amounts from the CARDINAL officers , but to no avail , since the officers did not own any seizable assets . For this reason the CARDINAL enforcement proceedings were discontinued towards DATE at the applicants ' request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL applicants and Mr PERSON 's son brought a tort action against ORG and ORG before ORG .

These judgments , which assessed the applicants ' nonpecuniary damage at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL respectively , were binding on the civil court . The court further noted that the applicants had not been able to collect the awards made in the criminal proceedings and concluded that this called for an award of damages to be paid by the entity which was vicariously liable for the police officers ' actions . It observed however that the applicants had claimed lesser amounts DATE BGN CARDINAL and ORG DATE and it was therefore unable to increase the amount of the awards .", "CARDINAL .
