The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants live together in a homosexual relationship . The second applicant is a civil servant and , for the purpose of accident and sickness insurance cover , he is insured with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( PERSON ) . On DATE the first applicant asked the ORG to recognise him as the dependent ( Angeh\u00f6riger ) and to extend the second applicant 's insurance cover to include him . He submitted that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( FAC ) only referred to persons of the opposite sex living with the principally insured person and running the common household without receiving any payment . But , because there were no good reasons for excluding persons living in a homosexual relationship from the privilege of extended insurance cover , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) should be interpreted as also including homosexual partners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the request , holding that , because the first applicant was of the same sex as the second applicant , his request had to be dismissed . This decision was served on the second applicant who , on DATE , filed an objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of GPE , acting as the Regional Governor , quashed the decision on procedural grounds . He held that the ORG should have served its decision on the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed a request by the first applicant and this time served the decision on him . The first applicant filed objections .", "CARDINAL . NORP The mayor of GPE confirmed the ORG 's decision on DATE . Thereupon the first applicant lodged a complaint with ORG in which he argued that the exclusion , under section CARDINAL ) of the ORG , of homosexual couples from the extension of insurance cover was in breach of LAW , read in conjunction with LAW , of the LAW and was therefore unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to deal with the first applicant 's complaint . Referring to its previous case - law , ORG found that , in the issue at hand , the legislator had had a very wide margin in which to reach a decision and the decision taken had been within that margin .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG granted a request by the first applicant for the case to be transferred to ORG . On DATE the first applicant supplemented his complaint to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant 's complaint . It found that the authorities had correctly concluded that section CARDINAL ) of the ORG only applied to heterosexual partnerships . There was no issue under LAW , read in conjunction with LAW , because LAW did not guarantee specific social rights , and the case at issue did not therefore fall within the ambit of that provision . The exclusion of homosexual partnerships from the scope of section CARDINAL ) of the ORG also complied with the principle of equality because that difference in treatment was justified . While it was true that , where persons of different sex living together in a household in which CARDINAL of them was running that household while not being gainfully employed , it was , as a rule , safe to conclude that they were cohabiting in a partnership , that was not the case if QUANTITY persons of the same sex were living together in a household . In the absence of any possibility to register a homosexual partnership , it would have been necessary to undertake delicate enquiries into the most intimate sphere of the person concerned . That difference in the factual situation justified different treatment in law .", "CARDINAL . NORP In proceedings instituted by ORG to examine the constitutionality of CARDINAL similar provisions to section CARDINAL ) of the ORG relating to extending insurance cover to relatives , on DATE ORG decided to quash section CARDINAL(CARDINALb ) of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) ( Allgemeines Sozial - versicherungsgesetz ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) ( Gewerbliches Sozialversicherungsgesetz ) . ORG explicitly referred to the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . PERSON , DATE ) and held that the CARDINAL provisions in which the extension of insurance cover to unrelated persons living with the insured were discriminatory because they were restricted to persons of the opposite sex .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW ( \u201c the SRAA \u201d ) ( Sozialrechts - \u00c4nderungsgesetz ) entered into force amending in particular the ORG , the ORG and also section CARDINAL of the ORG . A second amendment to section CARDINAL of the ORG entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Before DATE section CARDINAL ) of ORG ( Beamten- , Kranken- und Unfallversicherungs - gesetz ) , in so far as relevant , provided as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Relatives are entitled to benefits , if they have their ordinary residence in GPE and are neither health insured under the provisions of this LAW nor any other provision of law ...", "...", "( CARDINAL ) A person belonging to the group of parents , ... step - parents and foster parents , children , ... stepchildren and foster children , grandchildren or brothers and sisters of the insured or a person of the opposite sex who is not related to him or her who has been living with him or her in the same household for DATE and since then has been doing the domestic work for the insured without payment , unless there is a spouse living in the same household who is able to work , shall be regarded as a member of the household . Only CARDINAL person can be a member in this sense . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After the amendment to ORG on DATE , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) remained the same , but a new paragraph ( CARDINAL ) was introduced . It read as follows ;", "\u201c A person who is not a relative of the insured and who has been living with him or her in the same household for DATE and since then is doing the domestic work for him or her without payment , unless there is a spouse living in the same household who is able to work , shall be regarded as a member of the common household , if", "( a ) he or she is bringing up CARDINAL or more children living in the same household ... or did so for DATE ;", "( b ) he or she is entitled to benefits for the payment of nursing care ( at least level CARDINAL ) pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG or pursuant to the provisions of ORG ;", "( c ) he or she is doing nursing work for the insured who is entitled to benefits ( at least level CARDINAL ) for the payment of nursing care pursuant to ORG or pursuant to the provisions of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE a further amendment to ORG entered into force . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) no longer applied to non - related persons , but only to relatives of the insured . The newly introduced paragraph CARDINAL was only slightly modified . These provisions , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person belonging to the group of parents , ... step - parents and foster parents , children , ... stepchildren and foster children , grandchildren or brothers and sisters of the insured who has been living with him or her in the same household for DATE and since then has been doing the domestic work for the insured without payment , unless there is a spouse living in the same household who is able to work , shall be regarded as a member of the household .
