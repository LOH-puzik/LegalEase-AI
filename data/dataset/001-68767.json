His religious beliefs were deeply held and he had a desire to convert others to his way of thinking .", "During DATE , PERSON had a large double - sided sign made , bearing the words \u201c Stop Immorality \u201d , \u201c Stop Homosexuality \u201d and \u201c Stop Lesbianism \u201d . The sign , attached to a pole , also bore in each corner the words \u201c PERSON is Lord \u201d .", "Prior to CARDINAL DATE PERSON had on CARDINAL occasion preached in public while displaying the sign and had received a hostile reaction from members of the public , some of whom attempted to deface or destroy the sign .", "On TIME , DATE , PERSON travelled by bus into GPE . He covered the sign with a plastic bin liner for the trip as he believed , in light of previous reactions , that it might provoke a disturbance if displayed inside the bus . He then took up position in FAC , a pedestrian area of the town centre , and began preaching , holding up the sign .", "A group of CARDINAL people gathered around him , arguing and shouting .

A struggle ensued during which PERSON fell to the ground . He got up and continued preaching , holding up the sign . At this point , someone poured water over his head .", "CARDINAL police constables , PERSON and PERSON , arrived at the scene . PC PERSON found the crowd to be angry , agitated and insulted .

In their statement of case dated DATE , amended on DATE , the magistrates declared that they had considered his Convention rights but found that there had been a pressing social need to restrict his freedom of expression to prevent disorder .

The sign was displayed in the town centre on a DATE TIME , provoking hostility from members of the public .", "( e ) The interference with the appellant 's right to freedom of expression by prosecuting him was a proportionate response in view of the fact that his behaviour went beyond legitimate protest , was provoking violence and interfered with the rights of others .", "( f ) Although the appellant knew that insult , distress and disturbance were likely to be caused by using the placard , having received a similar reaction in the past , he refused to put away the sign or leave at PC PERSON 's request .", "On DATE PERSON died . The executors of his estate were granted permission on DATE to continue the appeal .", "After a hearing on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal .", "Lord Justice May held , inter alia :", "\u201c ... The essential grounds of appeal ... are firstly that the justices were wrong and misdirected themselves in finding that the words on the sign were insulting and secondly , that a proper reading of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG should have led to the conclusion that the appellant should have been acquitted of this offence . The precise intellectual route by means of which that , it is submitted , should be achieved can , in my judgment , be addressed by reference to the question of reasonableness . ...", "... It is submitted that no reasonable tribunal of fact could conclude that the words on the sign went beyond legitimate expression and that they were something more than an affront or disrespectful is not sustained . There is no element of stereotyping , no element of gratuitous or gross abuse . ...", "... I have not found this question easy because it is certainly correct that the words on the sign are short and , so far as they go , are not expressed in intemperate language . ... but I come to the clear conclusion that it was open to the magistrates to reach the conclusion they did , not least because the words appear to relate homosexuality and lesbianism with immorality . The justices themselves take this into consideration when they say that the words on the appellant 's sign were directed specifically towards the homosexual and lesbian community , implying that they were immoral . Accordingly , not without hesitation , I have reached the conclusion that it was open to the justices to reach the conclusion ... that these words on the sign were , in fact , insulting .", "I have also considered whether in light of LAW , in particular but also taking account of LAW , the justices should have concluded that Mr Hammond had established that his conduct was reasonable . He was , after all , according to his understanding , exercising his right of freedom of expression of views which may or may not have been acceptable to those who were passing by but , nevertheless , one had to bear in mind the cardinal importance of freedom of expression in a society such as ours . Nevertheless , I have concluded that the justices in their reasons have not only considered the questions which they were obliged to consider ... and have reached a conclusion that it was open to them to reach , for the reasons they gave , that the appellant 's conduct was not reasonable . \u201d", "ORG refused to certify that a point of law of public importance arose to be considered by ORG . Its decision was therefore final .", "The relevant parts of LAW provide :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person is guilty of an offence if he \u2013", "...", "( b ) displays any writing or sign or other visible representation which is threatening , abusive or insulting ,", "within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment , alarm or distress thereby .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) It is a defence for the accused to prove \u2013", "...", "( c ) that his conduct was reasonable . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL is relevant as regards the mental element . Section CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c A person is guilty of an offence under section CARDINAL only if he intends his words or behaviour , or the writing , sign or other visible representation , to be threatening , abusive or insulting , or is aware that it may be threatening , abusive or insulting or ( as the case may ) he intends his behaviour to be or is aware that it may be disorderly . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
