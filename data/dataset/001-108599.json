On DATE , in GPE , GPE , PERSON was killed by a gunshot wound to the head in the course of a robbery .", "The first applicant was subsequently arrested for the murder of Mr PERSON and , on DATE , was indicted for first degree murder and attempted robbery with a firearm . On DATE the prosecution filed a notice that they intended to seek the death penalty for the charge of first degree murder ; that notice was subsequently withdrawn . According to an affidavit filed in support of the GPE extradition request by Mr PERSON , Assistant ORG Attorney ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the prosecution case is based upon the testimony of a co - accused , Mr PERSON , who has since confessed and become a witness for the prosecution . His evidence is that he and the first applicant arranged for Mr PERSON to purchase marijuana from the first applicant . A meeting was arranged for delivery and payment . Mr PERSON and the first applicant arrived at the meeting wearing masks . According to PERSON , the first applicant brandished a rifle and , when Mr PERSON refused to hand over the money , the first applicant shot him in the head . Mr PERSON and the first applicant fled the scene , washed blood from their car at a carwash and threw the rifle in a river . The prosecution further rely on ballistics evidence , and other witnesses whom they intend to call at trial to prove that the applicant planned the robbery and left his residence with a gun shortly before the robbery and killing .", "The applicant maintains that initial police reports into Mr Hayes\u2019 murder record PERSON as stating that he , the first applicant , hit Mr PERSON in the head with the gun and the gun went off . The police reports also directly refer to the killing as CARDINAL of \u201c felony murder \u201d . ( The GPE \u201c felony murder rule \u201d allows a defendant to be convicted of murder , even if there was no premeditation on his part , if he committed or was attempting to commit a serious felony offence ( including armed robbery ) at the time of the killing : see relevant GPE law at paragraph CARDINAL below . ) The applicant also maintains that the medical examiner \u2019s report on Mr Hayes\u2019 injuries demonstrates that the injuries are consistent with the gun going off accidentally . However , the first applicant denies being present at the fatal incident : he alleges that he only lent his car to CARDINAL of those present , a Mr Randle , who went on to participate in the fatal robbery of PERSON .", "After he was indicted , the applicant was released on bail and ordered to appear before the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant was arrested in GPE following a fatal car accident , for which he was subsequently sentenced to DATE imprisonment . An extradition request was made by ORG on DATE . In an affidavit provided in support of the extradition request , Mr PERSON , Assistant ORG Attorney , confirmed that the notice of intention to seek the death penalty had been withdrawn and that the prosecution sought a life sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the District Judge sitting at FAC concluded that the evidence established a prima facie case against the first applicant and ordered that he be committed to prison to await the decision of the Secretary of ORG as to his surrender to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a Diplomatic Note issued on DATE ORG assured ORG that , based on an assurance ORG had received from the ORG Attorney of ORG , the death penalty would not be sought or imposed on the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG refused the first applicant \u2019s representations and ordered his surrender . On the basis of the assurance from ORG , the Secretary of ORG concluded that the death penalty would not be imposed on the first applicant and that extradition would not otherwise violate the first applicant \u2019s rights under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision by ORG . He argued inter alia that the assurance contained in the Diplomatic Note was inadequate because it had been issued by ORG whereas the prosecution would be conducted by ORG and only an assurance from the ORG Governor would suffice . He further argued that the trial court in GPE was enabled by the applicable criminal procedure to consider the imposition of the death penalty irrespective of whether or not it was sought by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . A further affidavit was then submitted by the GPE Assistant ORG Attorney , Mr PERSON , who stated that , as a matter of long - standing practice , the trial court would not conduct a sentencing hearing to decide whether to impose the death penalty when the ORG Attorney did not seek the death penalty ; even if it were to do so , the ORG Attorney would not present any evidence in support of the death penalty , meaning that there would be no basis upon which the trial court could find there were sufficient aggravating circumstances to warrant the death penalty . Mr GPE therefore stated that the first applicant would not be subjected to the death penalty if he were convicted of first degree felony murder .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this affidavit , and on the further basis that the Diplomatic Note was clear and binding as a matter of international law , ORG found there was no real risk of the death penalty and accordingly refused the application for judicial review . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , it also refused the first applicant \u2019s application for certification of a point of law and permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitor informed the Secretary of ORG that an application had been made to ORG for reconsideration of its decision . He relied on the affidavit sworn by an NORP attorney , which stated that the trial court could in fact impose the death penalty if sufficient aggravating features were found to exist in the first applicant \u2019s case . By way of an order dated DATE , ORG Judge PERSON , the trial judge in the first applicant \u2019s case , stated that no death penalty sentencing proceedings would be held and therefore the maximum sentence that could be imposed would be life in prison . It does not appear that the first applicant made an application to ORG or that any such application was determined by that court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an application with this ORG and , on DATE , the President of the ORG to which the application was allocated decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG and to indicate to the Government of GPE that the applicant should not be extradited until further notice . It was also decided , under LAW ) , that notice of the application should be given to ORG of GPE and that the Government should be invited to submit written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case , including on whether any life sentence imposed on the first applicant would be compatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . After the Government \u2019s observations had been received , the first applicant indicated that he had submitted fresh representations to the Secretary of ORG on the issue of the imposition of a life sentence . Those representations were made on DATE . Further submissions were made in the light of the ORG of Lords\u2019 judgment in GPE v. the Secretary of ORG for ORG ( see paragraphs DATE CARDINAL below ) on DATE , DATE and DATE . Proceedings before this Court were therefore adjourned while those representations were considered by the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG refused the first applicant \u2019s representations on DATE , relying in particular on this ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , DATE and the GPE judgment , cited above . He noted that , on the basis of information provided by the first applicant and the United States\u2019 authorities , DATE the Governor had commuted the sentences of CARDINAL defendants who had been convicted of first - degree murder . Although he was not constrained as to the factors he could take into account in granting clemency , the Governor took in account inter alia the nature of the offence and any history of mental instability . Moreover , the sentence of life imprisonment without parole had only been introduced in DATE . It was not unrealistic to assume that defendants who had received that sentence would be expected to serve CARDINAL to fifteen years before being considered for clemency and thus it was immaterial that the Governor had not granted clemency to anyone who had been given that sentence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG also had regard to the first applicant \u2019s representations that GPE law allowed for the imposition of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole either for : ( i ) premeditated murder ; or ( ii ) if the defendant committed or was attempting to commit a serious felony offence ( including armed robbery ) at the time the person was killed ( the \u201c felony murder rule \u201d ) . Having regard to the circumstances of the crime of which the first applicant had been accused , the Secretary of ORG was not satisfied that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole , even as a result of the felony murder rule , was grossly disproportionate . This conclusion was not altered by the applicant \u2019s young age at the time of the offence , or the fact that he had submitted a psychiatric report , which showed he suffered from a severe personality disorder , with features of narcissistic and borderline personality disorders . Both these factors amounted to only limited mitigation . The Secretary of ORG was also satisfied that no separate issues arose under LAW in respect of life imprisonment without parole or the felony murder rule .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant sought judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision , arguing that mandatory life imprisonment without parole as a consequence of the felony murder rule would be in violation of LAW . ORG dismissed that application on DATE ( [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON ( with whom Mr Justice PERSON agreed ) considered it to be \u201c wholly unreal \u201d that the first applicant could be tried in GPE and GPE . He also applied the approach taken by ORG in GPE and , on the evidence before the court , concluded that the only mechanism for release of the first applicant was by clemency or conditional release on compassionate medical grounds . However , the clemency procedure had been from time to time exercised , despite the first applicant \u2019s submission that it was subject to political pressure . The fact that no one convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole had been granted clemency did not mean that there was no prospect of clemency being granted in the future to someone thus sentenced . Lord Justice PERSON accepted the Secretary of ORG \u2019s submission that , given that the sentence had only existed since DATE , it was unsurprising that no one sentenced to life imprisonment without parole had yet been granted clemency .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the felony murder rule , Lord Justice PERSON found that the evidence showed that it was likely that , at trial , the prosecution would seek to argue that the first applicant \u2019s shooting of Mr PERSON was a premeditated killing . There was , however , also a realistic possibility that the first applicant could be convicted by way of the felony murder rule and the prosecution was not bound to put the matter higher . Lord Justice PERSON observed , however , that :", "\u201c [ T]he only \u2018 accident\u2019 involved is the accidental discharge of the loaded and cocked firearm . The killing would thus not have been premeditated but would have resulted from a serious and most dangerous assault , committed in the course of a robbery . Insofar as it is permissible to have regard to LANGUAGE PERSON ( as furnishing no more than a frame of reference ) , the most likely outcome , on that factual assumption , would be a conviction for manslaughter . Moreover , it would involve a very grave case of manslaughter indeed ... On the material before us , it is fanciful to contemplate a complete acquittal on the basis of ( true ) \u2018 accident\u2019 . \u201d", "He concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . First and importantly , it is necessary to clarify the ambit of the argument before this ORG . It is not contended on behalf of Mr. PERSON that the GPE felony murder rule is unconstitutional on the ground of arbitrariness or its potential application to a wide range of circumstances and in cases of ( relatively ) low culpability . [ Counsel \u2019s ] submission is instead confined to the contention that , on the facts of this case , the possible conviction of Mr. PERSON by way of the GPE felony murder [ rule ] means that his extradition would be incompatible with Art . CARDINAL . It follows that some of [ counsel \u2019s ] more graphic examples of the scope of application of the GPE felony murder rule ( e.g. , to a man sentenced to ORG [ life imprisonment without parole ] after lending his car to friends to commit a burglary , in the course of which a woman was killed ) , can be put to CARDINAL side . ORG is concerned with the facts of this case and no question arises of accessory liability , remote from the killing ; Mr. PERSON alleged role was plainly that of principal .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the scope of the debate in this case has now been clarified . Realistically , for reasons already canvassed , this case is concerned with the possibility that Mr. PERSON will be convicted by way of the GPE felony murder rule for conduct ( at best for Mr. PERSON ) akin to manslaughter in the course of an armed robbery in this jurisdiction . It is fanciful to contemplate Mr. PERSON being at risk of conviction for what was an \u2018 accident\u2019 truly so called ; on any realistic view , there was no such \u2018 accident\u2019 here .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , it is of course a matter for the sentencing policy of the ORG of GPE whether mandatory ORG is an appropriate sentence for the crime committed in this case , if Mr. PERSON is convicted . Bearing in mind that this ORG is not engaged in a comparative sentencing exercise , it is helpful to keep the following matters in mind when considering whether , seen through \u2018 the prism of an application for LOC ( GPE , supra , at [ CARDINAL ] ) the potential GPE sentence should be seen as clearly disproportionate :", "i ) As this ORG is only concerned with the facts of this case , the mandatory nature of the sentence does not carry the significance which it might , had the Court been engaged in some wider review of the law in question .", "ii ) The ( alleged ) facts of the present case are shocking indeed . However analysed , should Mr. PERSON be convicted , he will have committed a grave crime ; even on the most favourable ( realistic ) view of the facts for Mr. PERSON , his culpability will be high . On the ( alleged ) facts of this case , a severe sentence would be a punishment fitting the crime .", "iii ) To the extent that it matters , it would be wrong to underestimate the likely sentence Mr. PERSON would face in this country , even were he convicted \u201c only \u201d of manslaughter rather than murder . It is probable that he would receive an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection ( \u201c IPP \u201d ) , although the possibility of a life sentence can not be excluded . In any event , so far as concerned the notional determinate element of an ORG or a determinate sentence if it stood alone , on the conduct alleged in the present case , Mr. PERSON could expect a significant sentence well into double figures .", "CARDINAL . Fourthly , against this background , I am unable to conclude that the imposition in the GPE of a sentence of ORG on Mr. PERSON would be clearly disproportionate , although it would not be a sentence passed here . Given Mr. PERSON ( alleged ) conduct , it would not be a sentence which \u2018 shocked the conscience\u2019 . On any view , that the killing occurred in the course of an armed robbery is a most serious aggravating factor , made , if anything , yet more grave by the ( alleged ) fact that the loaded rifle had been cocked by Mr. PERSON before getting out of his car .", "CARDINAL . Fifthly , although I have carefully considered Mr. Harkins\u2019 age at the time of the incident ( he was DATE ) , I am not dissuaded by that factor from the conclusion to which I am otherwise minded to come .", "CARDINAL . Sixthly , on the evidence and as already discussed , the sentence of ORG is not irreducible . The significance of this feature for the Art . CARDINAL jurisprudence was highlighted above . However , even if , contrary to my conclusion , the sentence was irreducible , on the ( alleged ) facts of this case , I would not regard the imposition of an irreducible sentence of ORG as clearly disproportionate and thus in violation of Art . DATE whatever questions might arise at some point in the course of Mr. Harkins\u2019 detention .", "CARDINAL . Pulling the threads together , the case of Mr. PERSON does involve a young ( alleged ) offender , facing a mandatory sentence of ORG . But , as the ORG is solely concerned with the facts of this case , the mandatory nature of the sentence does not have the wider significance which might otherwise attach to it . Should he be convicted , Mr. PERSON will , on any ( realistic ) view , have committed a grave crime with high culpability . The sentence of ORG is manifestly severe and different from the sentence he would face in this jurisdiction DATE but it can not be seen as clearly disproportionate . It is , moreover , not irreducible , though even if it was , the imposition of the sentence per se would not be incompatible with Art . CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first applicant then applied to ORG for a certificate of points of law of general public importance and for leave to appeal to ORG . On DATE , ORG refused both applications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a grand jury in GPE , GPE returned an indictment against the second applicant on CARDINAL counts , relating to the death of a Mr PERSON , the non - fatal shooting of a second man , Mr PERSON , and assault of a third man , Mr PERSON . The first count of the indictment is murder in the first degree of Mr PERSON . The second count is attempted murder in the second degree of Mr PERSON . The third and fourth counts are alternatives to counts CARDINAL and CARDINAL , charging the applicant with murder in the second degree of PERSON and attempted murder in the second degree of Mr PERSON . Counts CARDINAL to CARDINAL charge the applicant with assault in the first degree upon the CARDINAL men . Counts eight to CARDINAL charge him with assault in the second degree upon the men and count CARDINAL charges him with using a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence .", "CARDINAL . The allegations giving rise to these counts are that , on TIME DATE , the second applicant , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON PERSON were at the apartment of a friend . The second applicant began to argue with PERSON and PERSON who had made fun of his small stature and feminine appearance . The second applicant left the apartment and later returned with CARDINAL other men . Mr PERSON told the police that , while he was restrained by CARDINAL of the other men in the kitchen , the second applicant produced a handgun and went into the living room . Shots were then fired which left Mr PERSON dead and Mr PERSON with a non - fatal gunshot wound to the head .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the second applicant was arrested in the GPE pursuant to a provisional warrant of arrest issued CARDINAL of LAW DATE . In an affidavit of DATE , Mr PERSON , an attorney of ORG Attorney for GPE , GPE , outlined the facts of the case and the charges against the applicant . On count one , he stated :", "\u201c Although a defendant convicted of first degree murder may , under certain circumstances , be subject to the death penalty , none of those circumstances exist in this case . Consequently , the maximum penalty is life in prison . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG in GPE issued Diplomatic Note No . CARDINAL , which requested the second applicant \u2019s extradition . The note specified that count one , first - degree murder , carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and that count CARDINAL , attempted first - degree murder , also carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment . Counts CARDINAL and CARDINAL each carried maximum penalties of DATE imprisonment . Counts CARDINAL to CARDINAL carried maximum penalties of DATE imprisonment ; counts CARDINAL to CARDINAL , CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ; and count TIME , twenty years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG certified that the extradition request was valid . In a decision given on DATE , the District Judge , sitting at GPE ORG , ruled that the extradition could proceed . He held that , inter alia , the second applicant \u2019s extradition would not be incompatible with his rights under LAW since LAW stated that it was for ORG to seek the death penalty and the extradition request clearly indicated that it would not do so . The District Judge accordingly sent the case to the Secretary of ORG for his decision as to whether the applicant should be extradited .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG issued a further Diplomatic Note in respect of the second applicant , which assured ORG that the second applicant was not subject to the death penalty , the death penalty would not be sought or carried out against him upon his extradition to GPE , and that the Government of GPE has been assured of the same by the Deputy State Attorney of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG ordered the second applicant \u2019s extradition . The second applicant appealed to ORG , inter alia , on the ground that a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a second affidavit in support of the extradition , Mr PERSON provided further details of the sentence for first - degree murder under GPE law . He stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . This particular case qualifies for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment under PERSON . Criminal Law \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL(b ) . The Death Penalty does not apply .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has the option of filing a notice to the Defendant that it will seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole , which entitles the sentencing court to consider a sentence of life without parole , but does not require that the sentencing court impose such a sentence .", "CARDINAL . Given the heinous nature of the instant case , which the ORG characterizes as ORG ] \u2018 execution style\u2019 homicide , which claimed CARDINAL life , and seriously and permanently injured a second victim , the ORG anticipates that it will seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole under GPE PERSON . Criminal Law \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL and \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the instant case , in the event that the ORG did in fact file its notice of intention to seek life without parole , the trial judge would be the sole sentencing authority , and would have the discretion to seek a sentence of :", "- life without the possibility of parole ;", "- life with the possibility of parole ;", "- life with the possibility of parole , with all but a certain number of DATE suspended , followed by DATE of probation .", "CARDINAL . In the undersigned \u2019s experience , there is no way to accurately predict what sentence a defendant will face if convicted of first degree murder . \u201d", "Mr PERSON added that a person convicted of first - degree murder was entitled to a pre - sentencing investigation . This involved a report from ORG on the defendant and included information received from the victims . There was also the right to apply for review of the sentencing by the sentencing judge and thereafter review by CARDINAL other judges of the circuit . Mr PERSON also stated he was unprepared to offer an opinion on any mitigating factors which might affect the second applicant \u2019s sentence if convicted of first - degree murder . He continued :", "\u201c In general terms , ORG [ the county where the second applicant would be tried ] has considered as mitigating factors several known attributes possessed by Mr PERSON : youth and lack of serious criminal history . The single biggest mitigating factor in regard to whether a Defendant receives life without parole would be an acceptance of responsibility upon the part of a given defendant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the second applicant accepted that his ground of appeal based on LAW was precluded by the ORG of Lords\u2019 ruling in NORP v. PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and conceded that it had to be dismissed . On DATE , the High Court therefore dismissed the second applicant \u2019s appeal on this ground , allowing only his appeal that count CARDINAL of the indictment was not an extraditable offence . It also refused to certify a point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant lodged an application with this ORG and requested an interim measure to prevent his extradition . On DATE the President of the ORG to which this application was allocated decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG and indicate to the Government of GPE that the applicant should not be extradited until further notice .", "CARDINAL . For each applicant , the applicable bilateral treaty on extradition was the DATE GPE \u2013 USA Extradition Treaty ( now superseded by a DATE treaty ) . LAW DATE treaty provided that extradition could be refused unless the requesting ORG gave assurances satisfactory to the requested ORG that the death penalty would not be carried out .", "CARDINAL . GPE requested the extradition of GPE from GPE to stand trial in GPE on CARDINAL counts of murder in the first degree . In his appeal against extradition , Mr GPE argued that his surrender would violate LAW , on the basis that there was a real risk that he would be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in the form of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole .", "CARDINAL . In giving judgment in ORG ( [ DATE ] DATE ) ) , Lord Justice Laws found that there were \u201c powerful arguments of penal philosophy \u201d which suggested that risk of a whole - life sentence without parole intrinsically violated LAW . He observed :", "\u201c The abolition of the death penalty has been lauded , and justified , in many ways ; but it must have been founded at least on the premise that the life of every person , however depraved , has an inalienable value . The destruction of a life may be accepted in some special circumstances , such as self - defence or just war ; but retributive punishment is never enough to justify it . Yet a prisoner \u2019s incarceration without hope of release is in many respects in like case to a sentence of death . He can never atone for his offence . However he may use his incarceration as time for amendment of life , his punishment is only exhausted by his last breath . Like the death sentence the whole - life tariff is lex talionis . But its notional or actual symmetry with the crime for which it is visited on the prisoner ( the only virtue of the lex talionis ) is a poor guarantee of proportionate punishment , for the whole - life tariff is arbitrary : it may be measured in DATE or DATE according to how long the prisoner has to live . It is therefore liable to be disproportionate \u2013 the very vice which is condemned on LAW unless , of course , the death penalty \u2019s logic applies : the crime is so heinous it can never be atoned for . But in that case the supposed inalienable value of the prisoner \u2019s life is reduced , merely , to his survival : to nothing more than his drawing breath and being kept , no doubt , confined in decent circumstances . That is to pay lip - service to the value of life ; not to vouchsafe it . \u201d", "However , and \u201c not without misgivings \u201d , he considered that the relevant authorities , including those of this ORG , suggested an irreducible life sentence would not always raise an Article CARDINAL issue .", "CARDINAL . GPE \u2019s appeal from that judgment was heard by ORG and dismissed on DATE . Central to the appeal was paragraph CARDINAL of this ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE v. GPE , DATE , LAW , Series A no . CARDINAL , where the ORG stated that considerations in favour of extradition :", "\u201c .. must also be included among the factors to be taken into account in the interpretation and application of the notions of inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment in extradition cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A majority of their Lordships , Lord PERSON , ORG and Lord PERSON , found that , on the basis of this paragraph , in the extradition context , a distinction had to be drawn between torture and lesser forms of ill - treatment . When there was a real risk of torture , the prohibition on extradition was absolute and left no room for a balancing exercise . However , insofar as LAW applied to inhuman and degrading treatment and not to torture , it was applicable only in a relativist form to extradition cases .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , giving the lead speech , considered the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , in which the ORG stated that :", "\u201c It should not be inferred from the ORG \u2019s remarks [ at paragraph CARDINAL of GPE ] that there is any room for balancing the risk of ill - treatment against the reasons for expulsion in determining whether a ORG \u2019s responsibility under LAW ) is engaged . \u201d", "Lord PERSON stated :", "\u201c In the context of PERSON , I read this remark as affirming that there can be no room for a balancing of risk against reasons for expulsion when it comes to subjecting someone to the risk of torture . I do not however think that the ORG was intending to depart from the relativist approach to what counted as inhuman and degrading treatment which was laid down in GPE and which is paralleled in the cases on other articles of the LAW in a foreign context . If such a radical departure from precedent had been intended , I am sure that the ORG would have said so . \u201d", "For Lord PERSON , paragraph CARDINAL of PERSON made clear that :", "\u201c ... the desirability of extradition is a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the punishment likely to be imposed in the receiving state attains the \u2018 minimum level of severity\u2019 which would make it inhuman and degrading . Punishment which counts as inhuman and degrading in the domestic context will not necessarily be so regarded when the extradition factor has been taken into account . \u201d", "He went on to state :", "\u201c A relativist approach to the scope of article CARDINAL seems to me essential if extradition is to continue to function . For example , ORG has decided in PERSON v Scottish Ministers ( DATE ) GPE CARDINAL that in GPE the practice of \u2018 slopping out\u2019 ( requiring a prisoner to use a chamber pot in his cell and empty it in TIME ) may cause an infringement of article CARDINAL . Whether , even in a domestic context , this attains the necessary level of severity is a point on which I would wish to reserve my opinion . If , however , it were applied in the context of extradition , it would prevent anyone being extradited to many countries , poorer than GPE , where people who are not in prison often have to make do without flush lavatories . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A minority of their Lordships , Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON , disagreed with these conclusions . They considered that the extradition context was irrelevant to the determination of whether a whole life sentence amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment . They found no basis in the text of LAW for such a distinction . Lord PERSON also considered that the ORG , in PERSON and again in PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG DATE ... , had departed from the previous , relativist approach to inhuman and degrading treatment that it had taken in GPE . He stated :", "\u201c There is , I conclude , no room in the GPE jurisprudence for a concept such as the risk of a flagrant violation of article CARDINAL \u2019s absolute prohibition against inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( akin to that of the risk of a \u2018 flagrant denial of justice\u2019 ) . By the same token that no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of torture , so too no one can be expelled if he would then face the risk of treatment or punishment which is properly to be characterised as inhuman or degrading . That , of course , is not to say that , assuming for example \u2018 slopping out\u2019 is degrading treatment in GPE , so too it must necessarily be regarded in all countries ( see para CARDINAL of Lord PERSON \u2019s opinion ) ... ORG has repeatedly said that the LAW does not \u2018 purport to be a means of requiring the contracting states to impose LAW standards on other states\u2019 ( Soering , para CARDINAL ) and article CARDINAL does not bar removal to non - Convention states ( whether by way of extradition or simply for the purposes of immigration control ) merely because they choose to impose higher levels or harsher measures of criminal punishment .", "Nor is it to say that a risk of article CARDINAL ill - treatment , the necessary pre - condition of an article CARDINAL bar upon extradition , will readily be established . On the contrary , as ORG reaffirmed in PERSON at para CARDINAL :", "\u2018 [ T]he ORG has frequently indicated that it applies rigorous criteria and exercises close scrutiny when assessing the existence of a real risk of ill - treatment . . . in the event of a person being removed from the territory of the respondent ORG by extradition , expulsion or any other measure pursuing that aim . Although assessment of that risk is to some degree speculative , the ORG has always been very cautious , examining carefully the material placed before it in the light of the requisite standard of proof . . . before . . . finding that the enforcement of removal from the territory would be contrary to LAW . As a result , since adopting the PERSON judgment it has only rarely reached such a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d", "Therefore , for Lord PERSON , if a mandatory life sentence violated LAW in a domestic case , the risk of such a sentence would preclude extradition to another country .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , despite these different views , none of ORG found that the sentence likely to be imposed on Mr GPE would be irreducible ; having regard to the commutation powers of the Governor of GPE , it would be just as reducible as the sentence at issue in GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE .... All five Law Lords also noted that , in GPE , the ORG had only said that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence may raise an issue under LAW . They found that the imposition of a whole life sentence would not constitute inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of LAW , unless it were grossly or clearly disproportionate . Lord PERSON in particular noted :", "\u201c Having puzzled long over this question , I have finally concluded that the majority of ORG [ in GPE ] would not regard even an irreducible life sentence \u2014 by which , as explained , I understand the majority to mean a mandatory life sentence to be served in full without there ever being proper consideration of the individual circumstances of the defendant \u2019s case \u2014 as violating article CARDINAL unless and until the time comes when further imprisonment would no longer be justified on any ground \u2014 whether for reasons of punishment , deterrence or public protection . It is for that reason that the majority say only that article CARDINAL may be engaged . \u201d", "Lord PERSON added that this test had not been met in GPE \u2019s case , particularly when the facts of the murders for which he was accused , if committed in GPE , could have justified a whole life order . However , Lord PERSON considered that , in a more compelling case , such as the mercy killing of a terminally ill relative , this ORG \u201c might well judge the risk of ill - treatment to be sufficiently real , clear and imminent to conclude that extradition must indeed be barred on article CARDINAL grounds \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Finally , Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON , ORG and Lord PERSON all doubted Lord Justice Laws\u2019 view that life imprisonment without parole was lex talionis . Lord PERSON , ORG and Lord PERSON did not accept his premise that the abolition of the death penalty had been founded on the idea that the life of every person had an inalienable value ; there were other , more pragmatic reasons for abolition such as its irreversibility and lack of deterrent effect . Lord PERSON rejected the view that an irreducible life sentence was inhuman and degrading because it denied a prisoner the possibility of atonement ; once it was accepted that a whole life sentence could be a just punishment , atonement was achieved by the prisoner serving his sentence .", "CARDINAL .

In GPE v. PERSON [ DATE ] S.C.R. CARDINAL , PERSON and another ( the respondents ) were to be extradited from GPE to the ORG of GPE to stand trial for murders allegedly committed when they were both DATE . Before making the extradition order the NORP Minister of ORG had not sought assurances that the death penalty would not be imposed . ORG found that the remoteness between the extradition and the potential imposition of capital punishment meant the case was not appropriately considered under section CARDINAL but under section CARDINAL . However , the values underlying section CARDINAL could form part of the balancing process engaged under section CARDINAL . The extradition of the respondents would , if implemented , deprive them of their rights of liberty and security of person as guaranteed by section CARDINAL . The issue was whether such a deprivation was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice . While extradition could only be refused if it \u201c shocked the conscience \u201d an extradition that violated the principles of fundamental justice would always do so . The court balanced the factors that favoured extradition against those that favoured seeking assurances that the death penalty would not be sought . The latter included the fact that a degree of leniency for youth was an accepted value in the administration of justice , even for young offenders over DATE . The court concluded that the objectives sought to be advanced by extradition without assurances would be as well served by extradition with assurances . The court held therefore that assurances were constitutionally required by section CARDINAL in all but exceptional cases .", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. PERSON ; GPE v. GPE , [ DATE ] CARDINAL SCR CARDINAL , the appellants were to be extradited to GPE to face charges of fraud ( the PERSON case ) or trafficking of cocaine ( the GPE case ) .

In dismissing the appeals , ORG affirmed the balancing approach laid down in PERSON to determining whether potential sentences in a requesting state would \u201c shock the conscience \u201d . The harsher sentences the appellants might receive if convicted in GPE were among the factors militating against their surrender but they had offered no evidence or case - law to back up their assertions that the possible sentences would shock the conscience of NORP .

There was no legal limitation on what the Governor could consider in granting pardon or commuting a sentence . However , in every case he would consider inter alia the nature of the offence and any history of mental instability , drug abuse , or alcohol abuse . The letter confirmed that , from DATE , the Governor had commuted CARDINAL sentences , of which CARDINAL were for first - degree murder . If a request was denied , another request could be made in DATE or , alternatively , the defendant could apply for waiver of the DATE period . A defendant could also apply for commutation if he or she became ill and could file a motion to have his sentence set aside on the ground that it amounted to cruel and unusual punishment . The letter accepted that , given the current status of the law , such a motion was unlikely to succeed .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant provided the following provisions of GPE law on sentencing :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) A person who has been convicted of a capital felony shall be punished by death if the proceeding held to determine sentence according to the procedure set forth in s.

Mr ORG disagreed with the view of the current Assistant State Attorney Mr GPE that , if the prosecution did not present evidence in support of the death penalty , there was no basis upon which the trial court could find there were sufficient aggravating circumstances to warrant the death penalty ( see Mr GPE \u2019s statement summarised paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In Mr GPE \u2019s view , in the penalty phase of a trial there was no requirement that new evidence be present ; the jury could be asked simply to rely on the evidence heard during the guilt phase of proceedings . There was no reason why a trial court could not convene a penalty phase and impose the death sentence , even if the prosecution did not seek it . The trial judge was not limited by any recommendation of the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant also submitted an affidavit sworn by Professor PERSON , of ORG . Her view was that the assurances provided by ORG and the GPE authorities made it unlikely that the first applicant faced a significant risk of being sentenced to death but some risk remained as the assurances were not binding in GPE law . It was more likely that he would face a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and executive clemency was the only avenue by which he could seek reduction in his sentence . The procedure for seeking such a reduction was subject to minimal procedural protections . GPE had never granted clemency to a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment without parole and rarely commuted sentences of those accused of first degree murder ; after DATE , no one convicted of first degree murder had been granted a commutation . Although the granting of clemency required the approval of CARDINAL cabinet members , it could be denied unilaterally by the Governor at any time . The Governor and cabinet were elected officials and would never risk political unpopularity by granting a commutation unless there were clear evidence of innocence . The first applicant \u2019s chances of receiving clemency were remote and it was virtually certain that he would spend the rest of his life in prison .", "CARDINAL . Further to the second affidavit of Mr PERSON set out at paragraph CARDINAL above , section QUANTITY of LAW provides that where the ORG has given notice of its intention to seek a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole , the court shall conduct a sentencing hearing as soon as practicable after the defendant is found guilty of murder in the first degree to determine whether he shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole or to imprisonment for life . By section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(b ) , a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole means \u201c imprisonment for the natural life of an inmate under the custody of a correctional facility \u201d . A person who receives such a sentence is not eligible for parole consideration and may not be granted parole at any time during the term of sentence ( GPE Code of Correctional Services Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL(d)(CARDINAL)(i ) ) . The courts of GPE have no role in determining whether such prisoners should be released on parole ; that power is vested in the Governor of ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL(d)(CARDINAL)(ii ) and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . He may pardon any individual convicted of a crime subject to any conditions he requires or remit any part of a sentence of imprisonment without the remission operating as a full pardon .

NORP Under the first category , ORG has struck down as grossly disproportionate a sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed on a defendant with previous convictions for passing a worthless cheque ( PERSON v.

In PERSON , cited above , the court held that LAW also prohibited the imposition of life imprisonment without parole on a juvenile offender who did not commit homicide . The court found that life imprisonment without parole was an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile and that the remote possibility of pardon or other executive clemency did not mitigate the harshness of the sentence . Although a ORG was not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a non - homicide crime , it had to provide some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation . The court also held that a sentence lacking in legitimate penological justification ( such as retribution , deterrence , incapacitation and rehabilitation ) was , by its nature , disproportionate . Such purposes could justify life without parole in other contexts , but not life without parole for juvenile non - homicide offenders .", "CARDINAL .

The court stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . While under LANGUAGE law the offence of murder attracts a mandatory life sentence , this is not normally an irreducible sentence . The judge specifies the minimum term to be served by way of punishment and deterrence before the offender \u2019s release on licence can be considered .

In light of its conclusion on section CARDINAL , the ORG considered it unnecessary to decide that question or to consider the relevance of the possibility of release under section CARDINAL ( the presidential prerogative of mercy ) . It did , however , find that the safeguards available in GPE ( in the form of the Attorney - General \u2019s powers to recommend release and the President \u2019s powers to commute sentences or decree release ) were not available in GPE . It also acknowledged the appellant \u2019s argument that , as with the mandatory sentence of death it had considered in PERSON , a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment did not allow for consideration of the facts of the case . ORG also considered any differences between mandatory sentences of death and life imprisonment could be exaggerated and , to this end , quoted with approval the dicta of Lord Justice Laws in GPE and Lord GPE in PERSON ( at DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . In ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , ORG held that a mandatory sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for murder amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of section CARDINAL on the grounds that it was disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . In ORG v. Tcoeib [ DATE ] CARDINAL LRC CARDINAL ORG considered the imposition of a discretionary life sentence to be compatible with section CARDINAL of the country \u2019s constitution ( subsection ( c ) of which is identical to LAW ) . Chief Justice PERSON , for the unanimous court , found the relevant statutory release scheme to be sufficient but observed that if release depended on the \u201c capricious exercise \u201d of the discretion of the prison or executive authorities , the hope of release would be \u201c too faint and much too unpredictable \u201d for the prisoner to retain the dignity required by section CARDINAL . It was also observed that life imprisonment could amount to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment if it was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offence . ORG of GPE found mandatory minimum sentences for robbery and possession of firearms to be grossly disproportionate in ORG v. PERSON CARDINAL LRC CARDINAL and ORG v Likuwa [ DATE ] CARDINAL LRC CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. GPE [ DATE ] HKCFA CARDINAL , ORG rejected a challenge to the mandatory life sentence for murder . It found that the possibility of regular review of the sentence by an independent board meant it was neither arbitrary nor grossly disproportionate and thus it did not amount to cruel , inhuman or degrading punishment .", "CARDINAL .
