The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the town of GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the GPE delivered a judgment in a criminal case against the applicant and his co - defendants , Mr T. and Mr Z. The court established that in DATE the applicant , the then Head of the ORG , had detected certain irregularities in the privatisation of a local brewery which , in his assessment , might have rendered the privatisation void . The applicant had conspired with T. and PERSON to approach the director of the brewery to extort MONEY ( RUB ) from the head of the brewery in exchange for covering up those irregularities . The head had agreed to pay RUB CARDINAL . On DATE of payment the applicant prepared an amended assessment report on the brewery \u2019s immovable property , signed it in his office and affixed the seal of ORG . PERSON and ORG delivered the report to the brewery head and received the stipulated amount . On leaving the head \u2019s office they were apprehended by the police .", "CARDINAL . The trial court found the applicant guilty of having attempted to solicit , through an intermediary , a large sum of money for performing acts in the interests of the bribe - giver that were within the applicant \u2019s official competence . The court established that those acts were punishable under LAW ( c ) and ( d ) of LAW ( \u201c Bribery \u201d ) in conjunction with LAW ( \u201c Preparation of a criminal offence and an attempted criminal offence \u201d ) . The applicant was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment in a high - security colony .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , but not the prosecution , appealed against the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE held an appeal hearing in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer and a prosecutor . The applicant did not attend the hearing . In his oral submissions the prosecutor asked the court to recharacterise the applicant \u2019s acts as attempted large - scale fraud committed by an organised group ( LAW ( b ) of LAW in conjunction with LAW ) , without reducing the sentence . Pursuant to LAW , the court then asked the applicant \u2019s lawyer to submit \u201c additional explanations \u201d . The lawyer contended that the granting of the prosecutor \u2019s request would violate the applicant \u2019s right to prepare his defence because neither the applicant nor the lawyer himself had been informed in advance of the nature and grounds of the new charge and they had not had adequate time to prepare their position . The lawyer relied , in particular , on LAW ( a ) and ( b ) and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court then withdrew for deliberations and delivered its judgment by which it recharacterised the applicant \u2019s acts as attempted large - scale fraud within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW in conjunction with LAW and upheld the applicant \u2019s imprisonment term . It reasoned as follows :", "\u201c Having correctly established the facts of the case , the [ trial ] court , however , groundlessly characterised [ the applicant \u2019s ] acts as an attempt to solicit a bribe in conspiracy with T. and PERSON As the court acknowledged in the judgment , the brewery privatisation documents had contained \u2018 PERSON that had been too insignificant to entail annulment of the privatisation , and [ the applicant ] , as the court established , had been perfectly aware of it . By setting up a deception scheme designed to get hold of a large amount of money because of the defects in the documents , [ the applicant ] , acting in collusion with T. and PERSON , attempted to steal another person \u2019s property on a large scale using his official position . These acts of [ the applicant ] are to be characterised under LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW ...", "Notwithstanding the change in the legal characterisation of the GPE acts , it must be recognised that the sentence imposed by the [ trial ] court corresponds to [ the gravity of ] the offence and the information on their personalities . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Obtaining a bribe in form of money , securities , other property ... by an official -personally or through an intermediary \u2013 for acts ( omissions ) in the interests of the bribe - giver ... , provided such acts ( omissions ) are within the competence of the official or he can facilitate the performance of such acts ( omissions ) by virtue of his position ... shall be punishable by a fine ... or up to DATE imprisonment ...", "...", "CARDINAL . The acts enumerated in parts CARDINAL , CARDINAL of the present Article , if they are committed ...", "...", "c ) with a solicitation of a bribe ;", "d ) on a large scale ,", "shall be punishable by DATE imprisonment , accompanied by a confiscation of property or without such . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .

An attempted criminal offence is an intentional act ( omission ) of a person , directly aimed at committing an offence , if however the offence had not been completed due to circumstances beyond the will of that person . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the DATE Code of Criminal Procedure required the court to examine the case within the scope of the charge against the defendant(s ) . The charge could be amended by the court , provided that such an amendment did not aggravate the situation of the defendant or violate his right to defend himself . If the amendment entailed a violation of the defence rights , the court was to remit the case for an additional investigation . It was prohibited to prefer a more serious charge or a charge based on substantially different factual circumstances . The court could continue the trial if the amendment only concerned abandonment of certain counts or aggravating circumstances .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL provided that the appeal court could decide to dismiss the appeal and uphold the judgment ; to quash the judgment and remit the case for an additional investigation or a fresh examination by a trial court ; to discontinue the criminal proceedings or to vary the judgment , in particular , if the trial court had incorrectly applied the law .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL described the procedure for the examination of cases before the appeal court . A judge rapporteur opened the hearing and gave a summary of the facts of the case and the grounds of appeal . The defendant first gave explanations , after which the prosecutor made oral submissions . The defendant then made additional observations and the court withdrew for deliberations and delivery of the judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
