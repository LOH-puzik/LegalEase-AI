SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objections rejected (victim, non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Art. 6-1 as regard the equality of arms;No violation of Art. 6-1 as regard the right to a fair hearing;Not necessary to examine Art. 8 and P1-1", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants are individual NORP nationals who live in LANGUAGE ( GPE ) . The third applicant is also the chairperson and legal representative of the sixth applicant , FAC association . The first , second , fourth and fifth applicants are members of this association .", "CARDINAL . The case originated in an engineering project of DATE for the construction of a dam in GPE ( GPE ) which would result in the flooding of CARDINAL nature reserves and a number of small villages , including ORG , where the applicants live . According to the Government , the total number of landowners affected by the dam 's construction is CARDINAL , thirteen of whom live in GPE itself .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Coordinadora de Itoiz association was set up ; its articles of association state , inter alia , that its aim is \u201c to coordinate its members ' efforts to oppose construction of the FAC dam and to campaign for an alternative way of life on the site , to represent and defend the area affected by the dam and this area 's interests before all official bodies at all levels , whether local , provincial , ORG or international , and to promote public awareness of the impact of the dam \u201d .", "By a ministerial decree of DATE , ORG adopted the FAC dam project .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the villages concerned by the dam and the applicant association brought an administrative appeal before the Audiencia Nacional against the ministerial decree of DATE . The appeal was based on several allegations of unlawfulness which , in their opinion , had tainted the procedure for informing the public about the proposed dam , the fact that the project had been adopted without the prior approval of the hydrological plans for each river basin or of the national hydrological plan and the lack of any public or social interest served by the project . They also claimed that the project breached the legislation on environmental protection , since no environmental impact study had been commissioned . Finally , the court 's attention was drawn to the project 's impact on the nature reserves and habitat within the relevant area in the light of ORG recommendations on engineering works in the LOC and ORG common agricultural policy .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the Audiencia Nacional partly upheld the appeal , considering in particular that , according to the law , the planned dam should have been based on the national hydrological plan , which had not been drawn up when the project was approved . The court also accepted the request for precise designation of the protection zones around the nature reserves affected by the dam and for a breakdown of the quarry use that would be necessary for its construction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association applied for immediate enforcement of the judgment and , in particular , for suspension of construction work on the dam . By a decision of DATE , the Audiencia Nacional granted a suspension order but directed that the necessary measures be taken to ensure the completion of work already begun and for the maintenance and safety of the work already completed , subject to the payment of security by the applicant association .", "CARDINAL . All the parties to the proceedings lodged s\u00faplica appeals against the decision of DATE . In the context of the interim enforcement of its judgment of CARDINAL DATE and , in particular , with a view to maintaining the protection zones around the CARDINAL nature reserves affected by the project , ORG , by a decision of DATE , prohibited the filling of the reservoir and displacement of the population concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parliament of ORG ( parlamento foral de Navarra ) passed Autonomous Community Law ( foral ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on natural sites in GPE ( \u201c GPE ) . This law amended LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , particularly with regard to the possibility of reclassifying the protection zones or carrying out activities within them for the purpose of introducing infrastructure that had been declared in the general or public interest . According to the applicants , this PERSON enabled construction work on the dam to continue , with the consequent deterioration of the protected natural site .", "In application of ORG , ORG government adopted Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , which identified the peripheral protection zones for certain nature reserves and strict nature reserves in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , Counsel for the ORG and the government of ORG had appealed on points of law against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . In a judgment of DATE , ORG definitively cancelled the dam project in so far as it concerned the CARDINAL-metre protection zones around nature reserves DATE , CARDINAL and DATE . As a result of the judgment , the size of the planned dam , and thus of the area to be flooded , was reduced , so that the village of GPE , where the applicants ' immovable property was located , was saved from flooding .", "CARDINAL . In application of ORG judgment , by a decision of DATE , the Audiencia Nacional declared final the interim enforcement measures ordered on DATE concerning the prohibition on filling the reservoir and other related work . Before ruling on the question of the possible suspension of construction work on a dyke , the Audiencia Nacional invited the parties to appear before it so that they could submit observations on the consequences of the new ORG law of DATE , particularly with regard to the protection zones around all the nature reserves provided for in that law , and on the impact of the maximum flood levels on the protection zones of the reserves to which the cancelled project had referred .", "CARDINAL . The central ORG authorities and ORG government argued before the Audiencia Nacional that it had become legally impossible to enforce ORG judgment of DATE , in so far as GPE law of DATE had removed protection - zone status from the area within the nature reserves that was due be flooded . Accordingly , taking that legislative amendment into account , it had become possible to carry out the public - works schemes planned within those protection zones .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association contested the authorities ' argument , claiming that ORG was inapplicable in the instant case , since it had been enacted following the administrative decisions in the proceedings in issue and subsequent to ORG judgment and the CARDINAL interim enforcement orders . In the alternative , the applicant association requested that certain provisions in ORG law be referred to ORG for a preliminary ruling on their constitutionality , particularly those authorising the removal of protection - zone status from the CARDINAL nature reserves in the area to be flooded , which , in the applicant association 's submission , would allow the work to be completed and make the reservoir cover the area specified in the original plans .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the Audiencia Nacional asked ORG to rule on the preliminary question submitted by the applicant association .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declared the application inadmissible on account of certain errors in its presentation which could nonetheless be corrected .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to rectify the above - mentioned errors , the Audiencia Nacional summoned the parties on CARDINAL DATE so that it could hear their submissions on certain aspects of ORG law whose constitutionality had been challenged before ORG , and on the constitutionality of section DATE ) ( A.CARDINAL . ) and ( B ) of that law . The applicant association submitted its observations on DATE .", "By a decision of DATE , the Audiencia Nacional again asked ORG to rule on the preliminary question as to constitutionality and extended the question to include a new point raised by the applicant association , namely section DATE ) ( B ) ( B.CARDINAL . ) of ORG law .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG declared the issues raised in the preliminary question admissible . Under section CARDINAL ) of LAW , it gave notice of the questions to ORG , the ORG , the government and parliament of GPE and the NORP government , and invited them to file their observations within DATE . ORG received Counsel for the ORG 's observations on DATE . The government and parliament of GPE submitted their observations on CARDINAL and DATE respectively . The Attorney General 's observations were submitted on DATE . The Speaker of ORG indicated that the ORG would present no observations . The Speaker of the ORG asked that the ORG be considered a party to the proceedings and offered its assistance . On DATE the Audiencia Nacional forwarded to ORG the written pleadings submitted by the applicant association during the proceedings before it . These pleadings , dated DATE , DATE and DATE , were formally included in the case file at ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , held that the impugned provisions of ORG were compatible with LAW . It observed at the outset that enforcement of ORG judgment of DATE , delivered in accordance with ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , had become impossible since the entry into force of ORG , in that the cancelled project complied with the new law .", "CARDINAL . Examining the purpose of ORG , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ... Its purpose is to establish a general system for environmental protection of the natural sites in ORG . Accordingly , this protection system [ was ] applicable ... to the nature reserves already identified in the previous ORG law , even though the essential difference between the legal rules established by those QUANTITY laws lies in the arrangements regarding the peripheral protection zones . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held , firstly , that this was not to be seen as a legislative solution for the particular problem of the CARDINAL peripheral zones around the CARDINAL nature reserves affected by construction of the LOC dam and , secondly , that statements and parliamentary initiatives by certain politicians which , in the opinion of FAC , demonstrated that the main aim of ORG was to prevent execution of ORG judgment , were immaterial in assessing whether there had been a violation of the principle of lawfulness . ORG also ruled that , given the significance of the question raised by the FAC dam 's construction , which could not simply be ignored , it was justifiable that the explanatory memorandum accompanying ORG law of DATE specifically mentioned the aim and means of environmental protection in the peripheral protection zones around the CARDINAL above - mentioned nature reserves .", "CARDINAL . As to the alleged infringement of the right to a fair hearing , in so far as GPE law of DATE now prevented execution of ORG judgment partly cancelling the FAC dam project , ORG considered that the fact that in the meantime a new law had been passed amending the legal system applicable to the peripheral protection zones and replacing the previous law on the basis of which the project had been declared partly void was not in itself incompatible with the right to execution of judicial decisions as enshrined in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the case - law of ORG and , in particular , to the judgments in ORG and GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B ) and PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-VI ) , ORG examined whether the impossibility of executing ORG judgment as a consequence of the enactment of ORG was justified in view of the values and assets protected by LAW . Having held that environmental protection was enshrined in the LAW , ORG examined whether the prejudice arising from the failure to execute the judgment in issue was proportionate to the protected or disputed interests or was on the other hand purposeless , excessive or the cause of a clear imbalance between the interests at stake . It found that both ORG judgment of DATE and the new ORG law of DATE were intended to guarantee the existence of a peripheral protection zone around the CARDINAL nature reserves affected by the dam 's construction . ORG further noted that the system of peripheral protection zones introduced by this new law had not in itself been considered arbitrary in FAC decision ; nor had the zones ' new boundaries been held responsible for the serious deterioration of the environment . Accordingly , it held that the balance of general interests had been respected and that there was no clear lack of proportion between the conflicting interests . Consequently , the impugned provisions could not be held to be contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the argument that the new legal rules governing the peripheral protection zones around the nature reserves appeared in a law rather than in regulations , as had previously been the case , and that this deprived the applicants of the possibility of overseeing the administration 's actions through an administrative appeal or enforcement proceedings , ORG noted that there was no legal provision requiring that certain subjects be dealt with by regulations . It added that the new law did not amount to ad causam legislation , being general in form and in substance , and pointed out that laws could be challenged before ORG through the remedy provided for in LAW .", "Accordingly , ORG dismissed the application for a preliminary ruling . The judgment was published in ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
