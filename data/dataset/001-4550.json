In DATE GPE ORG ( Bezirkshauptmannschaft ) found him guilty of illegal entry and imposed a fine of CARDINAL NORP Schillings ( ORG ) on him . Subsequently , the applicant obtained a residence permit which was periodically renewed . In DATE his wife , who is also a NORP national , as well as their son , born in DATE , and their daughter , born in DATE , were allowed to join him under a family reunion scheme . The applicant found employment as a worker . In DATE GPE ORG found him guilty of drunken driving and imposed a fine of ORG CARDINAL on him . In DATE the same authority found him guilty of refusing to undergo a breathalyser test when being reasonably suspected of drunken driving and imposed a fine of ATS CARDINAL , CARDINAL on him .", "On DATE ORG issued a residence ban valid for DATE against the applicant . Referring to S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( PERSON ) , according to which a residence ban has to be issued against an alien , inter alia , if he has been convicted more than once of a serious administrative offence , it found that the applicant \u2019s convictions for drunken driving in DATE and refusing to undergo a breathalyser test in DATE constituted such serious offences . Although the residence ban constituted an interference with the applicant \u2019s private and family life , this measure was necessary , as there were specific reasons to fear that his further stay would be a danger for public security .", "On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , filed an appeal . He argued that the residence ban against him was disproportionate , as the offences committed by him were not of a serious nature . Moreover , it forced him to separate from his family who were dependent on his income . Further , the applicant argued that GPE had become a member of ORG on DATE and was therefore bound by ORG between ORG and GPE . According to this Agreement and the decisions on its implementation , NORP workers who had been legally employed in a member ORG for DATE had a right of free access to the employment market and also to a residence permit . Moreover , measures of public security against such workers could not be based solely on criminal convictions but had to be justified by the specific conduct of the person concerned .", "On DATE ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It confirmed that the applicant \u2019s convictions in DATE and DATE , relating to drunken driving and refusing a breathalyser test , constituted serious administrative offences within the meaning of S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . Referring to LAW of the said LAW which requires the authority to weigh the negative consequences the residence ban would have for the alien and his family against the public interest in issuing a residence ban , it found in particular that the applicant had only lived in GPE since DATE and his family since DATE . Moreover , his family could leave GPE with him . Having regard to the conduct of the applicant and the particular risks it entailed for life and limb as well as the property of others , he had to be considered as a danger for public safety . In sum , the interest in issuing the residence ban outweighed the interests of the applicant and his family in staying in GPE . Finally , ORG between ORG and GPE , relied on by the applicant , did not prohibit the issuing of a residence ban .", "On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG ) . He repeated the arguments he had already forwarded in his appeal to ORG .", "On DATE the ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s complaint and referred the case to ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It found that the contested residence ban was necessary within the meaning of LAW of LAW in the interests of public safety and the prevention of crime . Referring on the one hand to the gravity of the offences committed by the applicant and on the other hand to his short stay in GPE , the ORG confirmed that ORG had duly weighed the interests involved ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
