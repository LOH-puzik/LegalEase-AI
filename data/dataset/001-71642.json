He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings determining the applicant \u2019s status in GPE", "The applicant entered GPE illegally on an unspecified date in DATE . He immediately claimed asylum on the ground that he had allegedly taken part in various hostilities against the NORP military forces and that he feared persecution if returned to GPE . He alleged that he had been previously detained by NORP military officers , that he had been beaten and tortured during that detention , and that he had only been released after his relatives had \u201c paid a ransom \u201d .", "On DATE the immigration authorities refused asylum and applied to a court for the applicant \u2019s deportation to GPE . In reaching their conclusion , the immigration authorities referred to the \u201c danger to national security \u201d which the applicant represented . No factual elements were specified to support that statement , the immigration authorities having reached the conclusion on the basis of a letter sent to them by ORG . The decision of CARDINAL DATE mentioned that the applicant had the right of appeal to a court within DATE of the notification of the decision , pursuant to LAW .", "The decision of CARDINAL DATE was translated into NORP and given to the applicant on DATE , as confirmed by his signature on a copy of the decision submitted to the ORG .", "On DATE ORG accepted the immigration authorities\u2019 request to deport the applicant to GPE on the basis of his presenting a danger to national security .", "On DATE the applicant was accommodated at ORG ( ARC ) pending the final determination of his legal status in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant applied to a court , claiming asylum and alleging persecution in GPE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the application on the ground that the applicant had missed DATE time - limit for the submission of an appeal , laid down in LAW . In this regard it was noted that the applicant had sent his application by post only on DATE . The court also noted that the applicant had not specified whether his application was an appeal against the immigration authorities\u2019 decision of CARDINAL DATE , or against the court decision of DATE . In either event , the applicant had submitted his appeal out of time . It was further noted that he had not requested an extension of the time - limit for appeal .", "On DATE the applicant received the court decision of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE he consulted a lawyer , who helped him to draft a further appeal against the immigration authorities\u2019 decision of CARDINAL DATE . In that appeal , dated DATE , the applicant stated that he had only taken cognisance of the impugned decision on DATE , and that he had appealed against it on DATE . Since he did not have a lawyer until DATE , the applicant requested the reinstatement of the time - limit for appealing against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . In his appeal , the applicant argued that the authorities\u2019 conclusions on his alleged \u201c danger to national security \u201d were not supported by any evidence . He claimed that he would be subjected to persecution if returned to GPE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to reinstate the time - limit . The court held that the time - limit mentioned in LAW could only be reinstated in cases where it had been missed as a result of circumstances independent of the applicant \u2019s will . However , the court observed that the applicant had not invoked any circumstances which could show that he was not in a position to submit his appeal before DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against the decision of DATE . The applicant stated that from DATE , after having taken cognisance of the decision of CARDINAL DATE , he had been unable to submit his appeal within the DATE period since he did not know the NORP language or legislation and , moreover , had no postage stamps or envelopes to send an appeal . According to the applicant , on DATE he had given his appeal , which had been written in LANGUAGE , to a representative of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) , who in turn sent the appeal to the court . The applicant also stated that the ORG representative had promised the applicant that he would inform certain immigration lawyers about his situation . As a result , the applicant had been able to meet a lawyer for the first time on DATE , and to draft a properly motivated appeal on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE . The court reiterated that the applicant \u2019s first appeal against the decision of DATE had only been sent on DATE , i.e. DATE after the applicant had familiarised himself with the decision ( of DATE ) . The court observed that the fact that the applicant had access to a lawyer for the first time only on DATE did not constitute a circumstance absolving him from the obligation to comply with the time - limit . The court also stated that the other allegations relied on by the applicant ( i.e. ignorance of language and laws , and no stationery ) could not be reviewed on appeal as these facts had not been alleged before the first - instance court on DATE . That decision was final .", "On DATE ORG communicated the applicant \u2019s complaints about his imminent expulsion from GPE to GPE under LAW .", "On DATE ORG suspended the execution of the expulsion order of DATE .", "On DATE the immigration authorities authorised the applicant \u2019s stay in GPE on humanitarian grounds .", "On DATE the President of ORG petitioned ORG to resume the proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s expulsion .

In this connection the appeal court noted that the decision on the applicant \u2019s expulsion had not been quashed , although its execution had been suspended by ORG on DATE . It held that the applicant \u2019s continuing detention was compatible with LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( see the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d part below ) .", "On DATE ORG refused to order the applicant \u2019s release . On DATE the ORG further authorised the applicant \u2019s detention at the ARC until DATE . The court noted that on DATE the immigration authorities had decided to authorise the applicant \u2019s stay in the country on humanitarian grounds , and that , as a result , the ground specified in LAW , namely the unlawfulness of his stay in the country , could no longer justify his detention . However , the court observed that the continuing validity of the expulsion order of DATE warranted his detention in accordance with LAW and CARDINAL of LAW .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE .", "On DATE ORG quashed the expulsion order of DATE inter alia because of a risk of the applicant \u2019s possible persecution if deported to GPE .", "In view of this decision , on DATE ORG decided that there were no longer any grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention under LAW . The decision of DATE was accordingly quashed .", "On DATE , upon the applicant \u2019s request , his further stay at the ARC was authorised by the immigration authorities under a different regime , namely without any restrictions on his liberty of movement .", "Following the decision of DATE to issue the applicant with a temporary residence permit , he left his accommodation at the ARC on an unspecified date in DATE .
