The claimant \u2019s assertion that \u2018 his cousins are serving sentences in GPE for their religion\u2019 ... can not be taken into consideration because he has not produced any evidence to substantiate his claim . Making a global assessment of the submissions , the first - instance court correctly considered that there were no grounds to assume that the claimant would face a real risk of inhuman treatment . Applying the standards for the assessment of the allegation of ill - treatment in case of his return to GPE ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALI ) , the court considers that the ill - treatment which the claimant may allegedly face in GPE would not reach the minimum threshold of severity attracting the protection of LAW . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4", "6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
