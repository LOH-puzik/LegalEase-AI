The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant intended to organise demonstrations in order to call attention to the situation of those having sustained damage originating in a major bankruptcy case which had attracted considerable media attention in GPE . On DATE he applied to ORG for acquiescence in a demonstration on DATE and in another one , of ongoing nature , from DATE until DATE , both scheduled in FAC , in front of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to deal with either of the applications . It observed that on DATE the area in question had been declared by ORG itself a \u201c security operational zone \u201d ( biztons\u00e1gi m\u0171veleti ter\u00fclet ) in view of the tumultuous events in GPE in DATE . Consequently , the measure \u2013 which was , after a prolongation , in place for an indefinite period of time \u2013 remained as such outside ORG competence as regards the prohibition of , or acquiescence in , a demonstration .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL.K.CARDINAL.CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL . , both the first- and the second - instance administrative decisions and remitted the case to the GPE Commander . The court pointed out that the impugned decisions did not contain any concrete elements establishing the necessity and proportionality of maintaining the \u201c security operational zone \u201d after the prolongation of DATE . Nor did they address the plaintiff \u2019s suggestion that the mere fencing - off of ORG \u2019s immediate vicinity \u2013 rather than the global ban on FAC \u2013 would have been sufficient in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL .
