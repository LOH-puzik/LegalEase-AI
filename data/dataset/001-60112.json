In a statement taken and recorded by police on DATE , CARDINAL PERSON said that he had been kidnapped and beaten up by CARDINAL unknown men . He suspected that they had acted on the orders of another man , PERSON , and that his kidnap had constituted an act of revenge for a burglary that he , PERSON , was rumoured to have carried out . On DATE preliminary judicial investigations were initiated into allegations that the applicant and an accomplice , Mr D. , had intentionally deprived Mr A. of his liberty on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE QUANTITY police officers drew up an official record ( proces - verbaal ) containing the findings of the investigation into the kidnapping and assault of PERSON It stated , inter alia , that a number of witnesses had seen PERSON and CARDINAL other persons in bars in the town of GPE in the night of CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE and that these witnesses had overheard the CARDINAL men making inquiries into the whereabouts of the victim , Mr PERSON was said to know PERSON well and to be very afraid of him . Police investigations conducted in various bars in GPE had shown that PERSON had such a reputation that this fear was shared by many people . According to the reporting officers , the witnesses who had seen the suspects prior to and during the commission of the offences in question were so scared that they were afraid to make written statements .", "CARDINAL . NORP The official police record then describes how CARDINAL witnesses were confronted with the applicant and his co - accused Mr NORP through a CARDINAL - way mirror . The police officers observed that the witnesses became very fearful upon seeing the suspects and that they wanted to leave the room as soon as possible . None of the CARDINAL witnesses identified the applicant , although CARDINAL of them said that the applicant looked similar to CARDINAL of the perpetrators . The witnesses were interviewed separately after the identification procedure ; CARDINAL of them indicated to the police officers that s / he did not wish to remain on his / her own for fear of coming face to face with Mr NORP whom s / he had recognised as one of the perpetrators . The police officers further reported that a fifth witness recognised from CARDINAL photographs shown to him / her the applicant , Mr NORP and PERSON as the men who had made enquiries into the whereabouts of the victim .", "CARDINAL . One of the police officers also noted that the witnesses had repeatedly telephoned him after they had made their statements , saying that they wished to withdraw these statements because they feared reprisals by the applicant and his co - accused . The police officer considered that this fear was not unfounded given that , since the event , unknown persons had put pressure on the victim .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant in ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE . The charges against him included having been an accomplice to the offence of intentionally and unlawfully depriving PERSON of his liberty and keeping him deprived thereof .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of that charge , convicted him on another charge and sentenced him to a partly suspended term of CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , less the time spent in pre - trial detention . By a judgment of DATE , ORG also acquitted the applicant \u2019s co - accused , Mr D.", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and ORG ( Openbaar Ministerie ) lodged an appeal against ORG decision with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE . No appeal was lodged against the judgment concerning Mr NORP", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed ORG judgment , convicted the applicant , inter alia , of having deprived Mr A. of his liberty and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , less the time spent in pre - trial detention . ORG used in evidence , inter alia , the following section from the official police record of DATE ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) :", "\u201c It has emerged from the investigation that several witnesses saw PERSON , who was known to them , with CARDINAL other persons in bars in GPE in the night of CARDINAL to CARDINAL September . These witnesses also overheard these QUANTITY persons making enquiries into the whereabouts of the victim , PERSON", "CARDINAL witness was shown CARDINAL photographs , including pictures of the suspects Mr NORP , < the applicant > and PERSON The witness stated that s / he was PERCENT sure of recognising from the photographs the CARDINAL named persons as being the persons who had made enquiries into the whereabouts of the victim on CARDINAL and DATE in GPE . The witness had subsequently seen Mr NORP and < the applicant > leaving with the victim \u2019s brother , while PERSON had stayed behind in the bar in GPE , where shortly afterwards this Mr PERSON had been approached by < the applicant > , who had returned in the meantime , and who had taken PERSON outside . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG . It held that the way in which the facts had been established by ORG did not comply with legal requirements . It recalled that the statement of an anonymous witness could only be used in evidence if it had been taken down by a judge who knew the identity of the witness , who had expressed his opinion as regards the reasons for the witness \u2019s desire to remain anonymous and that witness \u2019s reliability , and who had provided the defence with ample opportunity to question the witness . ORG added that it could not be said that the finding of guilt was based to a significant extent on other evidence from identified sources . ORG decided that the applicant \u2019s original appeal against the judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE should be considered again and , to that end , referred the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the subsequent public hearing on DATE ORG instructed the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) of ORG of GPE to hear the witness who had previously recognised the applicant from photographs , as described in the official police record of DATE . If need be , that witness was to be heard with the application of appropriate measures to safeguard the witness \u2019s anonymity , should the witness wish to remain anonymous .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the witness was heard under oath by the investigating judge , who was aware of the identity of the witness . The opinion of the investigating judge that the identity of the witness should remain concealed was phrased as follows in the official record of the interview :", "\u201c In a short conversation prior to the actual interview , the investigating judge discussed with the witness the latter \u2019s wish to remain anonymous . The witness stated that s / he was fearful because CARDINAL of [ the applicant \u2019s ] fellow suspects can be very aggressive , which , according to the witness , is common knowledge . The witness also said that s / he feared reprisals given that , as the witness has heard it said , the case in which the witness is about to make a statement in itself also concerns an act of revenge .", "In view of the witness \u2019s statements above , as well as the contents of the record drawn up by the police officers on DATE and the statements of the witness which can not be reproduced here , the investigating judge is of the opinion that the necessity to hear the witness anonymously has been sufficiently substantiated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant attended the interview in a different room . In addition to his own questions , the investigating judge also put a number of questions to the witness at the request of counsel , who had submitted these questions to the investigating judge in writing beforehand . The investigating judge twice gave counsel the opportunity to read through the statement of the witness and to put further questions , again to be asked by the investigating judge , to the witness , and counsel did in fact avail himself of this opportunity .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to one of the questions put by counsel the witness said that when interviewed by police , on DATE , s / he had been handed a bundle of CARDINAL photographs . The witness had taken out CARDINAL photographs of persons whom s / he had recognised . Counsel also asked the witness why the latter was so afraid and why the witness wished to remain anonymous . In reply , the witness stated that s / he had explained the reasons to the investigating judge at the beginning of the interview . The witness added that some of these reasons had not , however , been noted down by the investigating judge as the latter had considered that by doing so the witness \u2019s anonymity could not be sufficiently guaranteed .", "CARDINAL . In the official record of the interview , the investigating judge noted that the statement of the witness appeared to be consistent and that it corresponded to the statement given previously to the police . In the opinion of the investigating judge , it could be concluded that the witness was a reliable witness .", "CARDINAL . At the subsequent hearing before ORG on DATE , counsel submitted that although his questions had been put to the anonymous witness , taking evidence from a witness who could neither be seen nor heard by the defence and who did not appear before the trial court remained problematic . Counsel also queried whether the anonymous witness \u2019s fear of reprisals was real or contrived . He further argued that the scent - association test carried out by a sniffer dog could not be relied upon since a similar test carried out by a different sniffer dog had not resulted in the applicant \u2019s scent being associated with the scent on a revolver .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant , inter alia , of having deprived PERSON of his liberty , and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , less the time spent in pre - trial detention . It based its finding of guilt on the following evidence :", "( a ) an official record of CARDINAL DATE , drawn up by a police officer , containing the statement of the victim , PERSON , to the effect that he had been forcibly taken from his house and beaten up , inter alia , with the butt of a chrome - coloured revolver , by CARDINAL men unknown to him ;", "( b ) an official record of CARDINAL DATE containing a statement from the police officers who had found PERSON to the effect that , when they were driving PERSON home , the latter had recognised the car in which he had been held and assaulted ;", "( c ) an official record of DATE containing a statement from the same police officers to the effect that they had found traces of blood on the car indicated by PERSON and that they had arrested PERSON near the car ;", "( d ) a report of CARDINAL DATE ( contained in an official police record of DATE ) drawn up by a member of the scientific police investigation department stating that the traces of blood found on the inside and outside of the car , as well as a chrome - coloured revolver and a jacket found inside the car , were sent to the forensic laboratory ( ORG ) together with a blood sample taken from the victim ;", "( e ) an official record drawn up by the forensic laboratory dated DATE indicating that the traces of blood could have come from PERSON ;", "( f ) an official record of DATE drawn up by a police officer stating that the revolver and a car telephone found in the car had been seized ;", "( g ) an official record of DATE drawn up by a police officer who had been in charge of a scent - association test which had been carried out with a sniffer dog , to the effect that this dog had CARDINAL times associated the scent on the butt of the revolver which had been found in the car with an object which had been held by the applicant ;", "( h ) the official record of DATE drawn up by the investigating judge containing the statement of the anonymous witness to the investigating judge , to the effect that , inter alia , the witness confirmed his / her previous statement to the police officers in which s / he said that s / he had seen the applicant and his co - defendants , whom the witness identified from photographs shown to him / her , on TIME DATE in a bar , that they had made enquiries into the whereabouts of the victim , and that the witness had heard from several people that the applicant and his co - defendants were involved in the assault and battery of the victim ; and", "( i ) the statement which the applicant had made at the hearing before ORG to the effect that he knew the defendants PERSON and PERSON NORP well , that the car in question had been used by PERSON in the period around DATE , that Mr NORP and he would regularly drive the car and that the telephone which had been present in the car had been registered in his name .", "CARDINAL . Unlike ORG of GPE , ORG did thus not make use of the statement made by the anonymous witness to the police on DATE , but only to this witness \u2019s statement before the investigating judge . The other items of evidence were essentially the same as those used by ORG of GPE in its judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment contained no assessment as to the reliability of the statement of the anonymous witness or as to the validity of the witness \u2019s desire to remain anonymous .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG . He complained , inter alia , that insufficient facts and/or circumstances had been adduced justifying the need for the witness to remain anonymous and that the statement of the anonymous witness could not be relied upon as it had been taken DATE after the alleged offence . The applicant further submitted that the series of photographs from which the anonymous witness was said to have selected the photograph of the applicant had not been put before the investigating judge . Neither the investigating judge nor the defence had therefore been in a position to assess the nature of the photographs , the way in which they were presented or the certainty of the recognition .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . After having noted that the investigating judge had found that the anonymous witness was afraid because CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - accused could be very violent and because the witness feared reprisals as the offence of which the applicant stood accused itself concerned an act of revenge , ORG considered that the conclusion of the investigating judge that there were circumstances justifying the anonymity of the witness did not constitute an incorrect interpretation of the law and was not incomprehensible . In respect of the applicant \u2019s complaints relating to the photographs which had originally been shown to the anonymous witness , ORG noted that the official record containing the statement taken on DATE had not been used in evidence against the applicant by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Relevant domestic law and practice at the time of the criminal proceedings complained of were as set out in the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of PERSON v. the GPE of DATE ( Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , p. CARDINAL ) and PERSON and Others v. the GPE of DATE ( Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . Reference is therefore made to those judgments , especially pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , and pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL respectively .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL , ORG considered that it had to be assumed in the light of ORG PERSON judgment ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) that the use of statements by anonymous witnesses was subject to stricter requirements than those established in its case - law until then . It established these stricter requirements in the following rule : such a statement must have been taken down by a judge who ( a ) is aware of the identity of the witness , ( b ) has expressed , in the official record of the hearing of such a witness , his reasoned opinion as to the reliability of the witness and as to the reasons for the wish of the witness to remain anonymous and ( c ) has provided the defence with some opportunity to put questions or have questions put to the witness . On the other hand , according to the same judgment , a written document containing the statement of an anonymous witness may be used in evidence if ( a ) the defence has not at any stage of the proceedings asked to be allowed to question the witness concerned , ( b ) the conviction is based to a significant extent on other evidence not derived from anonymous sources and ( c ) the trial court makes it clear that it has made use of the statement of the anonymous witness with caution and circumspection .", "CARDINAL . The Act of DATE , Staatsblad ( Official Gazette ) DATE , no . CARDINAL , has added to LAW ORG ) a number of detailed provisions relating to the \u201c protection of witnesses \u201d . It entered into force on DATE . The additions include the following . Article ORG now provides that the identity of a witness may remain secret if there is reason to believe that the disclosure of his identity may threaten his life , health , safety , family life or socio - economic existence and if the witness has made it clear that he does not wish to make any statement because of this . The decision is made by the investigating judge , who must first hear the prosecution , the defence and the witness himself . An appeal against the decision of the investigating judge lies to the trial court ( Article CARDINALb ) . The investigating judge may order that a threatened witness be heard in the absence of the accused , or of counsel , or of both , so as not to disclose the identity of the threatened witness ; in that event , the prosecuting authorities may not attend the questioning of the witness either . The investigating judge must then allow the defence to put questions of its own to the witness , either through the use of telecommunication or in writing ( Article CARDINALd ) . Article CARDINAL now lays down that the prosecution may refuse to summon a threatened witness . If the trial court has ordered that a witness be heard and that witness turns out to be under threat , he must be heard in camera by the investigating judge ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The statement of an anonymous witness taken in accordance with the above - mentioned provisions may only be used in evidence against a person accused of crimes in respect of which he may be held in detention on remand ( LAW ( b ) ) . A new paragraph has been added to LAW effect that a written document containing a statement of a person whose identity is not apparent may only be used in evidence if the conviction is based to a significant degree on other evidence and if the defence has not at any time during the trial sought to question that person or to have him questioned ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
