It held that the mere fact that a judge had presided over the panels extending the applicant \u2019s detention could not raise any issue of his impartiality since the questions to be decided when the detention was extended differed from those which the judge had to decide when examining the case on the merits . There were also no reasons to doubt the impartiality of Judge PERSON within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

At a hearing on CARDINAL DATE the trial bench questioned several witnesses and the defence again sought to have the evidence obtained by secret surveillance excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence . Ruling out the possibility of appeal , the president of the trial bench dismissed the request as ill - founded . The trial bench thus examined the evidence obtained by the use of secret surveillance measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG , composed of judges TIME , GPE and GPE , extended the applicant \u2019s detention under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( risk of reoffending and gravity of charges ) , reiterating the reasons stated in the previous decisions .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the applicant pleaded not guilty and denied all the charges against him . The parties gave their closing statements and the trial bench concluded the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The judgment was based on an analysis of the applicant \u2019s defence and the statements of his co - accused , as well as on the statements of witnesses , evidence obtained through numerous searches and seizures and the use of secret surveillance measures .", "CARDINAL . As to the refusal to exclude the latter evidence from the case file , ORG noted :", "\u201c The court found that the defence of the accused PERSON was unconvincing , contradictory and aimed at avoiding his criminal responsibility .... The court examined the audio recordings ( CD ) of the conversations between the accused and witnesses GPE and GPE after it had found that the recordings had been made pursuant to the orders of the investigating judge of ORG no . PERSON authorising the telephone tapping . These were the reasons why the court dismissed the request made during the proceedings that these recordings be excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence . [ Moreover ] the court considered them to be lawful and acceptable evidence obtained pursuant to valid court decisions . This court also refused the request by the defence to examine the case files of ORG no . PERSON and ORG no . PERSON [ concerning the use of secret surveillance ] , because it considered those requests irrelevant and obsolete for the same reasons referred to in the decisions concerning the requests for exclusion of the secret surveillance recordings from the case file . As to the request that the secret surveillance orders be excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence on the grounds that they did not contain an assessment of the likelihood that the accused themselves or jointly with other persons had committed one of the offences proscribed under LAW , and that they did not contain an assessment of whether the investigation could be conducted by other means , this court considers that this is not correct because the orders were sufficient and well - reasoned and eventually resulted in an indictment being lodged [ against the accused ] . In any event , as to the request by the defence that the secret surveillance orders be excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence , it should be noted that these are not evidence but court decisions so they can not be excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence . And as regards the evidence obtained on the basis of these orders , this court considers that there was no breach of LAW and therefore it does not consider them to be fruit of the poisonous tree but lawfully obtained evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the first - instance judgment with ORG . He argued , inter alia , that the secret surveillance orders had not been properly drafted as required under LAW given that they had not given a proper assessment of the likelihood that the offences in issue had been committed , or of the circumstances indicating that the investigation could not be conducted by other means . In his view , this had led to his unlawful surveillance and therefore any evidence thus obtained could not be used in the criminal proceedings against him . He challenged , further , the basis of the first - instance court \u2019s reasoning in its judgment , namely , the evidence obtained through secret surveillance . The applicant also requested ORG to quash the first - instance judgment and order that a retrial be held before a differently composed trial bench .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded and upheld the first - instance judgment on DATE . It held that all relevant facts had been sufficiently and correctly established , that the applicant had had every opportunity to participate effectively in the proceedings and that the first - instance court had given sufficient reasons for its decisions . As to the alleged unlawfulness of the applicant \u2019s secret surveillance , ORG noted :", "\u201c As regards the secret surveillance orders , contrary to what is alleged in the appeal , these impugned orders contain sufficient reasons as to probable cause to believe that the offence under LAW of LAW was committed , as well as to the fact that the investigation into this offence could not be conducted by other means and that [ such investigation ] would be extremely difficult , which is evident from the fact that the investigating judge did not refuse to issue the orders . In fact he issued the orders as required under LAW of LAW . It follows that the appellant \u2019s allegation that the impugned orders of the investigating judge do not contain sufficient reasons , is erroneous and that they are therefore not unlawfully obtained evidence within the meaning of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG on DATE arguing , inter alia , that the trial bench had lacked impartiality because of the previous involvement of Judge PERSON in the case ; that his secret surveillance had been unlawful on account of the failure of the investigating judge to issue an order in the manner required under the relevant law ; and that the use of the evidence thus obtained for his conviction had rendered the entire proceedings unfair .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint as ill - founded . It endorsed the reasoning of ORG with regard to the use of secret surveillance measures and the use of evidence thus obtained in the proceedings . As regards the lack of impartiality of the trial bench , ORG observed :", "\u201c In the case in issue , the mere fact that the president of the trial bench had on CARDINAL previous occasions ... sat on a panel which extended the appellant \u2019s pre - trial detention can not in itself be a reason for disqualifying the judge from deciding the merits of the case .", "There is a significant difference between the decision on detention and the decision on the guilt of the appellant . When ruling on an extension of detention , a member of a panel of judges decides only the legal issues on which the application of the procedural law concerning the so - called causae arresti ( LAW ) depends . Accordingly , he or she does not assess all the legal and factual aspects of the charges . The charges will be assessed in the first - instance proceedings . However , the appellant has not advanced any reasons why Judge PERSON \u2019s participation in the panel [ of judges ] which had extended his detention could be considered to have led him to form a previous conviction as to his guilt . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
