The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals . Mr PERSON was born in DATE and lives in GPE , while PERSON was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are the children of Mr Vasil Tonkev , who was killed on CARDINAL DATE during a police operation aimed at apprehending him .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL luxury cars were stolen in the GPE region in DATE . Mr PERSON was one of the suspected perpetrators of the thefts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG in GPE ordered an operation aimed at apprehending the perpetrators . He selected CARDINAL police officers to participate in the operation , scheduled for TIME . The officers were briefed in advance ; they were advised , in particular , that the individuals they were seeking to apprehend were dangerous and armed and would be unlikely to obey police orders .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the officers , in CARDINAL police cars and a minivan , left GPE for the city of PERSON , where , according to operational intelligence data , a theft was planned for TIME . They arrived in the city at TIME At TIME on CARDINAL DATE they were informed that a car , a ORG XCARDINAL , had been stolen and was heading towards GPE . It transpired subsequently that the car had been stolen and was being driven by Mr Tonkev . Once in GPE , he stole another car together with an accomplice .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police officers returned to GPE , where they were informed that the CARDINAL stolen cars were taking the motorway to GPE . QUANTITY police cars and a minivan followed them . At TIME the CARDINAL stolen cars left the motorway and entered nearby fields . The police officers set up CARDINAL roadblocks , obstructing roads in the area .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the CARDINAL cars left the fields and headed towards the first roadblock . Once the drivers had seen it , they made a U - turn . CARDINAL of the cars , driven by Mr Tonkev \u2019s accomplice , took a dirt road back towards the fields , followed by several officers . The car was subsequently found , but the driver managed to escape . Mr Tonkev remained on the road in the other stolen car , driving at high speed towards the second roadblock . The officers who were there tried to stop him , placing the police car in the middle of the road . However , PERSON did not stop but managed to drive round the car , hitting it . Then he continued towards the third roadblock .", "CARDINAL . Having been told on the radio by their colleagues that Mr Tonkev had driven past the second roadblock , had hit the police car and was driving towards them , the officers at the third roadblock made preparations to stop him . They parked their police minivan in the middle of the road and stood around it .", "CARDINAL . Mr Tonkev approached at high speed . With their hands raised , the officers signalled to him to stop . He did not do that , but instead directed the car at the officer who was standing to the left of the minivan and who had to jump hastily into the ditch to escape . The other officers from the group stated later that they had thought the car had knocked him down , as they had not been able to see him . Mr Tonkev then drove towards the other officers , who were standing in a group to the right of the minivan . The first CARDINAL of them , after once again making gestures indicating that he should stop , jumped out of the way . This left the third officer , PERSON , alone in front of the speeding car . Mr PERSON was armed with an AK-CARDINAL assault rifle , set to semi - automatic fire . He fired CARDINAL warning shots aimed to be into the air . However , at that very moment he had to jump hastily out of the way to avoid being hit by the car and fell to the ground . This changed the direction of the shots , which instead hit the front right - hand door of the car driven by Mr Tonkev . Already on the ground , Mr K.A. fired CARDINAL more shot , which hit the car \u2019s right rear tyre . CARDINAL of the other officers attempted to deploy a spike strip to stop the car , but did not succeed . Mr Tonkev continued driving and headed towards the fourth roadblock .", "CARDINAL . Approaching the roadblock at high speed , he once again directed the car at the police officers trying to stop him and they had to jump to CARDINAL side to escape . They managed to deploy a spike strip , but despite passing through it , Mr Tonkev continued driving and soon after that turned off onto a small dirt road . The police officers started searching the area . DATE they found the abandoned car . They heard Mr Tonkev cry for help and found him close by , wounded . They called an ambulance , but Mr Tonkev died before its arrival .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings concerning a possible offence under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) were instigated on DATE . The investigation was conducted against an \u201c unknown perpetrator \u201d until its conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the scene of the incident was visited by an investigator from the investigation service in GPE . He also inspected the car which had been driven by Mr Tonkev . CARDINAL bullet holes were found in its front right - hand door , but CARDINAL of the bullets had pierced the door and penetrated the interior . Stains of dry blood were found on the left - hand front seat . A bag of tools including pliers and screwdrivers was found on the back seat .", "CARDINAL . A post mortem of Mr Tonkev \u2019s body was carried out on CARDINAL DATE . A gunshot wound measuring QUANTITY was found in the right lower part of the thorax . The bullet , which had penetrated horizontally , had caused a laceration of the liver . This had resulted in a severe intra - abdominal haemorrhage , which had caused the death . The expert concluded that the lethal shot had not been fired at close range .", "CARDINAL . A ballistic expert report was drawn up on CARDINAL DATE . It established that the lethal shot had been fired from the ORG rifle used by Mr K.A.", "CARDINAL . Many of the officers who took part in the operation on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , including all of those who had been stationed at the third roadblock , were interviewed on different dates . PERSON was interviewed on CARDINAL DATE . He said that he had fired into the air and immediately after that had jumped back to escape the speeding car . He also stated that his aim had been to preserve the life and physical integrity of his colleagues and of Mr Tonkev .", "CARDINAL . A combined medico - ballistic expert report was drawn up on DATE . It established that the lethal shot which had killed ORG had been fired from QUANTITY . Whoever fired the shot had been positioned to the right and slightly in front of the victim . The shot had been fired while he was falling , staggering or jumping backwards and the gun had been in a horizontal position . The victim had been sitting in the driver \u2019s seat , leaning against the backrest in the normal way .", "CARDINAL . Another medico - ballistic expert report , drawn up on DATE , concluded that , while firing the first CARDINAL shots , Mr K.A. had been moving to the right , attempting to escape the approaching car . It was possible that at the time the second of these shots was fired he was no longer supporting the rifle with his left hand , which was thus in a position close to horizontal . The experts were of the view that it was impossible for shots fired into the air to have the trajectory observed in the case .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions in the course of the investigation the ORG representatives requested the replacement of the investigator and the prosecutor in charge of the case , arguing that they were not carrying out a thorough and independent investigation . In particular , the applicant \u2019s representatives considered that the investigator and the prosecutor , by commencing an investigation concerning a possible offence under LAW of LAW , had predetermined the course of the criminal proceedings and had allegedly unjustifiably sought to discontinue the proceedings ( see below ) . On all occasions the requests for replacement of the investigator and the prosecutor were refused by their superiors , it being found that the investigation was being carried out in a thorough and vigorous manner and that the allegations made by the applicants could not justify the conclusion that the investigator and the prosecutor were not independent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor in charge of the case decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings , finding , on the basis of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , that no offence had been committed in connection with Mr Tonkev \u2019s death . The prosecutor considered that Mr Tonkev \u2019s actions , namely his directing of the powerful car he had been driving at high speed towards the police officers , represented an unlawful direct attack that placed their health and lives at risk . It therefore justified self - defence on their part , in particular the firing of the QUANTITY shots by Mr K.A.", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the first applicant , on DATE the ORG quashed the prosecutor \u2019s decision , considering that she had not examined in a thorough manner the particular circumstances in which Mr K.A. had fired the lethal shot , such as the position of his body and the possible trajectory of the bullet .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor collected further evidence , in particular the expert report mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above , and on DATE decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings , relying once again on the provision contained in LAW . She considered that Mr Tonkev had launched a \u201c direct and unlawful attack \u201d on the police officers at the second , third and fourth roadblocks , using the car he was driving \u201c as a weapon \u201d capable of injuring or killing any CARDINAL of them . Thus , Mr K.A. had \u201c no longer aimed at apprehending \u201d Mr Tonkev , but had acted in self - defence , in order to protect his own life , and also the lives of his colleagues . Given Mr Tonkev \u2019s aggressiveness , the action taken in selfdefence had not been disproportionate . Mr K.A. had used his firearm after all other attempts to halt the attack had proved futile .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the first applicant , on DATE ORG upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision , confirming her conclusion that PERSON had acted in self - defence , and finding that the investigation of Mr PERSON \u2019s death had been objective and thorough . The court dismissed the first applicant \u2019s argument that it had been necessary to examine as witnesses all officers who had participated in the operation of CARDINAL April-CARDINAL DATE , pointing out that all the eye - witnesses to the relevant events had been interviewed . The domestic court dismissed a further argument put forward by the first applicant that Mr Tonkev had not been armed , that his actions had been predictable and that he had not posed a danger to the officers . The court pointed out that Mr Tonkev had used the car driven by him \u201c as a weapon \u201d and that he had aimed at injuring or even killing the police officers trying to stop him . Thus , it did not appear that the use of lethal force was unjustified . Lastly , the domestic court dismissed the argument that the police ORG actions had been \u201c inadequate \u201d and that they could have halted the car \u2019s movement by using spike strips at TIME than the fourth roadblock . It noted that the place where Mr Tonkev and his accomplice had been hiding and the route they were intending to take had been unclear and that , moreover , the situation had unfolded very quickly .", "CARDINAL . Upon a further appeal by the first applicant , in a final decision of DATE ORG upheld the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings . It noted that Mr Tonkev \u2019s death had occurred within the framework of a police operation organised with the aim of apprehending him after he had stolen a car . It observed also that Mr Tonkev \u2019s actions had created \u201c a real and immediate danger \u201d for the police officers at the third roadblock and that in firing the shot which had killed PERSON , PERSON had acted in self - defence . ORG noted further that at the moment when the shots were fired , the attack carried out by Mr Tonkev had not ceased and that the actions taken in defence had been aimed at repelling it . This was illustrated by the fact that the shots fired by PERSON had been directed at the front right door of the car , and not at the side windows ; thus , he had aimed to halt the car \u2019s movement and prevent its running over him and his colleagues . Lastly , ORG concluded that the self - defence manifested in the case had been within the necessary limits , seeing that the attack launched by ORG had been strongly violent . For the self - defence to be considered disproportionate , it would have to have clearly exceeded what had been necessary to repel the attack , and this had not been the case .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of DATE provides that an act committed in self - defence and not causing disproportionate harm to the attacker is not criminal .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , causing death by a disproportionate reaction to an attack is punishable by up to MONEY imprisonment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
