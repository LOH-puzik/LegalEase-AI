WIMMER GESELLSCHAFT mbH v. AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are CARDINAL companies incorporated in GPE . The first applicant company is the proprietor and publisher of the NORP DATE newspaper \u201c PERSON GPE \u201d , the second applicant company is the proprietor and publisher of the NORP newspaper \u201c ORG \u201d .", "They are represented before the ORG by Mr T. H\u00f6hne , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the corporate applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The application is directed against the DATE amendment to LAW ) concerning section CARDINALb on the \u201c protection of the presumption of innocence \u201d , which provides for a compensation claim against the proprietor of a news medium in certain cases of reporting contrary to the presumption of innocence ( see relevant domestic law , below ) .", "In DATE the corporate applicants and other proprietors of news media instituted proceedings in ORG ) claiming that the impugned provision violated their right to freedom of expression , freedom of the press and their right to property , and also amounted to discrimination .", "On DATE ORG dismissed their requests that section CARDINALb of LAW as a whole , or particular passages of section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) of that LAW , be declared incompatible with their constitutional rights and thus null and void .", "As regards the corporate applicants\u2019 right to apply to ORG , the ORG recalled that , in order to be able to lodge a complaint under LAW , a complainant had to show that the legal provision constituted an immediate and not only a potential violation of the complainant \u2019s interests , and that there was no other reasonable remedy . Doubts as regards the compliance of legal provisions with LAW usually had to be raised in proceedings before the ordinary courts . However , no - one could be expected to commit an offence in order to have the opportunity to raise such doubts in the course of ensuing criminal proceedings . In the present case , ORG considered that section CARDINALb of LAW immediately restricted the corporate applicants\u2019 freedom of expression and that there was no other reasonable remedy , as they could not be expected to contravene this provision and thereby cause proceedings under LAW .", "In its further reasoning , ORG , referring to principles established by the case - law of ORG ( Sunday Times ( I ) v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE ; PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE ) and to its own case - law , recalled that freedom of expression held a prominent place in a NORP society and that the press performed special tasks as purveyors of information and opinions of a political nature or of other general interest .", "ORG found that section CARDINALb of LAW interfered with freedom of expression . It then turned to the question of whether this interference was justified under paragraph CARDINAL of LAW as being necessary for the protection of the rights of others and maintaining the impartiality of the judiciary .", "Having regard to the corporate applicants\u2019 argument that the strict prohibition under section CARDINALb of LAW was disproportionate in cases of predominant public interest , ORG recalled that the protection of the rights guaranteed under the Convention sometimes required the ORG to take positive measures .", "In the Constitutional Court \u2019s view , the NORP legislator , in enacting the impugned provision , had complied with its constitutional duty to prevent that reporting in the news media , or possibly even a press campaign , stigmatised a person as guilty of a criminal offence and thereby rendered the presumption of innocence ineffective , thus prejudicing the fairness of the ensuing trial . In doing so , the legislator had acted within its margin of appreciation under paragraph CARDINAL of LAW . There was no justifiable public interest in denouncing persons as convicted criminal offenders , i.e. in having a \u201c trial by newspaper \u201d ( ORG ) , before they had been found guilty according to the law . Section CARDINALb of LAW was only concerned with press reports of such a nature and did not prevent true reporting about criminal cases .", "", "ORG also found that , given the importance of the principle of the presumption of innocence , the exceptions enumerated in section CARDINAL ) of LAW and the choice of civil compensation instead of criminal sanctions , there was no indication of disproportionality . Furthermore , the abstract maximum amounts of fines for causing actual bodily harm or defamation by far exceeded the maximum amount of compensation fixed in section CARDINALb of LAW .", "For similar reasons , ORG rejected the corporate applicants\u2019 argument that there was a violation of their right to property , in particular in cases of a subsequent conviction of the person concerned .", "The decision was served on DATE .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "Section CARDINALb of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) is entitled \u201c Protection of the presumption of innocence \u201d ( PERSON der Unschuldsvermutung ) and reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A person suspected of having committed an offence but not yet convicted by final judgment , who is portrayed in a medium as being guilty or as the perpetrator of the offence and not only suspected of having committed the offence , is entitled to claim compensation from the proprietor of the news medium ( editor ) for the insult suffered . The amount of compensation shall not exceed CARDINAL ORG ; \u2026", "CARDINAL . There shall be no right to compensation if", "( CARDINAL ) a true report about a hearing at a public session of ORG , ORG , ORG , the ORG of a Land or a committee of these general representative bodies is concerned ,", "( CARDINAL ) a true report about a conviction at first instance is concerned which indicates that the conviction is not final ,", "( CARDINAL ) the person concerned has made a confession in public or before a medium and has not revoked it ,", "( CARDINAL ) a direct broadcast ( live broadcast ) is concerned and the employee of the broadcast has applied the care required of journalists ,", "( CARDINAL ) a true quotation of the statement of a third person is concerned and if there was a predominant public interest in the publication of the quoted statement . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
