On DATE the applicant was again questioned as an accused in the presence of lawyer GPE , during which he made similar submissions and pleaded partly guilty .", "CARDINAL .

Furthermore , he had no criminal record , had pleaded guilty and regretted his actions .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on unspecified dates CARDINAL other witnesses , GPE and GPE , were also questioned in connection with the applicant \u2019s case .

Furthermore , the lawyer even failed to satisfy his request to be provided with a copy of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s case was brought before the PERSON and Nor ORG of GPE which started its examination on DATE . The applicant submitted before ORG that he wished to be represented by lawyer GPE", "CARDINAL . The examining judge noted at the outset that the witnesses had been duly notified but had failed to appear and inquired about the opinion of the parties . The prosecutor submitted that they had to be compelled to appear . The lawyer made a similar submission on the ground that it was impossible to examine the case without the witnesses . The judge agreed and adjourned the hearing until DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE CARDINAL witnesses appeared , witnesses GPE and GPE and police officers PERSON and GPE ..", "CARDINAL . Witness GPE admitted that he was seeing the applicant for the second time , the first time being on DATE at the prosecutor \u2019s office . He further submitted that DATE before he was at work at the marketplace when somebody had approached and given him a leaflet , adding that \u201c DATE at TIME there would be a demonstration on FAC \u201d . The person handing out the leaflets was tall and had grey hair . He gave the leaflet and said \u201c come at TIME , we will crush , shatter and conquer \u201d . Witness GPE submitted that he had understood from these statements that the demonstrators wanted to change the government . In reply to the applicant \u2019s lawyer \u2019s questions , witness GPE submitted that he was not familiar with that person and he could not say for sure if it was the applicant who had given the leaflet and made the statements . He was sure though that he had seen the applicant at the prosecutor \u2019s office . Witness PERSON explained that he had stated at the prosecutor \u2019s office that he had not seen who was distributing the leaflets , to which they replied that it had been the applicant . In reply to the judge \u2019s question as to why he had stated unequivocally during the investigation that it was the applicant who had distributed the leaflets and made the above statements , witness GPE submitted that he had said so because he had been told at the prosecutor \u2019s office that it was the applicant who was distributing leaflets in the area of the marketplace . He further submitted that he could not remember who it was , but people around him said that it was the applicant , so he said the same .", "CARDINAL . Witness PERSON submitted that at some point in DATE he was at the marketplace when the applicant , who was distributing leaflets , approached him and invited him to a demonstration in order to \u201c turn over \u201d the government . The applicant then left . Witness PERSON further confirmed his pre - trial statement and asked to rely on it . He also confirmed that the person distributing the leaflets , like the applicant , had grey hair and a white shirt and was tall .", "CARDINAL . Police officer ORG submitted that he was on duty at the marketplace with police officer G.A. where they noticed a person who was handing out leaflets . They approached him and brought to the police station , where he was identified as the applicant . They could not hear what he was saying to the vendors . In reply to the applicant \u2019s lawyer \u2019s questions , police officer PERSON said that he personally did not hear any calls from the applicant . Nor did any of the vendors tell him that the applicant had made calls .", "CARDINAL . Police officer G.A. made similar submissions .", "CARDINAL . The examining judge then announced that he had received an official letter from the police stating that witness PERSON had not been found at his place of residence , that witness PERSON was absent from his place of residence and lived elsewhere , and that the court \u2019s decision ordering the appearance of these witnesses , in its part concerning witness GPE , had not been executed for reasons not communicated to the court . The prosecutor requested that the pre - trial statements of these witnesses be read out . The applicant and his lawyer consented , after which the statements were read out .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was then examined , during which he admitted that he had distributed leaflets but denied having made any calls for a violent overthrow of the government .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter the trial entered its final stage of pleadings . The prosecutor made a speech , followed by the applicant \u2019s lawyer and the applicant himself . The lawyer , in particular , made the following speech : \u201c I find that the defendant must be acquitted \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty as charged and imposed DATE suspended sentence , ordering at the same time the applicant \u2019s release from detention under a written undertaking not to leave his place of residence . ORG found , in particular , that :", "\u201c On DATE [ the applicant ] received leaflets from the PERSON and Nor PERSON district office of ORG concerning a rally to be held on DATE at TIME on FAC , distributed them to persons working and involved in trade in the area of the seventh market situated in [ ORG ] and made public calls inciting to a violent overthrow of the government and the constitutional order . In particular , when handing out leaflets to [ GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and PERSON , he incited them to participate in the rally telling them \u2018 You must come by all means , we will crush , overcome , put an end to the government and sort them out , we will make a coup , we will violently overthrow the current government and establish a new ORG \u201d", "CARDINAL . In support of its findings ORG relied on the statements of witnesses GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and PERSON As regards , in particular , the statements made by witness GPE in court , ORG dismissed them as unreliable and admitted his statements made during the confrontation of DATE . ORG justified this decision by the fact that the statements made by witness GPE during the confrontation had been unequivocal . Thus , according to the entirety of the witness statements relied on by ORG , the applicant had made the following calls while handing out the leaflets and inciting people to attend the demonstration : \u201c we will crush and overcome \u201d ( witness GPE ) , \u201c the government will be changed and we will put an end to the government and sort them out \u201d ( witness FAC ) , \u201c a struggle will start at the demonstration aimed at changing the government and establishing a lawful CARDINAL \u201d , \u201c the current government will be overthrown and a new one will be established \u201d , \u201c the current government is unlawful and has to be changed \u201d ( witness ORG ) , \u201c the government has to be overthrown and a coup has to be made \u201d ( witness ORG ) and \u201c the current government has to be eliminated and violently overthrown and a new order has to be established \u201d ( witness PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal , which he apparently drafted himself . In his appeal the applicant submitted that during the investigation he had pleaded guilty only to distributing leaflets , which in any event was not an offence , but he had never made any calls for a violent overthrow of the government . He was not a member of any political party , had never participated in demonstrations or had links with the parties organising them . The applicant further complained about the fact that the statements made by witnesses GPE and FAC in court , which were favourable for him , had been considered unreliable , while other witnesses , being ashamed of their false statements , had failed to appear in court . He argued that the statements of those witnesses who had not been examined in court should not have served as a basis for his conviction . The applicant lastly stated that the arresting police officers had not heard him make any calls . Thus , he had been convicted on the basis of statements of CARDINAL or CARDINAL witnesses who had seen him for the first time at the prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the proceedings commenced before the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal . The applicant submitted before ORG that he wished to be represented by lawyer GPE and pleaded not guilty . Lawyer PERSON also claimed that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to acquit him .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE , following the applicant \u2019s examination , the presiding judge announced that it was necessary to summon and examine witnesses GPE , GPE and PERSON He further stated that he had telephoned all CARDINAL witnesses on DATE . PERSON \u2019s wife replied that DATE before he had gone to GPE for work and his whereabouts were unknown . PERSON \u2019s wife replied that he had gone to another region for work and that she had no further information about him . PERSON \u2019s relatives replied that he had left GPE for work . ORG decided , taking into account that the attendance of the above witnesses was indispensable , that they be compelled to appear . This task was assigned to the local police department . The hearing was adjourned until DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE the presiding judge announced that , according to the police , the witnesses were absent from their places of residence . The police had promised to provide further information in writing . In reply to the presiding judge \u2019s question , the parties did not object to proceeding with the hearing and requested that measures be taken to ensure the attendance of the witnesses at the next hearing .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE the presiding judge informed the parties that an official letter had been received from the police informing that witnesses GPE , GPE and PERSON were absent from their places of residence . While reading out that letter , the presiding judge noticed that the police had visited the wrong address as far as witness ORG was concerned . The prosecutor then requested that their statements be read out . Lawyer GPE submitted that the witnesses in question had made defamatory statements against the applicant during the investigation which lacked credibility and it was therefore necessary to bring them to court with the help of the police . The applicant joined his lawyer \u2019s request and asked that the witnesses in question appear in court and also present their identity documents . ORG decided that , since a wrong address had been indicated in the decision ordering ORG \u2019s appearance in court , it was necessary to inform the police of the correct address . As regards witnesses PERSON and GPE , the former was in GPE , while the latter was out of town . This was also confirmed by the telephone calls made by the presiding judge . ORG found that , in such circumstances , there were no reasons to doubt the veracity of the police information and announced that it would read out and examine the pre - trial statements of those witnesses . The statements would then be analysed in the deliberation room and an assessment would be made as to their credibility , since the evidence examined in court was sufficient to allow such an assessment . ORG then proceeded to read out the statements in question . The applicant submitted that their statements did not concern him since there had been many tall , grey - haired men at the marketplace . The investigating authority had never arranged his identification by those witnesses and their statements were therefore false .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE the presiding judge announced that an official letter had been received from the police , according to which witness ORG indeed resided at the correct address but nobody answered the door during their visit . The presiding judge announced that , not being satisfied by the information contained in the police letter , he personally called ORG home and became convinced that nobody was there because nobody answered the telephone . The prosecutor requested that the statement of witness ORG be read out in court , while both the applicant and his lawyer submitted that the statement of witness ORG lacked credibility and requested that it be disregarded . The court then proceeded to read out the statement .", "DATE . At the same hearing the applicant filed a motion with ORG dispensing with the services of lawyer GPE He submitted that the lawyer had not taken any steps to defend his interests and to prove his innocence . The lawyer had never come to visit him in detention despite the requests he had made to the administration of the detention facility . Furthermore the lawyer , without his knowledge , had filed a motion on DATE seeking his release , in which the lawyer stated that he had pleaded guilty despite the fact that he had never pleaded fully guilty , thereby acting to his detriment and assisting the prosecution in substantiating the charge against him . The applicant claimed that he had found out about this motion only during the appeal proceedings . He further claimed in his motion that he had pleaded guilty to distributing leaflets because he was not aware that such act did not constitute an offence . He realised this only following his release from detention because no copy of LAW had been provided to him by either the investigator or his lawyer while in detention , despite his numerous requests . The applicant lastly claimed that the case against him had been fabricated . He submitted that , while sitting behind a glass wall at the police station , he was shown to some people who later became witnesses and made false statements against him . Some of them he was not able to examine and CARDINAL of them appeared in court . CARDINAL of those CARDINAL retracted his pre - trial statement , while the second one , because of giving a false statement , was even ashamed to look him in the eyes and was only able to mumble a confirmation of his pretrial statement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated at the same time that it was his personal choice to dispense with the services of his lawyer . ORG decided to grant the applicant \u2019s motion and to allow him to defend himself in person . The lawyer was then asked to leave the courtroom .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal adopted its judgment upholding the applicant \u2019s conviction . In doing so , ORG referred to the statements of witnesses GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE and of police officers PERSON and G.A. As regards the statement of witness GPE , ORG found that it should not have formed a basis for the applicant \u2019s conviction because that witness had failed to appear in court despite a court order . ORG further rejected the applicant \u2019s claim that he had only distributed leaflets but not made any calls for a violent overthrow of the government . In doing so , ORG stated that CARDINAL witnesses had testified that the applicant had made such calls . Furthermore , the police officers had arrested him while he was handing out the leaflets . In the light of the overall sufficiency of evidence , the fact that witnesses PERSON and PERSON had failed to appear in court could not put into doubt the applicant \u2019s involvement in the act and his guilt . The criminal element in his actions lay in the making of calls inciting violent seizure of power and change of the constitutional order . Those calls were public and aimed at a big group of people . Since he made such calls at a marketplace during the daytime , they were audible to the public . The fact that they were perceived as calls inciting to a violent overthrow of the government was confirmed by the witness statements .", "CARDINAL . ORG further dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint about lawyer PERSON , stating that the applicant \u2019s right to defence had been ensured by the investigating authority , he had chosen his position regarding the charge against him without any outside pressure and he had not previously made any complaints about the lawyer . Furthermore , the fact that the nature of the charge was clear to the applicant was evident from the records of investigative measures . He had certified this with his signature in the presence of his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law in which he raised arguments concerning the witnesses against him and the alleged failure of lawyer GPE to provide effective legal assistance , similar to those raised in his complaint of DATE . He also added that the witness statements against him had been fabricated under police pressure . The witnesses in question were people trying to make a living by working at the market , so if they had refused to follow police orders they would have been immediately expelled from the market .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . In doing so , ORG found that both witnesses PERSON and GPE had made statements implicating the applicant . As regards the legal representation , the applicant had agreed that lawyer GPE defend his interests and the lawyer had properly done so .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the head of staff of ORG informed the applicant , in reply to his complaint , that lawyer PERSON had lawfully carried out the applicant \u2019s defence and had not done anything illegal . The motion of DATE had been filed upon the applicant \u2019s and his relatives\u2019 request .", "CARDINAL .
