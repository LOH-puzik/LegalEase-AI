NORP In DATE the applicant applied to the ORG for a NORP citizen 's passport for travel abroad ( \u043f\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430 GPE \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0457\u0437\u0434\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d ; an \u201c external passport \u201d ) . It appears from the case file that , when submitting his application , the applicant was obliged to complete and sign a form on which he gave his given name as ORG .

After adversarial proceedings , the court dismissed the appeal in a judgment of DATE .

The court also noted that all of the principal entries in such a passport were to follow the model of the corresponding entries in the internal passport issued to the same person . On the first page of his internal passport , the applicant 's given name had been entered as ORG ; accordingly , this spelling was also to be used in the external passport . In addition , the court pointed out that the applicant himself had written his given name as ORG on the passport application form ; consequently , his objections were unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . He vehemently denied that he had used the form ORG on the application form . In his opinion , this was a manifestly erroneous finding by the court of first instance , since he had , without question , indicated that his given name was PERSON and not PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the findings of the court of first instance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently made several applications to the prosecution service and the President of ORG for supervisory review of the final decision , all of which were dismissed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant submitted an internal appeal to the head of the ORG 's local branch . He challenged the fact that his given name and patronymic had been translated into NORP ; in particular , he alleged that , even on the NORP page of the passport , these ought to have appeared in their original form merely transliterated into the NORP alphabet , not replaced by their NORP equivalents . Consequently , according to the applicant , his name ought to have been written on page CARDINAL of the passport as \u201c LOC \u201d ( PERSON ) , since the NORP grapheme ' \u0418 ' reads as [ i ] in NORP but as [ y ] in GPE . The appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG , PERSON , for an order requiring the authorities to issue him with a new passport in which his given name and patronymic would be written in their original form on both the NORP and NORP pages .

After adversarial proceedings , ORG dismissed the appeal as unfounded . The judgment noted that the disputed passport had been drawn up in compliance with ORG , which stated that the holder 's personal data were to appear \u201c in NORP and in NORP \u201d . Finally , the court pointed out that page CARDINAL of the passport had been drawn up in NORP , and that all the elements of the applicant 's name appeared on it in their original form ; accordingly , there had been no violation of the applicant 's fundamental rights .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this judgment to ORG which , in a judgment of DATE , also dismissed his appeal . In ORG opinion , the provision by which the holder 's personal data were to appear \u201c in NORP and in NORP \u201d indeed meant that the given name , patronymic and surname were \u201c to comply with the requirements of the NORP language , in application of the rules governing literary translation \u201d .
