AUSTRIA (No. 3)", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression -{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression)", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Steiner;Erik M\u00f8se;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company is a limited liability company based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company is the owner of the DATE newspaper ORG . In its issue of DATE , in the economics section , the applicant company published an article dealing with the investigation into losses incurred by ORG . The article reads as follows :", "\u201c PERSON \u2019s Hypo now also facing criminal investigation", "After ORG , the prosecution service is now also looking into allegations of embezzlement against ORG . PERSON has accused the judicial authorities of being overzealous and politically motivated .", "GPE \u2013 Following the discovery of massive speculative losses from swap deals , the floodgates are threatening to open at LOC . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office initiated an investigation in respect of Hypo senior managers . Chief public prosecutor PERSON said that the investigation , concerning suspected embezzlement , had been launched by the prosecution service of its own motion and that it would take the findings of ORG audit into account .", "Regional governor PERSON criticised the \u201c judicial authorities\u2019 overzealousness \u201d and spoke of a \u201c politically motivated ploy to deflect attention away from the PERSON scandal \u201d . His deputy PERSON described the MONEY lost as a result of the speculation as a \u201c molehill that should not be made into a mountain \u201d .", "PERSON , of ORG executive board , and PERSON , who represents Hypo \u2019s shareholders and also ( through ORG ) performs a supervisory function at the bank , had previously blamed the speculative losses of MONEY on an individual member of the bank \u2019s treasury department , PERSON , the son of a former ORG regional government member with responsibility for finance . In DATE PERSON was not dismissed but merely demoted and transferred , being relieved of his duties only after the incident of the losses had become known .", "PERSON had been in charge of the treasury department , together with PERSON , in DATE . The department was , however , under PERSON \u2019s personal authority as chairman of the executive board . To relieve PERSON of his responsibilities as regards the treasury department , PERSON was brought in to join PERSON and PERSON on the Hypo board in DATE . At the same time , the PERCENT managing shareholder of ORG , PERSON , was promoted to become chairman of the Hypo supervisory board . PERSON \u2019s GPE subsidiary , ORG , audited Hypo \u2019s accounts . The DATE financial statements , in which the massive speculative losses were intended to be adjusted , were signed by the PERSON auditors PERSON and PERSON , the former of whom frequently crops up in circles close to PERSON . As the swap losses were evidently too large - scale for PERSON \u2019s GPE subsidiary to handle , the audit firm ORG was consulted and promptly informed ORG .", "Meanwhile , Hypo \u2019s flotation , which surprisingly had recently been brought forward to DATE , is very much up in the air . How matters are to proceed will now probably be on the agenda of Hypo \u2019s shareholder meeting on DATE .", "Against this background , PERSON interest in ORG also appears in a new light . In DATE Hypo submitted the last and the best bid , but suddenly withdrew its offer . Buying PERSON would have made sense because at the time it had MONEY in losses carried forward in its accounts , which would have allowed Hypo to save on capital - gains tax . It is possible that the acquisition failed to materialise because of the substantial losses from the botched swap transaction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Rauscher brought proceedings against the applicant company for disclosure of his identity in breach of section FAC of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) . He submitted that he was not a public figure and that his position in the bank had not been such as to justify the disclosure of his name . He asserted that when authorising the transactions at issue he had acted in accordance with his instructions and under the supervision of his superior \u2019s and the bank \u2019s risk management . The publication of his name had had negative repercussions on his professional advancement and had not been justified by any public interest .", "CARDINAL . In its submissions in reply , the applicant company contended that the article had not depicted the claimant as the person responsible for the losses but rather as the \u201c scapegoat \u201d . The public interest in the disclosure of his name outweighed his private interests since he had held a leading position in the bank and there was also a connection with the political sphere on account of his father \u2019s position as a former regional government member responsible for finance ( NORP ) . Moreover , the article had reported on the issue in a neutral manner .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) dismissed Mr PERSON \u2019s action .", "CARDINAL . It noted that the claimant had been head of ORG treasury department which had incurred losses of FAC to MONEY ( ORG ) in DATE . It also noted that the article , which reported on the investigation into embezzlement by the public prosecutor \u2019s office and mentioned the claimant \u2019s full name as the person who was being blamed for these losses , contained the information that the claimant was suspected of a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of LAW required a weighing of the claimant \u2019s interest in the protection of his identity and the public interest in its disclosure .", "CARDINAL . It noted that the claimant , who had lost his job at ORG , was unemployed . The mentioning of his name in the context of the speculation scandal as being suspected of the criminal offence of embezzlement was certainly detrimental to his professional advancement within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW . However , it had to be assumed that the claimant \u2019s former position and activity at LOC was known in banking and business circles even without the publication of his name in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . It remained to be examined whether there was an overriding public interest in the disclosure of the claimant \u2019s name . The court noted that it had heard the claimant as a witness and had DATE on the basis of his submissions \u2013 found that the following facts were established . MONEY of ORG was owned by ORG . DATE the bank had incurred losses of FAC to MONEY as a result of foreign currency speculations . The claimant had been the head of the bank \u2019s treasury department from DATE until DATE , when he had terminated his employment on his own initiative . In his capacity as head of the treasury he had had to authorise or refuse foreign currency transactions . The losses had thus been incurred under his responsibility . He had only been answerable to the bank \u2019s executive board , which consisted of CARDINAL members . The claimant \u2019s father had been a regional government member responsible for finance until DATE . While the claimant was head of the bank \u2019s treasury , his father had been on the bank \u2019s supervisory board .", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted that the claimant , although having been a senior employee of the bank , was not a public figure . Thus , he did not have \u201c a position in society \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which would justify the publication of his name . Nor did the fact that his father had held such a position justify the disclosure of the claimant \u2019s name .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , ORG held that there was a connection between the claimant \u2019s professional activity and public life for the purposes of this provision : as the ORG owned PERCENT of the bank , the Land and consequently the taxpayer had to carry a considerable share of the losses . The claimant had been in a leading position , being responsible for the very department which had caused the losses . The public , or in other words , the taxpayer thus had an overriding interest in receiving information about the identity of those who were responsible for the enormous losses . Consequently , PERSON had been entitled to mention the claimant \u2019s name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) granted the claimant \u2019s appeal and ordered the applicant company to pay MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation to the claimant and to reimburse his procedural costs .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal agreed with ORG that the claimant had been presented as someone suspected of embezzling a large sum of money . However , it found that ORG had wrongly weighed the conflicting interests at issue :", "\u201c ORG finding that the public interest in the publication of the claimant \u2019s name outweighed his interest in the protection of his identity can not , however , be endorsed . The former must be assessed against an objective standard and , in particular , with reference to the identity of the person concerned ; for that reason the mere public interest in the reporting of a crime does not by itself suffice . In accordance with settled case - law , when assessing whether the identity of persons listed in section CARDINAL ) of LAW may be revealed , a strict standard must be applied , especially as the general public has , in principle , no legal right to know the identity of the persons concerned . ...", "At the time the article was published , the investigation into the \u201c Hypo Alpe - Adria affair \u201d was still in the early stages . According to the claimant , no proceedings had yet been brought against him , and the subject matter of the article in question was only the rumours of accusations against him by CARDINAL senior bank officials . However , at this time there was no independent value in the disclosure of the claimant \u2019s name that would have outweighed the legitimate interest in protecting his anonymity . The claimant \u2019s name was clearly disclosed in order to make a connection with his father , the former regional government member responsible for finance , and by doing so create a \u201c story \u201d which would satisfy the public \u2019s curiosity and appetite for the sensational to a high degree . In practice , the disclosure of the claimant \u2019s name had no informative value whatsoever and so the weighing of interests must operate in favour of the claimant . ...", "ORG is right in stating that the public has a very substantial interest in finding out who is responsible for these enormous losses . However , this does not justify the disclosure of the claimant \u2019s identity in a situation where the suspicions are so vague and uncertain . ...", "Since the first - instance court found that the publication of the claimant \u2019s name had had considerable negative consequences for him , and taking into account the gravity of the accusation and the wide circulation of PERSON , compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL seems to be appropriate . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , so far as material , provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where publication is made , through any medium , of a name , image or other particulars which are likely to lead to the disclosure to a larger not directly informed circle of people of the identity of a person who", "CARDINAL . NORP has been the victim of an offence punishable by the courts or", "CARDINAL . NORP is suspected of having committed , or has been convicted of , a punishable offence , and where legitimate interests of that person are thereby injured and there is no predominant public interest in the publication of such details on account of the person \u2019s position in society , of some other connection with public life , or of other reasons , the victim shall have a claim against the owner of the medium ( publisher ) for damages for the injury suffered . .... \u201d", "( CARDINAL ) ORG interests of the victim shall in any event be injured if the publication", "CARDINAL .
