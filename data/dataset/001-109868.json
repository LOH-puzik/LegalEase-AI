In such cases a serviceman was entitled either to an early termination of his service for family reasons , or to CARDINAL months\u2019 leave .

The case of PERSON v. Ministre de l\u2019Economie , des Finances et de l\u2019Industrie , PERSON publique , PERSON , deals with the issue of service credit for children being awarded only to female civil servants in accordance with the NORP civil and military retirement pension scheme . In its judgment of DATE ORG ( ECJ ) observed that the grant of that credit was not linked to maternity leave or to the disadvantages which a female civil servant incurred in her career as a result of being absent from work during the period following the birth of a child . This credit was linked to a separate period , namely that devoted to bringing up the children . In this connection , the ECJ found that the situations of a male civil servant and a female civil servant were comparable as regard the bringing - up of children . In particular , the fact that female civil servants were more affected by the occupational disadvantages entailed in bringing up children , because this was a task generally carried out by women , did not prevent their situation from being comparable to that of a male civil servant who had assumed the task of bringing up his children and had thereby been exposed to the same career - related disadvantages .", "CARDINAL . Further , the ECJ noted that NORP legislation introduced a difference in treatment on grounds of sex in regard to male civil servants who had in fact assumed the task of bringing up their children . That measure was not justified because it was not of a nature such as to offset the disadvantages to which the careers of female civil servants were exposed by helping those women conduct their professional life on an equal footing with men . On the contrary , that measure was limited to granting female civil servants who were mothers a service credit at the date of their retirement , without providing a remedy for the problems which they might encounter in the course of their professional career . The NORP legislation therefore infringed the principle of equal pay inasmuch as it excluded male civil servants who were able to prove that they had assumed the task of bringing up their children from entitlement to the credit .", "CARDINAL . The judgment adopted by the ECJ on DATE in the case of PERSON v. Sesa Start PERSON deals with the question whether the denial of \u201c breast - feeding leave \u201d ( a TIME reduction in DATE for the purpose of feeding a baby ) to employed fathers , while employed mothers were entitled to such leave , amounted to discrimination on grounds of sex . The ECJ found that the positions of a male and a female worker , father and mother of a young child , were comparable with regard to their possible need to reduce their DATE working time in order to look after their child . The NORP legislation established a difference on grounds of sex , as between mothers whose status was that of an employed person and fathers with the same status .", "DATE . As concerns justification for such a difference in treatment , the ECJ considered , firstly , that the leave at issue had been detached from the biological fact of breastfeeding , entitlement to it being granted even in cases of bottle feeding . It could be therefore considered as time purely devoted to the child and as a measure which reconciled family life and work following maternity leave . Feeding and devoting time to the child could be carried out just as well by the father as by the mother . Therefore that leave seemed to be accorded to workers in their capacity as parents of the child . It could not therefore be regarded as ensuring the protection of the biological condition of the woman following pregnancy or the protection of the special relationship between a mother and her child .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the measure at issue did not constitute a permissible advantage given to women with a view to improving their ability to compete on the labour market and to pursue a career on an equal footing with men . On the contrary , the fact that only a woman whose status was that of an employed person could take that leave , whereas a man with the same status could not , was liable to perpetuate a traditional distribution of the roles of men and women by keeping men in a role subsidiary to that of women in relation to the exercise of their parental duties . To refuse entitlement to the leave at issue to fathers whose status was that of an employed person , on the sole ground that the child \u2019s mother did not have that status , could have as its effect that the mother would have to limit her self - employed activity and bear the burden resulting from the birth of her child alone , without the child \u2019s father being able to ease that burden . Consequently , a measure at issue could not be considered to be a measure eliminating or reducing existing inequalities in society , nor as a measure seeking to achieve substantive as opposed to formal equality by reducing the real inequalities that could arise in society and thus to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in the professional careers of the relevant persons .", "CARDINAL . The ECJ concluded that the relevant provisions of NORP law were incompatible with ORG law .", "CARDINAL . The ORG conducted a comparative study of the legislation of CARDINAL member ORG GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the \u201c Former GPE \u201d , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The comparative study suggests that as far as civilians are concerned , in CARDINAL GPE ( GPE and GPE ) entitlement to parental leave is limited to women . In CARDINAL State ( GPE ) men working in the private sector are not entitled to parental leave , while male civil servants are entitled to such leave . In CARDINAL State ( GPE ) men may take parental leave under certain conditions only ( for example , absence of maternal care of the child ) . In CARDINAL State ( GPE ) no parental leave entitlement is provided by law . In the remaining QUANTITY States both men and women are equally entitled to parental leave in civilian life .", "CARDINAL . In some countries parental leave is a family entitlement to be divided between parents as they choose ( for example in GPE , GPE and GPE ) . In other countries it is an individual entitlement , with each parent entitled to a certain portion of parental leave ( for example in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . In GPE the entitlement is partly family , partly individual , with DATE reserved for each parent and the rest divided between them as they choose . In some countries parental leave is unpaid ( for example GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE ) . In others parental leave is paid either in part or in full ( for example GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . There are also varied approaches to the length of parental leave , ranging from DATE ( GPE ) to DATE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards military personnel , it appears that in CARDINAL State ( GPE ) military personnel are not expressly entitled to parental leave . In GPE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) only servicewomen are entitled to such leave . In GPE ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) all servicewomen are entitled to parental leave , while servicemen are entitled to such leave only in exceptional cases , for example if the mother has died , has abandoned the child , is seriously ill or is unable to take care of the child for any other justified reason . In the remaining QUANTITY both servicemen and servicewomen are equally entitled to parental leave .", "CARDINAL . In some countries ( for example GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) parental leave for military personnel seems to be governed by the same general provisions as those applicable to civilians . In other countries ( for example GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) parental leave is regulated by specific provisions which do not , however , contain any significant differences as compared to the rules applicable to civilians . In CARDINAL countries ( GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE ) the specific provisions governing parental leave for military personnel contain certain differences or restrictions not applicable to civilians . For example , legislation in the GPE provides that parental leave may be postponed where \u201c important interests of the service \u201d so require . In GPE military personnel benefit from the same statutory entitlements as civilians in terms of parental leave . However , ORG may oppose the attribution of parental leave to a DATE or recall a DATE on parental leave to duty on grounds of imperative needs of national defence . Similarly , in GPE , service personnel , who in principle have the same entitlement to parental leave as civilians , may not be able to take parental leave at their convenience if it is considered to affect the combat effectiveness of the armed forces ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["34"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
