Accordingly , the ORG is justified in requesting an order against PERSON to pay a fine and restore the seashore to its original state prior to the construction of the house ... This must be done within DATE of service of this judgment ... . On the expiry of that period , PERSON shall pay a fine of MONEY per day 's delay in the event of failure to comply with the present judgment and the authorities shall be authorised to enforce it at the cost and risk of the offender . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE they appealed against the judgment delivered in case no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG decided to join the CARDINAL sets of proceedings on the ground that they were connected and to dismiss the applicants ' appeals .", "With regard to the application relating to the offence of unlawful interference with the highway , the court noted first of all that PERSON had died during the proceedings and decided that the prosecution was therefore now extinguished . In respect of the ORG property proceedings , ORG gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c ... Firstly , it is not disputed that the parcel of land on which the dyke on which the house was built ... was entirely covered by water , independently of any exceptional meteorological circumstances , prior to the draining works undertaken in order to build the dyke . It has not been established , or even alleged by the applicants moreover , that the undrained portion of this land had ever been removed from the action of the tide . The investigation shows , moreover , that the dyke is the result of land draining carried out prior to the entry into force of LAW of DATE and that , notwithstanding the various authorisations of temporary occupancy granted by the authorities , as this was not done in the manner prescribed for concessions for the construction of a dyke it has not had the effect of bringing this part of the land thus removed from the action of the tide outside the category of maritime public property . In accordance with the principles of inalienability and imprescriptibility of public property , the submissions by PERSON and Ms Brosset - Pospisil to the effect that the house was built legally and its occupancy accepted by the authorities for a very long time and tolerated even after the expiry of the last authorisation to occupy it do not alter the fact that the land falls within the category of maritime public property .", "Secondly , as has been said , the last decision authorising temporary occupancy of the maritime public property ... expired on DATE . In the absence , since that date , of a lawful title of occupancy , the ORG is justified in requesting an order against the occupants to restore the site DATE if they have not already done so \u2013 to its original state prior to construction of the house on maritime public property . In disputing that obligation , the applicants can not properly rely on DATE of occupancy of the LOC or on the fact that the authorities have tolerated the continuation of that occupancy since DATE and proposed draft occupancy agreements to Ms Brosset in order to regularise the situation , which , moreover , she has not taken up . ...", "Fifthly , [ the obligation to restore the site to its original state ] does not constitute a measure prohibited by the requirement of LAW No . CARDINAL that no one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest . \u201d", "Regarding the refusal to grant a concession to build a dyke , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ... Secondly , as section CARDINAL of the above - mentioned LAW DATE provides that draining works carried out prior to enactment of that Act shall continue to be governed by the previous legislation , the provisions codified under LAW of LAW according to which \u201c the ORG may concede , on conditions it shall determine ... the right to build a dyke ... \u201d are applicable .", "The Prefect of GPE based his decision not to grant PERSON the requested concession to build a dyke on the guidelines set out in the circular of DATE issued by the Minister for ORG and the Minister for Regional Development on the use of public property other than commercial or fishing ports . He did not discern any general - interest ground in favour of granting the applicant 's request .", "By instructing the authorities responsible for granting concessions to build a dyke not to allow any plot of land whatsoever falling into the category of public property to be reclassified as private property with a view to transferring full title thereto , the ministers signatory to the circular of DATE did not adopt any legal rules amending or supplementing the above - mentioned provisions of LAW of LAW but confined themselves to applying them . Accordingly , as stated above , the plot of land in question is ORG - owned public property . There is no evidence in the case that the ORG , before reaching his decision , either failed to examine the particular circumstances of PERSON request or made a manifest error of assessment in concluding that there was no special feature or general - interest consideration in the case justifying an exemption from the above - mentioned rules \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of DATE . They submitted that in the absence of proof , which logically they could not have as they had acquired by gift a house already built on a previously constructed embankment , they had shown that the only legal means of building a dwelling house on a parcel of land supposedly falling within the category of public property was to obtain authorisation of temporary occupancy for private use of that land that did not expressly exclude the possibility of such an edifice being built on it . They concluded from this that the construction of a house , of which the authorities were aware and which they had accepted , had resulted in full title to the house passing to the occupants of the land . If this were not the case , it was for the ORG to provide proof that the draining works undertaken at DATE had been illegal . The applicants also submitted that the penalty was disproportionate and that , in the absence of justification on grounds of the general interest , compensation should be paid for the damage wrongly caused .", "CARDINAL . The Government Commissioner pointed out , in the same submissions as those made in a similar case , that the value in DATE 's terms of the purchase price of the house was QUANTITY ( ORG ) . He continued as follows :", "\u201c ... The appellants have not acquired any property right over their houses ; nor have they acquired rights in rem over public property as a result of the successive transfers . Given the precarious situation of the buildings , the market value could not be established without taking account of that essential fact and it is to be hoped that the applicants were duly informed of the position when the purchase deeds were drawn up ... . Lastly , and despite the fact that we are not especially enthusiastic about the outcome of this case , we have no alternative but to dismiss the appellants ' pleadings . ... They probably committed a tactical error in refusing the ORG 's reiterated offer . Even if they were not exactly delighted by the prospect , it was at least preferable to a straightforward demolition order which will have to be judicially enforced at their expense . All hope is perhaps not lost of renewing contact with the authorities with a view to finding what might be a less drastic solution .", "There may be a case for suing the ORG in tort for allowing occupants of public property to nurture for DATE the hope that they would not be ruthlessly compelled to demolish their property . It should be pointed out that the prospects of success of such an action are fairly slim , however , given the legitimate protection enjoyed by public property . In any event , it is clear that if the public authority were to be found liable , the offenders would bear a considerable portion of liability too . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment delivered on DATE the ORG d'Etat dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicants . It held that they could not rely on any right in rem over the land in question or over the buildings that had been erected on it and that the obligation to restore the land to its original state without any prior compensation was therefore not a measure prohibited by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the director of ORG for the Morbihan d\u00e9partement wrote to the applicants in the following terms :", "\u201c I have received some information from ORG . It appears first of all that your house was not specifically listed by ORG when they drew up an inventory for the LOC in DATE . However , ORG is well documented , as can be seen from a photograph available at ORG , in which your house appears very clearly . Furthermore , ORG has told me orally that if an inventory of the Vannes - Ouest district were to be carried out DATE , your house , and others in the same situation , would definitely be listed .", "In any event , ORG could usefully make submissions on your behalf to ORG for the d\u00e9partement , among others , with a view to protecting the region 's cultural heritage if a further threat of demolition were to be made .", "As regards , lastly , the possible classification or registration of your house in the supplementary list of historical monuments , you should not count on this , firstly because the ORG does not consider you as owner and secondly because it is inundated with requests , especially in the GPE . For the time being , given that ORG appears kindly disposed to your problem , I am not particularly worried . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the housing tax on the house came to ORG CARDINAL and the land tax to ORG CARDINAL . The applicants produced a valuation of their house prepared by an estate agent in DATE : \u201c a dwelling house made of stone built in DATE ... Having regard to the geographical situation of the property , the condition of the building , the surface area , its location on maritime public property and the local property market , and subject to the owners ' ability to produce a concession agreement in respect of maritime public property , this property is worth CARDINAL \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The idea that the foreshore is \u201c common property \u201d , that is , can not be appropriated for private use and is managed by the public authorities , dates back to NORP times , when even then a permit was necessary in order to build on the seashore . PERSON 's Ordinance of the NORP of DATE codified the principle and up until recently was still the legal basis for the ORG 's management of maritime public property . In addition to defining what constituted the \u201c seashore and foreshore \u201d , it laid down the applicable rules : \u201c No one shall build on the foreshore , set stakes in the ground or erect any construction that may interfere with navigation , on pain of demolition of the constructions , confiscation of the materials and discretionary fines \u201d . At the time of the ORG , the idea developed that maritime public property was governed by the Government in the interest of the nation , and not merely as part of the heritage that used to belong to the ORG and now belongs to the ORG . The management of maritime public property is still largely guided by this principle DATE . Over and above the idea of ORG ownership of such property , the conservation and management of it are more a matter of implementation of a policy regarding its use than the exercise of the owner 's \u201c civil \u201d rights . The prefect has a major role in the protection of maritime public property . He is the authority who , generally , governs the use of the property at local level , decides whether or not to allow private occupancy and protects the integrity of the property by prosecuting offenders ( source : www.mer.gouv.fr , consulted on DATE ) .", "ORG 's Ordinance of the NORP was definitively repealed in DATE . Since DATE LAW owned by ORG ( Code general de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des personnes publiques \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) has replaced LAW ( dating from DATE ) . It restructures the law governing ORG - owned land and public bodies and combines the rules governing maritime public property into a whole , including provisions relating to the environment in particular .", "CARDINAL . Maritime public property , determined on the basis of natural phenomena , lies between the highest point of the shore , that is , up to the high tide mark under normal meteorological conditions ( ORG , PERSON , DATE ) and the boundary of the territorial waters , seaward .

Land reserved for public - interest maritime , seaside or tourist needs which has been purchased by the ORG .", "' Land artificially removed from the action of the tide shall remain in the category of natural maritime public property unless otherwise stipulated in legally concluded and lawfully executed deeds of concession transferring ownership ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The principle of inalienability of public land , which was established in the case - law and then incorporated into the Code of State Property ( Article L. CARDINAL ) and the ORG ( Article PERSON ) , is inextricably linked to the notion of public land . The basis of this principle is the designation of land for public use . As long as it remains thus designated , and no express decision has been taken reclassifying particular public land as private property , no transfer of land can be authorised . It is a means of preventing public land from being acquired by prescription or adverse possession under private law , hence the principle of imprescriptibility that is very often associated with the principle of inalienability . Accordingly , in its PERSON judgment , on the subject of plots of land situated close to the seashore in LOC the ORG d'Etat found that \u201c whilst the public authorities have authorised various building works on this land and on several occasions waived their right to apply the rules governing public land ... , neither the founders of the soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du domaine des pr\u00e9s sal\u00e9s nor the company itself have been able to acquire any property right over the land , which , being part of public land , was inalienable and imprescriptible \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG has stated that inalienability is limited to precluding the transfer of public property that has not first been reclassified as private property ( ORG , no . PERCENT of DATE , ORG ) . It has not , however , recognised that the principle of inalienability has any constitutional status ( ORG , DATE . no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , Rights in rem over public property ) . The ORG d'Etat has recently reiterated that \u201c where property belonging to a public authority has been incorporated into the category of public land by virtue of a decision classifying it thus , it shall remain public land unless a decision is given expressly reclassifying it as private property \u201d . Accordingly , it has held that the question whether or not short - stay factories fell into the category of public property was not affected by the fact \u201c that these short - stay factories were intended to be rented or assigned to the occupants or that the occupancy leases granted were private - law contracts \u201d ( CE DATE , PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The effect of the principle of inalienability is that any transfer of public land that has not been \u201c reclassified \u201d is null and void , so third - party purchasers have a duty to return the land even if they have purchased it in good faith . Moreover , the fact that public land is inalienable means \u2013 in theory \u2013 that no rights in rem can be established over it . However , the legislature has departed from this principle by passing CARDINAL Acts , CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE which creates long administrative leases , and the other of CARDINAL DATE on the constitution of rights in rem over public land , thus making it possible to grant private rights in rem to occupants of maritime public property . LAW of DATE concerns only public land belonging to local and regional authorities or groups thereof . LAW DATE relates to artificial maritime property and immovable constructions and installations built for the purposes of an authorised activity ( Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code of ORG and Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the ORG ) . In its above - mentioned decision of DATE , ORG held that granting rights in rem in this way was compatible with the LAW as public services were maintained and public property protected under LAW . However , it declared the provision allowing the renewal of authorisation beyond DATE unconstitutional on the ground that it could potentially render ineffective the public authority 's right to the automatic return , free of charge , of any constructions and therefore undermine the \u201c protection due to public property \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The last consequence of the principle of inalienability is that property belonging to public authorities can not be seized ( Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the ORG ) . This consequence has been attenuated by a decision of the PERSON d'Etat in a case which subsequently came before ORG NORP fermi\u00e8re ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Apart from public easements intended to protect public property from the encroachment of private properties , such as a QUANTITY wide right of way along the coast over properties adjoining maritime public property , created by an LAW DATE reforming town and country planning , the land conservation policy guarantees the protection of the physical integrity of maritime public property and compliance with its designated use . Offenders are prosecuted for unlawful interference with the highway on grounds of infringement of the land conservation policy . An interference of this kind is liable to a criminal fine imposed by the administrative courts and the offender is required to restore the site to its original state . The relevant provisions on unlawful interference with maritime public property no longer refer essentially to navigation but take account of the protection of coastal areas for their own sake ( Articles L. DATE and PERSON of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG d'Etat , conservation agencies have a duty to prosecute offenders ( ORG \u201c des amis des chemins de ronde \u201d , DATE ) . Regarding a plot of land incorporated into maritime public property at ORG beach ( southern Corsica ) , the PERSON d'Etat decided that \u201c the fact that ORG produced title deeds to the property in question and had been authorised to build on the land under the regional planning legislation , as distinct from the legislation governing maritime public property , does not mean that the offence of unlawful interference with the highway has not been made out and , in any event , can not preclude prosecution by the Prefect ... \u201d ( CE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . With regard to repairing damage caused to public property , the actual attitude adopted by the authorities prior to bringing proceedings for unlawful interference with the highway has been deemed to give rise to rights in favour of the offender , including the right not to assume personal responsibility for restoring the site to its original state ( CE , GPE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The use of maritime public property may be collective or private . Collective use which allows all citizens to benefit from public property ( navigation on watercourses , beaches ) is freely exercisable , equally available to all and free of charge . However , the principle that use is free of charge has not been expressly incorporated into the ORG because it is subject to numerous exceptions .", "Private occupancy must be compatible or in conformity with the designated use of the public property . Unlike collective use , it is subject to authorisation , issued personally , and a charge and is of a precarious nature .", "Article L. CARDINAL of the Code of State Property ( Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the ORG ) provided that", "\u201c Subject to authorisation being issued by the competent authority , no one may occupy any national public property or make use thereof over and above the right of use vested in everyone .", "ORG shall record any infringement of the provisions of the preceding paragraph with a view to instituting proceedings against illegal occupants , recovering compensation for charges in respect of which ORG has been defrauded , without prejudice to the institution of proceedings for unlawful interference with the highway . \u201d [ Article A CARDINAL specified that authorisation was revocable without compensation ] .", "CARDINAL .

Consequently , the fact \u2013 assuming it is made out DATE that , prior to adoption of the decision being challenged , PERSON had been granted authorisation to occupy the part of common public property ... does not affect the lawfulness of the mayor 's decision requesting him to demolish the buildings he had erected and restore the public land to its original state ... \u201d ( CE , PERSON , DATE ) . It also states very clearly that those to whom authorisation has been granted have not thereby \u201c acquired rights \u201d to renewal of the authorisation ( CE , Helie , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The conditions of occupation of public property are determined either in unilateral concessions granted by the authorities ( of the type referred to above in LAW of LAW ) or in contracts signed with the occupant . The latter are called concessions to occupy public land , which DATE on maritime public property \u2013 may be a beach concession or a concession to build a dyke . By means of this concession , the ORG authorises the concessionaire to carry out works on the foreshore by which land is removed from the action of the tide . In respect of natural maritime public property an arrangement was established in DATE , traditionally called a concession to build a dyke and by which ownership was transferred ( former LAW of LAW ) : the concessionaire was authorised to drain land , which , once removed from the action of the tide , no longer fell within the definition of natural maritime public property and could therefore be reclassified as private property and transferred by the ORG . That arrangement , which was originally used to build agricultural polders , has more recently been used for property developments in the form of marinas , reclaimed from the sea . Following a reaction to what was perceived as a privatisation of the shore , a circular was issued in DATE prohibiting such arrangements \u2013 a prohibition later confirmed by LAW , which imposes a broader prohibition on any interference with the natural state of the shore . It is now no longer possible to build marinas or polders by means of concessions to build dykes by which ownership is transferred . This arrangement can now apply only to past draining works and is the sole means of legalising these ( source : www.mer.gouv.fr ) .", "CARDINAL . Up until DATE maritime public property was protected by the rules governing the highways . LAW introduced new rules for the protection of natural public land ( source : www.mer.gouv.fr ) .", "CARDINAL . As early as DATE enthusiasm for seaside holidays brought about an increase in the number of tourists and thus in the number of buildings on the seashore ... . Awareness of the economic importance of the seashore and of the degree to which it is coveted made it necessary to introduce a rule of overriding legal force that would arbitrate between the many uses of coastal areas . It is in this spirit that LAW of DATE ( consolidated on CARDINAL DATE ) was unanimously passed by ORG . LAW provides that coastal areas are \u201c geographical entities which call for a specific policy of development , protection and enhancement \u201d . The general principles of that LAW consist in preserving rare and fragile areas , managing spatial planning and tourist development economically and , lastly , making the shore \u2013 like the beach DATE more widely accessible to the public and giving priority in coastal areas to marine - related activities .", "CARDINAL . It is in the planning sphere that the principles established are the best known and have given rise to the most litigation . Planning permission for further development must be granted with regard to continuation of existing constructions or new hamlets . It is forbidden to build roads on the shore and through roads can not be built closer than QUANTITY from the shore . In order to preserve natural sites the LAW imposes a \u201c no building \u201d rule within a CARDINAL-metre band DATE outside urban centres \u2013 from the shore , and restricts development in areas near the shore . Lastly , sites of outstanding interest or characteristic of the shore must be preserved and only small - scale development can be allowed .", "CARDINAL . The Act has laid down rules for managing maritime public property which include a mandatory public inquiry prior to any substantive change of use , clarifying the procedures for delimiting the foreshore , prohibiting \u2013 other than in exceptional circumstances \u2013 interference with the natural state of the seashore and establishing specific rules for collective mooring . Lastly , it has established the principles of unobstructed and free public use of the beaches and facilitated public access to the sea ( see LAW and LAW \u201c Pedestrians shall have free access to beaches ... . Beaches are fundamentally reserved for the unobstructed and free use of the public . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW , now Article L.

A report entitled \u201c Assessment of LAW and measures in favour of coastal areas \u201d , prepared by ORG ( DATE ) , contains a part devoted to opening coastal areas to pedestrians which is worded as follows :", "\u201c The purpose of LAW is to maintain or develop tourism in coastal areas . Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the LAW , in particular , lay down the conditions in which the public may visit natural sites , the seashore and the corresponding facilities . The provision of coastal paths goes some way towards giving effect to these legislative provisions . ... The public can continue to walk along the coast by virtue of an easement over private properties and a right of way over public land that may belong to the ORG ( maritime public property ) , ORG or local and regional authorities ... .", "Making a pathway often requires an on - site study of the terrain in order to determine whether the coastal area in question can be opened to pedestrians without harming the fauna , the flora or the stability of the soil . If the land is considered to be accessible without any risk to the environment , regard will have to be had to where the path is routed , particularly across private property , it being observed that the statutory route ( QUANTITY in width running along the boundary of maritime public property ) is not always the most appropriate solution . If the statutory route across private properties has been modified , a public inquiry must be carried out . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG examined the situation in CARDINAL coastal member GPE .

In the other GPE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE ) , maritime public property belongs either to the ORG or to other public bodies and is inalienable on that basis . In all these GPE maritime public property can nevertheless be designated for private use on the basis of fixed - term concessions . And in all these GPE illegal use exposes the offender to administrative or even criminal penalties . In particular , the illegal construction of immovable property can result in the offender being ordered to demolish the building concerned at his or her own expense and without compensation . This type of measure also exists in GPE , where the private right of ownership of land on the seashore is recognised by law but the land is subject to relatively strict easements which prohibit the construction of new buildings and guarantee public access to the sea .", "CARDINAL .

In GPE properties built before the LAW came into force without a permit or concession as required by the previous legislation will be demolished if they can not be legalised on public - interest grounds . Any building that was authorised before the LAW came into force but is now illegal will be demolished on the expiry of the concession if it is located on land falling within the category of maritime public property .
