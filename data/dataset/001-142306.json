The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an operation was planned for the applicant \u2019s arrest following allegations made by GPE and GPE to the police that he was a drug dealer and had tried to sell them narcotic substances .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant stopped for petrol at a petrol station in ORG . At that moment he was approached by several plain - clothes police officers . According to the applicant , they dragged him out of his car and began beating , punching and kicking him , and hitting him with a truncheon . He then fainted .", "CARDINAL . When he regained consciousness , he found himself in the back seat of a moving car with the abovementioned police officers . According to the applicant , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL officers sitting on either side of him in the back seat slipped something into his right side trouser pocket . The applicant tried to stop him , but was punched and hit in the head with the butt of a handgun and fainted again . He was taken to ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he was repeatedly beaten after his arrival at FAC .", "CARDINAL . A search of the applicant and his car was conducted at the police station . According to the search record , the search was carried out at TIME on DATE in the presence of the applicant , police officers and CARDINAL attesting witnesses . It appears from the record that the applicant was not represented by a lawyer . During the search , narcotic ( cannabis - based ) substances were found both on his person and in his car . The applicant claimed that the drugs did not belong to him and had been planted . He refused to sign the search record . According to him , the search had been filmed and the recording would have shown signs of ill - treatment on his body .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE a police investigator drew up a record of the applicant \u2019s arrest ( tutma protokolu ) . It indicated that the applicant was arrested on DATE , not CARDINAL DATE . The applicant refused to sign the record .", "CARDINAL . At an unspecified time on DATE the investigator gave the applicant details of CARDINAL defence lawyers registered with ORG who could represent him . The applicant did not choose any of them , and stated that he would be defending himself . However , he refused to sign a waiver of legal assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE , calculating the period of detention from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by a forensic expert from ORG and ORG . According to the forensic report , the applicant complained of having been ill - treated by the police on DATE . The expert noticed an oval - shaped bruise on his neck . The conclusion of the expert reads as follows :", "\" The oval - shaped bruise on ORG \u2019s neck , caused by a hard blunt object , its time of infliction corresponds to CARDINAL DATE , the time initially indicated . The degree of the injury was not determined because it was not an injury causing harm to health . The injury found would not have caused Layijov to lose consciousness . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date during his interrogation , the applicant informed the investigator that there was a knife in his car . In this connection , he submitted that the police had not carried out a \u201c real \u201d search of his car on DATE , and had only found narcotic substances they had planted there themselves , otherwise they would have found the knife . Following the applicant \u2019s questioning , on DATE a new search of the car was conducted and a knife was recovered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator at FAC delivered a decision on assessment of the evidence . It appears from the decision that the applicant was also examined by a forensic narcotics expert who established that he had not been using narcotic substances and was not a drug user . By the same decision , the investigator also refused to launch a criminal inquiry in respect of the applicant \u2019s allegation of ill - treatment . The relevant part of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c ORG alleged in his testimony that he had been beaten up by police officers and had even fainted . It appears from the case file that ORG tried to escape when he was being taken to the district police station and that police officers dragged him upstairs . In that case , there should have been contusions and bruises on his body . It was established in the forensic report that there was an oval - shaped bruise on ORG neck , but no injuries were found on other parts of his body . The degree of the injury was not determined because it was not an injury causing harm to health and it was established that the injury [ found ] would not have caused [ him ] to lose consciousness . Nevertheless , the procedural legislation allows causing harm to a person who has committed a crime , if he tries to escape during arrest . As the extent of ORG injuries was much less serious than the crime he had committed , a criminal inquiry in respect of the fact that he sustained injuries should be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the indictment issued on DATE , the applicant was charged with offences under ORG CARDINAL ( illegal possession of narcotic substances in an amount exceeding that necessary for personal use , without intention to sell ) , CARDINAL ( illegal sale or illegal possession of narcotic substances with intention to sell ) , and CARDINAL ( illegal possession of a cold steel weapon ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of all the offences as charged and sentenced him to six years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant complained in the course of the proceedings that he had been illtreated by the police during his arrest and in police custody . He also complained that the criminal case against him had been fabricated by the police because of a pre - existing dispute he had with some officers from FAC . In this connection , he claimed that the drugs had been planted by the police officers and that despite his request , the search of his person and car had not been carried out immediately after his arrest . However , his complaints were not addressed in the judgment . The part of the judgment concerning the applicant \u2019s conviction reads as follows :", "\u201c The criminal offence committed by the accused ORG was not only proved by witness testimonies , but also other materials in the case file ...", "In total QUANTITY of cannabis - based narcotic substances , QUANTITY of opium , CARDINAL hunting knife and CARDINAL \u201c ORG \u201d mobile phone taken within the framework of the case had been recognised as real evidence ...", "Therefore , the fact that the accused ORG committed the criminal offences provided for by Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW was again proved in the court investigation by witness testimonies , expert opinions , records of face - to - face questioning and other official information in the case file .", "The preliminary investigating authority had rightly qualified the criminal offences of the accused ORG under ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . He should be found guilty under these ORG and be punished . \u201d", "According to the judgment , the period of imprisonment was to be calculated from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment of DATE . In the course of the proceedings , the applicant reiterated his complaints , but ORG did not consider them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment and remitted the case for fresh examination . ORG found that there had been flaws in the assessment of the admissibility and probative value of evidence serving as a basis for the applicant \u2019s convictions , and that the lower courts had failed to properly determine the date of the applicant \u2019s arrest and to examine the issue of the applicant \u2019s alleged illtreatment in police custody and the compliance with procedural requirements of the search of the applicant and his car . ORG also noted that the lower courts had not examined why a search of the applicant and his car had not been carried out immediately at the place of his arrest . The relevant part of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c According to forensic report no . CARDINAL of DATE , the injuries on ORG body are characteristic of a beating .", "The documents and statements signed by police officers were drafted by PERSON at the same time , using the same pen . The content of the attesting witnesses\u2019 statements , as well as those of GPE and GPE , was dictated by a professional police officer and they say the same thing .", "During the investigation and in the proceedings before the courts , these facts were not examined and no action was taken in this respect .", "Under LAW , evidence and facts , if there are doubts as to their source or the circumstances in which they were obtained , can not be used in order to determine the charge correctly . All the documents and statements on which the court relied as evidence in the present case are contradictory , and do not disprove ORG allegations .", "It follows that , when the case is re - examined at appellate court level , it should be considered whether GPE and GPE cooperated with the police and participated in the procedural measures in other cases and were for this reason interested in the outcome of the case , the reason why the first operation aimed at arresting PERSON on DATE was not carried out , the reason why a search of ORG and his car was not immediately conducted when he was arrested at the petrol station in ORG as required by the operational search and criminal procedural legislation , the cause and perpetrators of ORG injuries , as well as the reason why the knife , which was considered to be a cold steel weapon , was not found in the car during the first search on DATE , but was found DATE . As it appears from ORG statements , his allegation , that the narcotic substances were not taken from his car otherwise the knife would also have been found during the search , must be assessed from a logical point of view . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE in the part relating to the charges under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and terminated the corresponding part of the criminal proceedings . The court held that the evidence concerning the charge under LAW had been obtained in breach of the relevant procedural requirements and failed to prove the applicant \u2019s guilt . In particular , GPE and GPE \u2019s statements were inconsistent and had been drafted by the investigator . The court also noted that the testimony of GPE and GPE at the hearings before ORG had differed from their statements . The court further noted that the evidence in connection with the charge under LAW , namely the knife found in the applicant \u2019s car , did not qualify as a weapon for the purposes of that provision . The court also found that the applicant had actually been arrested on DATE and for a day had been unlawfully detained in police custody . As to his allegation of ill - treatment , the court noted that he had been ill - treated by the police during his arrest and in police custody , as certified by the forensic report of CARDINAL DATE . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c It was established following the investigation carried out by the panel of the court that during ORG arrest the requirements of criminal procedural law were violated by the investigating authorities ; his arrest was not immediately documented , he was not provided with a lawyer , he was not informed of his rights and obligations and he was unlawfully detained at FAC for a day ...", "Taking into consideration the fact that the video - recording of the investigative steps taken during the preliminary investigation was not added to the case file as evidence , and the fact that ORG allegation of being beaten by police officers was not rebutted by any plausible evidence by the party defending the charge , the court considers that the injuries on ORG body were inflicted by the police during the preliminary investigation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction under LAW . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c ... The panel of the court considers that the accused ORG had committed the crime under LAW and that he had been correctly found guilty and convicted by the first - instance court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG was silent as to the applicant \u2019s particular complaints concerning the drugs being planted on him by the police , the conditions in which the search had been carried out , and the lawfulness of the use of the evidence obtained in those circumstances against him .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal reduced the applicant \u2019s sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and decided to calculate the beginning of the corresponding sentence from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released after having served his sentence .", "CARDINAL .
