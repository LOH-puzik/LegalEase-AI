The applicants alleged that in DATE ORG operated an LAW ( \u201c ETF \u201d ) at GPE , PERSON , which was built to intercept CARDINAL simultaneous telephone channels coming from GPE to GPE and on to the continent . DATE the applicants claimed that the ORG intercepted all public telecommunications , including telephone , facsimile and e - mail communications , carried on microwave radio between the CARDINAL ORG radio stations ( at FAC and GPE ) , a link which also carried much of GPE \u2019s telecommunications traffic . During this period the applicant organisations were in regular telephone contact with each other and also providing , inter alia , legal advice to those who sought their assistance . They alleged that many of their communications would have passed between the ORG radio stations referred to above and would thus have been intercepted by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having seen a television report on the alleged activities of the ETF , the applicant organisations requested ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d : see CARDINAL below ) to investigate the lawfulness of any warrants which had been issued in respect of the applicants\u2019 communications between GPE and GPE and GPE . On DATE an official of the ORG confirmed that an investigation would proceed and added :", "\u201c ... I am directed to advise you that the ORG has no way of knowing in advance of an investigation whether a warrant exists in any given case . The ORG investigates all complaints in accordance with section CARDINAL of the [ Interception of Communications Act DATE : \u2018 the DATE Act\u2019 , see paragraphs CARDINAL below ] establishing whether a relevant warrant or relevant certificate exists or had existed and , if so , whether there has been any contravention of sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL . If ... the ORG concludes that there has been a contravention of sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL , the ORG may take steps under sections DATE ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) . In any case where there is found to have been no contravention , the ORG is not empowered to disclose whether or not authorised interception has taken place . In such instances , complainants are advised only that there has been no contravention of sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL in relation to a relevant warrant or a relevant certificate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the ORG confirmed that it had thoroughly investigated the matter and was satisfied that there had been no contravention of sections CARDINAL of the DATE Act in relation to the relevant warrant or certificate .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the applicants complained to the ORG of an unlawful interception , requesting the prosecution of those responsible . The ORG passed the matter to ORG for investigation . By a letter dated DATE the police explained that no investigation could be completed until the ORG had investigated and that a police investigation might then follow if it could be shown that an unwarranted interception had taken place or if any of the other conditions set out in section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act had not been met . The applicants pointed out , in their letter of CARDINAL DATE , that the vague , albeit statutory , response of the ORG would mean that they would not know whether a warrant had been issued or , if it had , whether it had been complied with . They would not , therefore , be in a position to make submissions to the police after the ORG investigation as to whether or not a criminal investigation was warranted . The applicants asked if , and if so how , the police could establish for themselves whether or not a warrant had been issued , so as to decide whether an investigation was required , and how the police would investigate , assuming there had been no warrant .", "CARDINAL . The ORG responded on DATE that the police had to await the ORG decision , and the police responded on DATE that the applicants\u2019 concerns were receiving the fullest attention , but that they were unable to enter into discussion on matters of internal procedure and inter - departmental investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants wrote to the police pointing out that , having received the decision of the ORG , they still did not know whether or not there had been a warrant or whether there had been unlawful interception . The response , dated DATE , assured the applicants that police officers were making enquires with the relevant agencies with a view to establishing whether there had been a breach of section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and identifying the appropriate investigative authority . The police informed the applicants by a letter dated DATE that their enquiries continued , and , by a letter dated DATE , that these enquiries had not revealed an offence contrary to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the former statutory regime for the interception of communications was replaced by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) and a new tribunal , the ORG , was created .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants began proceedings in the ORG against the security and intelligence agencies of GPE , complaining of interferences with their rights to privacy for their telephone and other communications from DATE ( NORP - Irish Rights Watch and others v. ORG and others , IPT/CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CH ) . The ORG , sitting as its President and Vice - President ( a ORG and a ORG judge ) , had security clearance and was able to proceed in the light not just of open evidence filed by the defendant services but also confidential evidence , which could not be made public for reasons of national security .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made a number of preliminary rulings on points of law . Although the applicants had initially formulated a number of claims , by the time of the ruling these had been narrowed down to a single complaint about the lawfulness of the \u201c filtering process \u201d , whereby communications between GPE and an external source , captured under a warrant pursuant to LAW ) of LAW ( which had replaced section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act : see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , were sorted and accessed pursuant to secret selection criteria . The question was , therefore , whether \u201c the process of filtering intercepted telephone calls made from the GPE to overseas telephones ... breaches LAW [ of LAW ] because it is not \u2018 in accordance with the law\u2019 \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that the difference between the warrant schemes for interception of internal and external communications was justifiable , because it was more necessary for additional care to be taken with regard to interference with privacy by a Government in relation to domestic telecommunications , given the substantial potential control it exercised in this field ; and also because its knowledge of , and control over , external communications was likely to be much less extensive .", "CARDINAL . As to whether the law was sufficiently accessible and foreseeable for the purposes of LAW , the ORG observed :", "\u201c The selection criteria in relation to accessing a large quantity of as yet unexamined material obtained pursuant to a sCARDINAL(CARDINAL ) warrant ( as indeed in relation to material obtained in relation to a sCARDINAL(CARDINAL ) warrant ) are those set out in sCARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . The Complainants\u2019 Counsel complains that there is no \u2018 publicly stated material indicating that a relevant person is satisfied that the [ accessing ] of a particular individual \u2019s telephone call is proportionate\u2019 . But the ORG submit that there is indeed such publicly stated material , namely the provisions of sCARDINAL(l ) of LAW which requires a public authority to act compatibly with Convention rights , and thus , it is submitted , imposes a duty to act proportionately in applying to the material the sCARDINAL(CARDINAL ) criteria .", "To that duty there is added the existence of CARDINAL safeguards listed by ORG , namely ( CARDINAL ) the criminal prohibition on unlawful interception ( CARDINAL ) the involvement of the Secretary of ORG ( CARDINAL ) the guiding role of ORG ( \u2018 JIC\u2019 ) ( CARDINAL ) LAW ( CARDINAL ) the oversight by LAW ( whose powers are set out in Part IV of the Act ) ( CARDINAL ) the availability of proceedings before this Tribunal and ( CARDINAL ) the oversight by ORG , an all - party body of CARDINAL Parliamentarians created by the Intelligence Services Act DATE ...", "It is plain that , although in fact the existence of all these safeguards is publicly known , it is not part of the requirements for accessibility or foreseeability that the precise details of those safeguards should be published . ORG has pointed out that it appears from the Respondents\u2019 evidence that there are in existence additional operating procedures , as would be expected given the requirements that there be the extra safeguards required by sCARDINAL of the LAW , and the obligation of the Secretary of ORG to ensure their existence under sCARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) . It is not suggested by the Complainants that the nature of those operating procedures be disclosed , but that their existence , i.e. something along the lines of what is in the Respondents\u2019 evidence , should itself be disclosed in LAW .", "We are unpersuaded by this . First , such a statement in DATE , namely as to the existence of such procedures , would in fact take the matter no further than it already stands by virtue of the words of the statute . But in any event , the existence of such procedures is CARDINAL of the substantial number of safeguards which are known to exist . Accessibility and foreseeability are satisfied by the knowledge of the criteria and the knowledge of the existence of those multiple safeguards .", "... [ F]oreseeability is only expected to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances , and the circumstances here are those of national security ... In this case the legislation is adequate and the guidelines are clear . PERSON does not require that a person who telephones abroad knows that his conversation is going to be intercepted because of the existence of a valid s. CARDINAL ) warrant . ...", "The provisions , in this case the right to intercept and access material covered by a s.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) warrant , and the criteria by reference to which it is exercised , are in our judgment sufficiently accessible and foreseeable to be in accordance with law . The parameters in which the discretion to conduct interception is carried on , by reference to s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and subject to the safeguards referred to , are plain from the face of the statute . In this difficult and perilous area of national security , taking into account both the necessary narrow approach to Article PERSON ) and the fact that the burden is placed upon the Respondent , we are satisfied that the balance is properly struck . \u201d", "CARDINAL . During the period at issue in this application the relevant legislation was sections CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which came into force on DATE and was repealed by ORG ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL .

When he issued a section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) warrant , the Secretary of ORG was required to issue also a certificate containing a description of the intercepted material the examination of which he considered necessary in the interests of national security , to prevent or detect serious crime or to safeguard the ORG \u2019s economic well - being ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) ) .

Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) warrants could be issued only under the hand of the Secretary of ORG or a permitted official of high rank with the written authorisation of the Secretary of ORG . If issued under the hand of the Secretary of ORG , the warrant was valid for DATE ; if by another official , it was valid for DATE . Only the Secretary of ORG could renew a warrant . If the Secretary of ORG considered that a warrant was no longer necessary in the interests of national security , to prevent or detect serious crime or to safeguard the ORG \u2019s economic well - being , he was under a duty to cancel it ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE report of the Commissioner for DATE explained the difference between warrants issued under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c There are a number of differences ... But the essential differences may be summarised as follows :", "( i ) Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) warrants apply only to external telecommunications ;", "( ii ) NORP whereas section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) warrants only apply to communications to or from one particular person ... or one particular set of LOC , ORG ) warrants are not so confined ; but", "( iii ) at the time of issuing a Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) warrant the Secretary of ORG is obliged to issue a certificate describing the material which it is desired to intercept ; and which he regards as necessary to examine for any of the purposes set out in LAW ) .", "So the authority to intercept granted by the Secretary of ORG under LAW ) is limited not so much by reference to the target , as it is under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , but by reference to the material . It follows that in relation to LAW ) warrants , I have had to consider first , whether the warrant applies to external communications only , and , secondly , whether the certified material satisfies the Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) criteria . ...", "There is a further important limitation on LAW ) warrants . I have said that the authority granted by the Secretary of ORG is limited by reference to the material specified in the certificate , rather than the targets named in the warrants . This distinction is further underlined by LAW ) which provides that material specified shall not include the address in GPE for the purpose of including communications sent to or from that address , except in the case of counter - terrorism . So if , for example in a case of subversion ORG wishes to intercept external communications to or from a resident of GPE , he could not do so under a Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) warrant by asking for communications sent to or from his address to be included in the certified material . But it would be possible for ORG to get indirectly , through a legitimate examination of certified material , what it may not get directly . In such cases it has become the practice to apply for a separate warrant under LAW ) known as an overlapping warrant , in addition to the warrant under LAW ) . There is nothing in the [ CARDINAL LAW ] which requires this to be done . But it is obviously a sound practice , and wholly consistent with the legislative intention underlying Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . Accordingly I would recommend that where it is desired to intercept communications to or from an individual residing in LOC , as a separate target , then in all cases other than counter - terrorism there should be a separate warrant under LAW ) , even though the communications may already be covered by a warrant under LAW ) . The point is not without practical importance . For the definition of \u201c relevant warrant \u201d and \u201c relevant certificate \u201d in LAW ) of the LAW makes it clear that , while the ORG has power to investigate warrants issued under section CARDINAL ) and certificates under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) where an address is specified in the certificate , it has no such power to investigate LAW ) warrants , where an address is not so certified . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

While there is nothing to prevent consultation of the Commissioner before a warrant is issued , it is not the practice to consult him in advance and such consultation on a routine basis would not be practicable . So the Commissioner \u2019s view is largely retrospective , to check that warrants have not been issued in contravention of the LAW and that appropriate procedures were followed . To that end , I have visited all the warrant issuing departments and agencies named in this report , in most cases more than once , and discussed at some length the background to the warrant applications . I have also discussed the procedure for seeking warrants with officials at various levels in all the initiating bodies and presenting departments . I have inspected a significant number of warrants , some chosen by me at random , some put before me because it was felt that I should see them . Although I have described ... a number of instances in which mistakes were made or mishaps occurred , I have seen no case in which the statutory restrictions were deliberately evaded or corners knowingly cut . A salutary practice has grown up by which the Commissioner \u2019s attention is specifically drawn to any case in which an error or contravention of the LAW has occurred : I accordingly believe that there has been no such case during DATE of which I am unaware . \u201d", "Similar conclusions about the authorities\u2019 compliance with the law were drawn by all the Commissioners in their reports during DATE .", "CARDINAL .

It also seemed to me that it would be advantageous , where this was not already done , to remind all involved m handling intercept material on a regular basis of the safeguards to which they were subject , securing written acknowledgements that the safeguards had been read and understood .

For example , the practical considerations involved in deciding what is necessary in the interests of national security , or the economic well - being of GPE ( the areas with which ORG and ORG are almost exclusively concerned ) are somewhat different from those involved in the prevention and detection of serious criminal offences ( with which the police forces and ORG are almost exclusively concerned ) .
