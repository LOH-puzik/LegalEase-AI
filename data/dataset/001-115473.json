NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE on suspicion of rape of the complainant at her home in DATE . A police officer ( an officer of PERSON ) cautioned him to the effect that he was not obliged to speak but anything he might say might be given in evidence . He was taken to a police station where he was informed by the police that they had information that he had been involved in other sexual offences against the same complainant . The applicant denied any involvement in the alleged offences .", "CARDINAL . A police officer asked the applicant whether he would provide a sample of his blood and the applicant agreed . The sample was taken in the police station by a medical doctor with the consent of the applicant . The applicant was released from custody . He was then charged with CARDINAL sexual offences contrary to , inter alia , LAW DATE against the complainant . Those offences took place over a period of DATE ) while the complainant was DATE . The applicant did not dispute during his trial ( see below ) that he had provided the sample voluntarily but he argued that he had not been cautioned about the use that could be made of the sample . The trial judge found that he had been given the appropriate caution ( that he was not obliged to give any sample but that any tests carried out on the blood sample might be admitted in evidence against him ) and that he had fully understood it . It was not disputed that the sample had been taken under the common law and not pursuant to ORG Forensic Evidence ) Act , DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE he was re - arrested and returned for trial before ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . His trial began on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge tried , as a preliminary issue in the absence of the jury , the admissibility of the DNA evidence drawn from the blood sample . The applicant had argued that he had not been properly cautioned and that the sample had been unlawfully taken because the common law power , on which the police relied , had been ousted by LAW . The trial judge heard oral evidence from relevant police officers , the applicant and the relevant doctor : the trial judge found that the applicant had been cautioned by the police ( that he was not required to provide a sample but that , if he did so , the sample could be analysed and the results admitted against him at trial ) and that he had understood the caution . The trial judge noted that , having given a sample , the applicant had then signed a statement , after he had consulted his solicitor , in which he accepted that he had volunteered the sample after such a caution . The trial judge concluded that he had been properly cautioned prior to giving the sample . He also found that the common law power to obtain a blood sample remained and co - existed alongside that of LAW so that the common law was a valid legal basis for the taking of the voluntary blood sample . The trial judge , in his ruling admitting the evidence , did so principally on the basis of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act : it stated that the powers conferred on the police under LAW were without prejudice to other powers exercised by them which meant that the power of the police to invite persons to voluntarily provide a blood sample applied in this case and was unaffected by the provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The complainant did not identify the applicant in her evidence but stated that the offences had been committed by the same man since , inter alia , the perpetrator referred to earlier incidents when later assaulting her . The DNA evidence was key : the prosecution \u2019s case was that the DNA evidence linked the applicant to CARDINAL of the offences ( DATE and DATE ) and , if the jury were to find that the DNA evidence established his guilt for those CARDINAL offences , it was also entitled to conclude that the same person committed all or any one of the other offences . The trial ended on DATE when the applicant was convicted by jury on CARDINAL counts of rape , attempted rape , indecent assault or sexual assault from DATE . In DATE he was sentenced to concurrent terms of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the ORG mainly contesting the lawfulness of the blood sample arguing that the only lawful basis for it being obtained , retained and used was LAW . Of the CARDINAL grounds of appeal , the first and last referred to the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights : that the trial judge had erred in finding that the sample had been lawfully taken under the common law and thus failed to vindicate his constitutional right to bodily integrity ; and that the police had failed to inform the applicant that his sample would be used to investigate offences other than that relating to DATE contrary to his rights to bodily integrity , to privacy , not to incriminate himself and to fair procedures .", "CARDINAL . His appeal to the ORG was heard on CARDINAL and DATE . Further submissions were requested and filed in DATE . On DATE he was released from prison .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE the ORG rejected his appeal . It reviewed in some detail and confirmed the trial court \u2019s factual findings as regards , inter alia , the caution given to the applicant prior to giving the sample . It also underlined the legality under the common law of collecting forensic evidence on a voluntary basis from person in custody :", "\u201c While the conduct of criminal investigations by the [ police ] must be carried out within the ambit of the law and in accordance with the law , many of the procedures which they adopt may not require the exercise of powers expressly conferred by statute . The interviewing and taking of statements from witnesses to a crime , the entry upon the scene of a crime , its examination and taking away of forensic evidence are just some examples of investigation methods which are carried out on the basis of the consent and cooperation of the citizens concerned . ... An example would be where a householder permits a [ police officer ] to enter or enter and search premises without the need for a search warrant .", "Cooperating citizens may willingly provide the [ police ] with forensic evidence such as fingerprints , clothing or blood samples to assist them in their inquiries . A rape victim may willingly provide a sample of pubic hair so that the [ police ] may determine whether it matches a pubic hair discovered in the course of their investigations in circumstances which , if matched , may implicate a suspect . Of course the gathering of such evidence and its use at a criminal trial from persons , who at the trial have the status of witnesses rather than that of an accused , is rarely a source of controversy . ... Inevitably , ... the obtaining of forensic evidence from persons in custody may often be a source of legal controversy at a trial and subject to particular scrutiny as to its lawfulness and its voluntary nature . ... It has long been the case that the prosecution are entitled to introduce such forensic evidence obtained from a person in custody at a trial provided that it was obtained voluntarily and with the full consent of the person in custody . Provided consent is fully and voluntarily given and the person in custody is of full age and not otherwise suffering from any legal or other incapacity , they may give a forensic sample , including in response to a [ police ] PERSON request , and the [ police ] may take it or receive it . That is an essential part of the evidence gathering aspect of a criminal investigation provided it is done within the ambit of the law but it has not always been and is not necessarily dependent , as such , on the existence of express statutory powers to collect such voluntarily provided forensic evidence . In short , it is not unlawful to take voluntarily provided forensic samples from persons in custody . ...", "It would indeed be extraordinary if [ parliament ] contemplated that any forensic sample freely and voluntarily provided by a person in custody and then forensically examined by the [ police ] which was lawful before the passing of the LAW should be considered unlawful after the passing of the LAW without any express provision to that effect , even though it was provided without any element of coercion and when the consequences of the refusal were nil from the point of view of an accused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG went on to find that LAW created a statutory regime distinct from the common law and , further , that that regime did not have the effect of abolishing the existing common law power . Both legal bases , statutory and common law , subsisted . LAW extended existing law ; it did not abrogate it . The DNA evidence , drawn from the sample taken under the common law , was admissible . Finally , the ORG did not consider tenable the factual presumption underlying the CARDINALst ground of appeal because the applicant had never disputed that he had given the sample voluntarily and it was the uncontested evidence of the prosecution that the police had informed him that they were investigating , not only a sexual offence committed against the complainant in DATE , but also his involment in other sexual offences against her .", "CARDINAL . By perfected order ( not submitted ) of the ORG of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG gave leave to appeal pursuant to LAW DATE on a point of law of general public importance desirable in the public interest to be examined by ORG . ORG judgments recorded the text of the question certified by the ORG as follows :", "\u201c Is it lawful for a member of ORG , when taking a sample of blood from a person in custody who voluntarily agrees to provide that sample for the purpose of forensic analysis , to do so without having invoked the provisions of LAW ( LAW , DATE ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . By Notice of Motion dated DATE ( grounded upon an affidavit of the same date and a Notice of Appeal dated DATE ) , the applicant requested , pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG ( LAW DATE , leave to add CARDINAL grounds of appeal for ORG consideration . The first CARDINAL and last grounds read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . That ORG erred in law or erred on a question of mixed fact and law in holding that LAW of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] did not preclude [ the police ] from taking a voluntary forensic sample from a person in custody without invoking the provisions of the said LAW and that the said section of LAW was designed to enable [ the police ] to obtain such forensic samples which might otherwise be refused and to provide for admissibility of such evidence arising from the refusal , and that the neglect , failure or refusal by the [ police ] to take the said sample under the aegis of the said LAW was ultra vires , contrary to LAW Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . That the learned trial judge erred in law and on the facts in ruling that the blood sample from the Accused for the purpose of DNA testing was admissible in evidence , that it was lawfully taken and/or did not require to be taken pursuant to ORG Forensic Evidence ) Act DATE , and thereby failed to vindicate the Accused \u2019s Constitutional Rights to his bodily integrity . ...", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected ( by a majority ) the appeal . All judges agreed that it had been long accepted that the police could , under the common law , obtain information and samples from a person so long as that person \u2019s consent was given voluntarily . Indeed , even the judge who dissented on the question of the effect of the DATE Act noted that the applicant had accepted that there had been a power to take samples by consent under the common law , he referred to the ORG judgment on the issue cited at paragraph CARDINAL above and he added :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Neither the inviolability of the dwelling nor the right to bodily integrity of the human individual , though these are personal rights which enjoy constitutional protection , prevents individuals from agreeing to provide access to the CARDINAL and samples from the other . Most citizens will perceive it as their duty to assist in the investigation of crime . Many will wish to eliminate themselves from suspicion ; many others will wish to assist in finding the perpetrator of a crime . Where evidence is thus freely and voluntarily provided by a person at liberty , no principle of the criminal law prevents material thus gained in the course of police investigation from becoming the subject - matter of evidence at a criminal trial against the provider . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the DATE Act did not deprive the police of their ability to take samples under the common law since both the statutory and common law schemes for taking samples co - existed . It was satisfied that the matter in issue was not the application of a policy of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , ( whereby he had advised that , after the coming into force of the LAW , the police could still take samples that were provided voluntarily and on consent ) or whether that policy was appropriate or not . Rather , the matter in issue was a question of law . The advice of the ORG was an interpretation of LAW . The issue was whether that interpretation was correct . ORG conducted a detailed construction of the DATE Act in order to ascertain the intention of the legislature . It noted that the common law approach to obtaining information by consent was well established . It was a fundamental aspect of the approach to investigating crime . It was a practical approach . Any alteration to such a fundamental aspect of criminal investigation would require a clear expression of an intention to change . No such approach was apparent from the words of the LAW .", "It further noted that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW expressly stated that the powers conferred by that section were without prejudice to any other powers exercisable by a member of ORG : it thereby expressly retained powers of ORG . ORG went on to note the detrimental consequences to a \u2018 person\u2019 under LAW and it gave , as an example , the \u2018 inference\u2019 which might be raised at the trial , and upon which a jury might rely for corroboration . There was also the possibility of the offence of obstruction under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . No such detrimental consequences arose under the common law . Therefore it considered that to apply the statutory scheme in the absence of a clear mandatory requirement under statute would be a step too far . ORG was satisfied that the ORG did not intend to exclude the common law when it passed LAW and that the common law might also be applied to a person detained or in prison as referred to in LAW .", "Finally , ORG noted CARDINAL other grounds of appeal ( Nos . CARDINAL and DATE ) which the applicant \u2019s counsel had highlighted in his oral submissions and which it rejected .", "CARDINAL . One judge dissented on the effect of LAW and considered that , when a person was in custody , it would be absurd , \u201c inconsistent and potentially unfair \u201d to ignore the statutory regime which he considered the Government to have intended would apply in such circumstances . He regarded the first CARDINAL grounds of the applicant \u2019s appeal as concerning the question of the \u201c admissibility of the evidence \u201d . He found that the failure to apply the CARDINAL LAW was not an interference with the constitutional rights of the applicant since he had freely agreed to provide a sample of his blood . He also considered that this failure to follow the statutory regime did not impact on the admissibility of the DNA evidence : while the blood sample had been obtained unlawfully , it had led to the production of objective material evidence linking the applicant to the offences so that \u201c no breach of a constitutional right was involved \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The LAW", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL concerns the constitution and powers of ORG ( the ORG ) and , in so far as relevant , provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the ORG is hereby vested in the ORG : no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The police may obtain samples on a voluntary basis from persons in custody under the common law . There are no specific rules laid which regulate the taking , use , retention or destruction of such samples . No inferences may be drawn from a refusal to provide a sample .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act also permits the taking of samples from persons in custody . It provides for authorisation to request samples on a consent basis , it allows the drawing of inferences in case of a refusal and it governs the use of samples pre - trial and post - trial including destruction .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a circular of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) advised that , after the coming into force of LAW , the police could still take samples that were provided voluntarily and on consent .
