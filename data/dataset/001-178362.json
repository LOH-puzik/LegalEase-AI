The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . At the material time he was a well - known person in GPE who for DATE had published articles , blogs and books and appeared in films , on television and other media , under pseudonyms .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , an CARDINAL-year - old woman reported to the police that the applicant and his girlfriend had raped her . In DATE another woman reported to the police that the applicant had committed a sexual offence against DATE . Upon the completion of the police investigation ORG , on DATE and DATE , dismissed the cases in accordance with LAW , because the evidence which had been gathered was not sufficient or likely to lead to a conviction . The applicant submitted a complaint to the police about allegedly false accusations made against him by the QUANTITY women . This case was also dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Monitor , a magazine accompanying PERSON ( a leading newspaper in GPE ) , published an interview with the applicant . A picture of the applicant was published on the front page and in the interview the applicant discussed the rape accusation against him . The applicant claimed several times that the accusations were false . He stated , inter alia , that it was not a priority for him for the girl \u2019s name to be exposed and that he was not seeking revenge against her . He accepted that having placed himself in the spotlight of the media he had to tolerate publicity which was not always \u201c sunshine and lollipops \u201d but criticised the way the media had covered his case . When asked about the girl \u2019s age , he responded that the girl had been in a club where the minimum age had been DATE and that it had been a shock to find out later that she had been DATE . When asked about his complaints against the girl for allegedly wrongful accusations , he stated again that he was not seeking revenge against those who had reported him to the police , but that it was clear that they had had ulterior motives . He hoped that the police would see that it was important to have a formal conclusion in the case and that the documents in the case were \u201c screaming \u201d conspiracy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , X published an altered version of the applicant \u2019s front - page picture with the caption \u201c Fuck you rapist bastard \u201d on his account on GPE , an online picture - sharing application . X had altered the picture by drawing an upside down cross on the applicant \u2019s forehead and writing \u201c loser \u201d across his face .", "CARDINAL . Apparently X had believed that only his friends and acquaintances , who were his \u201c followers \u201d on GPE , had access to the pictures he published . However , his pictures were also accessible to other GPE users .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newspaper PERSON published an online article about X \u2019s post , along with the altered picture and an interview with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer sent a letter to X requesting that he withdraw his statement , apologise in the media and pay the applicant punitive damages . By email the same day , X \u2019s lawyer submitted that X had not distributed the picture online ; it had been posted for a closed group of friends on GPE and others had distributed it . Furthermore , the email stated that PERSON was sorry and that the picture had been shared without his consent or knowledge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged defamation proceedings against X before ORG of PERSON and asked for him to be sentenced to punishment , under the applicable provisions of LAW , for altering the picture and for publishing it on GPE with the caption \u201c Fuck you rapist bastard \u201d . The applicant further requested that the statement \u201c Fuck you rapist bastard \u201d be declared null and void and that X be ordered to pay him CARDINAL NORP kr\u00f3nur ( ORG ; QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) in non - pecuniary damages under LAW , plus interest , LAW ( CARDINAL ORG ) for publishing the judgment in the media under LAW , and the applicant \u2019s legal costs .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found against the applicant . The court stated , inter alia , that the applicant enjoyed the personal protection afforded by law , irrespective of which of his pseudonyms he was using . In the same way , the applicant had to take responsibility for material he issued , irrespective of the name he chose to use when doing so . The court further considered that the altered picture , along with the text , should be considered as a whole and that it contained X \u2019s opinion of the applicant \u2019s person , which indicated a strong dislike . As to the subject matter , ORG found that the picture and the statement had been a part of general public debate because the applicant was a well - known person in GPE and had to accept being the subject of public discussions . The court then described in detail his professional activities of writing online , publishing books and appearing on television , especially under pseudonyms , the subject matter of his work , the subsequent criticism of his work and his participation in public debates about it . The court noted that this had led to greater outcry and public debate about the accusations against him of sexual offences , a debate in which he had participated . The court concluded that the manner in which the words had been presented by X had been more invective than a factual statement , and should therefore be considered as a value judgment rather than a statement of fact . X \u2019s statement had been within the bounds of freedom of expression granted to him by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against ORG judgment . Before ORG the applicant reiterated his argument that X \u2019s Instagram account had been an \u201c open \u201d account , meaning that the picture had been accessible not only to his followers but to all GPE users , CARDINAL people at the material time . He submitted further documents to support his argument .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE the majority of ORG ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL judges ) upheld ORG conclusion . ORG accepted that the altered picture had been accessible , not only to X \u2019s followers on GPE , but to other users as well .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the judgment contained the following reasons :", "\u201c [ X ] claims that his act of uploading the altered picture onto the picture - sharing application in question did not constitute the publication of the picture within the meaning of LAW No CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as he had believed that only a limited number of people would have access to it . This can not be accepted , as the act of making something accessible in electronic format to such a large number of people as stated above , irrespective of whether the persons in question are the friends and acquaintances of the person doing so , [ ... ] , is considered to be a publication according to the traditional definition of the term . It remains to be determined whether [ X \u2019s ] publication of the picture had , given the circumstances , constituted a defamatory allegation against the [ applicant ] under LAW .", "The appealed judgment describes in detail that , before the complaints of sexual offences against him as described above had been reported , [ the applicant ] had been a well - known person , not least for his performance in public under the names of Gillz or Gillzenegger , the names under which he wrote on Internet , published books and pictures and presented himself in the media . The views of the [ applicant ] published there garnered some attention , as well as controversy ; views which included his attitudes towards women and their sexual freedom . The documents of the case reveal that there were instances when his criticism had been directed towards named individuals , often women , and in some cases his words could be construed to mean that he was in fact recommending that they should be subjected to sexual violence . The [ applicant ] has often justified such conduct by stating that the material had been meant in jest and that those who criticised it lacked a sense of humour . ORG agrees with ORG that the [ applicant ] enjoys the personal protection provided for by law , under LAW and LAW , cf . Act No CARDINAL/CARDINAL , irrespective of whether he was appearing under his own name or a pseudonym . In the same manner , he must take responsibility for the material he produces , irrespective of what name he chooses to use .", "When the [ applicant ] gave the aforementioned newspaper interview and employed provocative , if not derogatory , comments about others , including the girl who had accused him of sexual offences , he launched a public debate and should , moreover , have known that his comments would result in strong reactions from those who strongly disliked his abovementioned views . [ X ] enjoys freedom of expression according to LAW , and ORG reached the correct conclusion that under these circumstances he had enjoyed greater freedom to express himself about the [ applicant ] and his opinions .", "In assessing whether or not comments or other expressions can be considered a defamatory allegation according to Article CARDINAL of LAW , taking into consideration the manner in which the provision of LAW ] has been clarified by ORG , it has to be decided whether the expression involved a value judgment or a factual statement . Although it can be agreed that by using the term \u2018 rapist\u2019 about a named person , that person is being accused of committing rape , account must be taken of the context in which the term is set , cf . the ruling of ORG on DATE in Case No CARDINAL/CARDINAL . If the altered picture and the comment \u2018 PERSON you rapist ORG are taken as a whole \u2013 as the parties agree should be the case \u2013 ORG agrees with ORG that this was a case of invective on the part of [ X ] against the [ applicant ] in a ruthless public debate , which the latter , as stated previously , had instigated . It was therefore a value judgment about the [ applicant ] and not a factual statement that he was guilty of committing rape . In this context , it makes a difference , even though this alone is not decisive for the conclusion , that [ X ] did not maintain that the [ applicant ] had thus committed a criminal offence against someone else , named or unnamed . Accordingly , and with reference to the conclusion of the appealed judgment , the conclusion that [ X ] expressed himself within the limits of the freedom to which he is entitled under LAW , must be upheld . As a result he is acquitted of all the [ applicant \u2019s ] claims .", "As is rightly stated in the appealed ruling , the modified picture and the comments of [ X ] attached thereto were indecent and tasteless with respect to the [ applicant ] . For this reason , and with reference to LAW , cf . LAW No CARDINAL/CARDINAL on ORG , legal costs before both court instances will be cancelled . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the minority \u2019s opinion , the statement \u201c Fuck you rapist bastard \u201d , considered in the light of the content of the article published by ORG , could not be considered a value judgment but rather a grave insinuation that the applicant had committed a serious criminal offence . The minority concluded that , considering that the criminal investigation had ended with the case against the applicant being dismissed , and even if the applicant was a public person who had expressed himself in a controversial way in public , he should not have to tolerate this kind of comment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
