The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a member of ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . He submitted that ORG had adopted CARDINAL Directives in succession aimed at preventing the use of the financial system for money - laundering . The first ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE ) targets credit and financial institutions . It was amended by a Directive of DATE ( CARDINAL ) which , among other things , widened its scope to include professions outside the financial sector , including members of the independent legal professions . The third Directive ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of DATE ) repealed the Directive of DATE , as amended , and reproduced and added to its content . The laws transposing these Directives \u2013 Law no . CARDINAL of DATE in the case of LAW , as amended \u2013 and the regulations implementing that law \u2013 Decree no . DATE - CARDINAL of DATE have been incorporated into ORG ( for more details see sections III and IV below on relevant ORG and domestic law ) .", "CARDINAL . These texts place lawyers under an \u201c obligation to report suspicions \u201d which the legal profession \u2013 who see it as a threat to professional privilege and the confidentiality of exchanges between lawyers and their clients \u2013 have constantly criticised , in particular through ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE ORG took a \u201c decision adopting regulations on internal procedures for implementing the obligation to combat money - laundering and terrorist financing , and an internal supervisory mechanism to guarantee compliance with those procedures \u201d ( published in ORG on DATE ) . In so doing it was effectively applying section CARDINAL of the PERSON of DATE reforming certain legal and judicial professions , which empowered it , with due respect for the laws and regulations in force , to take general measures to unify the rules and practices of the legal profession .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the above - mentioned decision states that \u201c all lawyers who are members of a NORP Bar \u201d are bound by these rules of their profession when , in the course of their business activity , they participate for and on behalf of their client in any financial or real - estate transaction or assist their client in the preparation or execution of transactions relating to : ( CARDINAL ) the buying and selling of real estate or businesses ; ( CARDINAL ) the management of funds , securities or other assets belonging to the client ; ( CARDINAL ) the opening of current accounts , savings accounts or securities accounts ; ( CARDINAL ) the organisation of the contributions required to create companies ; ( CARDINAL ) the formation , administration or management of companies ; and ( CARDINAL ) the formation , administration or management of trusts governed by a foreign legal system , or of any other similar structure . They are not bound by these rules \u201c when acting as legal counsel or in the context of judicial proceedings \u201d in connection with CARDINAL or other of the above activities ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The regulations establish in particular that lawyers must always \u201c show due diligence \u201d in this context and \u201c develop internal procedures \u201d to ensure compliance with , inter alia , the laws and regulations governing the reporting of suspicions ( Article CARDINAL ) , indicating in particular the procedure to be followed when an operation appears to warrant such reporting ( Article CARDINAL ) . More specifically , they must adopt written rules describing the steps to be taken ( Article CARDINAL ) . They must also ensure that the regulations are properly applied in their structure , and that lawyers and staff receive the necessary information and training , tailored to their particular activities ( Article CARDINAL ) , and set up an in - house monitoring system ( Article CARDINAL ) . At the same time , the regulations also specify that \u201c lawyers must , in all circumstances , ensure that professional confidentiality is respected \u201d ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Failure to comply with these regulations can entail disciplinary sanctions and even being struck off ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE organising the legal profession ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , considering that it undermined lawyers\u2019 freedom to exercise their profession and the essential rules regulating that profession , the applicant appealed to the ORG d\u2019Etat to have the decision set aside . He submitted that there was no law or regulation giving the ORG regulatory powers in such matters as money - laundering . Furthermore , pointing out that the decision concerned required lawyers to adopt in - house procedures to ensure compliance with the instructions on the reporting of suspicions , subject to disciplinary sanctions , and that the term \u201c suspicions \u201d was not defined , he complained that this was in breach of the requirement of legal certainty inherent in DATE Convention . In addition , referring to the PERSON and PERSON v. GPE judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , he contended that the regulations adopted by ORG were incompatible with LAW , as the \u201c obligation to report suspicions \u201d jeopardised legal professional privilege and the confidentiality of exchanges between lawyer and client . Lastly , under LAW , he asked the PERSON d\u2019Etat to refer the matter to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling on the conformity of the \u201c declaration of suspicion of criminal offence \u201d with LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat rejected the bulk of the submissions in the application .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the submission based on LAW , the judgment found that the \u201c reporting of suspicions \u201d referred to in the disputed decision was not unclear in so far as it referred to the provisions of LAW ( subsequently amended to become LAW ) . As to the submission based on LAW , the judgment rejected it on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... if , according to the applicant , the provisions of [ Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC , as amended ] are incompatible with those of LAW ... which protect the fundamental right to professional confidentiality , among other things , that Article also permits interference by the authorities with that right when necessary in the interests of public safety , for the prevention of disorder or crime ... ; ... regard being had on the one hand to the general interest served by combating money - laundering and , on the other , to the safeguard provided by the exclusion from its scope of information received or obtained by lawyers in the course of activities connected with judicial proceedings , or in their capacity as legal counsel , save , in this latter case , where the lawyer is taking part in money - laundering activities , or the legal advice is provided for money - laundering purposes , or the lawyer knows that the client is seeking legal advice for money - laundering purposes , the obligation under the Directive concerned for lawyers to report their suspicions does not amount to excessive interference with professional confidentiality ; ... accordingly there is no need to refer the matter to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling and the submission concerning the breach of the LAW provision concerned must be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The recommendations adopted by the ORG provide , inter alia , for a duty of diligence on the part of financial institutions and require them to report suspicious transactions .", "Recommendation no . CARDINAL proposed widening the scope of the professions concerned by the requirement of due diligence to include \u201c lawyers , notaries , other independent legal professionals and accountants \u201d when they prepare or carry out transactions for their clients concerning the following activities : buying and selling of real estate ; managing of client money , securities or other assets ; management of bank , savings or securities accounts ; organisation of contributions for the creation , operation or management of companies ; and creation , operation or management of legal persons or arrangements , and buying and selling of business entities . Recommendation no . CARDINAL widened the scope of the obligation to report suspicious transactions to include the same professions when engaging in the above activities , but provided for an exception when the relevant information was obtained in circumstances where they were subject to professional secrecy or legal professional privilege .", "CARDINAL . ORG of CARDINAL DATE on Laundering , Search , Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on ORG ( which came into force on CARDINAL DATE but has not been ratified by GPE ) contains the following provisions concerning the prevention of money - laundering ( LAW and CARDINAL ) .", "\u201c CARDINAL . Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to institute a comprehensive domestic regulatory and supervisory or monitoring regime to prevent money - laundering and shall take due account of applicable international standards , including in particular the recommendations adopted by ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In that respect , each NORP shall adopt , in particular , such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to :", "( a ) NORP require legal and natural persons which engage in activities which are particularly likely to be used for money - laundering purposes , and as far as these activities are concerned , to :", "( i ) identify and verify the identity of their customers and , where applicable , their ultimate beneficial owners , and to conduct ongoing due diligence on the business relationship , while taking into account a risk - based approach ;", "( ii ) report suspicions on money - laundering subject to safeguards ;", "( iii ) take supporting measures , such as record - keeping on customer identification and transactions , training of personnel and the establishment of internal policies and procedures , and if appropriate , adapted to their size and nature of business ;", "( b ) prohibit , as appropriate , the persons referred to in sub - paragraph ( a ) from disclosing the fact that a suspicious transaction report or related information has been transmitted or that a money - laundering investigation is being or may be carried out ;", "( c ) NORP ensure that the persons referred to in sub - paragraph a are subject to effective systems for monitoring , and where applicable supervision , with a view to [ ensuring ] their compliance with the requirements to combat money - laundering , where appropriate on a risk - sensitive basis . \u201d", "According to the explanatory report , the intention of the drafters of this LAW was that it should also cover the \u201c non - financial professions \u201d referred to in FAC no . CARDINAL . Moreover , the expression \u201c subject to safeguards \u201d in LAW ( a ) ( ii ) primarily means that it is in respect of the independent legal professions that the restriction \u201c resulting from professional secrecy or legal professional privilege \u201d contained in FAC no . CARDINAL ( and its explanatory note ) is relevant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money - laundering . The aim was to oblige credit and financial institutions to identify their customers and all transactions in excess of QUANTITY ( ORG ) , to \u201c examine with special attention \u201d any suspicious transaction they considered likely to be related to money - laundering , and to report any sign of money - laundering to the relevant authorities . It was amended by Directive CARDINAL of DATE , which broadened the definition of laundering and extended the obligation to identify clients and report suspicious transactions to a series of professionals outside the financial sector , and in particular to \u201c independent legal professionals \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC , as amended , was repealed by Directive CARDINAL of DATE on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money - laundering and terrorist financing , which reproduces and adds to the text of the earlier Directive . Recital CARDINAL specifies that \u201c independent legal professionals ... as defined by the member GPE ... are subject to the provisions of [ the ] Directive when participating in financial or corporate transactions , including providing tax advice , where there is the greatest risk of the services of those legal professionals being misused for the purpose of laundering the proceeds of criminal activity or for the purpose of terrorist financing \u201d . LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) specifies that the Directive applies to them when , \u201c acting in the exercise of their professional activities \u201d , \u201c they participate , whether by acting on behalf of and for their client in any financial or real - estate transaction , or by assisting in the planning or execution of transactions for their client concerning the : ( i ) buying and selling of real property or business entities ; ( ii ) managing of client money , securities or other assets ; ( iii ) opening or management of bank , savings or securities accounts ; ( iv ) organisation of contributions necessary for the creation , operation or management of companies ; ( v ) creation , operation or management of trusts , companies or similar structures \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Directive calls in certain cases for customer due diligence measures , including identifying and verifying the identity of the customer and the beneficial owner and obtaining information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship ( LAW ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) . Member GPE are in principle obliged to require that , where the institution or person concerned is unable to comply with its obligations , they \u201c may not carry out a transaction through a bank account , establish a business relationship or carry out the transaction , or shall terminate the business relationship , and shall consider making a report to the financial intelligence unit ( ORG ) in accordance with LAW . This obligation does not apply , however , \u201c in situations when ... independent legal professionals ... are in the course of ascertaining the legal position for their client or performing their task of defending or representing that client in , or concerning judicial proceedings , including advice on instituting or avoiding proceedings \u201d ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . It also enshrines the obligation to report suspicions , specifying that \u201c member GPE shall require the institutions and persons [ concerned ] ... to cooperate fully \u201d , \u201c by promptly informing the ORG , on their own initiative , where [ they ] know , suspect or have reasonable grounds to suspect that money - laundering or terrorist financing is being or has been committed or attempted \u201d and \u201c by promptly furnishing the ORG , at its request , with all necessary information , in accordance with the procedures established by the applicable legislation \u201d ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , where \u201c independent legal professionals \u201d are concerned , \u201c member GPE may ... designate an appropriate self - regulatory body of the profession concerned as the authority to be informed in the first instance in place of the ORG \u201d , in which case the designated self - regulatory body must \u201c forward the information to the ORG promptly and unfiltered \u201d ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP And member GPE are not obliged to apply the obligations laid down in DATE to ( inter alia ) \u201c independent legal professionals ... with regard to information they receive from or obtain on one of their clients , in the course of ascertaining the legal position for their client or performing their task of defending or representing that client in , or concerning judicial proceedings , including advice on instituting or avoiding proceedings , whether such information is received or obtained before , during or after such proceedings \u201d ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , according to recital CARDINAL , \u201c [ n]othing in this Directive should be interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in connection with an application lodged by various ORG associations to have certain legal provisions transposing Directive CARDINAL annulled , ORG referred the following question to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling :", "\u201c Does LAW , [ LAW ] , of Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... breach the right to a fair trial guaranteed by LAW ] ... in so far as the new LAW , [ \u00a7 CARDINAL ] which it adds to Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC imposes the inclusion of independent legal professionals \u2013 no exception being made for lawyers DATE in the scope of the said Directive , which , in substance , requires certain people and institutions to inform the authorities responsible for combating money - laundering of any sign that may be an indication of money - laundering ( LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC , replaced by LAW , [ LAW ] , of Directive CARDINAL ) ? \u201d", "The Bar associations submitted in particular that in extending to lawyers the obligation to inform the competent authorities of any transactions they knew or suspected were linked to money - laundering , the legislation concerned was in breach of the principles of professional confidentiality and the independence of the lawyer , which are essential aspects of the fundamental right to a fair trial and the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG disagreed .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , it pointed out that fundamental rights formed an integral part of the general principles of law which it upheld , drawing on the constitutional traditions shared by the member GPE and the guidance given by the international human rights protection treaties to which the member GPE were party or with which they cooperated , among which ORG was \u201c particularly significant \u201d . It concluded that the right to a fair trial enshrined , inter alia , in LAW was a fundamental right which ORG respected as a general principle by virtue of LAW .", "ORG , it noted that under the Directive in question the obligations to report and cooperate applied to lawyers only when they were helping their clients to prepare or carry out certain types of transaction , mainly financial or real - estate operations , or when they were acting in the name and on behalf of their clients in such financial transactions or real - estate operations . It pointed out that as a general rule these activities , by their very nature , took place in contexts that were not related to any judicial proceedings and therefore did not concern the right to a fair trial .", "ORG further noted that where a lawyer \u2019s assistance with a transaction was requested in connection with the defence or representation of a client in judicial proceedings , or advice on instituting or avoiding proceedings , the Directive exempted the lawyer from these obligations . It considered that this exemption protected the client \u2019s right to a fair trial . It also stated that the requirements relating to the right to a fair trial did not preclude the obligations of information and cooperation from being imposed on lawyers acting specifically in the situations listed in the preceding paragraph where those obligations were \u201c justified by the need ... to combat money - laundering effectively , in view of its evident influence on the rise of organised crime , which itself [ was ] a particular threat to society in the member LAW .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned Directives have been transposed into NORP law and included ( and amended several times ) in the Monetary and Financial Code .", "CARDINAL .
