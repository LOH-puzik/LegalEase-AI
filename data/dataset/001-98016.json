NORP In DATE the applicant brought proceedings in ORG of the PERSON against CARDINAL military authorities : the NORP regional department of ORG and the financial department of the Privolzhsko - Uralskiy military command .

At the end of the hearing , he made a statement , exercising a right conferred on him by LAW , in force at the material time ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant was not afforded an opportunity to comment on the above statement . On DATE ORG of ORG upheld the judgment on appeal . It considered that , as confirmed by the applicant , he had first learnt about the violation of his right on DATE ; that his references to the contracts concluded by the ORG authorities had been irrelevant for his claim .", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW a complaint against unlawful actions by a public official should be lodged with the competent court DATE from the date on which the person concerned became aware of the violation of his or her rights or freedoms .

Both in first - instance and appeal proceedings , a party could challenge the prosecutor participating in the proceedings on account of his or her previous participation in the case in a different capacity , his next - of - kin status in relation to a party or other persons involved in the case , or if the prosecutor had an interest in the outcome of the case or if other circumstances indicated his partiality ( Articles DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . After the oral pleading by the parties but before the court 's deliberations , the prosecutor was allowed to give his conclusions as to the lawfulness and reasonableness of the court decision ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The parties could not comment on the above conclusions .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of ORG Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) On ORG in ORG by LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c it is essential :", "a. that any role for prosecutors in the general protection of human rights does not give rise to any conflict of interest or act as a deterrent to individuals seeking state protection of their rights ;", "b. that an effective separation of state power between branches of government is respected in the allocation of additional functions to prosecutors , with complete independence of the public prosecution from intervention on the level of individual cases by any branch of government ; and", "c. that the powers and responsibilities of prosecutors are limited to the prosecution of criminal offences and a general role in defending public interest through the criminal justice system , with separate , appropriately located and effective bodies established to discharge any other functions ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG ) at its CARDINALrd plenary session ( DATE ) adopted an Opinion on the Prosecutor 's Offices Act ( see above ) . Its relevant provisions provide as follows :", "\u201c ... DATE ... It is , of course , clear that ORG is among those Offices which does not conform to the model which ORG considered to be essential . Moreover , in respect of the ORG 's predominant role in the NORP administration , which can hardly be described as limited or exceptional , ORG does not seem to conform to the tests ... which are as follows :", "CARDINAL . In addition to the essential role played by prosecutors in the criminal justice system , some member states of ORG provide for the participation of the prosecutor in the civil and administrative sectors for historical , efficiency and economic reasons but their role should always be exceptional ( principle of exceptionality ) .", "CARDINAL . The role of the prosecutor in civil and administrative procedures should not be predominant ; the intervention of the prosecutor can only be accepted when the objective of this procedure can not , or hardly be ensured otherwise ( principle of subsidiarity ) .", "CARDINAL . The participation of the prosecutor in the civil and administrative sectors should be limited and must always have a well - founded , recognisable aim ( principle of speciality ) .", "CARDINAL . GPE can entitle prosecutors to defend the interest of the state ( principle of protection of state interest ) .", "CARDINAL . Prosecutors can be entitled to initiate procedures or to intervene in ongoing procedures or to use various legal remedies to ensure legality ( principle of legality ) .", "CARDINAL . In case it is required for reasons of public interest and/or the legality of decisions ( e.g in cases of protection of the environment , insolvency etc . ) the participation of the prosecutor can be justified ( principle of public interest ) .", "CARDINAL .

There have been undoubted reforms in the NORP system of ORG , notably the limitations on the prosecutor 's powers of supervisory review of court decisions ... and the fact that intervention in court cases on behalf of the citizens is limited to cases where they are unable to act for themselves or where this is justified because numerous citizens are affected by the wrongdoing concerned \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Opinion no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) adopted by ORG , an advisory body set up by ORG by its decision of DATE , contains the following comparative analysis [ internal footnotes omitted ] :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Court actions \u2013 irrespective of the procedural rules governing them ( rules of civil proceedings or special administrative law rules ) \u2013 are bound to court proceedings : prosecutors act as parties therein . Prosecution services did not report any special powers or authority when prosecutors take part in civil court proceedings as petitioners , they have the same powers as other parties . Their position is not exclusive , the proceedings may be started by other interested persons as well . In such cases prosecutors have definitely no decision - making powers regarding the merit of cases , their decisions concern only initiation of a case : submitting a petition to the civil law court .", "CARDINAL . Almost in all countries where prosecutors have competences in the non criminal field , prosecutors are empowered to launch new court - actions , to use ordinary and extraordinary remedies ( appeals ) as parties of proceedings . However some rules could be identified ( prohibition of extraordinary appeal or proposal for reopening of proceedings ; prohibition of settlement in the name of the party ) ...", "CARDINAL . The aims of non penal activities of prosecutors , irrespective of their substantive or procedural differences , are much more concordant : ensuring rule of law ( integrity of democratic decisions , legality , observance of law , remedy against violation of law ) , protection of rights and liberties of persons ( mostly of those incapable to protect their rights \u2013 minors , persons with unknown domicile , mentally incapables ) , protection of assets and interests of ORG , protection of public interest ( or of public order ) , harmonisation of jurisdiction of courts ( special remedies against final court decisions in the best interest of law , action as parties in such proceedings of the highest court levels ) ...", "CARDINAL . ... [ T]he ORG is aware of occasional improper practice of public prosecutors acting outside the field of criminal justice assessed by the ORG or by certain ORG or criticised by other bodies of ORG . The most disconcerting events were in connection with rejection without reason of requests to start civil law court actions ; intervention in court proceedings without reasonable interest ( of ORG , of public interest or based on protection of rights ) violating the principle of equality of arms ; quashing of final judgment of courts violating the principle of legal certainty ( res judicata ) ; participation of prosecutors in panels of supreme courts confusing the decision - making role of judges with prosecutors tasks ; unlimited right to start litigation .", "CARDINAL .
