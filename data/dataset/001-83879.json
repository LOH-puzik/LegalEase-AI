ORG noted that the Penitentiary had refused to move the applicant to an individual cell on the ground that he would be soon transferred to a new section , to a room that would be better suited to his medical requirements .

In a number of countries visited by the ORG , particularly in central and eastern LOC , inmate accommodation often consists of large capacity dormitories which contain all or most of the facilities used by prisoners on a DATE basis , such as sleeping and living areas as well as sanitary facilities . The ORG has objections to the very principle of such accommodation arrangements in closed prisons and those objections are reinforced when , as is frequently the case , the dormitories in question are found to hold prisoners under extremely cramped and insalubrious conditions . No doubt , various factors - including those of a cultural nature - can make it preferable in certain countries to provide multi - occupancy accommodation for prisoners rather than individual cells .
