It is represented before the ORG by Mr T. ORG , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted on behalf of the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant company is involved in the storage and sale of damaged vehicles . It applied for planning permission to relocate part of its business . On DATE the local authority resolved that it was minded to grant planning permission . However , on DATE the Secretary of ORG for the Environment wrote to the ORG requesting it to direct the application to him under LAW of ORG DATE ( see below ) .", "The Secretary of ORG considered that he should exercise his power to \u201c call - in \u201d the applicant \u2019s application because of the nature of the proposed use , the impact it could have on the future economic prosperity of the region , and the proposed site \u2019s location next to hazardous gas storage installations .", "The applicant challenged the Secretary of ORG \u2019s power to \u201c call - in \u201d the application as a breach of LAW , and the case together with CARDINAL others raising a similar issue was heard by ORG on DATE , which found in favour of the applicants . The Secretary of ORG appealed to ORG which held , on DATE , that there had been no breach of LAW . Reversing the decision of ORG , ORG held that , although the Secretary of ORG was not himself an independent and impartial tribunal when dealing with called in or recovered matters , the crucial question under LAW was whether there was sufficient judicial control to ensure determination by such a tribunal subsequently . The jurisprudence of ORG ( in particular , the judgment of the ORG in GPE v. the GPE : see below ) did not require such control to constitute a rehearing on an application by an appeal on the merits . What was required was that there should be a sufficient review by a court satisfying the requirements of independence and impartiality of the legality of the decisions and the procedures followed . The judicial review jurisdiction of ORG constituted such a review ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG , ex parte Holding and ORG , ORG and ORG , [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ; [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL ) .", "Following the ORG of Lords\u2019 decision the applicant was forced to abandon part of its relocation plans and substantially to amend its request for planning permission .
