I familiarised myself with the contents of the criminal case file as a result of which the following has been established :", "CARDINAL . My brother had been detained at TIME on DATE . The case file contains the list of his mobile phone connections for DATE . According to that list , after the abduction , my brother \u2019s mobile telephone had received a text message while being in LOC . At that time a checkpoint had been functioning on the roads leading from ORG to Argun . Therefore , the persons who had detained my brother had taken him or his telephone to ORG ; they had passed through CARDINAL checkpoints of the law enforcement agencies . However , there is nothing in the case file showing that the investigators had taken any steps in respect of the staff who had manned those checkpoints on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the persons who had detained my brother had carried out a special operation in PERSON . From the information obtained from the local residents , they had condoned off several streets and had not allowed anyone into the sealed off area .... In addition , these persons had used CARDINAL vehicles ... from the case file it does not follow that the investigation took steps to verify this information .", "CARDINAL . The investigators , when questioning the local residents , could have asked them not only of the vehicles used by the abductors , but also of the direction in which they had left . However , no such steps have been taken .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON had been abducted by a large group of armed persons who had arrived in CARDINAL vehicles and cordoned off significant area in PERSON . Every time if a member or several members of illegal armed groups resurface in GPE , the authorities take urgent steps to eliminate them . In my brother \u2019s case , the law - enforcement agencies had failed to take any steps to search for his abductors . They had arrived at the crime scene to inspect it DATE after the crime had been reported to them , in spite of the fact that already in TIME after the abduction my cousin Mr A .- M.A. had informed LOC of the abduction . From this it is possible to conclude that the authorities had known that the persons who had detained my brother , had belonged to law - enforcement agencies . It also follows that the investigation in the criminal case should have questioned lawenforcement officials responsible for LOC in PERSON in order to find out the reasons for their failure to take urgent steps to apprehend the abductors ...", "CARDINAL . The persons who detained my brother on DATE had been armed , in camouflage uniforms , had arrived as a large group , driven openly around PERSON and cordoned off large areas in the town . Nonetheless , the law enforcement authorities , having received the information about the abduction , had taken no steps to identify and arrest them . Such circumstances provide me with grounds to believe that my brother had been a victim of the ORG agents as a result of their special operation . In spite of those clear facts , the authorities had failed to establish the law - enforcement agencies empowered to carry out such operations in LOC in PERSON and to questions their servicemen .", "CARDINAL . From the above it follows that the investigation should have obtained information of all special operations conducted in ORG on DATE and their results . From the case file it follows that no such information was requested by the investigators .", "CARDINAL . ... I and my relatives believe that PERSON provided the authorities with information about my brother which served as the basis for his arrest . Of course , GPE had known my former husband [ Mr A.Kh . ] .

No further information was submitted to ORG on the progress of the proceedings ; but from the documents submitted it follows that the investigation is still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators questioned the applicants\u2019 relative PERSON . A. who provided detailed description of the abduction similar to the applicants\u2019 account submitted to the Court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE or DATE ( the date is illegible ) the investigators questioned the ORG neighbour PERSON whose statement was similar to that of the applicants submitted before the ORG . In addition , she stated that the abductors had told her in NORP to get back in the house and stay inside . From the conversation she had overheard between them , the witness had understood that the fair - haired intruder of medium height and solid built in embroidered scullcap ( tubeteyka ) had been in charge of the group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators questioned the first applicant whose statement was similar to the applicants\u2019 account submitted before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators also questioned Mr A .- M.A. whose statement was similar to the ORG account submitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators again questioned PERSON .

On DATE the investigators again questioned the first applicant who reiterated her previously given statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators also questioned the applicants\u2019 relative and the father of Mr PERSON , Mr GPE , whose statement was similar to the applicants\u2019 account submitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators questioned the applicants\u2019 neighbour PERSON whose statement was similar to the applicants\u2019 account submitted before the ORG . In addition , she stated that the abductors had spoken NORP and that she had subsequently learnt from the first applicant that when the abductors had arrived at their house , Mr FAC had been in a shop in the CARDINALrd district in ORG .", "DATE . On DATE the investigators again questioned PERSON . A. and the first applicant both of whom reiterated their previously given statements .", "CARDINAL . The applicants maintained that it was beyond reasonable doubt that ORG agents had taken away Mr FAC and subsequently killed him . In support of their complaint they referred to the following facts . The abductors had arrived as a large group of armed men in uniforms in numerous civilian vehicles which were typically used by the local law - enforcement agencies ; the abductors had used portable radio - stations and condoned off a large area , which would have been impossible for an illegal armed group . The abductors had acted openly , without any fear of being discovered by the authorities and openly spoken with the applicants\u2019 neighbours . The abductors had acted as an organised group under chain of command and had been able to drive unobstructed through checkpoints in the area . The authorities had not taken any urgent steps to establish the whereabouts of Mr FAC in spite of the applicants\u2019 immediate complaint about it . Finally , the authorities had motives for the abduction of Mr FAC owing to his past as a member of illegal armed groups and his acquaintanceship with PERSON . who had been killed during the special operation carried out in another neighbourhood in PERSON on the same date . The applicants submitted that they had made a prima facie case that their relative had been abducted by ORG agents and that the essential facts underlying their complaints had not been challenged by the Government . They stressed that Mr PERSON had disappeared in life - threatening circumstances , that he had been missing for DATE of time and that therefore , he must be presumed dead .", "CARDINAL . The applicants further argued that the investigation of the abduction had been ineffective . In particular , they alleged that the investigators had either failed to take a number of crucial investigative steps or they had taken important steps with major delays and deficiencies . In spite of being informed of the abduction shortly after the events , the authorities opened the criminal case only on DATE and carried out the crime scene examination without forensic experts only on DATE , almost in DATE after the report of the abduction . By DATE the crime scene had not been examined by forensic experts ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that had led to the loss of such evidence as the culprits\u2019 fingerprints , and the tracks of their boots and the PERSON tires . Not all the witnesses to the events had been established and those who had been identified and questioned had been questioned belatedly and in a superficial manner . The investigation into the abduction had accepted the theory that the perpetrators belonged to the ORG authorities and forwarded information requests to verify whether Mr FAC had been in State custody whereas the other theories had not been verified . Despite the clear indications to the special operation against Mr FAC , the investigators neither took steps to identify and question the law - enforcement officials as to the reasons for their belated reaction to the abduction nor requested information on special operations carried out in the area on DATE . The investigation was suspended in spite of the ORG failure to take basic steps ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the cases PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE the ORG contended that the applicants had failed to make a prima facie case of ORG agents\u2019 involvement into the abduction as the witnesses had not been sufficiently precise in the description of the perpetrators ; the vehicles , uniforms and the firearms of the abductors could have been used by any other criminals and that there was no proof that Mr FAC had been dead as his body was never found . They further claimed that the investigation of the incident had met the Convention requirement of effectiveness , as all possible measures available under national law were being taken to have the crime solved .", "CARDINAL . The ORG points out that a number of principles have been developed in its case - law as regards applications in which it is faced with the task of establishing facts on which the parties disagree . As to the facts that are in dispute , the ORG reiterates its jurisprudence requiring the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d in its assessment of evidence ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VII ) . Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . In this context , the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account ( see ORG and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVIII ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first - instance tribunal of fact , where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case ( see , for example , ORG v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . Nonetheless , where allegations are made under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention , the ORG must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny ( see , mutatis mutandis , PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL , and ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place .", "CARDINAL . The period of time that has elapsed since the person disappeared , although not decisive in itself , is a relevant factor to be taken into account . It must be accepted that the more time that goes by without any news of the disappeared person , the greater the likelihood that he or she has died . The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead . Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by LAW see , among other authorities , NORP v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINALVI ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that where the applicant makes out a prima facie case , it is for the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred . The burden of proof is thus shifted to the Government and if they fail in their arguments , issues will arise under LAW ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE , and Akkum and Others v. GPE , no . LOC , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALII ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that in reply to its request for a copy of the investigation file into the abduction of Mr Rizvan Aziyev , the Government furnished its contents reflecting the period of the investigation DATE and DATE . The Government furnished no further updates on the progress of the proceedings . The applicants , on their part , updated the ORG on the progress in the proceedings to the extent known to them .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the criminal case materials in its possession reflect primarily DATE of the investigation into the circumstances of the abduction . Taking into account the importance of DATE of an investigation into disappearance for the subsequent progress of the proceedings , the ORG finds that the materials furnished by the parties suffice for the examination of the application .", "DATE . In view of the parties\u2019 submission , the Court\u2019s\u2019 relative . As for the Government \u2019s reference to PERSON and Others , cited above , \u00a7 DATE , the ORG notes , that unlike in that case where the abductors had arrived on foot and where the ORG statements concerning the perpetrators had been vague , in the present one there are materials in its possession demonstrating the validity of the ORG allegation of special operation for the following reasons . In spite of the absence at the material time of curfew in the area and the abductors arrival at the applicants\u2019 house in civilian vehicles \u2013 unlike in numerous other cases concerning abductions perpetrated by ORG agents in the same district DATE prior to the events in question ( see , for example , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE concerning abduction perpetrated in DATE ) the ORG would like to point out the following . Firstly , the abductors arrived as a large group in CARDINAL vehicles ; they cordoned off several streets and acted as an organised group . Their vehicles were able to drive freely through the military checkpoints situated in vicinity of PERSON . The abductors had informed the local residents that they had been conducting a special operation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Secondly , from the investigation file it follows that the investigators took no meaningful steps to check whether the abduction could have been perpetrated for other reasons , such as a blood feud , ransom , drugs or hostility . No serious steps were taken to verify those hypotheses and no information was obtained that the abductors could have been other than ORG agents ( see , by contrast , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , LAW , DATE ) . Lastly , the reluctance of the authorities to verify the information concerning the connection between the abduction of Mr PERSON and the killing on DATE as a result of the special operation of PERSON . ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) provide the ORG with the grounds to conclude that the applicants have made a prima facie case that their relative was abducted by ORG agents . The Government \u2019s statement that the investigators found no evidence proving the involvement of members of lawenforcement authorities in Mr PERSON disappearance is insufficient to discharge them from the above - mentioned burden of proof . Having examined the documents submitted by the parties and drawing inferences from the ORG \u2019s failure to provide another plausible explanation for the events in question , the ORG finds that Mr PERSON was arrested on DATE by ORG servicemen .", "CARDINAL . There has been no reliable news of Mr PERSON since his arrest . The Government have not submitted any explanation as to what happened to him afterwards .", "CARDINAL . The ORG finds that , in a situation where a person is detained by unidentified police officers without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention and is then missing for DATE , that situation can be regarded as life - threatening . The absence of Mr PERSON or of any news of him for DATE supports this assumption .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the ORG finds that the evidence available permits it to establish to the requisite standard of proof that Mr PERSON must be presumed dead following his unacknowledged detention by ORG agents ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
