NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr C. Cali , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and PERSON , his brother , arrived at a NORP bank ( ORG ) where PERSON held a current account ( hereinafter \u201c the current account \u201d ) , which he had opened on DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON on DATE withdrew MONEY ( ORG ) , which had been deposited in the current account earlier . At the same time , the applicant asked the bank employee dealing with them to issue CARDINAL bearer savings books ( libretti al portatore ) in his name . The CARDINAL brothers asked the bank employee to then deposit the money PERSON had just withdrawn into the CARDINAL bearer savings books ( in particular , they requested that each savings book have an equal amount of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Asked by the bank employee for the reason for such operations , the applicant and his brother explained that they feared that ongoing criminal proceedings against PERSON in GPE could lead the NORP judicial authorities \u201c to request information \u201d ( potrebbe determinare una richiesta di informazioni ) .", "CARDINAL . Despite the suspicious nature of the operations and the explanation provided by the applicant and his brother , the director of the bank branch gave his consent to carry out the requested transactions , despite his duty under anti - money laundering laws not to engage in operations that appear suspicious . However , he later reported them to ORG ( GPE di Informazione Finanziaria , hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the national authority responsible for combatting money laundering , among other tasks .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a report of CARDINAL DATE , received by the NORP courts DATE after , the ORG informed the investigating judge ( PERSON , hereinafter the PERSON ) of the above - mentioned facts , which in the ORG \u2019s opinion possibly constituted money laundering . In particular , the agency emphasised that PERSON had deposited the money in the current account by paying in several cheques which could not be considered \u201c compatible \u201d with the professional and commercial activities he had declared to the bank . In fact , the information provided to the bank in DATE had stated that his job consisted of trading in clocks , silver and items made from gold . The trading had originally been done in his own name , as a natural person , and subsequently through a company called PERSON , which had been liquidated in DATE . After that , it had continued through a company called ORG , in which he had never held any administrative position or share capital ( the company had in formal terms been administered by his wife ) . That company had ceased business in DATE . Since most of the cheques which had made up the above - mentioned sum had been deposited in or after DATE , the ORG considered that the transactions had not been justified by or been in line with the above - mentioned facts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the authorities in GPE instituted criminal proceedings no . CARDINAL against the applicant for money laundering .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON , relying on LAW between GPE and GPE ( ORG bilaterale di ORG ) , reported the suspected operations to ORG against the ORG ( ORG ) and requested information concerning the applicant and his brother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the requested judicial authority in GPE informed the PERSON that there were ongoing proceedings for usury against the applicant \u2019s brother , as well as ORG and T , following a criminal complaint submitted by PERSON , a jewellery trader . The applicant was also considered by the NORP financial police ( ORG ) to be very close to various members of a local ORG group in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of that information , the PERSON sent a formal letter of request on DATE to the public prosecutor in GPE for assistance in finding out if the money deposited in the current account in the GPE bank could possibly have been related to the offence of usury or to any other crimes in any way related to PERSON", "CARDINAL . By a note of CARDINAL DATE the GPE public prosecutor replied to the PERSON . He stated that after examining the NORP bank documents attached to the letter of request and comparing those documents with information at his disposal , the money deposited in the GPE current account had to be considered as proceeds of the offence of usury or related to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a request by the PERSON , the ORG provided the judicial authority with further information regarding the bank operations carried out by the applicant and his brother .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON informed the applicant ( judicial notice ) , that he was under investigation for money laundering under LAW for the actions taken in GPE on \u201c DATE \u201d ( the first page of the same decision gave the correct date of DATE ) . According to the prosecution , the opening of the bearer savings books and the deposit of the money from the current account , held by the applicant \u2019s brother , into the bearer savings books in equal shares of ORG CARDINAL each for an overall sum of EUR CARDINAL had constituted acts of concealment , transfer and substitution of money , aimed at hiding the criminal origin of the funds , which were the proceeds of the offence of usury .", "CARDINAL . By the same decision , the PERSON also ordered the seizure of the ORG CARDINAL deposited in the CARDINAL bearer savings books as well as the physical seizure of the savings books themselves , if they were in the possession of the bank , considering the money to be the corpus delicti of the offence of money laundering . Moreover , the PERSON ordered the bank to transfer to it within DATE a copy of all the documents relating to the savings books and to provide any other useful information ( including the precise final balance of each book ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON also asked the ORG and the judicial police to carry out further investigations .", "CARDINAL . The results of those investigations were eventually reported by the ORG on DATE . It stated , inter alia , that PERSON had opened a first bearer savings book ( no . CARDINAL ) on DATE and had deposited ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL through CARDINAL deposits of cash . Following a series of other operations the bearer savings book ( no . CARDINAL ) had been closed on DATE . On DATE , PERSON had opened a current account , in which he had deposited the money left in bearer savings book ( no . CARDINAL ) and had over time deposited CARDINAL cheques worth a total ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , PERSON had written or been the beneficiary of CARDINAL of the above - mentioned cheques for an overall sum of EUR CARDINAL , ORG had written or been the beneficiary of CARDINAL cheques ( EUR CARDINAL ) , T. of DATE ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and FAC of CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint with the Judge of Criminal Appeals ( Giudice d\u2019Appello GPE ) against the PERSON \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . He applied , firstly , to have the whole decision annulled on the ground that it had not complied with the time - limit provided by law . Secondly , he sought the annulment of the seizure since it lacked the requisite fumus delicti ( presumption of a sufficient legal basis ) and because the PERSON had seized all the money in the applicant \u2019s bank accounts and not just that directly linked with the alleged \u201c predicate offence \u201d ( usury ) . In the applicant \u2019s opinion the PERSON should have seized only ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and not the entire EUR CARDINAL given that in the report submitted by the ORG on CARDINAL DATE only ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL had definitely been considered as the proceeds of usury against B.", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE a Judge of ORG in his capacity as Judge of ORG dismissed the complaint . The judge held that the seizure decision had been delivered within the time - limit . He further held that the CARDINAL prerequisites for the application of the disputed seizure , namely fumus delicti and periculum in PERSON ( a danger in delay ) , had been in place .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the judge noted that even if the PERSON report had limited the corpus delicti of the usury in question to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , such a limitation did not exclude the possibility that further amounts of money transferred into the savings books could also possibly have been profits from the alleged predicate offence . In the judge \u2019s view , if that were not the case it was difficult to fathom why the applicant had transferred the whole sum into the savings books and not just LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to the Third - Instance Criminal Judge ( Terza Istanza Penale ) against the seizure decision and the decision of the Judge of Criminal Appeals . In particular , he highlighted , inter alia , the lack of proportion between the amount of money seized and the sum considered , in the NORP proceedings and the ORG report , to have been the proceeds of usury .", "CARDINAL . The Third - Instance Criminal Judge dismissed the appeal on CARDINAL DATE after an oral hearing held DATE . He noted that there was no reason to believe that the predicate offence ( usury ) in the criminal proceedings in GPE against the applicant \u2019s brother was the only offence ascribable to him .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant was served with a bill of indictment , which read : \u201c ... for the offence ex Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL bis of LAW ... since with multiple actions connected between them by a common criminal plan , in the Banca di GPE , in the presence of his brother , [ the applicant ] opened QUANTITY bearer savings books of ORG CARDINAL each , where he transferred the overall sum of EUR CARDINAL using money simultaneously ( contestualmente ) withdrawn by his brother [ G.S. ] from his current account , in which the latter had deposited sums deriving from usury or having a criminal origin ... acts committed in GPE , on DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date during the applicant \u2019s trial he was questioned at a public hearing by the first - instance judge on the merits ( namely , the PERSON della PERSON in his capacity as judge on the merits in inquisitorial proceedings ) . The applicant stated that the money that had been seized was profit from his work and savings and that he had decided to deposit it in a NORP bank rather than an NORP one in order to take advantage of the GPE tax system . The applicant also explained that transferring the money had been the result of his reckless behaviour ( \u201c frutto di un comportamento sconsiderato \u201d ) after advice from the same bank manager who had later reported the operation to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to prove that the money did not have a criminal origin , the applicant submitted a report prepared by a financial expert , who also took part in a subsequent hearing and was questioned by the judge . In particular , the expert stated in the report that the money deposited in the NORP current account had to be considered as the result of tax evasion ( redditi non dichiarati ) , which at the time of the facts was an administrative rather than a criminal offence in GPE . The origin of the assets had therefore not been \u201c criminal \u201d , as required by law , to amount to the crime of money laundering .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . He was also fined ORG CARDINAL ( multa a giorni ) and prohibited from holding public office and exercising political rights for DATE . In addition , the judge ordered the confiscation of all the seized money ( indicated by the judge as EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment and its reasoning was filed with the court \u2019s registry .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance judge held that previous case - law had established that in order to find someone guilty of money laundering it was not necessary to determine the specific legal classification of the predicate offence , perpetrator or victim . It sufficed instead to have evidence ( prova logica ) of the criminal origin of the proceeds in question . Hence , the acts leading to the predicate offence could be described in the charges and eventually ascertained during the trial , without the details of the manner in which the predicate offence had been committed ( anche solo per sommi capi quanto alle modalita\u2019 di commissione ) .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance judge considered that the alleged tax evasion argument used by the defence had been an acknowledgment that the assets involved had been the result of the embezzlement of the profits of the CARDINAL companies through which PERSON had worked and had de facto confirmed the criminal origin of the money .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , many factors had demonstrated PERSON \u2019s involvement in acts of usury , inter alia , the issuing and cashing of CARDINAL of cheques , the cashing of cheques with increased amounts as substitutes for ones not paid out , the cashing of cheques in exchange for high - denomination banknotes and the brief period of time in which all such operations had been carried out . All those elements , together with the results of the NORP investigations , had , owing to their relevance and repeated nature , demonstrated usury , regardless of the results of the NORP criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal against the first - instance judgment . He complained , inter alia , about the lack of clarity in the charges , which had not contained any precise description of the predicate offence ( apart from a reference to the offence of usury , which had anyway been connected with only a very small part of the confiscated money ) . In his opinion , that had amounted to a violation of his right of defence , as provided , inter alia , by LAW ( a ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also challenged the first - instance judge \u2019s finding that the confiscated money had had a criminal origin and the fact that no other predicate offence ( apart from usury , which in his opinion had to be considered as relating to only a small part of the assets ) had been specified and identified by the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicant argued that the reason given by the first - instance judge on the specific point of the criminal origin of the money had led to a reversal of the burden of proof . In fact , the first - instance judgment had noted that the applicant had not submitted any evidence of the lawful origin of the money . It followed that there had been a violation of the presumption of innocence and of the applicant \u2019s right of property .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also argued that the wording of LAW in force at the time of the facts ( DATE ) had provided for confiscation of only the price , the product and the profit of the offence . According to the defence , the judge had applied an amendment to that provision which allowed the confiscation of assets whose legitimate origin had not been proven by the person found guilty . That being so , a finding of guilt should have led to the confiscation of only EUR CARDINAL , namely only those assets whose criminal origin ( usury to the detriment of B. ) had been shown .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , filed with the registry on DATE , the Judge of ORG upheld the first - instance judgment , reducing , however , the penalty . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and prohibited from holding public office and exercising political rights for DATE . The fine was reduced to ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The judge also upheld the order to confiscate all the money deposited in the savings books since the criminal origin of those assets had been proven ( with reference to usury and embezzlement by the applicant \u2019s brother to the detriment of the NORP companies ) . Moreover , the laundering had concerned all the money and not just part of it , therefore the applicant could have foreseen that the whole sum could be confiscated .", "CARDINAL . The judge noted that the law did not require that charges or final judgments refer to a specific legal classification of the predicate offences at the origin of money laundering . Nor was it necessary to specify when an offence had been committed or by whom . The only relevant factor was the determination beyond a reasonable doubt that funds had a criminal origin ( provenienza da misfatto ) . Accordingly , in order to find the applicant guilty of money laundering it had been sufficient for the judge to ascertain that the money allegedly subjected to laundering had not had a lawful origin , that is it had been possible to categorically exclude through evidence and logical deductions that the origin of the proceeds had been anything other than criminal .", "CARDINAL .
