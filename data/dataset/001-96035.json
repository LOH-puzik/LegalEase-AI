The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to ORG ( Zaklad Ubezpiecze\u0144 Spolecznych ) in GPE , the applicant 's husband submitted that in his view the applicant , who had been receiving a disability pension since DATE , was in fact healthy and should no longer be receiving a pension . He suggested that she be re - examined by competent doctors . Apparently divorce proceedings involving the parties were pending at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , referring to the applicant 's medical records , instituted proceedings in order to reassess the applicant 's condition with a view to establishing whether she complied with the conditions governing entitlement to a disability pension .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to a query from the applicant about the legal basis on which these proceedings were instituted , on DATE ORG informed her that the proceedings had been instituted under the provisions governing the internal supervision of physicians working for the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Eventually , on DATE ORG gave a decision by which the applicant 's right to receive a disability pension was extinguished as she was no longer unfit to work .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed , submitting that ORG had failed to assess properly the medical evidence concerning her condition . She also submitted that her condition had been reassessed in DATE . On each of these occasions decisions had been given confirming that she was permanently unfit to work .", "CARDINAL . In her pleadings submitted on DATE and DATE the applicant submitted that there was no legal basis for conducting medical examinations in order to reassess her condition . She referred to the DATE Ordinance , which prohibited reassessment of the medical condition of persons who had been receiving a disability pension for longer than DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The GPE provided that no medical examination could be conducted in respect of such persons with a view to a reassessment of their condition . She further invoked the case - law of ORG which , in the applicant 's submission , supported the conclusion that no medical reassessment of a condition which had served as the basis for granting a disability pension could be ordered once DATE had elapsed from the date on which the decision awarding the entitlement to a pension became final ( II URN DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG , by a judgment of DATE , partly amended the decision of ORG by granting the applicant the disability pension for a fixed period , namely from DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , claiming that in view of her condition she was entitled to a permanent disability pension . She complained about the assessment of the medical evidence by the first - instance court . In her additional pleadings submitted to ORG on DATE , she reiterated her arguments about the lack of legal basis for the reassessment of her condition and concluded that the first - instance judgment was therefore in breach of substantive law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court examined the complaint concerning the allegedly incorrect assessment of the evidence and concluded that the first - instance court had been thorough in the assessment it had carried out . It also noted that during the appellate proceedings and in view of doubts the appellate court had harboured as to the applicant 's condition , it had ordered that , in addition to the evidence available in the applicant 's medical records , a medical opinion should be obtained from the local centre for occupational medicine and further examinations should be carried out by specialists in cardiology , nephrology , endocrinology and gynaecology . The applicant had refused to undergo these examinations .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that the first - instance judgment had maintained the applicant 's pension for the period from DATE until DATE . When that period expired , the applicant had failed to submit to ORG a request to have her entitlement to the pension prolonged .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the applicant 's argument based on the DATE Ordinance and the prohibition it imposed on the medical re - examination of persons in receipt of a disability pension for DATE , the court observed :", "\u201c It should be borne in mind that the proceedings concerning the applicant 's case had been instituted [ by ORG ] under the legal provisions governing the internal supervision by the principal physician of doctors working for that ORG and assessing the medical condition of persons seeking a disability pension ( see LAW of the Minister of ORG ) . Accordingly , it was of no legal relevance to the applicant 's case that she had been declared permanently unfit to work in DATE . Neither was the length of time for which she had been receiving her pension of any significance for the present case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant legal aid to lodge a cassation appeal . The written grounds for the refusal read as follows :", "\u201c Under LAW of the Code of Civil Procedure a party to proceedings who has been exempted , fully or in part , from the obligation to pay court fees can request that a legal - aid lawyer be assigned to represent him or her in the case . The court shall allow such a request if it decides that the participation of a lawyer in the case is necessary . A legal - aid lawyer shall be so assigned where the party is unable to argue the case competently or the case is complex as to the facts or law .", "The crucial issue in the present case was the assessment of the [ applicant 's ] condition and , consequently , it can not be regarded as so complex as to warrant legal assistance . The court therefore considers that legal assistance would be unnecessary and , accordingly , dismisses the applicant 's request .", "The mere fact that a party can not afford to pay legal fees does not justify the granting of legal assistance ; this also applies to cases where legal representation is mandatory for the preparation of the cassation appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the material time LAW provided that parties to proceedings could ask the court competent to deal with the case to grant them an exemption from court fees provided that they submitted a declaration to the effect that the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in their standard of living and that of their family .", "CARDINAL . NORP Parties to proceedings concerning social insurance allowances and pensions were exempted , under LAW , from the obligation to pay court fees .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , persons exempted from court fees could request that legal aid be granted to them . This provision , in so far as relevant , provided :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A party [ to the proceedings ] exempted partly or entirely from court fees may request that an advocate or a legal adviser be appointed for him or her . ... The court shall grant that request if it considers that the participation of an advocate or a legal adviser in the case is necessary . ...", "CARDINAL . The provisions of the preceding paragraph are also applicable to parties who benefit from a statutory exemption from court fees , provided that they demonstrate , by way of the declaration referred to in LAW , that the fees of the advocate or legal adviser would entail a reduction in their standard of living and that of their family . The court shall refuse to assign a lawyer to the case if it considers that the party 's action or appeal is manifestly ill - founded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the material time a party to civil proceedings could lodge a cassation appeal with ORG against a final judicial decision of a secondinstance court terminating the proceedings . Under Article MONEY of the Code of Civil Procedure a cassation appeal had to be lodged with the court that had given the relevant decision within DATE from the date on which the decision with its written grounds was served on the party concerned . Cassation appeals which were not lodged by an advocate or a legal adviser were to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code listed the grounds on which a cassation appeal could be lodged . It read as follows :", "\u201c The cassation appeal may be based on the following grounds :", "( CARDINAL ) a breach of substantive law on account of its erroneous interpretation or wrongful application ;", "( CARDINAL ) a breach of procedural provisions if the defect in question could significantly affect the outcome of the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure guarantees the parties to proceedings the right to appeal against a decision of the first - instance court terminating the proceedings . An interlocutory appeal ( za\u017calenie ) of this kind is also available against certain interlocutory decisions specified in this provision . An appeal lies against a refusal of exemption from court fees and likewise against a refusal of legal aid , where such decisions have been given by a first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . No appeal lies where such decisions are given by an appellate court .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the DATE Ordinance of the Minister of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG . CARDINAL , item CARDINAL ) , as amended in DATE , provided that no medical examination could be organised with a view to reassessing the medical condition of persons who had been declared unfit to work and who had been in receipt of a disability pension for DATE .", "This Ordinance was repealed with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the system of social insurance has been regulated by ORG of DATE ( Ustawa o systemie ubezpiecze\u0144 spo\u0142ecznych ) and a number of other acts applying to specific occupational groups or types of benefits . Social insurance benefits are essentially paid from a single fund financed by various compulsory contributions from employees and employers and managed by ORG . Entitlement to a disability pension is based on the claimant 's inability to continue paid employment on grounds of illhealth , confirmed by a medical certificate by doctors working for the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a number of judgments ORG and ORG examined whether entitlement to a disability pension which had been paid to the insured person for DATE could be redetermined following a fresh medical examination and reassessment of the person 's condition .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( II URN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) quashed a judgment of ORG in which the latter had accepted that a fresh medical examination could be ordered in respect of the appellant , who had been in receipt of a disability pension for DATE . ORG found that , despite the fact that it was contained in the Ordinance , the prohibition should be regarded as being of a statutory nature . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( II URN CARDINAL ) ORG reached the same conclusion and quashed a judgment of the appellate court . It observed that the decision that the appellant should undergo a medical examination to reassess his condition lacked any legal basis and that , accordingly , the result was of no legal relevance to the appellant 's entitlement to a disability pension . In both judgments ORG referred to its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( II URN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( II URN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG allowed an extraordinary appeal brought by the ORG in the case of an appellant who had been in receipt of a disability pension for DATE . It reiterated the conclusions previously reached by ORG and held that the medical reassessment of a person 's condition after that time had no legal basis as it was contrary to section CARDINAL of the Ordinance DATE . It would have been possible only if , prior to issuing such an order , ORG had obtained evidence showing that the person 's condition no longer made him or her unfit to work . In the absence of such evidence , medical reassessment breached the principle of vested rights . On DATE ( II URN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG reiterated its previous conclusions as to the prohibition of medical reassessment after longer than DATE . In its judgment of DATE the ORG shared the view of ORG and held that in such cases the disability should be presumed to be permanent .", "In its judgment of DATE ( II UKN CARDINAL ) ORG held :", "\u201c ORG can not challenge the assessment that a person entitled to a disability pension is unfit to work if that person has been recognised as disabled for a period of over DATE . The change of legal situation in DATE [ when the DATE Ordinance was repealed ] is irrelevant in this respect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( II UKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG held that the legal changes made to the social insurance system in DATE did not affect existing disability entitlements in so far as the applicable provisions guaranteed the permanence of entitlements which had been paid for a period exceeding DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgments of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE ( III GPE CARDINAL and II GPE CARDINAL respectively ) ORG noted that the Ordinance had been repealed with effect from DATE . It further referred to the views expressed by ORG in the judgments referred to above and disagreed with them . It was of the opinion that section CARDINAL of the DATE Ordinance did not create a presumption of permanent entitlement to a disability pension which had been paid for DATE . It observed that the temporal scope of the application of that GPE and the principle stated in LAW thereof were unclear ; in particular , it was not clear whether after the entry into force of LAW the prohibition on medical re - assessment remained valid . The court took the view that this was not the case and that the right to social insurance entitlements , including disability pensions , could not be seen as being irrevocable under all circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( III UZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG examined a request brought by the ORG for a resolution by CARDINAL judges as to whether ORG could challenge the entitlement to a disability pension of persons who prior to DATE , the date on which the DATE Ordinance was repealed , had been receiving the pension for longer than DATE . The ORG pointed to discrepancies in the case - law of the various appellate courts and in ORG case - law . In its resolution the ORG retraced the history of the relevant case - law and acknowledged that diverging views had been expressed by different benches of that court . It ultimately expressed the view that the prohibition on medical reassessment contained in the DATE Ordinance was merely of a procedural nature and as such could not be applied after the ORG had been repealed . In consequence , nothing prevented ORG from ordering a fresh medical examination with a view to reassessing whether the person concerned continued to be unfit for work ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
