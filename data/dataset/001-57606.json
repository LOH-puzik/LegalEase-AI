On DATE at TIME , Mr. PERSON , deputy superintendent of police , considered that PERSON was in a state of vagrancy and put him at the disposal of the public prosecutor at PERSON ; at the same time , he asked the competent authorities to supply him with information about ORG . TIME , after being deprived of his liberty since TIME , PERSON attempted to escape . He was immediately caught by a policeman and he disputed the right of the police to \" keep him under arrest for TIME \" . He threatened to commit suicide .", "The information note , dated DATE , showed that DATE and DATE the applicant had had CARDINAL convictions by courts of summary jurisdiction or police courts and that , contrary to his allegations , he had been placed at the ORG \u2019s disposal CARDINAL times as a vagrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the police court at GPE , after satisfying itself as to \" the identity , age , physical and mental state and manner of life \" of PERSON , decided , at a public hearing and after giving him an opportunity to reply , that the circumstances which caused PERSON to be brought before the court had been established . In pursuance of LAW of LAW of DATE \" for the suppression of vagrancy and begging \" ( \" LAW \" ) the court placed the applicant \" at the disposal of the Government to be detained in a vagrancy centre for DATE \" and directed \" the public prosecution to execute the order \" .", "CARDINAL . After being first detained at the institution at ORG and then from DATE at that of PERSON , PERSON was sent on CARDINALth DATE to the medico - surgical centre at FAC from where he was returned to PERSON on DATE .

On DATE May and CARDINALth DATE , that is , DATE after his arrest and DATE after sending his first letter to ORG ( CARDINALrd DATE ) , the applicant wrote to the Minister of ORG invoking Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . He underlined the fact that on DATE he had received CARDINAL BF in respect of his pension and showed surprise that he had not yet been released . He also complained of being forced to work for the TIME wage of CARDINAL BF . He added that he had refused to work in protest against the behaviour of the head of the block at PERSON who had wrongfully claimed to be entitled to \" take \" from him PERCENT of his pension . Finally , he complained of the disciplinary measures taken on such refusal - punishment in a cell and confinement without privileges - and of hindrance to correspondence . On DATE , ORG requested the governor of the prison at PERSON to inform PERSON \" that his request for release \" of CARDINALst May would \" be examined in due course \" .", "The applicant took up his complaints again on DATE and later on DATE . In this last letter , he enquired of the Minister why he had been transferred to the prison at GPE . He also pointed out that there was no work available at this institution which would enable him to earn his \" release savings \" . On DATE , ORG had him notified that his release before the prescribed period had expired could \" be considered \" \" provided that his conduct at work ( was ) satisfactory \" and \" adequate arrangements for rehabilitation ( had ) been made \" .", "ORG wrote again to the Minister on CARDINALth DATE . Due to his pension , he argued , he had \" sufficient money \" ; in any case , \" the results of ( his ) work \" already amounted to CARDINAL BF . As regards his rehabilitation , he stated that his detention made it \" impossible \" ; it prevented him from corresponding freely with employers and the welfare officer had failed to help him . Nevertheless , on DATE , ORG considered that his application \" ( could ) not at present be granted \" .", "On DATE , the applicant wrote once again to the Minister claiming he could find board and lodging and work on a farm .", "CARDINAL .

In his application lodged with ORG on DATE ( No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG invoked Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of the Convention . He complained in the first place of his \" arbitrary detention \" ordered in the absence of any offence on his part , without a conviction and in spite of his having financial resources . He also protested against the \" slavery \" and \" servitude \" which , in his view , resulted from being obliged to work in return for an absurdly low wage and under pain of disciplinary sanctions .", "The Commission declared the application admissible on DATE ; prior to this , the Commission had ordered the joinder of the case with the applications of PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , PERSON , a NORP citizen born on DATE at ORG , reported to Mr. PERSON , deputy superintendent of police at GPE , in order \" to be treated as a vagrant unless one of the social services ( could find him ) employment where ( he could ) be provided with board and lodging while waiting for regular work \" . He explained that of late he had been living with his mother at GPE but that she could no longer provide for his upkeep ; that he had lost a job as a scaffolding fitter at GPE and , in spite of his efforts , had failed to find another job for over a month ; that he no longer had any means of subsistence and that he had been \" convicted \" in DATE for vagrancy by the police court at GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , the police court at GPE , after satisfying itself as to \" the identity , age , physical and mental state and manner of life \" of PERSON , considered at a public hearing and after giving him an opportunity to reply that the circumstances which had caused him to be brought before the court had been established . In pursuance of LAW of LAW , the court placed him \" at the disposal of the Government to be detained in an assistance home \" and directed \" the public prosecution to execute this order \" .", "CARDINAL . Ooms was detained partly at ORG and partly at PERSON . He also spent DATE at the prison medico - surgical centre at FAC ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , that is DATE after his arrest and DATE before applying to the Commission ( CARDINALth DATE ) , the applicant petitioned the Minister of ORG for his release . He alleged he was suffering from tuberculosis and that his family had agreed to take him back with them and place him in a sanatorium . On CARDINALth May , ORG , after receiving the unfavourable opinion of the doctor and of the director of the institution at PERSON , considered the request to be premature .", "PERSON again made a petition for release on DATE , this time to the Prime Minister . He pleaded that as \" he had been ill since his detention \" he had been unable to earn by his own work the CARDINAL BF needed to make up his release savings , and repeated that his mother was willing to have him with her and to take care of him . ORG , to whom the Prime Minister \u2019s office had transmitted the request , also considered it to be premature ; on DATE , it requested the governor of GPE prison to inform the applicant accordingly .", "On DATE , the welfare department of ORG at GPE certified that PERSON would \" be given work and lodging in ( their ) establishments immediately on his release \" . The applicant sent this declaration to the director of the welfare settlement at ORG on DATE , but without result .", "His mother , PERSON . Ooms , confirmed her son \u2019s declarations by letter of DATE to the same director . In his reply of DATE , the director asked her to produce a certificate of employment , pointing out that \" at the time of his possible discharge \" , the applicant had to have , besides a resting place , \" a definite job by which he ( could ) ensure his upkeep \" .", "PERSON . Ooms also wrote to the Minister of Justice on DATE , asking for a \" pardon for ( her ) son \" . On CARDINALrd DATE , ORG informed her that he would be freed when \" he ( had ) earned , by his prison work , the sum of money prescribed in the regulations as the release savings of vagrants interned for an indefinite period at the disposal of the Government \" .", "In a report of DATE drawn up for ORG , the director of the ORG settlement pointed out that PERSON had already received several criminal convictions , that this was his fourth detention for vagrancy , that his conduct could not be described as exemplary , and that his earnings amounted to CARDINAL BF . According to a medical certificate appended to the report , physical examinations of the applicant had revealed nothing wrong . As a result , on DATE , ORG instructed the director to inform the detainee \" that his complaints had been found groundless \" .", "On DATE , Ooms again petitioned the Prime Minister . To justify this step , he cited the negative attitude of ORG . He stated that he was the victim of \" monstrous injustices \" which he attributed to his being a PERSON . He alleged , in particular , that on DATE , at PERSON , he had been punished with DATE in the cells and a DATE \u2019s confinement without privileges for refusing to sleep in a foul - smelling dormitory where the light was kept on TIME , that he had been locked up naked and later \" lightly clad \" in a freezing cell which had brought on an attack of pneumonia and of tuberculosis for which he had had to spend DATE in the sanatorium at the PERSON institution . He also protested against the dismissal of the many petitions for release presented both by himself and by his mother . He finally declared his agreement to the opening of an enquiry for the purpose of verifying the truth of his allegations and he stated that he was ready to take action , if necessary , before a \" national authority \" within the meaning of LAW ( LAW ) of the LAW .", "DATE , the Prime Minister \u2019s office informed the applicant that his letter had been transmitted to ORG .", "Ooms was released ex officio at GPE on DATE , DATE to DATE after being put at the disposal of ORG , first sentence , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In his application lodged with the Commission on DATE ( No . PERSON ) , the applicant mentioned that he was in the sanatorium of the PERSON institution but that his mother had agreed to have him hospitalised in a \" civil \" clinic . He added that his illness completely prevented him from working and thereby earning the CARDINAL BF for his release savings ; in any case , he would need DATE to earn such a sum , at the rate of CARDINAL BF per hour . He was therefore surprised that ORG had considered his request for release to be premature .", "Ooms , who had meanwhile been transferred to the prison at FAC , supplemented his original application on DATE . He declared that he had for the moment been cured of his pulmonary disease caused by ill - treatment and undernourishment , but his illness had left \" traces \" which made it impossible for him to perform \" any heavy work \" . He also stressed that his mother , who was in receipt of a pension , wanted him home with her . In these circumstances he considered he was entitled to be released , and he complained of the NORP authorities\u2019 refusal to recognise this right . Invoking DATE , paragraph ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) and ( c ) ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-b , article DATE ) , of the LAW he further maintained that on his arrest he had asked in vain for free legal aid ; this fact was contested before the ORG by ORG .", "That part of the application where PERSON complained \u2013 apparently in subsequent letters - of ill - treatment and of a violation of his liberty of conscience and religion ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention ) ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) was declared inadmissible on CARDINALth DATE as manifestly ill - founded ( PERSON to the ORG \u2019s report ) . On DATE , the Commission declared the remaining part of his application admissible , after having ordered its joinder with the applications of PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a NORP citizen born in GPE on DATE , works , at least from time to time , as a draughtsman ; he seems to have had his residence at PERSON .", "On DATE , at TIME , he appeared before Mr. PERSON , deputy superintendent of police at GPE ; he carried a letter from ORG requesting that he be given a TIME \u2019s shelter . He stated he had no fixed abode , no work or resources , and \" ( begged ) to be sent to a welfare settlement \" ; he pointed out that he had \" previously ( been ) in PERSON \" and did not wish for \" any other solution \" . After spending the night in the municipal lock - up , where he had already been TIME , he was taken in charge by ORG on DATE at TIME On DATE , this office certified that so far as its services were concerned there was no objection to Versyp \" being but in the charge of the prosecuting officer with a view to his possible placement in a state welfare settlement \" : he was \" well - known to both ( the ) after - prison care and vagrancy sections \" at the office and attempts so far to rehabilitate him had failed due to \" his apathy , idleness and weakness for drink \" ; in any case , he refused \" any other welfare action \" , except his detention . As a result , PERSON was immediately put at the disposal of the public prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . TIME , the police court in GPE , having satisfied itself as to \" the identity , age , physical and mental state and manner of life \" of the applicant , considered , at a public hearing and after giving PERSON an opportunity to reply , that the circumstances which had caused him to be brought before the court had been established . In pursuance of LAW of LAW , the court placed him \" at the disposal of the Government to be detained in a vagrancy centre for DATE \" . It entrusted the execution of this order to the public prosecutor , who on that DATE , CARDINALth DATE , required the director of the vagrancy centre of PERSON to receive PERSON into his institution .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was detained at different times at ORG , PERSON and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , that is DATE after his arrest and DATE before applying to the Commission ( CARDINALth DATE ) , he wrote from ORG to the Minister of ORG requesting his transfer to the solitary confinement division in PERSON . His request was not transmitted to GPE due to the imminent visit of the inspector - general who granted his request DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant requested his transfer form PERSON to the prison at FAC where , he thought , the Head of ORG could succeed in getting him \" work outside \" to allow him \" to live as an honest citizen \" . He stated that living \" with other vagrants in ORG and PERSON \" had \" shattered \" his morale and that he had neglected his work as he had had to receive treatment in hospital twice ; he promised , however , to attend to \" ( his ) business outside more efficiently in order to avoid a similar situation recurring \" . In a report of CARDINALth May , the director of the PERSON institution pointed out that PERSON , who had CARDINAL criminal convictions and had been detained CARDINAL times for vagrancy , had spent the greater part of his detention in solitary confinement and could not adapt himself to communal life ; the director therefore suggested his transfer to a solitary confinement prison ( op zijn QUANTITY een celgevangenis ) , in accordance with his request . As a result , he was sent on DATE May to ORG and not to that of GPE ; on DATE , he complained of this to ORG , which ordered his return to ORG .", "On DATE , PERSON begged the Ministry to grant him the opportunity of rehabilitating himself \" in society according to ( his ) aptitudes through the good offices of ORG \" . On DATE , the authorities of the ORG settlement informed him , on the instructions of the ORG , that his case would be examined when the amount of his release savings showed that he was capable of doing a suitable job of work .", "On DATE , the applicant protested to ORG against this reply . According to him , he had been prevented \" by devious means \" from earning anything both at ORG and ORG in order \" that ( he ) could then be held for an even longer period \" . Thus , at ORG they wanted to make him do work for which he was not fit - potato picking - and refused to give him other work which he was able to do . Furthermore , they had purported to forbid him to correspond with the ORG but without success as he had invoked the regulations and informed the public prosecutor \u2019s office . In short , he felt himself exposed to hostility which made him want to leave ORG for PERSON , or better still , for GPE prison where , he claimed , ORG would find him a suitable job and accommodation \" in a hostel in GPE \" .", "ORG filed this letter without further action ; on DATE , the director of the state welfare settlement at ORG was requested so to inform the applicant .", "Versyp was released on DATE , by virtue of a ministerial decision of CARDINALrd DATE ( LAW of LAW ) and after DATE , DATE of detention . On DATE the authorities of the ORG settlement had given a favourable opinion on the new request for release which he had made some time before ; they noted , amongst other things , that he would more easily find a job at that time than at the expiry of the term fixed in DATE by the GPE magistrate , that is in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the application which he lodged with the Commission on DATE ( No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and supplemented on CARDINALth DATE , the applicant invoked Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( c ) ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL , article DATE ) of the LAW . He complained in the first place of his detention : he emphasised that he had a fixed abode at FAC and had never begged and so he was surprised at having been placed in a vagrancy centre . He further alleged that he had had no opportunity of defending himself before the GPE police court on CARDINALth DATE as the hearing had lasted \" scarcely TIME \" and he had not been granted free legal aid . He also complained of various features of the regime to which he was subjected . In order to prevent him accumulating the CARDINAL BF required to constitute release savings , he had been left , he alleged , for DATE without sufficient work . In a general way , he added , the directors of the various institutions acted in concert in order to prolong the detention of vagrants as much as possible ; the Government , for its part , \" encouraged \" vagrancy which gave it a labour force almost without cost ( CARDINAL BF per hour at manual work ) and huge profits . Finally , PERSON maintained that his numerous letters addressed to the competent authorities , such as , for example , the inspector of prisons , the public prosecutor \u2019s office ( DATE ) and the Minister of ORG ( DATE and DATE ) , invariably returned \" to the director \" who filed them without further action ; these letters were not the object of any decision or , like his request for a transfer to GPE , met with a refusal . CARDINAL of them , that addressed on CARDINALth DATE to the Minister of ORG by registered post , had even been opened by the director of the ORG settlement who had not sent it .", "On DATE , the Commission declared the application admissible ; it had previously ordered its joinder with the applications of PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW vagrants are persons who have no fixed abode , no means of subsistence and no regular trade or profession \" . These CARDINAL conditions are cumulative : they must be fulfilled at the same time with regard to the same person .", "CARDINAL . Vagrancy was formerly a misdemeanour ( Criminal Code of DATE ) or a petty offence ( Act of CARDINALth DATE ) , but no longer of itself constitutes a criminal offence since the entry into force of LAW : only \" aggravated \" vagrancy as defined in ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the present Criminal Code is a criminal offence and these articles were not applied in respect of any of the CARDINAL applicants . \" Simple \" vagrancy is dealt with LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW \" every person picked up as a vagrant shall be arrested and brought before the police court \" - composed of CARDINAL judge , a magistrate . The public prosecutor or the court may nonetheless decide that he be provisionally released ( LAW ) .", "\" The person arrested shall be brought before the magistrate within TIME and in his ordinary court , or at a hearing applied for by the public prosecutor for DATE \" . If that person so requests \" he ( shall be ) granted a CARDINAL ORG adjournment in order to prepare his defence \" ( Section CARDINAL of the Act of CARDINALst DATE ) ; neither PERSON , nor Ooms nor PERSON made use of this right .", "CARDINAL . Where , after having ascertained \" the identity , age , physical and mental state and manner of life \" of the person brought before him ( Section CARDINAL ) , the magistrate considers that such person is a vagrant , LAW of the DATE Act becomes applicable .", "Section CARDINAL deals with \" able - bodied persons who , instead of working for their livelihood , exploit charity as professional beggars \" , and with \" persons who through idleness , drunkenness or immorality live in a state of vagrancy \" ; Section CARDINAL with \" persons found begging or picked up as vagrants when none of the circumstances specified in LAW ... apply \" .", "In the first case the court shall place the vagrant \" at the disposal of the Government to be detained in a vagrancy centre , for not CARDINAL and not DATE \" ; in the second case , the court may \" place ( him ) at the disposal of the Government to be detained in an assistance home \" for an indeterminate period which in no case can exceed DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Section CARDINAL was applied to PERSON and PERSON and LAW to PERSON .", "The distinction between the \" reformatory institutions \" referred to as \" vagrancy centres \" and \" assistance homes \" or \" welfare settlements \" ( Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Act ) has become a purely theoretical one ; it has been replaced by a system of individual treatment of the persons detained .", "Detention in a vagrancy centre is entered on a person \u2019s criminal record ; furthermore , vagrants \" placed at the disposal of the Government \" suffer certain electoral incapacities ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Magistrates form part of the judiciary and have the status of an officer vested with judicial power , with the guarantees of independence which this status implies ( Articles CARDINAL of the LAW ) . ORG , however , considers that the decisions given by them in accordance with LAW and DATE of LAW are administrative acts and not judgments within the meaning of LAW , sub - section CARDINAL , of LAW of DATE . They are not therefore subject to challenge or to appeal nor - except when they are ultra vires ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the Commission \u2019s report ) \u2013 to cassation proceedings . The decisions of the highest court in GPE are uniform on this point .", "As to the PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat , it has so far had to deal with CARDINAL appeals for the annulment of detention orders for vagrancy . In a judgment of DATE in the ORG case , the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat did not find it necessary to examine whether the GPE police court \u2019s decision taken on DATE in pursuance of LAW of LAW emanated from an authority which was \" acting as an administrative authority within the meaning of LAW of DATE \" ; the appeal lodged by Mr. PERSON on DATE had been dismissed because :", "\" the decision appealed against ( was ) a preliminary decision which ( had been ) followed by the ORG \u2019s decision to detain the appellant in a vagrancy centre ... ; the appellant ( could ) not establish that he ( had ) any interest in the annulment of a decision which merely ( allowed ) the Government to detain him , while the actual decision by which he was interned ( had not ) been appealed against \" .", "As against this , on DATE , that is DATE after the ORG had declared admissible the applications of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat gave a judgment annulling the decision by which on DATE the ORG police court had placed a Mr. PERSON at the disposal of the Government in pursuance of LAW of LAW . Before examining the merits , the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat examined the admissibility - contested by the Minister of Justice - of the appeal lodged by Mr. PERSON on DATE . In the light of the legislative texts in force , of the preparatory work thereto and of \" the consistent case - law of the ordinary courts \" , the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat considered that the placing of a vagrant at the disposal of the ORG does not result from \" the finding of a criminal offence \" but amounts to \" an administrative security measure \" and that the decision ordering it is therefore \" of a purely administrative nature \" \" so that no form of appeal is open to the person concerned ... before the ordinary courts \" . It added that \" such an administrative decision by the magistrate \" could not be considered as \" a preliminary measure enabling the ORG to take the effective decision on the matter of detention but is itself the effective decision placing the person concerned in a different legal position and is therefore of itself capable of constituting a grievance \" ; in any event , \" the person concerned is immediately deprived of his liberty without any further decision by the Government \" .", "Section CARDINAL , sub - section CARDINAL , of the Act of DATE constituting the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat provides that where both this body and \" an ordinary court rule that they are either competent or incompetent to entertain the same proceedings , the conflict of jurisdiction is settled , on the motion of the most diligent party , by ORG \" in plenary session .
