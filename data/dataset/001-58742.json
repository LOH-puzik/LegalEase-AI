On DATE the ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) took the applicant into detention on remand ( GPE - haft ) on charges of attempted murder . He was suspected of having , together with an accomplice , tried to kill PERSON in that his accomplice attacked GPE with a knife , while the applicant prevented him from fleeing . In these and the following proceedings the applicant was represented by counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , sitting as an ORG ( Geschwornengericht ) , acquitted the applicant . The jury answered the main question as to attempted murder and the alternative question as to aggravated assault with CARDINAL votes \" no \" to CARDINAL vote \" yes \" . According to the record of its deliberations ( PERSON ) , the jury had answered both questions in the negative as \u201c the evidentiary basis was insufficient \u201d . Following his acquittal , the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , relying on the Compensation ( Criminal Proceedings ) Act DATE ( ORG DATE , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , filed a compensation claim relating to his detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , after a first decision had been quashed on appeal , dismissed the applicant 's compensation claim . The court was sitting in camera .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that it had heard the applicant on DATE . It also noted the submissions of ORG of DATE , proposing that the compensation claim be dismissed . The court , referring to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW , found that there had been a reasonable suspicion against the applicant , which had not been dissipated , particularly in view of the statement made by the victim at the hearing of DATE , which was not entirely without credibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal . He submitted in particular that ORG reasoning violated the presumption of innocence guaranteed by LAW . For the same reason , LAW b ) of LAW was unconstitutional . It put the onus of proof as regards the dissipation of the suspicion on the person claiming compensation , even if that person had been acquitted . Further , the applicant claimed that LAW applied to the compensation proceedings at issue , as they related to a pecuniary claim . He was , thus , entitled to a public hearing and a public pronouncement of the decisions . As there had not been a public hearing at first instance , he requested that such a hearing be held before the court of appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of Appeal ( PERSON ) adjourned the proceedings and requested ORG ) to give a ruling that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of the DATE Act was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the request of ORG ( see below , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "The court , referring to the decision of ORG , found that in order to determine whether the suspicion against the applicant had been dissipated it was not entitled to examine the statements of the witnesses heard or other results of the taking of evidence in the criminal proceedings , but had to limit itself to the reasons which the jury gave for its finding . The court also referred to case - law according to which the suspicion was only dissipated if either the claimant 's innocence had been proven , or if all arguments supporting the suspicion against him had been refuted . An acquittal for lack of evidence did not give an entitlement to compensation unless the innocence of the person concerned had at least become probable . Applying these principles to the facts of the case the court continued as follows :", "\u201c It can be concluded here - from the above - mentioned questions which were put to the jury and from the record of that jury \u2019s deliberations - that both the main and the alternative question were answered with CARDINAL \u2018 no\u2019 votes and CARDINAL \u2018 yes\u2019 vote and that CARDINAL jurors therefore cast a \u2018 no\u2019 vote in response to the main and the alternative question \u2018 because the evidence was insufficient\u2019 . This means that on the CARDINAL hand CARDINAL juror in any case found the applicant guilty , whereas on the other hand the other jurors answered the questions addressed to them in the negative only because they considered the evidence insufficient , in other words , they were of the opinion that the evidence did not suffice to find PERSON guilty of the charges brought against him . By no means can CARDINAL draw the conclusion that , as a result of these considerations , the suspicion has been dispelled or PERSON \u2019s innocence has at least become probable ! \u201d", "It concluded that the suspicion against the applicant had not been dissipated .", "CARDINAL .

In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( VfSlg DATE ) ORG dismissed the application filed by ORG to have LAW b ) of LAW annulled as being unconstitutional . It found that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) as such did not violate LAW which , under NORP law , has the force of constitutional law . In the light of the GPE v. GPE case ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) , it held that it was not the refusal of a claim for compensation which was contrary to the Convention , but the re - examination of the question of guilt after a final acquittal . In ORG view only the separate re - assessment of evidence on the basis of the contents of the whole court file was likely to infringe the presumption of innocence .
