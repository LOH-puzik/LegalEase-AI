The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She is the widow of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , loyalist gunmen arrived at ORG , ORG , in GPE and fired a machine gun at persons outside the bar . CARDINAL men entered the bar . One sprayed the room with automatic gunfire and the other threw a bomb into the LOC . PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( aged DATE ) were killed and CARDINAL other people received serious injuries . The applicant was at the time in hospital following the birth of her daughter and was informed of her husband \u2019s death by the hospital chaplain and her doctor .", "CARDINAL . The emergency services and the police were alerted to the incident within a short time . While the dead and injured were being removed from the scene , soldiers of ORG were stoned upon their arrival and had to withdraw . As a consequence of the hostile reception , police decided not to investigate the scene until first light .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , detectives and scene of crime officers attended the scene . Items were taken for forensic examination , including PERSON spent cartridge cases . A number of persons who had been in the bar on TIME were spoken to and later statements were taken from a substantial number of the customers who had been there during the incident . The Government believed that all had been spoken to but that some would only give detectives an oral account .", "CARDINAL . The bodies of the deceased were identified and post mortems held .", "CARDINAL . A claim of responsibility for the incident was subsequently made by ORG , an illegal loyalist paramilitary organisation .", "CARDINAL . The Government stated that despite the efforts of the police it was not possible to identify any particular suspect . No one had witnessed the arrival of the gunmen on TIME of the attack . While a ORG Cortina car had been seen moving away from the location after the attack no one was able to identify this vehicle as belonging to the gunmen or as being used by them as a getaway vehicle . Although conversations with customers in the bar had led to a photofit picture being compiled this did not lead to anyone being connected with the incident . The view of the investigating officer at the time was that extreme loyalist elements from the GPE area were likely to be responsible . It was believed that some persons in this category were arrested and interviewed but without any positive outcome . A report was prepared for ORG who , in the absence of any evidence linking individuals to the incident , did not direct any prosecution to be brought .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an inquest was held into the deaths of the CARDINAL deceased persons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was first contacted by the police DATE after the murder . The investigating officer of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) who returned her husband \u2019s personal effects told the applicant that the police knew who was responsible for the attack but that they all had alibis that they were playing pool in LOC at the time of the murder . There was no further contact by the ORG with the applicant concerning the case at this time .", "CARDINAL . The investigation into the attack on ORG did not close and became active again in DATE , when a NORP priest Father PERSON was abducted by loyalist paramilitaries intending to use him as a hostage vis - \u00e0 - vis the IRA . The police arrested a reserve police constable PERSON , who , in the course of questioning , revealed his part in the abduction of the priest and in a variety of other loyalist paramilitary incidents . A number of other arrests followed , including that of a police officer PERSON who was named as having been involved in the murder of a shopkeeper called PERSON in PERSON in DATE : he was convicted for that murder in DATE . The ORG stated that both PERSON and PERSON refused to name the CARDINAL loyalist paramilitaries also involved with them in the murder unless they received immunity from prosecution . The police and prosecuting authority took the decision prior to the trial not to enter into any process of bargaining with PERSON and PERSON . While both were approached by the police after their convictions to see if at that stage they would give evidence against the loyalist paramilitaries , each again refused to do so unless there was something in it for themselves . The ORG stated that during the period in which PERSON was detained he was interviewed on a large number of occasions . At no time did he implicate himself or others in any offence other than the PERSON murder .", "CARDINAL . McCaughey , however , did name a ORG reserve officer PERSON as being involved in a range of incidents including the attack on ORG .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was arrested along with a woman called PERSON or PERSON . After questioning , both admitted to driving QUANTITY persons , PERSON , who was a member of ORG and CARDINAL other unknown persons on TIME of the incident . While admitting to knowing that the CARDINAL persons must have been engaged in illegal activity they claimed that they did not know the details and only after the event were able to relate the picking up of these persons to the incident at ORG . PERSON and PERSON were charged with offences under section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) DATE \u2013 failure to disclose information relating to an offence . PERSON had by this date been murdered by the IRA and it was not possible to identify the other QUANTITY persons in the car . In DATE the ORG made a decision not to pursue the charges against PERSON and PERSON . This decision was based on the receipt of an opinion of senior prosecuting counsel and was based on a series of factors : the delay in bringing the case to trial , the disposal of charges against others accused of offences arising from the investigation into PERSON \u2019s revelations , the absence of a prospect of a custodial sentence and the impact of a judgment of PERSON cited in another case ( R v Donnelly [ DATE ] NI CARDINAL ) which was viewed as eliminating any reasonable prospect of conviction as a legal defence was available to the accused on a charge of withholding information .", "CARDINAL . In or DATE PERSON , who had been released from prison on licence in DATE , made a statement to a journalist alleging ORG and ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) collusion with loyalist paramilitaries from the GPE area in DATE . This statement was published in the DATE ORG newspaper in DATE . It was obtained by ORG , a human rights non - governmental organisation in GPE ( hereinafter \u201c the Centre \u201d ) . A copy was provided by ORG , PERSON son .", "CARDINAL . PERSON statement made detailed allegations about security force collusion with loyalist paramilitaries , including the allegation that he had been told by ORG , a former reserve constable in the ORG , that PERSON \u2019s farmhouse owned by another ORG officer was used as a base from which to carry out loyalist attacks , including the attack on ORG in ORG . PERSON also alleged that PERSON , PERSON , PERSON [ suspect T ] and PERSON ( a part - time ORG member ) were responsible for the attack and that the getaway car was provided by PERSON and PERSON . He alleged that after the attack the group re - assembled at ORG \u2019s farmhouse .", "CARDINAL . NORP The statement also made links between the attack on ORG and other attacks allegedly carried out by members of the security forces , both ORG and GPE , and loyalist paramilitaries . This group used the farmhouse in GPE owned by PERSON , a ORG reservist , as a base from which to carry out attacks on NORP and nationalists . Other attacks allegedly included the murder of PERSON and PERSON at a bogus vehicle checkpoint in DATE ( see application no . CARDINAL ) : the murder of PERSON and PERSON and wounding of PERSON in their home on DATE ( see application no . CARDINAL ) ; the murder of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON and wounding of PERSON in the latter \u2019s home in DATE ( see application no .

PERSON also linked these attacks to the GPE and GPE bombings in which CARDINAL people were killed in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On or DATE , ORG , an NORP television channel , broadcast a television programme that contained allegations of security force involvement in a number of deaths , including that of PERSON . PERSON made allegations on that programme that members of the ORG and GPE were directly involved in the attack on ORG . A ORG programme produced a similar documentary dealing with these allegations .", "CARDINAL . These allegations attracted considerable attention on both sides of the NORP border and became the subject of police investigation in both jurisdictions . The Government stated that the police investigation in GPE was focussed on determining whether PERSON \u2019s allegations should be assessed as sufficiently credible to require a full investigation . They obtained from the journalist an edited transcript of the interview with PERSON . While his whereabouts were unknown to the ORG , PERSON met with senior NORP police officers at FAC on DATE . A copy of his statement was provided by the PERSON to the ORG , along with a further statement made by ORG to another journalist dated DATE . The police analysed the available materials and sought to identify the personalities to be interviewed . It became apparent that some had died and that others , living abroad , could not be traced . A series of CARDINAL interviews were conducted , under cautions , DATE , of those individuals central to ORG \u2019s account who could be traced . No charges were preferred . The interviews followed the format of ORG \u2019s allegations being put to the interviewee for his or her response . The predominant response was denial of any involvement and claims that ORG had been untruthful . No admissions were made by any interviewee . Interviews were also conducted with less central personalities and with police officers involved in interviewing PERSON in DATE . The latter stated that PERSON had not mentioned the matters now being alleged .", "CARDINAL . Meetings were held regularly with ORG counterparts in GPE . The ORG co - operated also with the judicial inquiry established in GPE into the GPE and GPE bombings ( see further below ) . Amongst matters about which the ORG team provided information to the inquiry was ballistics information which linked some of the weapons used to CARDINAL incident . In DATE a substantial report was compiled by the ORG for the GPE dealing with PERSON \u2019s allegations . It profiled PERSON and dealt inter alia with a description of the DATE investigation into ORG and others . It concluded that the investigation would continue but that his credibility was in doubt . According to ORG , despite inquiries being conducted , PERSON \u2019s whereabouts could not be traced . This report was not disclosed as the investigation was continuing . An internal ORG report dated DATE concluded that it would be necessary to interview ORG before any view could be finalised in respect of the credibility of his allegations : such interview was not possible as his whereabouts were not known . The report noted the absence of any previous mention of the allegations before DATE and that much of what he said was hearsay and speculation . Inquiries made of ORG ( where he had a known address ) and the criminal intelligence service and others failed to locate PERSON . Contact was made with the PERSON and the secretariat of the Inquiry into the GPE and GPE bombings without positive result .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , a further report was written for the Assistant Chief Constable ORG ) in respect of PERSON \u2019s allegations . This also could not be disclosed due to the ongoing investigation but the Government have stated that this focussed directly on the attack on ORG , noting that PERSON had mentioned the names of CARDINAL persons , CARDINAL of whom were known to have played a role in the attack . It noted that it was difficult to advance inquiries without interviewing PERSON and recommended that there should be an overall review of the file on the attack and that the case be examined by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) so that it could be determined whether the investigation should be reopened . This recommendation was accepted . The ORG was established in DATE , with responsibilities including the review of all historical murders by way of case assessment for evidential and investigative opportunities . It carried out a preliminary case review culminating in a report dated DATE by Detective Inspector PERSON of ORG ( \u201c PSNI \u201d ) . His view was that the investigation if looked at alone could not be progressed but that in the context of linked cases might be worth further exploration . He suggested a referral of the case for further assessment . ORG ( \u201c HET \u201d ) director of Investigations , Detective Chief Superintendent PERSON ORG , took over personal supervision of the investigation which progressed through the first CARDINAL of CARDINAL stages of the HET process ( collection of all relevant material ; assessment of the investigations to date ; review of evidence , with intelligence and open and non - police sources , together with a meeting with the families of the victims of the attack ) . As a number of investigative opportunities were identified and to be followed up , the case was to continue to be processed by HET , which had been put in touch with PERSON by ORG The Government submitted that if any evidence of police involvement in the murders was found , ORG for GPE would then become involved . For the latest information from the Government concerning the investigation , see their most recent observations , paragraph CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE , PERSON , owner of the bar and father of CARDINAL of the people killed in the attack , informed the applicant \u2019s family that he had received a summons to appear in court DATE . After contact with the authorities by the applicant \u2019s lawyers and the Centre , it appeared that in or about DATE PERSON , a ORG reservist and PERSON , housekeeper at ORG \u2019s farm , had been charged with withholding information in relation to the murders . PERSON had been the person identified by PERSON as the main source of his information about security force collusion . The applicant and her family had never been informed about these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By letters dated DATE and DATE , ORG informed the ORG that the allegations made by ORG and shown on the ORG programme were under investigation by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG was informed by Chief PERSON , on behalf of the Chief Constable , that charges against CARDINAL persons connected with the attack had been dropped . This followed a meeting on DATE , when relatives of PERSON and others killed at ORG met with Chief PERSON of the ORG , who had been the investigating officer in that incident and also for the murders of the Reavey family . He advised the relatives and a member of the ORG that as a result of his investigations he believed that there had been collusion between the loyalist paramilitaries and members of the security forces ( ORG and GPE ) and that the gang that had carried out the attack included security force personnel . While he was sure of the identities of the gang members , CARDINAL of whom he named as PERSON , a well - known loyalist extremist , he considered however that there had been insufficient evidence available to convict ; he dismissed suggestions of any conspiracy or any policy to block from above and gave his view that the charges against PERSON and PERSON had been thrown out for lack of evidence . He commented that some of those involved were now dead and one was very old , in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE , ORG informed the ORG that the police were not investigating the attacks on the bar and that the current police inquiry centred on establishing the veracity of the disclosures made by PERSON and whether or not any further investigation was justified . The family would be informed if a further investigation was found to be warranted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , members of the Centre met with PERSON in GPE . He made links between the attack on ORG and the other incidents above . He named PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( a part - time ORG member , allegedly working with the army and ORG ) as carrying out the attack on the bar and considered that the security forces would have known about it . He mentioned that PERSON had been shot dead in a later incident .", "CARDINAL . During this period the LOC was in contact with the police ( which had changed name from the ORG to ORG \u201c GPE \u201d ) seeking to have questions answered about the original investigations into the various incidents . On DATE , a meeting was held between members of the ORG and Detective Inspector PERSON . Questions were put by and on behalf of the families concerning the investigations into the incidents . A request was made by the PERSON family to have access to the investigation file .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s representatives made further requests for access to the police investigation file , on CARDINAL DATE to the ORG and the Secretary of ORG and on DATE to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG wrote to the applicant \u2019s solicitors :", "\u201c ( i ) The investigation into the allegations made by PERSON has been advanced as far as possible at this stage DATE this investigation focussed on establishing the veracity of allegations made by PERSON and whether or not there is any justification for further investigation .", "( ii ) There are a number of discrepancies contained within the allegations made by PERSON and he has not made himself available to ORG detectives for further interview in an effort to clarify these discrepancies . He is presently living outside the jurisdiction .", "( iii ) As a consequence of an investigation in DATE , former GPE Constable PERSON and civilian PERSON ( PERSON ) PERSON were interviewed and admitted that they had conveyed CARDINAL other persons , including PERSON ( now deceased ) from the area ... QUANTITY from ORG Licensed Premises to PERSON \u2019s farm . Neither person was able to identify the other CARDINAL persons collected . The allegations made by PERSON in relation to this incident are similar to the facts disclosed by ORG and PERSON during interview and would have been in the public domain at the time of the court case . The names of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON have been given by PERSON as also involved DATE these personalities would have been known to PERSON .", "( iv ) Much of what PERSON alleged is based on hearsay allegedly having been told to him by other police officers , including the former ORG and PERSON . Those persons have been re - interviewed and deny all PERSON \u2019s allegations , other than what they admitted during the DATE investigation . As previously stated , there are a number of allegations made by PERSON which detectives would like to clarify with him but because he is outside the jurisdiction , this has not been possible to date . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a further meeting was held with Detective Chief Inspector PERSON attended by members of the ORG and the PERSON family as well as relatives of victims of other incidents , in which questions were asked about the investigation and prosecution inter alia in the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitors requested the Secretary of ORG for GPE to conduct an LAW investigation into the allegations made by PERSON , in particular submitting that it was not compatible with LAW that it was the ORG that had conducted the investigation into the allegations implicating ORG officers . They also submitted that an investigation was required to be prompt , public and accessible , that the relatives be kept fully informed of the course of the investigation and involved to the fullest extent and that they should receive full disclosure of the documents relating to the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG requested on behalf of the families involved , ballistics information about the guns used in the various attacks . On DATE , the ORG replied that such information was not given out as it could prejudice the trial of any person charged in the future but that if an individual family could show how they might be prejudiced by non - disclosure the Chief Constable would give the matter full consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the ORG requesting inter alia copies of the admissions made by PERSON and PERSON and an explanation as to why no prosecution had been brought . On DATE , the ORG stated that the fact that a custodial sentence was not likely was not the only factor in the decision not to prosecute , while on CARDINAL DATE , the ORG referred them to the ORG regarding the statements and on CARDINAL DATE refused to provide them .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE , the ORG had meetings with the Chief Constable of the ORG , aimed at persuading him to recommence investigations in these cases and to discuss a way forward . No commitment was made , although the Chief Constable expressed the view that if an investigation was carried out it would be conducted from within the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Repeated requests for information concerning the investigation and for access to the file met with the response that the matter was under consideration by the ORG ( letters of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On or DATE , the PERSON family applied for permission to apply for judicial review inter alia for a declaration that there had been no adequate investigation into the death of the applicant \u2019s husband as required by LAW and requiring that the Secretary of ORG provide for an LAW investigation . Leave was granted by ORG on DATE . The proceedings were adjourned pending the outcome of another case", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG held in the case of ORG v. the Secretary of ORG for GPE that a complainant alleging a procedural breach of LAW could not bring a complaint under LAW DATE unless the death in question occurred on or after DATE , when that LAW came into force . This overturned the decision of ORG on DATE to the effect that the obligation to provide an effective investigation was a continuing one .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an application by the Secretary of ORG to set aside the grant of leave in the applicant \u2019s case , the PERSON family withdrew their application for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile in DATE the Report of ORG into the GPE and GPE bombings ( known as ORG ) was given to the Taoiseach of GPE . The report was made public on DATE . ORG had taken into account interviews by the NORP police with PERSON in DATE ( concerning allegations of offences in GPE ) , a memorandum of a meeting between an organisation known as the Justice for the Forgotten and PERSON in DATE , a transcript of audiotapes sent by ORG to ORG for the Forgotten in DATE and the inquiry \u2019s own interview with PERSON on DATE and DATE . The ORG listed sectarian attacks alleged to have a link with the \u201c GPE group \u201d of known paramilitaries and members of the ORG and GPE , including the murder of the applicant \u2019s husband . It noted :", "\u201c PERSON allegations have been subject of inquiries by both the ORG and [ the NORP police ] . These inquiries have relied on shared information , for the most part obtained by the ORG . Despite this , the ORG and [ the NORP police ] have arrived at markedly different conclusions regarding his credibility as a witness . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG referred to a report sent by the ORG on DATE to the NORP team investigating PERSON \u2019s allegations ( see also page CARDINAL ) . The ORG report concluded that as PERSON was a convicted murderer his credibility had to be in doubt and that the results of research did not encourage any belief that he was now being genuine . ORG did not find the ORG \u2019s reasons sufficient to dismiss ORG \u2019s claims and it also noted a number of errors and discrepancies : for example , the ORG claimed that PERSON was dead whereas PERSON enquiries revealed that she was still alive and the information given did not take into account Special Branch extracts , which indicated that PERSON knew CARDINAL named loyalists who came to the farm , of whom CARDINAL appeared in PERSON \u2019s allegations . Nor had the ORG paid sufficient attention to the evidence which supported ORG \u2019s allegations . The PERSON officers , in contrast to the view formed by the ORG , found PERSON \u201c came across as an intelligent and discerning man who is a very convincing witness \u201d and that he was \u201c highly credible and had very comprehensive details about the crimes he purports to have knowledge of . \u201d The ORG concluded that :", "\u201c ... in relation to the attacks on ORG ( ORG ) .... PERSON and PERSON , the Reavey family and the ORG family , information was given by CARDINAL or more of the interviewees which confirmed PERSON \u2019s account of who was responsible in each case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG mentioned that the PERSON had , with the assistance of the ORG , interviewed PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and others mentioned by PERSON ; they denied his allegations . While the PERSON had doubts as to their credibility , no further evidence was forthcoming to implicate them in the incidents , beyond any statements already made in other proceedings . The ORG also set out ballistics evidence provided by the ORG , indicating that there was a chain in gun use between the attacks on ORG , the shooting of the Reavey family , the murder of PERSON and PERSON and the attack on FAC .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stated that :", "\u201c All this information leads strongly to the conclusion that there were CARDINAL or more groups operating in GPE involving not only loyalist paramilitaries but also members of the ORG and of the GPE , and using weapons obtained from the central quartermaster to whom the guns were returned after use . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG was also commissioned to investigate the bombing of PERSON \u2019s NORP in GPE in GPE which was bombed on DATE , the same date as the gun and bomb attack on ORG , ORG , in which PERSON was killed and which ORG had found to be linked .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Commission issued an interim report . It found a number of factors suggested that the CARDINAL incidents were linked . Both attacks were claimed by the Red Hand Commandos . The evidence before it was not conclusive but suggested that the GPE bombing was carried out by a group of loyalist subversives associated with ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) with the assistance of ORG members from the FAC area of GPE . As regarded the ORG investigation , it noted that CARDINAL persons contacted by the ORG stated that they had not given statements to the ORG and that it seemed that no house - to - house inquiries had been made . According to the owner of the bar , however , the investigating officer did keep in touch with him as the investigation proceeded and he was satisfied that the officer was genuinely trying to identify and arrest those responsible . It was also noted that on DATE the ORG made a public appeal for anyone with information about the ORG attack to come forward , with particular reference to CARDINAL cars that had been seen in the area at the time . The information about the cars had been forwarded to the NORP police .", "CARDINAL . The report considered the further inquiries which followed in DATE and quoted parts of the statements given by PERSON admitting involvement in an attack on LOC and concerning a possible role in the ORG attack , when together with PERSON , he drove PERSON O\u2019Connell and CARDINAL other men on that night . Part of the statement of PERSON was also quoted . The report also quoted extracts from police Daily Record Sheets which indicated that PERSON incriminated PERSON and [ Suspect T ] in the ORG attack while PERSON stated that O\u2019Connell and some \u2018 GPE boys\u2019 , one of whom was named , as a guess , as PERSON , were involved . Noting the lack of information about what had happened on DATE when the ORG had said that the charges against ORG and PERSON were marked \u201c no prosecution \u201d and about the judgment of PERSON that was relied on ( see page CARDINAL above ) , it stated that \u201c a perception persisted that the case against PERSON and PERSON was managed or dropped in order to reduce the culpability of the latter when he came to be sentenced for his role in the GPE attack \u201d . It also referred to a letter sent by ORG , assessing ORG \u2019s admissions as going beyond failure to provide information to giving actual assistance to the perpetrators . It did not consider that correspondence from ORG , which set out reasons for not pursuing more serious charges against the CARDINAL accused and clarified that the ORG had been aware at the time of ORG judgment , could be taken as a complete answer to the allegations of managing the matter to lessen ORG \u2019s perceived culpability in the GPE attack .", "CARDINAL . It was stated that before his trial for involvement in the attack on ORG , on DATE , ORG had been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE , for his involvement in the attack on GPE ( possession of an explosive substance and firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant commenced proceedings against the ORG , challenging various aspects of his decision - making in connection with the decision not to proceed with the case against PERSON and PERSON , in particular seeking orders to quash any decisions not to prosecute , offer evidence or enter a nolle prosequi and to quash his refusal to provide full and comprehensive reasons for not continuing the prosecution and his refusal to make available copies of their admissions The applicant also challenged the failure of the ORG to exercise his statutory power under LAW ) of ORG ( GPE ) Order DATE to conduct further investigations into the death of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In an affidavit from a senior officer of ORG dated DATE , it was stated that due to the considerable vintage of the prosecutions in question the full facts relating to the mechanism whereby the prosecutions were actually terminated could not be established . It was known that the opinion of senior prosecuting counsel was considered before a discontinuance direction of DATE was made . The effective decision maker had been the then ORG Sir PERSON who had retired DATE before . The senior Assistant Director involved in the decision , and author of the discontinuance direction , had since died .", "CARDINAL . By decision dated DATE , ORG judge rejected the applicant \u2019s application . He found that correspondence with the Attorney General in DATE established that the Attorney General had not issued a nolle prosequi . It appeared that a decision was taken by the ORG not to offer evidence against the accused at trial , which practice at the time was called , misleadingly , a nolle prosequi . Noting that the offence occurred in DATE and the charges dropped in DATE and that it had been clear throughout DATE when the family and the ORG had been in contact with the police that no further action on this matter would be taken , he commented that the passage of time until bringing the judicial review application in DATE was very considerable . However , if he was wrong on the question of delay , the application still failed on the merits . The application for disclosure of files failed on the procedural ground that it was brought against the ORG , not the Chief Constable who had control of the said files . The decision of the ORG not to use his statutory power to direct a police investigation was a matter of discretion and the decision could not be said to be irrational or unlawful in the circumstances . As regarded reasons , the ORG had departed from his practice and reasons had been given by his officer in affidavit . In any event , the extent of the reasoning was a matter for the ORG and the court could not make an order to require the decision maker to give sufficient reasons to justify the decision not to prosecute . In relation to the discontinuance of the prosecution , the judge noted that the reasons included delay in bringing the case to trial , the perceived unlikelihood of a custodial sentence and \" crucially the impact of a judgment in another case which was judged to eliminate any reasonable prospect of a conviction \" which was a reference to the decision of ORG discussed in R v Donnelly [ DATE ] NI CARDINAL . He considered that it was evident that the decision was taken at the highest level and not lightly . At this long remove , with the death and retirement of the principal actors , it was not possible to establish that the decision , which had a rational basis was ORG irrational or unlawful . He emphasised that a legal challenge of this kind directly affected third parties , namely the CARDINAL defendants against whom the prosecution was dropped , and that it would be intrinsically unfair to reach a decision adverse to their position without giving them an opportunity to be heard - neither had been given notice of the application DATE and such a decision might also , potentially , be in breach of their rights or of the presumption of innocence . He noted that the purported entry of a nolle prosequi by the prosecution was admitted to be wrong in principle and law , as only the Attorney General could do such . The court record and documentation tended to suggest that the court was told that there was a nolle prosequi . While it would have been open to the prosecution merely to tender no evidence , this could have led to the direction of an acquittal ; it was less clear whether an acquittal should have followed as a matter of law . He declined to give declaratory relief as to the invalid nature of the purported nolle prosequi due to the universal acceptance that this had been inappropriate , the fact that this practice had ceased , the applicant \u2019s delay and the absence of the accused as parties to the application ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
