NORP The applicant \u2019s village is situated on the banks of NORP river , at QUANTITY downstream from LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , following heavy rain , the river broke its banks and flooded the applicant \u2019s house . The water ruined a stone fence , a shed and a DATE kitchen , and carried away furniture , wood , home - canned food , and other chattels . The house \u2019s cellar and basement were damaged by dampness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a claim for damages under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE against ORG and the Governor of GPE . She alleged that the flood water had carried away trees and branches which had cluttered the riverbed . As the defendants had failed to clean it , this had impeded the flow of water and had caused flooding . She also alleged that no embankments or other protective facilities had been built to protect her village from flooding , and that no monitoring or alert systems had been put in place . She claimed that those omissions had been in breach of the defendants\u2019 obligations under several provisions of LAW DATE that expressly envisaged such measures .", "CARDINAL . Having initially decided to proceed with the case , in a decision of CARDINAL August CARDINAL , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim as inadmissible . It held that the administrative courts were not competent to examine it because the alleged omissions of the defendants did not constitute administrative action within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Administrative Procedure and section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . The relations between the applicant and the authorities in connection with the flood were not characterised by an exercise of authority and were therefore not governed by the rules of administrative law .

It went on to say that the applicant could bring a claim before the civil courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
