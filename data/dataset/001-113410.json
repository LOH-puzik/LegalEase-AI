ORG , granted the applicant union a period of DATE to amend the impugned provisions of its constitution .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the application for dissolution . In its reasoning it indicated in particular that the relevant Articles of E\u011fitim - Sen \u2019s constitution did not jeopardise ( tehlike ) territorial , national or ORG unity or the existing borders of GPE . It did not find that the union had committed any unlawful action capable of suggesting that the provisions of the impugned LAW constitution would be used by those opposed to the unity of GPE . Based on LAW , the tribunal also gave its own interpretation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL . It explained in this connection that freedom of expression constituted the basis of a democratic and pluralistic society , and that such freedom was a necessary condition for the progression of democratic societies and the personal development of each individual . It emphasised that , without such freedom , there was no democracy . It concluded that the provisions of LAW b ) of E\u011fitim - Sen \u2019s constitution were not in breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . It further indicated that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . DATE which granted DATE to a union to comply with the law \u2013 should be interpreted in the light of the purpose of that PERSON .

On DATE the public prosecutor appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG overturned the judgment of DATE on the ground that ORG had not correctly applied section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG . It took the view that this section did not allow for any latitude of interpretation and that the dissolution of the union was mandatory where it had not complied with the provisions of the PERSON within DATE . It therefore concluded that E\u011fitim - Sen had to be dissolved , as it had not complied with the law within the time allowed to it by the Governor and the tribunal .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , contrary to ORG judgment of DATE , reiterated its original findings . It referred back to the legal reasoning used in its judgment of DATE and invoked the GPE case - law on the dissolution of political parties , in particular the cases concerning ORG of GPE and ORG ( \u00d6ZDEP ) . It further observed that the official language of GPE was NORP and that , according to LAW , any individual attached to the Republic by citizenship was NORP . In its view , the fact of learning a language other than the official language did not constitute an action or conduct in breach of the law , but such conduct was proof of an attachment to the State of GPE . Whilst agreeing that the official language was NORP and that there could not be any other official language , it found that there should not be any particular impediment to the learning of other languages . Referring to its previous reasoning , based on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , the tribunal found that there were CARDINAL main grounds for the dissolution of a union , an association or a political party , namely \u201c an imminent threat \u201d and \u201c the criterion of violence \u201d . It observed that the union whose dissolution was sought defended in its constitution the principle of education in one \u2019s own mother tongue and the development of culture . It emphasised that , even supposing that the wording in question was illegal , the content and weight of the terms did not constitute an imminent threat or an incitement to violence and their inclusion in the union \u2019s constitution did not jeopardise territorial , national or State unity or the existing borders of GPE . It found , on the contrary , that the decision not to dissolve the union would have the effect of calming the social tension , disorder and antagonism that were prevalent in society , and of restoring social peace .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the combined divisions of ORG ( Yarg\u0131tay Hukuk PERSON ) quashed by a majority the judgment of the court below . In its reasoning the court indicated that ORG CARDINAL of the Convention provided for statutory limitations to the exercise of the freedoms of expression , assembly and association and that they notably stipulated that such restrictions had to be necessary in a NORP society . It was therefore the court \u2019s task to verify whether the restrictions imposed by domestic law on fundamental rights and freedoms were consistent with GPE \u2019s international commitments . The court took the view that the union \u2019s call for education in a mother tongue other than NORP was in breach of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Constitution and that it ran counter to the acceptance of a unitary ORG and to the existing legal system . In the court \u2019s opinion , the right to form a union could thus be limited and such restrictions were necessary in a NORP society . The combined divisions of ORG concluded that the defence of education in a mother tongue other than NORP could not rely on LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In their dissenting opinion , some of the members of the combined divisions of ORG , relying on section CARDINAL of Law no . ORG , observed that , according to the conclusion of the court below , the impugned provisions of the union \u2019s constitution were compliant with the law . The dissenting judges were of the view that , as a result , there had been no legal basis on which to order the union to amend its constitution within DATE . They stated that the judgment had to be quashed to enable the court below to comply with section CARDINAL of Law no . ORG and not for the purpose of having the union dissolved .", "CARDINAL .
