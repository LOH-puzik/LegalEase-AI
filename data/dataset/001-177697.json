On DATE , before publication of the article , the journalist had notified the applicant , via an email to CARDINAL of his employees , of the planned publication and had asked several questions . On CARDINAL DATE the journalist had made a follow - up telephone call to the employee , who confirmed that the applicant had received the questions . However , the applicant refrained from answering the questions or commenting on the planned publication .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the article , showing the date of first publication , is retrievable from the website of ORG . It can also be found through online search engines such as \u201c Google \u201d or \u201c GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant sought injunctions against certain parts of the article ( highlighted in the article , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , published in the print and online versions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s action inadmissible due to lack of international jurisdiction on the part of the NORP courts . It found that , at the material time , the print version of ORG was not distributed in GPE and that the Internet version of the newspaper was not directed at a readership in GPE . ORG confirmed that decision by its judgment dated DATE . On DATE ORG quashed the part of the decision regarding the applicant \u2019s claim for an injunction against the challenged statements in the online version of the article and referred that part of the action back to ORG . The court held that the online version of the newspaper was accessible from GPE , and because it mentioned a NORP businessman in the article , the publication had a direct connection with GPE and NORP jurisdiction . It therefore affirmed the international jurisdiction of the NORP courts in that respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided on the part of the dispute which had been referred back to it by ORG . It granted the injunction in so far as the article stated that the applicant had been banned from entering GPE , and dismissed the remainder of the applicant \u2019s action for lack of merit . ORG held that NORP law was applicable with regard to the online publication , as the article was accessible in GPE via the Internet and therefore the alleged violation of the applicant \u2019s reputation had at least occurred in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court accepted that the statements interfered with the applicant \u2019s reputation and personality right ( allgemeines ORG ) as protected by LAW and LAW ) . However , as the statements had been made in the press , which was constitutionally protected pursuant to LAW , it was necessary to balance both interests . Moreover , as the statements concerned a suspicion against the applicant , the presumption of innocence arising from LAW and from NORP law also had to be taken into account . The court held that there was in principle a public interest in reporting on criminal offences , including the suspicion of their commission . On the other hand , continued the court , the interference with the rights of personality associated with such reporting required higher standards of care for newspaper reporting , because even if the investigation was later discontinued , \u201c something of the accusation might stick to the person affected \u201d . Therefore , concrete , provable connecting facts which go beyond a vague , intangible suspicion were required , the reporting must concern an incident of great weight and the suspicion must be identified as such . In addition , the reporting must be balanced , the journalist must not fail to report on exculpatory circumstances and the person concerned must , as a rule , be invited to make his own comments before publication .", "CARDINAL . As regards the statements at issue , ORG held that there was a great informational interest on the part of the public in the reporting that the applicant , as a NORP businessman internationally active in the media sector , was suspected by the secret service of being involved in gold smuggling , embezzlement and organised crime . This assessment was not changed by the fact that the applicant had been mentioned by name in the article , or by the fact that when the article was published in DATE , the criminal offences mentioned therein had occurred DATE previously . Regarding the latter the court pointed out that the criminal offences had become relevant again , due to new suspicions regarding the involvement of a former mayoral candidate . For the understanding of these suspicions it had been necessary to elaborate on the companies and individuals , including the applicant , involved in the alleged corruption . Similarly , describing the suspected criminal backgrounds of some of the persons involved had been necessary for the ORG comprehension of the allegation . The court also took into account that the article remained accessible in an online archive of the DATE newspaper . It held that there was a recognised public interest not only in information on current events but also in being able to research events from recent history .", "CARDINAL . The court further considered that the reporting was free from polemic statements and insinuations , and made it sufficiently clear that only insights from ORG reports and the law - enforcement authorities were being reported . This was expressly pointed out in the challenged article with the words , \" according to reports by the ORG and NORP law enforcement agencies \" . The internal ORG report was confirmed by reports of several other law - enforcement agencies , and the applicant himself , while denying any criminal activities , confirmed certain facts mentioned in those reports during the proceedings . Furthermore , the author of the article had notified the applicant via email that the article would be published . In that context the court also considered that although the applicant had been aware of the defendant \u2019s reporting even before the article had been published , he had waited for DATE before applying for an injunction against the defendant . Therefore , the applicant had not perceived the interference with his personality right as intolerable .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the court concluded that the defendant had complied with the required journalistic duty of care and that the reporting had relied on sources and background information , which the journalist could reasonably consider reliable . Therefore , the informational interest of the public outweighed the concerns of protecting the applicant \u2019s personality right , even taking into account that such reporting might seriously damage his private and professional reputation . Regarding the alleged entry ban , the court concluded that there had been no reliable sources and that the applicant had shown that he had recently travelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected a complaint lodged by the applicant against ORG refusal to grant leave to appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider a constitutional complaint ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) lodged by the applicant , without providing reasons ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
