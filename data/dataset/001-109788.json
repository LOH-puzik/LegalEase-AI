GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention;Article 5-1-a - After conviction)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Ganna Yudkivska;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was convicted by NORP courts in CARDINAL judgments of offences including robbery , theft , assault and dangerous assault . In DATE he was also found guilty of raping a woman he had followed from the street into her house on DATE of his release from prison . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment ; the court further ordered his placement in an institution for mentally disturbed offenders . The applicant was detained altogether for DATE , at times in an institution for mentally disturbed criminals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of sexual abuse of children , combined with attempted rape in CARDINAL case and with attempted sexual assault in another case , committed in DATE and DATE . It sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention pursuant to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . ORG found that the applicant , who had acted with full criminal responsibility , had sexually abused and attempted to sexually assault an DATE girl he had followed from the street into her home . He had further sexually abused and attempted to rape a DATE girl he had lured into the cellar of her house and had sexually abused another eightyear - old girl in a playground . ORG found that the applicant , whom the court - appointed experts had described as an egocentric anti - social personality lacking empathy , had a propensity to commit serious offences which considerably harm their victims physically or mentally .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE GPE , having regard to the applicant \u2019s conviction by the GPE ORG on DATE , decided to expel the applicant from NORP territory and prohibited him from ever re - entering GPE . The expulsion was to be enforced on the applicant \u2019s release from prison . The decision became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his full prison sentence until DATE . He was then placed in preventive detention , for the first time , on DATE , which was executed in a separate wing of FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the execution of the preventive detention order against the applicant ( Article CARDINALc \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It noted that in his reports dated DATE and DATE the psychiatric and neurologic expert , ORG , it had consulted had found that the applicant suffered from a dissocial personality disorder and had not wished to undergo a therapy addressing his sexual offences in prison for fear of being harassed by other detainees . He considered that the applicant should first undergo a social therapy in prison to test his readiness to change his personality and should then be admitted to a therapy for sexual offenders .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that unless the applicant had completed a therapy for sexual offenders , there was still a risk that he would commit further sexual offences if released . The court further refused to transfer the applicant to a psychiatric hospital ( Article DATE LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant \u2019s reintegration into society could currently best be furthered by a social therapy ; he was not , therefore , transferred to a psychiatric hospital for a sexual therapy .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently attempted to be admitted to a social therapeutic institution in a different prison , with the help of FAC authorities . However , on DATE the social therapeutic institution of Baden - PERSON refused to accept the applicant for treatment . It argued that in view of the enforceable expulsion order against him , it could not be guaranteed that the applicant could complete a DATE therapy in that institution . Likewise , on DATE FAC refused to admit the applicant to its social therapeutic department . It was argued that under the administrative rules relating to section CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , prisoners against whom an enforceable expulsion order had been made were excluded from transfer to a social therapeutic institution . Moreover , on DATE ORG equally refused to admit the applicant to a social therapy . It was argued that its department offered treatment for young sexual offenders and was therefore not suitable for the then DATE applicant .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , which was confirmed on appeal , ORG ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention . It found that there was a risk that the applicant , who still suffered from a dissocial personality disorder , would commit further sexual offences if released ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph DATE below ) . The court considered that the applicant had refused with good cause to participate in a psychoanalytical group therapy for sexual offenders in FAC . He had further made strenuous efforts , with the help of the prison authorities , to be admitted to a social therapy in a different prison , which had also been considered to be beneficial by the psychiatric expert A. heard by that court . However , he had not been allowed to take part in a social therapy in GPE because of his age and because he was a foreigner who was to be expelled from NORP territory . It should therefore be examined by the prosecution authorities whether he could be transferred to GPE for the continuation of his preventive detention and could be admitted to a social therapy there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ORG , whose decisions were confirmed on appeal , dismissed the applicant \u2019s repeated requests under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to dispense with the further execution of his prison sentence and his preventive detention in view of his expulsion from NORP territory . It argued that there was still a public interest in the further execution of the preventive detention order made against the applicant , who was likely to reoffend and was dangerous to the public . It was noted in these proceedings that the applicant had not taken up the authorities\u2019 proposal that he should request his transfer to GPE for the further execution of his preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG , having heard the applicant , his counsel and a psychiatric and psychotherapeutic expert , PERSON , ordered the further execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG agreed with the findings of expert PERSON who had taken the view that the applicant \u2019s dissocial personality had not changed and that there was still a risk that he would commit further violent sexual offences if released . In his report of CARDINAL DATE the expert had considered that a therapy should be attempted despite its limited chances of success because the applicant had repeatedly stated that he was willing to undergo therapy and because there were no other means to reduce his dangerousness . He had proposed that the applicant participate in a discussion group for sexual offenders in FAC DATE which the applicant had , however , refused as he did not wish his offences to become known within that prison . The expert had further proposed that the applicant be admitted to a social therapeutic institution \u2013 for instance in GPE , GPE or FAC or in that which was currently being built up in FAC itself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , it found that it was not to be expected that the applicant would not commit further offences on his release ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . It equally referred to the findings of expert PERSON , which it considered convincing . It noted , in particular , that the expert had considered that the applicant should first take part in a discussion group for sexual offenders in FAC ; however , the applicant had vigorously refused to do so . In view of this , the court considered that the applicant \u2019s continued preventive detention was proportionate .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further noted that the prosecution authority \u2019s refusal to dispense with a further execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention under Article CARDINALa of the Code of Criminal Procedure was not the subject - matter of the proceedings before it . It noted , however , that the applicant had not taken up the prosecution \u2019s proposal to make a ( necessary ) request for his transfer to GPE for the further execution of his preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He claimed that his right to liberty had been violated because his continued preventive detention , during which he had been refused any therapy in view of his impending expulsion , was disproportionate . Moreover , his continued preventive detention without a maximum duration , which had been abolished after his conviction ( Article CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with LAW to LAW , as amended in DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , breached the prohibition of retrospective punishment . The refusal to offer him any treatment because of the expulsion order against him also discriminated against him on account of his NORP nationality .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , which was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE , ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant complained that the prohibition of retrospective punishment under LAW had been breached , ORG found that his complaint was inadmissible . The applicant was not yet affected by the provisions of Article CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with LAW of LAW to LAW . The court further referred to its leading judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; application no . CARDINAL to ORG ) . Apart from that , the applicant \u2019s complaint was ill - founded as the impugned decisions of the courts dealing with the execution of sentences did not violate constitutional law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention to continue ( Article NORP \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . It noted that the applicant had not received any therapy . The applicant had confirmed this , stating that he had failed in his attempts to be admitted to a therapy in a different prison in view of his planned deportation . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the applicant \u2019s preventive detention was not to be declared terminated on completion of DATE in such detention ( DATE ) . Having consulted a psychiatric expert , ORG , it found that there was still a risk that the applicant would commit further serious sexual offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims if released ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . It noted that the applicant had refused therapies for sexual offenders or social therapeutic treatment which had since been made available in FAC . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE ORG for ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests to be transferred to GPE for the further execution of the preventive detention order against him as the applicant would have to be released there after having served DATE in such detention , that is , in DATE . The decisions became final .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , on CARDINAL May CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG , whose decisions were confirmed by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s fresh requests under LAW to dispense with the further execution of his prison sentence and his preventive detention in view of his expulsion from NORP territory . The latter decision was quashed on DATE by ORG , which argued that it appeared that the prosecution authorities had failed to take all aspects relevant to their decision into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE I Public Prosecutor \u2019s Office dispensed with the further execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention at the date of his expulsion from GPE under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from FAC and expelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG revoked the suspension on probation of the applicant \u2019s placement in an institution for mentally disturbed offenders ordered in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Since DATE the applicant has been detained in GPE .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) . The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows :", "CARDINAL . The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention ( a so - called measure of correction and prevention ) under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence ( a penalty ) , if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to DATE imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention , the court responsible for the execution of sentences ( that is , a special ORG composed of CARDINAL professional judges , see sections ORG and DATE ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) must review , before completion of the prison term , whether the person \u2019s preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective . If that is not the case , it suspends the execution of the preventive detention order and places the person on probation with supervision of the person \u2019s conduct which commences with the suspension .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs the duration of preventive detention . Paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , of that LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time , provides that if there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time - limit has not yet expired , the court shall suspend on probation the further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his release .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version in force prior to DATE , the first period of preventive detention may not exceed DATE . If the maximum duration has expired , the detainee shall be released ( Article QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW was amended by the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other LAW of DATE , which entered into force on DATE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , in its amended version , provides that if a person has spent DATE in preventive detention , the court shall declare the measure terminated ( only ) if there is no danger that the detainee will , owing to his criminal tendencies , commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims . Termination shall automatically entail supervision of the offender \u2019s conduct . The former maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention was abolished . Pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW to LAW , the amended version of Article CARDINAL CARDINAL of LAW was to be applied without any restriction ratione temporis .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , ORG may dispense with the execution of a prison sentence or a measure of correction and prevention if the convicted person is expelled from NORP territory . The execution of the sentence or measure may be continued if the expelled person returns to GPE territory ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that prisoners may be transferred to a socio - therapeutic institution with their consent if the special therapeutic measures and social aids of the institution are advisable for their rehabilitation . The transfer is conditional upon the consent of the head of the socio - therapeutic institution concerned .", "CARDINAL . Article DATE of the Criminal Code contains provisions on the transfer of detainees for the execution of a different measure of correction and prevention than the measure ordered in the judgment against them . Under Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL , read in conjunction with \u00a7 CARDINAL , of LAW , the court may subsequently transfer a perpetrator against whom preventive detention was ordered to a psychiatric hospital if the perpetrator \u2019s reintegration into society can be better promoted thereby .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the ORG preventive detention beyond the former DATE maximum period and also concerning the retrospective order for the ORG preventive detention ( file nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Reversing its previous position , ORG held that all provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective ordering of such detention were incompatible with LAW as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all the relevant provisions of LAW on the imposition and duration of preventive detention were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of persons in preventive detention . It found that those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment ( PERSON ) . These provisions included , in particular , LAW in its version in force since DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with LAW remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until DATE at the latest . The provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention which did not concern the retrospective ordering or prolongation of preventive detention could only continue to be applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality . As a general rule , proportionality was only observed where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious violent crimes or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG relied on the interpretation of LAW made by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ; see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ss . of ORG judgment ) . It stressed , in particular , that the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment and the principles laid down in LAW required an individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care to the persons concerned . In line with the ORG \u2019s findings in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi - disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution did not have prospects of success ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-a"]}
