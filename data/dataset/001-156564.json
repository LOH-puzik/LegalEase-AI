NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national of NORP ethnic origin , who was born in DATE and is presently detained in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON of ORG foundation and PERSON of the nongovernmental organisation Help a Man , who were succeeded by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the respondent Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The present case is a sequel to application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which had been submitted by the same applicant . The latter application was examined by the ORG jointly with application no . CARDINAL , which had been submitted by applicant Mr Anzor Chadidovich GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s decision on the admissibility of applications nos . ORG and ORG is referred to below in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and established by ORG in the context of applications nos . CARDINAL and ORG , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested by NORP border police on DATE , having no valid travel document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he applied for asylum in GPE . His request was ultimately dismissed , the final decision being given by ORG on DATE and becoming final on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c OPGRF \u201d ) applied for the applicant \u2019s extradition . The request was based on the fact that the applicant had been accused of several offences , namely banditry with aggravating circumstances and attempt on the life of officials of a law - enforcement agency . He was suspected of having participated , as a member of an organised group , in the killing of CARDINAL agents of ORG in ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The above letter and another letter from the OPGRF dated DATE indicated that the applicant would not be tried by ORG , would enjoy the guarantees of a fair trial including the assistance of counsel and that he would not be subjected to treatment contrary to LAW . As to the risk of the death penalty , the letters indicated that there was a moratorium on the death penalty in GPE , that the applicant would not face the death penalty if extradited and that , should the applicant be sentenced to death , the sentence would not be carried out . Reference was made to the fact that GPE had signed LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW and that under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW on GPE of DATE it had an obligation not to use the death penalty .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was placed in preliminary detention with effect from DATE . On DATE the ORG remanded him in custody pending extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE inadmissible , but ORG challenged that decision before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned the contested decision and held that the applicant \u2019s extradition was admissible . It established that the applicant had been involved , as a member of an organised group , in the killing of CARDINAL NORP servicemen in PERSON in DATE . That killing had taken place after the military conflict had ended and it was not therefore an exclusively political or military action within the meaning of the relevant provision of the NORP Code of Criminal Procedure , which prevented the extradition of foreigners in such cases . ORG further noted that GPE was a member ORG and that respect for human rights was permanently monitored .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG considered sufficient the guarantees offered by the OPGRF , which stated that the applicant would not face the death penalty and that such punishment was in any event not carried out in GPE , that he would not be tried by a ORG as well as the undertaking that ORG and CARDINAL of the ORG would be respected in his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He relied on LAW and referred to various reports on the situation in prisons in GPE . In particular , he invoked reports on treatment to which persons of NORP origin suspected of fighting against NORP authorities were subjected . He also invoked the fact that the death penalty had not been formally abolished in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint as being manifestly ill - founded . It relied on the reasoning of ORG which it considered relevant and sufficient from the point of view of protecting the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE addressed to the NORP authorities the OPGRF confirmed the guarantees previously given with regard to the applicant , including respect for his physical and psychological integrity . The letter indicated that , if he was convicted and given a prison sentence , the applicant would serve his sentence in a federal prison , where the Convention and the NORP Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners are taken into account . ORG to GPE would be informed of the place of the applicant \u2019s detention and NORP diplomatic representatives would be able to visit the applicant and speak to him without the presence of third persons . The applicant would be provided with sufficient medical care . It was guaranteed that capital punishment would not be applied in respect of the applicant . Finally , the OPGRF guaranteed that the applicant would not be prosecuted for his political views or because of his race , religion or nationality .", "CARDINAL . In applications nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL the applicants PERSON GPE and ORG complained , against a similar background , that their extradition to GPE would amount to a breach of their rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention and LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a Chamber of the Fourth Section of the ORG decided to join applications ORG . ORG and ORG and to declare them inadmissible . In view of the documents before it , it found nothing which could reasonably have given the NORP authorities grounds to doubt the credibility of the guarantees provided by the OPGRF during the decision - making process . Thus , the ORG accepted the conclusion reached by the domestic authorities , namely that the facts of the case did not disclose substantial grounds for believing that the applicants PERSON GPE and ORG , if extradited to GPE , faced a real and personal risk of torture or of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In view of additional information submitted by the newly appointed representatives of the applicants Mr Ibragimov and Mr GPE on DATE , the President of the Fourth Section decided to indicate to the respondent Government , under Rule CARDINAL of ORG , that the applicants should not be extradited to GPE in the context of the present application until DATE . On the last - mentioned date a Chamber of the Fourth Section extended the interim measure by indicating to the respondent Government that the applicants should not be extradited until further notice . It was considered appropriate that they should have the possibility of having their cases reviewed at domestic level with the benefit of the new material , and that they should not be extradited pending such review .", "CARDINAL . The new application of GPE and GPE was registered under no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and the case was later transferred to the Third Section of the ORG , following the re - composition of the ORG \u2019s sections on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a part of application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was declared inadmissible and its remainder was notified to the respondent Government .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the interim measure of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was lifted in so far as it concerned Mr GPE . Subsequently , the remainder of application no . DATE concerning him was reregistered under no . CARDINAL , and it was declared inadmissible on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant Mr Ibragimov filed a fresh asylum claim in GPE . He referred to the suffering which he had had to endure during the war in GPE and his state of health , and indicated that his relatives were being threatened . The applicant \u2019s arguments included those on which he relies in the context of the present application ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG discontinued the proceedings on that claim on DATE , finding that the applicant had submitted no relevant new information in relation to that already examined before . He then filed an administrative appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s administrative appeal and upheld the decision of ORG .", "The Minister \u2019s decision stated that there had been no substantive change in the applicant \u2019s situation which would justify departing from the previous decision on his earlier asylum claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the Minister \u2019s decision by way of an administrative - law action , arguing that the refusal of his asylum claim had been contrary to the law and that the administrative authorities had failed duly to take into account additional information and documents on which he had relied in his renewed claim .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the action and its judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE following the applicant \u2019s appeal . However , the latter judgment was quashed by ORG on DATE , following the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . After the quashing by ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , it became incumbent on the latter to determine anew the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which it did , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , by quashing it as well as the ministerial decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In turn , it then became incumbent on the Ministry to determine anew the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE discontinuing the proceedings on his new asylum claim , which it did on DATE , by quashing that decision and remitting the matter to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The reasons behind ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , as reflected in the subsequent quashing judgment of ORG of DATE and the quashing decision of ORG DATE , were that the authorities had failed to respond adequately to the new information and arguments submitted by the applicant , as a result of which their decisions lacked proper reasoning and manifested signs of arbitrariness , and this was contrary to the applicant \u2019s right to a fair hearing LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s new asylum claim is now pending at the administrative level .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE , the OPGRF had confirmed in a letter to the NORP authorities the validity of all guarantees previously offered . In particular , they submitted that , in the event of extradition , the applicant would not be submitted to treatment contrary to LAW and would benefit from a fair trial , and the OPGRF would directly supervise the observance of all such guarantees .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been suffering from stomach ulcers for DATE and has had psychological problems . While in prison in GPE , he was kept in solitary confinement for significant periods . In the course of DATE , in reply to letters from the applicant \u2019s representatives , the prison administration rebutted allegations that he had not been receiving appropriate medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had a fight on DATE with another detainee in the course of which the latter suffered physical injury . In a different context , on DATE , a prison officer accused the applicant of having attacked him . Criminal proceedings against the applicant in these CARDINAL matters appear to be still pending .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a press release of CARDINAL DATE indicating that the Minister of the ORG had stated , after a meeting of the ORG , that GPE must not be a place where persons facing prosecution for serious criminal actions in CARDINAL of the member ORG could move freely . The Minister further indicated that the applicant \u2019s case had been sufficiently examined by ORG , ORG and ORG . The press release indicated that the Minister had refused to speculate as to whether the applicants would be extradited .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that the criminal proceedings against him had been instituted in GPE on the basis of statements by PERSON which had been extracted under torture . In that regard Mr PERSON has a pending application before the ORG against GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant also referred to the cases of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . PERSON , for his part , had an application before the ORG against GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , which was declared inadmissible on CARDINAL DATE . Nevertheless , in DATE , he was granted asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Further circumstances of these individuals are described in the ORG \u2019s partial decision of CARDINAL DATE on the admissibility of the present application ( see paragraphs CARDINAL of that decision ) .", "CARDINAL . Other facts and documents referred to by the applicant are described in paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s partial decision of CARDINAL DATE on the admissibility of the present application .", "CARDINAL . In the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG declared inadmissible application by PERSON , which had been submitted together with the present application , and which rested on identical or similar facts and allegations as the present application . The relevant part of the ORG \u2019s decision reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The documents before the ORG indicate that in the proceedings on his renewed asylum request [ Mr PERSON ] withdrew his action by which he had sought a review of the administrative authorities\u2019 decisions . On that ground ORG discontinued the proceedings without addressing the merits of the case ...", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , as regards applications against GPE , a complaint under LAW of the LAW has been generally considered as an effective remedy in respect of alleged breaches of the LAW which the applicants have been required to use after having had recourse to other domestic remedies available ...", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , the ORG considers that [ Mr PERSON ] has failed to use the remedies available in GPE as required by LAW . Therefore , the subsidiary role of the Convention mechanism ... prevents the ORG from dealing with the application . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , Mr PERSON was extradited to GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to a report of DATE submitted by the respondent Government , representatives of ORG to GPE carried out an official monitoring visit of Mr PERSON in ORG in GPE on DATE . The visit took place without the presence of the NORP party . Mr PERSON submitted that he had been placed in the PERSON detention centre in DATE . Of his free will and without any compulsion , he confirmed that during his detention he had not been subjected to any mistreatment and had had no complaint about the conditions of his detention . According to the report , PERSON appeared to be in good health and had displayed no signs of any mistreatment . The conditions of his detention had been inspected and found adequate . It was concluded that the guarantees of the OPGRF in relation to the treatment of Mr PERSON were actually observed and there was no reason to question them .", "CARDINAL . A number of relevant international instruments and reports concerning the situation in GPE , and GPE in general , are summarised , for example , in the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of PERSON GPE ( no .
