At TIME , when his detention was authorised , the arresting officer , Police Sergeant ( \u201c ORG MacLoughlan , remarked in a witness statement that PERSON was compliant and calm .", "In a witness statement dated DATE provided by PERSON , PERSON solicitor at the relevant time , he said that he had attended PERSON at FAC at TIME on DATE . PERSON confided in him that he was a heroin user and was just beginning to experience withdrawal symptoms . Mr PERSON asked if he wanted to see a police surgeon and explained to him that the practice of local police surgeons was to prescribe the drug temazepam for withdrawal symptoms . He added that numerous clients of his who had been in the same predicament had told him that temazepam did very little to relieve their discomfort and distress . He further explained that any contact that ORG had with the police surgeon would not be confidential , as the surgeon would make an immediate written report on his custody record . He offered the advice that , if the custody sergeant became aware that PERSON was a heroin user , and that he was unemployed , that would greatly reduce his chances of obtaining bail either from the police or , subsequently , from the court . After some discussion PERSON told PERSON that he had decided not to call the police surgeon at that time . Mr PERSON described PERSON as being unhappy and apprehensive about spending a night in police custody . However , he presented himself as rational and articulate .", "PERSON was charged with the offences of dangerous driving , driving whilst disqualified , and driving without insurance or an ORG ( a road worthiness certificate ) at TIME on DATE , at which time police bail was refused .", "At TIME on DATE PERSON detention was reviewed . At that time he asked to see a doctor for a \u201c personal reason \u201d . ORG , the custody officer , noted on the custody record that he advised PERSON that he would arrange for a surgeon to see him at the ORG cells , to where he was shortly due to be transferred . At TIME PERSON noted the following on the custody record :", "\u201c Conferred with police surgeon \u2013 PERSON . Problem is not an emergency . ( DP [ Detained Person ] has stated it is a problem seeing doctor in prison \u2013 where he believes he will be going - and wishes to see CARDINAL before his departure for prison ) . Issue to be handed over to ORG CARDINAL [ a private security company that , pursuant to statutory provisions , provides escort and custody services under a contract with ORG ] who will call a doctor themselves . \u201d", "According to a statement made by ORG on DATE , PERSON seemed satisfied with the above arrangement . PERSON explained that , at the time of requesting to see a doctor , PERSON stated that he would have waited until he got to prison , but that as it was difficult to see a doctor there he preferred to see one before he got there . It was for that reason that PERSON , in consultation with the police surgeon , PERSON , concluded that the matter was not an emergency .", "PERSON recalled in a witness statement that he was telephoned by ORG at TIME and told that ORG had a personal problem that he wanted to discuss with a doctor and thought that if the court sent him to prison it would be harder for him to talk to CARDINAL of the prison doctors about it . He was further told that , while PERSON had been in custody , he had acted at all times in a normal fashion , showing no particular signs of physical or mental distress . Based on that information , PERSON formed the opinion that medical attention was not urgently required and that PERSON could be transferred into the care of ORG CARDINAL as arranged , ensuring that the DATE \u2019s court proceedings were not delayed . PERSON asked PERSON to inform ORG request to see a doctor and left it with them to call him from ORG later on if he was still required .", "ORG commented that , while PERSON was in his custody , he neither proved to be any problem nor exhibited any visible signs that he had any medical problems , was calm throughout and seemed quite resigned to the fact that he was going to go to prison . PERSON proceeded to tell both the civilian detention officer , PERSON , and the gaoler , PC PERSON , that PERSON CARDINAL should be informed that PERSON wanted to see a doctor .", "At CARDINAL a.m. Stuart Gipp was handed over to Group CARDINAL custody in order to be transported to court .", "According to the witness statement of PERSON of DATE , at the time of his hand - over , PERSON explained to the ORG CARDINAL officers that PERSON wished to see the police surgeon on a personal matter the nature of which he would not reveal , that PERSON had been contacted by ORG and that ORG should contact the doctor from the court cells to come out to see PERSON .", "PERSON found PERSON request to see a doctor on a personal matter , without revealing what it was , to be very unusual and a factor which he specifically remembered . He also remembered making a flippant comment to CARDINAL of the ORG CARDINAL staff that it was unlikely that they would call out the police surgeon . This resulted from his understanding from other prisoners that Group CARDINAL was reluctant to call out doctors for any matter , by reason of the cost of so doing . Group CARDINAL , a private company , was responsible for the costs of the visit of a doctor . The Group CARDINAL member of staff replied that it was unlikely that a doctor would be called .", "At TIME Stuart Gipp arrived at ORG .", "Some time TIME ( recorded in the report carried out by the Prisoner Escort and ORG ( \u201c PECS \u201d ) , a division of ORG , as being at TIME , but possibly later in the light of the evidence in the witness statement of PERSON set out below ) , PERSON asked ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) PERSON whether he could see a doctor . According to his interview with the ORG investigators on CARDINAL DATE , ORG asked ORG to tell him what the problem was . PERSON did not do so , but just kept saying that he wanted to see a doctor . ORG explained that it was LAW policy that a doctor would not be called unless there was something specific to report . As he had only worked for Group CARDINAL for a fairly short time , ORG called PCO Stevens over to speak to ORG .", "In his interview with the ORG investigators on DATE , ORG PERSON stated that he asked PERSON a few questions . On not getting any response , he went into the cell , put his arm around PERSON and asked him what was wrong . He replied that he was a drug user and did not want anyone to know . PERSON continued to talk to ORG for a short while , after which the latter appeared to perk up a little . PERSON stated that he reported the facts to Senior Custody Officer ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) PERSON , who said that she would try to get his case in front of the court as soon as possible . PERSON reported this back to PERSON who appeared to him to be quite happy .", "ORG PERSON denied that ORG had mentioned to him ORG request to see a doctor on that occasion . However , ORG PERSON stated that he reported both PERSON initial request to see a doctor , which had been passed on to him by the police TIME , and the fact that he was a drug user to PERSON . He stated that he did not enter these facts on ORG Prisoner Escort Record ( \u201c PER \u201d ) . He further revealed that , as a drug user , he was concerned about PERSON health , but that he was not concerned about his safety . He added that ORG did not show any signs of being physically unwell and was quite chatty after PERSON had spoken with him .", "In her interview with the ORG investigators , PERSON denied that she was made aware at any time prior to TIME on DATE that ORG had asked to see a doctor or that she was ever told that he was a drug user .", "At TIME the community psychiatric nurse arrived at the cells . According to PERSON in her interview with the ORG investigators , such nurses usually saw any prisoner that they had not seen before , but that was a matter left to their discretion . Group CARDINAL staff only referred a prisoner to the nurse if they had a serious concern about a prisoner or if they had been asked to do so by a solicitor . PERSON was neither seen by nor referred to the nurse .", "At TIME on DATE Mr PERSON attended again on PERSON , in the ORG cells . In his witness statement , Mr PERSON stated that , at that time , PERSON appeared rather unwell but not dramatically so . Mr PERSON suggested that the time had now arrived for PERSON to ask the Group CARDINAL custody officers to call a doctor . He explained that the findings of the doctor were unlikely to be relayed to the prosecutor , the court clerk or the magistrates and that a doctor \u2019s visit was unlikely at that stage to prejudice his chances of being granted bail . During that attendance , PERSON stated that PERSON was calm , rational and responsive . He stated that there was nothing unusual about his behaviour and responses . He was clearly worried about the possibility of being remanded in custody . He further stated that he would think about calling a doctor : CARDINAL of the factors weighing upon him was that he did not want his mother to know that he was dependent on heroin . However , PERSON told the ORG investigators that during this visit PERSON told him that he had already requested to see a doctor , but that he had not yet been seen .", "PERSON did not express any concerns about the well - being of PERSON to his custodians at the conclusion of his legal visit at TIME Thereafter , PERSON cell was checked , as was normal , he made a visit to the toilet and he was provided with lunch .", "At CARDINAL p.m. Stuart Gipp was produced in court , where an application for bail was made . The magistrates retired for TIME and refused the application . PERSON was remanded in custody to ORG ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) for DATE . In a statement by PERSON , the ORG clerk , he recalled that at no time during the court hearing was anything said on ORG behalf to indicate that he was distressed .", "The Group CARDINAL officer who accompanied PERSON to his court appearance , PERSON , told the ORG investigators that , on the way to court , he was talking to her without any apparent problem and that during the hearing itself he appeared calm and behaved normally . At the time at which the magistrates retired to consider their decision , PERSON talked and joked with her . She described him as fine , good - natured and conversational during this period . Once the magistrates announced that he was to be remanded at ORG she described his reaction as follows :", "\u201c Almost instantly his demeanour changed in the dock . He became unresponsive , shut down and went quiet . He was not emotional at all and did n\u2019t cry , shout or anything of that kind . He was told to go with the officer as is usual and I went to put the cuff on him and he pulled his arm away , resisting me . I spoke to him kindly and said \u2018 come on , let \u2019s get you ORG . He then let me put the cuff on . As we reached the dock door he wiggled the cuff on his wrist but did n\u2019t really try to get it off ... I was talking to him all the time but he did n\u2019t respond to me . He did n\u2019t pull or refuse to come with me , he was just quiet ... His reaction was not unusual and did n\u2019t alarm me more than usual . \u201d", "The change in ORG demeanour was not noted on the PER form .", "PERSON , ORG brother , made a statement after the death in which he described PERSON demeanour in court DATE differently . He stated that he was at the back of the court when PERSON came in and that he appeared upset and looked as if he had been crying and that he put his head down in court and started to cry . He also stated that PERSON \u201c screamed and screamed \u201d as he went down the corridor with the ORG officer after the hearing . He added that ORG had never wanted to talk about his experiences at GPE the previous time that he was there and that CARDINAL of ORG friends had said that he had said that he would kill himself if he had to go back to PERSON .", "According to the entries on the ORG form , PERSON was returned to his cell at TIME and Mr PERSON visited him there at TIME PCO Cannon went to open ORG cell door to allow PERSON to conduct his legal visit . She saw PERSON with his head in his hands . She informed him that his solicitor had come to see him . He did not respond , but just walked into the interview room without saying anything . In his witness statement , Mr PERSON described that visit . Upon being asked by PERSON , Stuart Gipp stated that he had asked to see a doctor some time previously but that he had not been seen by one . Mr PERSON observed that PERSON was very unhappy about the decision of the court and stated that he would not be able to stand it . He referred generally to difficulties he had experienced when he was previously at ORG , but did not want to discuss these further . Mr PERSON described the ensuing conversation as follows :", "\u201c I told PERSON that in DATE time we could make another bail application . If that failed we could ask a Judge in ORG for bail . At that point he said : \u2018 I may not be ORG . I asked him what he meant and he said that he might kill himself . I took this seriously because although he said it in a tone that appeared to lack conviction , he had his head deeply bowed throughout this conversation except when he was smoking a cigarette . He seemed to feel defeated . \u201d", "According to the timings on the PER form , the legal visit concluded at TIME At TIME , Mr PERSON informed PERSON that ORG had requested to see a doctor . PERSON stated that she was unaware of that request . She further explained that no doctor was available at that time as she had been trying to get one to attend another detainee since TIME without success . PERSON also mentioned that PERSON was threatening to take his own life . PERSON noted on the PER form that he may try to harm himself and , at TIME , initiated a self - harm form FCARDINALSH as a result . At TIME , ORG went to check PERSON cell . Having initially not been able to see PERSON , PERSON re - checked the cell . As she opened the outer gate , she found PERSON hanging from his shoe - laces from the bolt hole of the open hatch on his cell door .", "PERSON was cut down and attempts were made to resuscitate him . An ambulance was called , paramedics and police arrived to assist and ORG was transported to ORG , GPE . It was there that he subsequently died .", "CARDINAL PER forms were created in respect of ORG . According to the Government , the second form was created after PERSON had hanged himself , but before he died .

All Group CARDINAL staff who gave evidence at the inquest were either uncertain as to whether the memorandum had been brought to their attention prior to PERSON hanging , or adamant that it had not been . They were further unclear what training , if any , they had received on the suicide risks of open cell hatches .

ORG held that suicide was not a foreseeable risk in relation to every prisoner and that the obligation to take reasonable care to prevent a prisoner from taking his own life deliberately only arose where the custodian knew or ought to have known that the individual prisoner presented a suicide risk . It further held that the increased risk of suicide amongst prisoners gave rise to an obligation , within the general duty of care of the custodian for the health and safety of the prisoner , to take reasonable steps to identify whether or not a prisoner presented a suicide risk . As , on the facts , the police had been justified in concluding that the deceased was not a suicide risk , no duty of care was owed to him to prevent him from taking his own life and therefore it was not a breach of any duty to permit the deceased to retain his belt or to have placed the deceased in a cell in which the gate on the door , from which the deceased had hanged himself using his belt as a ligature , did not comply with recommendations contained in ORG circulars .
