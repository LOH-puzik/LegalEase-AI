SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["A.", "On DATE the applicant claimed , pursuant to LAW ( see \" Relevant domestic law \" below ) , restitution of real property . He alleged that he had been forced , in DATE , to sell the property to the ORG under conditions that had been imposed on him .", "On DATE ORG Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad - \" FAC \" ) granted the applicant 's claim . It noted that the applicant had been threatened with expropriation should he refuse to sell the property in question . ORG found that the purchase price had been determined by an expert of the company which had been in charge of carrying out the purchase on behalf of the ORG . It was not clear from the expert 's opinion whether he had considered all the relevant facts when determining the price . ORG therefore considered that the applicant was entitled to restitution of the property pursuant to LAW para . CARDINAL ( g ) of LAW .", "On DATE the ORG branch office of ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad GPE - pobo\u010dka v Nitre - \" ORG \" ) granted the appeal lodged by the defendant authority and dismissed the applicant 's claim . ORG noted that the DATE sale contract had been drafted and signed in accordance with the law , and that the applicant had been paid the purchase price as determined by an expert .", "ORG further established that the ORG had purchased the applicant 's real property in order to use it as a building site in the context of construction , on adjacent plots , of a heat pipe - line . After the construction had been completed , the land originally owned by the applicant was used as a parking place .", "Finally , ORG noted that beside the price for his property the applicant had also been granted , in DATE , a flat in GPE which had been put at the disposal of his son , and that in the relevant documents the applicant had not mentioned that he had disagreed with the sale of his property . In ORG view , the applicant had not shown that the requirements laid down in Section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( g ) of LAW were met in his case .", "On DATE the applicant complained to the president of ORG that at the hearing held on DATE he had not been allowed to submit orally all facts concerning his case , that the chamber president had put irrelevant questions to him and his wife , and that there had been delays in the service of ORG judgment .", "On DATE the president of ORG informed the applicant that there was nothing to show that the chamber president dealing with his case had lacked impartiality or had otherwise infringed the applicant 's right to a fair hearing . The president of ORG further stated that the written version of the judgment of DATE had been submitted for distribution on DATE , and admitted that there had been a delay of DATE in its drafting .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) against ORG judgment of DATE . He alleged that he had been obliged to sell the property under threat of expropriation , possibly without any compensation . The applicant had also been warned that criminal proceedings could be brought against him should he incite other owners not to sell their property .", "The applicant further challenged the sale contract and the expert opinion , mainly because the expert determining the purchase price had not taken into consideration a part of the property which originally had been used as a bakery . He alleged that he had only obtained the contract and the expert opinion in DATE and in DATE respectively .", "On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) quashed ORG judgment of DATE . It found that ORG had failed to specify correctly the defendant authority and to establish the relevant facts with sufficient certainty .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE .", "On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that ORG judgment on his appeal on points of law had not yet been served on him .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant 's claim again . It established that the applicant could not check whether the purchase price was correct as he had been provided , prior to the sale of his house , neither with the relevant expert opinion nor with the sale contract . ORG further found that the applicant had been informed by representatives of the competent authority that , should he not be willing to sell the property , it could be expropriated , with or without compensation .", "ORG found that prior to the sale the applicant had invested into the property . In its view , it was therefore unlikely that the applicant had been genuinely willing to sell the property . ORG held that the conditions of the sale were obviously disadvantageous for the applicant since the expert had failed to take into account , when establishing the value of the property , the premises of a former bakery which had formed a part of the property , and also the fact that a part of the property had been re - built in DATE and in DATE respectively . ORG", "On DATE ORG granted the defendant 's appeal and dismissed the applicant 's claim . It found , after having taken further evidence , that the applicant had not concluded the contract under duress on strikingly unfavourable conditions within the meaning of Section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( g ) of LAW .", "ORG held , in particular , that immediately after the sale the applicant had moved to a new house which he had built . Furthermore , the applicant had arranged for an apartment , which had been granted to him in connection with the sale of the property in question , to be put at the disposal of his son in exchange for a smaller apartment used by the latter .", "ORG further recalled that the possibility of expropriation of the property had been provided for by the law and considered that its mentioning , by the representatives of the competent authority , could not be regarded as a threat . ORG admitted that , as a result of the failure to provide him with the sale contract in advance , the applicant had been placed at a disadvantage . ORG recalled , however , that the applicant had signed the contract and found no evidence showing that he had done so under duress .", "As to the applicant 's allegations concerning the conditions of the sale , ORG noted that the applicant had received CARDINAL NORP crowns for the property notwithstanding that the expert had evaluated it at CARDINAL crowns . It held , however , that only a price considerably below the value determined by an expert could be considered as imposing strikingly unfavourable conditions .", "ORG further examined in detail the way in which the expert had determined the value of the applicant 's property . It found , with reference to the relevant price regulations , that even if the bakery invoked by the applicant had actually formed a part of the property , the latter would have fallen under a different category for which a lower compensation had been foreseen . ORG therefore found that the expert 's omission to mention the bakery in his opinion was to the applicant 's advantage .", "ORG also recalled that the sale of the property had permitted the applicant to improve the living conditions of his son and concluded that the sale in question had not been carried out under conditions that were strikingly unfavourable for the applicant .", "Finally , ORG referred to Section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW and held that , in any event , the property claimed by the applicant could not be restored since a heat pipe - line had been built on it .", "The judge who , in the applicant 's view , had lacked impartiality in the proceedings leading to ORG judgment of DATE was not involved in the delivery of the aforesaid court 's judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . He claimed that there was no need for him to prove that he had acted under duress as it was generally known that under the communist regime the representatives of public authorities had commonly used threats and had acted arbitrarily , and that the prices for real property foreseen by the relevant regulations had been disproportionately low .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law . It held that the obligation to restore the property could not be deduced generally from the then existing law or economic conditions , and that it was for the applicant to show that the requirements laid down in Section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( g ) of LAW were met in his particular case .", "ORG found that the Regional had established all relevant facts of the case and had correctly assessed the evidence before it . In particular , ORG held that ORG had given detailed and correct reasons for its judgment and noted that in his appeal on points of law the applicant had not challenged , as such , ORG reasoning as regards the particular circumstances under which the contract had been concluded .", "ORG judgment was served on the applicant in DATE .", "", "B. Relevant domestic law", "LAW ( Z\u00e1kon o mimos\u00fadnych rehabilit\u00e1ci\u00e1ch ) of DATE , as amended , has for its aim to redress certain infringements of property and social rights which occurred DATE .", "Section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( g ) of the LAW provides for restitution of objects which were transferred to the ORG on the basis of a sale contract concluded under duress on strikingly unfavourable conditions .", "Section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW provides that plots which were built up after their transfer to the State are not liable to restitution ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
