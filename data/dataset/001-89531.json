The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . In DATE he participated as a sprinter in the Olympic Games and from DATE , he was the president of ORG Homburg , a football club playing in ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was the sole shareholder and sole managing director of the ORG investment trust corporation , which arranged the sale of apartments .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , which reached the applicant on DATE , the GPE police headquarters summoned the applicant to question him on charges of fraud in relation with his business activities for the ORG corporation . Thereby the applicant obtained knowledge of the criminal investigations instituted against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE ORG joined several different sets of proceedings concerning charges of fraud against the applicant , which had partly been transferred to it by other ORG ( no . CARDINAL Js CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , court orders issued in DATE and DATE , authorising the search of the applicant \u2019s home , those of CARDINAL co - defendants , of the companies led by them and of numerous banks in GPE , were executed and many documents seized .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the police submitted to ORG an evaluation of the documents seized and the statements of numerous witnesses who had been heard by way of a mailed questionnaire .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE further search orders , inter alia against the applicant and his company , were executed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE police headquarters , having heard ten witnesses since DATE , sent back the files to ORG with a summary note on the results of their investigations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having questioned the applicant twice and following unsuccessful negotiations with the defence with a view to discontinuing the proceedings under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , preferred an indictment ( running to CARDINAL pages ) against the applicant with ORG . It charged the applicant , who was represented by counsel , with CARDINAL cases of aggravated fraud and attempted fraud , committed together with his co - defendants PERSON and NORP between DATE and DATE . The applicant , acting as the ORG corporation \u2019s managing director , was accused of having incited investors to buy apartments at a price far above their market value . According to the indictment , the applicant had obtained the investors\u2019 consent to buy the apartments by misleading them about their true value and by orally undertaking , in particular , to repurchase the apartments after DATE at the ORG request , a guarantee which he never intended to keep .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened the main proceedings in respect of CARDINAL charges of aggravated fraud and attempted fraud against the applicant , who was represented by defence counsel throughout the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE and on DATE the president of the chamber of ORG noted that due to CARDINAL other sets of proceedings pending before ORG which had to be granted priority as the defendants concerned were in custody , it was not possible to fix dates for the hearing in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered CARDINAL experts to submit reports on the market value of CARDINAL apartments at the time they were bought by the investors . The expert reports were submitted to ORG between DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE and on DATE , DATE and DATE the president of the chamber of ORG noted that due to hearings in other proceedings which were granted priority as the defendants concerned were in custody , in particular the hearings in the proceedings against PERSON and others , against ORG . , it was not possible to fix dates for the hearing in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the proceedings against him be discontinued on account of their excessive length , if necessary after he had complied with a condition for discontinuance , pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . As proposed by ORG , the applicant and ORG subsequently entered into negotiations about discontinuing the proceedings in exchange for the payment of a sum of money ( see LAW , paragraph CARDINAL below ) which lasted until DATE . However , they were unable to reach agreement .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE ORG held CARDINAL hearings in which it questioned QUANTITY witnesses and CARDINAL experts . It stressed that in its view , the case appeared to be suitable for discontinuance in accordance with LAW , but the prosecution and the defence were unable to reach a settlement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the proceedings be discontinued pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) because their excessive length was an impediment to the proceedings ( NORP ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having heard the parties , discontinued the proceedings pursuant to LAW . It ordered the ORG to bear the costs of the proceedings and the applicant \u2019s necessary expenses pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court found that the length of the proceedings constituted a procedural impediment to their continuation , as proceeding with them would breach LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that it would not be possible to deliver a judgment in due course and before all offences became time - barred in DATE . It was unclear at that stage of the proceedings whether the applicant would have to be convicted or acquitted . Even assuming that the applicant was found guilty of fraud , his guilt could not be considered serious , notably because the investors who had bought the apartments had in fact received the tax benefits they had sought by their investment .", "CARDINAL . ORG \u2019s notification thereof and their further expected duration was excessive and violated the right to a hearing within a reasonable time as guaranteed by LAW , read in conjunction with the rule of law , and LAW . This warranted the discontinuance of the proceedings . The duration of the proceedings , which had lasted for CARDINAL and a half years , had been caused by structural problems at ORG and ORG , which were understaffed . The applicant had not caused any delays in the proceedings . The proceedings were quite complex , but this did not sufficiently explain their length . The ongoing proceedings imposed a burden on the applicant because there had been several , partly polemical , press articles about the case , so that his business activities kept being adversely affected .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that it was not possible to take into consideration the excessive duration of the proceedings when fixing the applicant \u2019s sentence , as this presupposed his conviction . The applicant could , however , no longer be convicted , as continuing the proceedings would breach LAW . Moreover , if the proceedings resulted in the applicant being acquitted , it would likewise be impossible to consider the length of the proceedings when fixing the sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , allowing the appeal on points of law lodged by ORG , quashed the judgment of ORG and remitted the case to ORG . It found that it was not in a position fully to examine whether there was in fact a procedural impediment to the continuation of the proceedings for failure to comply with the reasonable time requirement .", "CARDINAL . Having heard the parties at an oral hearing , ORG stated that in very exceptional circumstances a violation of LAW , taken in conjunction with the rule of law , could lead to an impediment to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG there had been a violation of LAW in the present case . The length of the investigation and court proceedings , which was attributable to the organisation within the judiciary , had been excessive , and the applicant had no responsibility for it . However , ORG had failed sufficiently to ascertain the extent of the applicant \u2019s guilt . Without that knowledge , it was impossible for ORG to assess whether the violation of LAW was so severe that it could neither be compensated when fixing the sentence nor by discontinuing the proceedings pursuant to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) and consequently was a procedural impediment to continuing the proceedings . Having regard to the contents of the case file and assuming the speedy processing of the case by ORG , it still appeared possible to take into consideration the violation of LAW when fixing the sentence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against this judgment ( see CARDINAL . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held forty - three hearings , acquitted the applicant . It ordered that the ORG bear the costs of the proceedings and the applicant \u2019s necessary expenses pursuant to LAW . It further held that the applicant was entitled to compensation for damage caused by the searches of his home and the seizure of his property pursuant to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Having heard CARDINAL witnesses , ORG found that the applicant was not guilty of fraud , because he had not misled or caused his staff to mislead the purchasers of apartments about their true value or by giving a binding guarantee to repurchase the apartments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment became final , ORG having withdrawn its appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a complaint with ORG against the judgment of ORG . He argued in particular that remitting the case to ORG and continuing the proceedings despite the fact that his right to be heard within a reasonable time had been disregarded throughout the proceedings further violated his right to a fair trial . Following the judgment of ORG , he further submitted that he had suffered pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage caused by the excessive length of the criminal proceedings against him despite his acquittal . NORP law did not provide for adequate compensation for this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having stayed the proceedings between DATE and DATE at the applicant \u2019s request awaiting the outcome of the proceedings in the criminal courts , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It argued that the complaint was inadmissible because following his acquittal , the applicant no longer had a legitimate interest in a finding that the judgment of ORG had violated his rights guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant was no longer prejudiced by the judgment delivered by ORG as the criminal proceedings against him had been terminated by his final acquittal . Assuming that the constitutional complaint would be well - founded , the violation of fundamental rights caused by the judgment of ORG would not have severe consequences for the applicant . His basic rights had notably been breached by the duration of the proceedings until the judgment of ORG . Following this judgment , the criminal proceedings had lasted for DATE , but had ended with his acquittal and therefore his rehabilitation . Moreover , ORG had clearly stated in its judgment that the duration of the criminal proceedings against the applicant had breached LAW . For lack of a sufficient statement of facts by ORG , that court had only found itself not to be in a position to draw the legal conclusion that there was a procedural impediment to continuing the proceedings , even though it acknowledged for the first time that this was a possible result of a breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure governs the discontinuance of criminal investigation or court proceedings on grounds of insignificance . According to that provision , criminal proceedings may be discontinued if they concern an offence for which it is not mandatory to impose a sentence of DATE imprisonment ( PERSON ) , if the defendant \u2019s guilt would be of a minor nature and if there was no public interest in criminal prosecution . If the indictment has already been preferred , the court may only discontinue the proceedings with the consent of both ORG and the defendant ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , ORG may discontinue criminal proceedings concerning offences for which the regular minimum punishment is DATE imprisonment at the investigation stage with the defendant \u2019s consent , if the latter complies with certain conditions . These conditions must be suitable to remove the public interest in criminal prosecution and may not be in conflict with the severity of the defendant \u2019s guilt . Such conditions notably entail the payment of a sum of money to a non - profit - making organisation or to the ORG . The court which has jurisdiction to open the main proceedings must consent under certain circumstances . If the indictment has already been preferred with that court , the latter may discontinue the proceedings under the conditions set out in \u00a7 CARDINAL with the consent of both ORG and the defendant ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the discontinuance of the proceedings shall be pronounced in a judgment if there is a procedural impediment to the continuation of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW the costs of the criminal proceedings and the defendant \u2019s necessary expenses shall be borne by the ORG if the defendant is acquitted , if the court refuses to open the main proceedings against him or if the proceedings against him are discontinued . According to LAW of the said Code , the court may decline to award the defendant \u2019s necessary expenses against the ORG where the defendant has avoided conviction merely because of an impediment to the proceedings ( NORP ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that the necessary expenses of a participant in the proceedings shall also comprise compensation for an inevitable loss of time in accordance with the provisions on compensation of witnesses ( no . CARDINAL ) and the fees and expenses of a lawyer in so far as these are to be reimbursed under LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) . LAW and Experts ( ORG \u00fcber die Entsch\u00e4digung PERSON ) , in its version in force DATE and CARDINAL June CARDINAL , on the compensation payable to witnesses for their loss of earnings , stipulates in paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , that TIME of lost working time shall be compensated at a rate of CARDINAL to thirteen euros ( ORG ) . LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time , stipulates in particular that the fees and expenses of the lawyer of the successful party as fixed by law shall be reimbursed . Before CARDINAL July CARDINAL , the fees and expenses payable to a lawyer were fixed in ORG on Lawyers\u2019 Fees ( PERSON - ordnung \u2013 BRAGO ) . Lawyer and client could , however , agree on a higher remuneration than that payable under LAW ( see its section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Compensation for damage caused by wrongful prosecution is covered by LAW ( PERSON \u00fcber die PERSON f\u00fcr Strafverfolgungsma\u00dfnahmen ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of that Act , a defendant is notably entitled to compensation for damage incurred by certain specified measures of criminal prosecution if he is acquitted , if the proceedings against him are discontinued or if the court refuses to open the main proceedings against him . The measures of criminal prosecution for which compensation may be granted notably comprise pre - trial detention and searches and seizures of property .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act on Compensation for Measures of Criminal Prosecution stipulates that pecuniary damage incurred as a result of the criminal prosecution measure is compensated for , as well as non - pecuniary damage in the event of a deprivation of liberty by a court decision . Once the finding that the ORG is under a duty to compensate has become final , the compensation claim must be submitted within DATE with ORG which last was in charge of the investigations at first instance ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the said Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , taken in conjunction with LAW , an individual has the right to be compensated by the ORG for any damage arising from a breach of official duty committed by a public servant . These provisions are also applicable to a breach of duty in giving judgment on an action if the breach consists in a refusal to discharge a function or a delay in performing it contrary to professional duty .", "CARDINAL . Damages are afforded to the individual concerned in accordance with Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW . By LAW , in the version in force until DATE , compensation for non - pecuniary damage could be awarded only if it was provided for by law . In this connection , LAW , which was in force until DATE , provided for non - pecuniary compensation only in the event of physical injury , damage caused to someone \u2019s health or deprivation of liberty . The new LAW , as in force since CARDINAL DATE , which replaced LAW , has not introduced any amendments relevant to the matters in issue in the instant case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
