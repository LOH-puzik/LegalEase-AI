ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is at present detained in FAC , GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of criminal proceedings concerning an arms trafficking charge , the PERSON preliminary investigations judge set down the preliminary hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he ordered the notice of the date of the hearing , translated into NORP and accompanied by an invitation to appoint a legal representative , to be served by post on the accused , a NORP national living in GPE named ORG , who was born in GPE on DATE . The reply slip acknowledging receipt of the notice reached ORG registry bearing a signature which , according to the applicant , was not his . He asserted that there was a difference between that signature and the one in his passport . Moreover , the forename of the signatory was \u201c Thamas \u201d and not \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As the defendant did not appear at the preliminary hearing , he was declared to be wilfully seeking to evade trial ( contumace ) and the court appointed a lawyer , PERSON , to assist him . From that point on , all notifications of procedural steps were served on PERSON", "CARDINAL . PERSON did not plead the nullity of the notice of the date of the preliminary hearing . An order was then made committing Thamas Somogyi for trial .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG sentenced the accused to DATE imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was grounded on statements made by certain persons facing charges in related proceedings , particularly a PERSON and the PERSON brothers , corroborated by other evidence . The text of the judgment did not indicate whether the persons in question had recognised the applicant on a photograph or if they had identified him in their statements purely on the basis of his name or personal information they had about him . ORG merely said that the applicant had been \u201c recognised and identified \u201d . It further observed that , in view of the gravity of the offences he was charged with and the fact that he had constantly refused to give his version of the facts , he could not be granted the benefit of any extenuating circumstance .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of DATE was served on PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having noted that the judgment of DATE had become final , ordered the arrest of Mr Thamas Somogyi .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police arrested the applicant ( PERSON , born in GPE on DATE ) and notified the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities opened an investigation which led to the finding that the person convicted on DATE was in fact the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ordered that the judgment of DATE be rectified by insertion of the applicant 's forename and his date and place of birth in place of the information originally recorded . That decision was served on PERSON", "CARDINAL . The applicant was then extradited from GPE to GPE , where he was deprived of his liberty in execution of the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On a date which has not been specified he applied to ORG under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , asking it to reopen the time allowed for an appeal ( istanza di rimessione in termini ) . He contended that the judgment of DATE was invalid because the summons was null and void , submitting the following arguments :", "( a ) the identity of the person convicted had not been reliably established , so that the procedure for rectification of an error ought not to have been followed ;", "( b ) he had not been aware of the proceedings against him , and the signature on the envelope containing the notice of the date of the preliminary hearing was not his . In that connection he said that if necessary a handwriting expert should be asked to determine whether the signature was authentic and that if he had to do so he would lodge a complaint alleging forgery ( querela di falso ) ;", "( c ) the notice concerned had not been properly served since the form of service did not comply with the provisions of the NORP - Hungarian agreement signed on DATE ( and ratified by the NORP parliament in PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , which required all judicial communications from CARDINAL of the CARDINAL signatory countries addressed to individuals in the other country to take the form of a request for judicial assistance . The applicant further asserted that the form of service of the notice in question had in any case been incompatible with the relevant provisions of the NORP legislation concerning judicial communications by post .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG refused the applicant 's request .", "CARDINAL . It observed in the first place that the judge responsible for the execution of sentences could not look into grounds for annulment arising out of the proceedings and concerning the merits of the charges . The defects complained of had in any case been cured ( sanate ) when the judgment of DATE became final .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the identity of the person convicted had been established through an investigation conducted by the PERSON prefecture with the assistance of the GPE branch of ORG . Moreover , a mere inaccuracy concerning a defendant 's date of birth did not constitute a ground for annulment of a judgment , and could properly be corrected via the rectification procedure .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , according to the case - law of ORG , a request to reopen the time allowed for an appeal was admissible only where a defendant alleged that he had been prevented from finding out about his conviction by circumstances beyond his control . It would be inadmissible , however , if he pleaded that service of a notice was null and void . In such a case a person convicted at first instance could lodge an appeal out of time , arguing in effect that the time allowed for an appeal had not begun to run .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against the judgment of DATE , submitting that as it had been based on invalid procedural steps it could not have become final . He also repeated his request for a report by a handwriting expert and his statement concerning the possibility of lodging a complaint of forgery .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG declared the applicant 's appeal inadmissible . It observed in particular that the evidence against the applicant had been corroborated by CARDINAL persons charged in related proceedings , who had stated that the weapons in question , which had been brought in from GPE and then used to commit an armed robbery , a murder and an attempted murder , had been bought at the applicant 's house . He had then taken to GPE a ORG car which CARDINAL of the co - defendants had sold him . ORG had correctly identified the defendant as PERSON , a NORP national living at FAC , Szigethalom , previously convicted of rape , armed robbery and acts of vandalism . Moreover , on DATE , NORP ORG had reported that the applicant was the son of a woman named PERSON ( as his lawyer had confirmed ) , that he had been born on DATE in GPE and that he lived at \u201c CARDINAL ... Erdo Str . , GPE / GPE \u201d . His address had also been confirmed by a co - defendant . In those circumstances , ORG ruled that there was no doubt that the applicant was indeed the person sought by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to note that notification of the charges had been served on the applicant . An acknowledgment - of - receipt slip dated DATE and apparently signed by the addressee proved that this information had been received . The address at which the notice had been served was in most respects correct , the only mistakes being that an extra \u201c h \u201d had been added to \u201c Szigethalom \u201d ( making \u201c LOC \u201d ) and the accent had been missed off the place name \u00cbrdo ( making LOC ) . It was therefore not necessary to compare the applicant 's signatures on his passport and certain company documents with the one on the return slip acknowledging receipt .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant 's argument that the terms of the NORP agreement had not been complied with , ORG observed that notification had been properly served on the applicant in accordance with the relevant domestic provisions , since the assistance between GPE provided for in the agreement was mandatory only if one of the High Contracting Parties requested it . Where , as in the present case , no explicit request to that effect had been made , domestic law had to be applied . In addition , although it was true that under NORP legislation registered letters could be delivered only to persons who had first been authorised and designated , it was obvious that those rules applied only where , unlike the position in the applicant 's case , the person receiving the letter was not the addressee .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal therefore ruled that , contrary to the applicant 's submissions , the first - instance judgment was valid . It followed that the defendant 's appeal was out of time , and therefore inadmissible pursuant to LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law . He repeated his request for a report by a handwriting expert and again stated that he was minded to lodge a complaint of forgery .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal , holding that the reasons given by ORG for all its disputed rulings had been logical and correct . It observed in particular that , in spite of minor clerical errors in the address , the notice sent by the PERSON preliminary investigations judge had obviously reached the person it had been sent to . There was no evidence that it had been received by someone of the same name as the applicant living at a similar or nearly identical address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked for a retrial , alleging that certain new information showed that he should have been acquitted . It was submitted that a NORP journalist and writer , PERSON , had informed the applicant 's lawyer that during a television programme CARDINAL co - defendants had made statements establishing his client 's innocence . In addition , PERSON had asserted that in his opinion the NORP and NORP secret services had intervened in the applicant 's case and that a Colonel PERSON , employed in ORG , knew that the convicted man was innocent .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG declared the application inadmissible . It pointed out that , according to the case - law of ORG , statements by co - defendants did not justify reopening a trial . Moreover , the evidence of the persons concerned had already been taken by the lower courts . Furthermore , the opinions expressed by PERSON about the applicant 's innocence were completely subjective and unsubstantiated by any evidence .", "CARDINAL . According to the information supplied by the ORG , identification of the applicant as an arms trafficker was based on the following evidence :", "\u2013 the record of an interview with PERSON on DATE during which she declared that a PERSON wished to participate in the criminal activities of the PERSON brothers and that he had supplied guns to them ;", "\u2013 a handwritten note from PERSON giving the applicant 's name and address ;", "\u2013 a letter sent by CARDINAL of the PERSON brothers to PERSON and received by DATE at the applicant 's address ;", "\u2013 a receipt for MONEY , given by Mr PERSON to PERSON ;", "\u2013 a television interview obtained by an NORP journalist on DATE at the applicant 's home , during which the applicant showed photographs of PERSON and one of the PERSON brothers ;", "\u2013 the fact that PERSON had recognised the applicant 's face in the video recording of the interview ; and", "\u2013 the fact that the applicant 's identity had been checked by the NORP and NORP police at the time of his extradition , on the basis of a photograph taken from the interview broadcast on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The relevant passages of LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) provide :", "\u201c In the event of conviction in absentia ... , the defendant may request the reopening of the time allowed for appeal against the judgment where he can establish that he had no knowledge [ of it ] ... without any negligence on his part or where , in the case of a conviction in absentia having been served ... on his lawyer ... , he can establish that he did not deliberately refuse to take cognisance of the procedural steps .", "A request for the reopening of the time allowed for appeal must be lodged within DATE of the date ... on which the defendant learned [ of the judgment ] , failing which it shall be declared inadmissible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c Rectification of judgments and decisions affected by errors or omissions which do not entail their nullity , and which may be corrected without requiring a substantial redrafting of the text , shall be ordered , where necessary of his or her own motion , by the judge who gave the decision in question ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG indicates what elements a judgment must include . ORG - paragraph ( b ) mentions , among other details , the defendant 's particulars or other information by which he can be identified . LAW ORG provides that , where CARDINAL of the elements mentioned in Article CARDINAL is missing or incomplete , the judgment must be rectified in accordance with LAW , and that an order to that effect may be made by the judge even of his or her own motion .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG also provides that a summons must include the applicant 's particulars or other information by which he can be identified . Paragraph CARDINAL adds that the decision in question is null and void if the defendant has not been reliably identified ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
