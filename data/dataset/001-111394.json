On DATE the applicant association applied to ORG for authorisation to hold a peaceful demonstration in front of the ORG on DATE , to encourage the adoption of laws to protect sexual minorities from discrimination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application on the ground that the applicant association \u2019s demonstration was baseless , since a law on the protection of national minorities had already been adopted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG also refused permission for the proposed demonstration , on the grounds that there was a law on the protection of national minorities already in place and that there were legal provisions which dictated which individuals had the power of legislative initiative required to promote laws .", "CARDINAL .

The court considers legally ungrounded the arguments relied on by the defendant to justify its refusal to authorise the assembly , as the law does not provide such grounds for the non - authorisation of an assembly .

The Chi\u015fin\u0103u Mayor \u2019s Office appealed against the decision of ORG of DATE .
