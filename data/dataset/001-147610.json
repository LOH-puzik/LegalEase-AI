On DATE the ORG ( ORG ) issued an arrest warrant against the applicant based on possession of forged documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took over the investigation . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) quashed the arrest warrant and issued a fresh arrest warrant based , inter alia , on the suspicion of membership of a foreign terrorist organisation ( ORG , ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE ORG upheld the arrest warrant and ordered that the applicant \u2019s detention be continued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a new arrest warrant . According to the new warrant , the applicant was strongly suspected of having played a leading role in the activities of a foreign terrorist organisation , and of having committed CARDINAL counts of murder and CARDINAL counts of attempted murder . The applicant had , in particular , telephoned witness PERSON from GPE to instruct him to carry out a terrorist attack which took place in GPE on DATE and in which CARDINAL policemen were killed . The applicant was further suspected of having ordered several terrorist attacks carried out by detonating explosives in GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant comprising CARDINAL pages plus a list of evidence covering another CARDINAL pages , based on the same grounds as the arrest warrant dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht , no . III-CARDINAL STS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , sitting as a first instance court for proceedings concerning ORG security , decided to open the trial against the applicant . The hearing started on DATE and took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE witness PERSON was heard by a court in GPE in the presence of all parties to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after DATE of court hearing , ORG quashed the arrest warrant insofar as it had been based on the suspicion that the applicant had ordered the attack which had taken place in GPE on DATE and ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention based on the remaining grounds of the arrest warrant . ORG considered that witness PERSON , relied upon by the prosecution , had not confirmed the testimony he had given to the NORP authorities in DATE . Conversely , he had stated that he had been tortured by NORP civil servants and had been forced to sign a prepared protocol . He did not know the applicant . Under these circumstances , no strong suspicion persisted that the applicant had ordered the above - mentioned criminal act .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant remained under strong suspicion of having committed the other crimes of which he was accused . There was , in particular , sufficient documentary and witness evidence supporting the allegation that the applicant , as a leading member of a terrorist organisation , was responsible for causing explosions and committing other criminal acts . ORG inter alia referred to the TIME and decisions of the founding congress which established that the applicant had been elected as a member of the central committee of the DHKP - C in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further considered that the applicant might abscond and that there was a risk of collusion . The court observed that the applicant , who had been residing illegally in GPE , had neither a fixed residence nor sufficient social ties to ensure his appearance before the court . There were thus no milder means available to secure his presence at the trial .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further considered that the proceedings were expedited as required in cases involving pre - trial detention . ORG included a detailed account of the trial , explaining that on several occasions witnesses could not be questioned by the court because they exercised their right not to testify . The court had heard testimony from CARDINAL witnesses and was then hearing CARDINAL further witnesses . In order to establish whether the applicant had committed the crimes of which he had been accused , testimony from NORP witnesses was of paramount importance . Accordingly , ORG had to make several enquiries by way of letters rogatory in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . ORG confirmed that the applicant remained under strong suspicion of having ordered several explosions causing injuries and death . The court further confirmed that the danger of the applicant \u2019s absconding , and of collusion , remained . The continuation of his detention was not disproportionate in view of the importance of the subject matter and of the considerable punishment to be expected in case of a criminal conviction . Furthermore , the length of the proceedings was due to their complexity , as had been set out in detail by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) refused to consider the applicant \u2019s complaint against the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , without giving further reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE witness FAC and CARDINAL further witness were heard in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG extended the arrest warrant on the grounds that there was again a strong suspicion that the applicant had ordered the attack during which CARDINAL policemen were killed in GPE in DATE . This assessment was , in particular , based on testimony given by witness PERSON , who had stated that PERSON had informed him in DATE that the applicant had given him the order to carry out the attack against the policemen . ORG considered that this statement was consistent and credible . Furthermore , there was corroborative evidence from witnesses who had confirmed that the applicant held a leading position in the terrorist organisation at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further found that there remained a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the other crimes of which he was accused . Referring to its previous decisions , ORG considered that the danger of the applicant \u2019s absconding persisted . This danger had further been aggravated by the fact that ORG had , in the meantime , allowed the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE . According to an intelligence report dating from DATE , a leader of the terrorist organisation had ordered that the applicant be taken out of the country immediately if released from detention . It was furthermore known that the terrorist organisation had the necessary means to put this plan into action .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally considered that the prolongation of the pre - trial detention was not disproportionate , having regard to the importance of the subject matter and to the seriousness of the penalty to be expected in case of a criminal conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE witness PERSON was once again heard in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on DATE of the hearing , ORG closed the hearing of evidence and heard the prosecutor \u2019s pleadings . Upon defence counsel \u2019s request , the hearing of evidence was reopened and ORG limited the charge to CARDINAL counts of murder committed in DATE , while discontinuing the proceedings concerning the other charges originally brought against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment . On the basis of the evidence presented during the hearing , ORG found it established that the applicant had ordered the assassination of the policemen by telephone from GPE at DATE . The court primarily based the applicant \u2019s conviction on testimony from witness ORG further considered that this finding was in line with the command structure inside the terrorist organisation and was not called into question by PERSON \u2019s allegations that he did not know the applicant . During his hearing before the NORP court , PERSON had refused to make any more specific statements . Under these circumstances , the vague statement that the applicant did not have anything to do with the attack was not sufficient to call PERSON \u2019s testimony into question .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally considered that the length of detention and of the main hearing did not violate the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . The specific circumstances of the instant case did not allow for an earlier termination of the proceedings . This was due to the extent and the complexity of the criminal charges . Apart from CARDINAL counts of murder , of which he had been convicted , the applicant had been accused of holding a leading role in a foreign terrorist organisation and of having participated in causing a considerable number of explosions in GPE . The case - files consisted of CARDINAL large volumes . As the applicant had been arrested by chance , the examination of the relevant facts could begin only after his arrest . The NORP authorities had submitted a large number of documents such as expert opinions , sketches and records of witness testimony , which had to be translated and examined before the issue of the indictment on DATE . Due to the volume of the case - file and to the complexity of the subject matter , the main proceedings could not be opened before DATE . During the hearing , the progress of the taking of evidence had been determined by several requests by letters rogatory to the NORP authorities . Members of the court and representatives of the parties travelled to GPE CARDINAL times in order to attend the hearing of witnesses before NORP courts . Each taking of evidence by letters rogatory took considerably DATE . Following this , the taking of evidence was closed on DATE , but re - opened altogether CARDINAL times at the request of the defence . The reading out of the applicant \u2019s last word alone took DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and remitted the case to another Chamber of that court . ORG considered that the assessment of the evidence by ORG had been erroneous as that court had wrongly assumed that the testimony given by PERSON on the circumstances of his alleged conversation with PERSON was consistent and without contradictions .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that it could not be ruled out that this error had been decisive for ORG in reaching its verdict . There were further reasons to review critically S.G. \u2019s testimony . Firstly , PERSON had not directly witnessed the applicant ordering the attack , but was merely a hearsay witness . Furthermore , the witness was not heard by the trial court , but by a NORP court at the trial court \u2019s request . Finally , PERSON , who had been arrested in GPE in DATE , had collaborated with the NORP police and had thus benefited from a milder sentence and early release from prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( no . IIICARDINAL STS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention . The further detention was justified because the applicant was under strong suspicion of having committed a serious crime and because there was the risk that he might abscond . That court considered that the applicant remained under strong suspicion of having ordered the attacks carried out on the policemen on DATE . This was not called into question by ORG decision to quash the judgment . The potential contradictions in the statements made by witness PERSON had to be examined in the new main proceedings . ORG further considered that there were no milder means available to secure the applicant \u2019s appearance before the court and that the length of his detention was not yet disproportionate . The fact that ORG had quashed the judgment of ORG did not lead to a violation of the obligation to expedite the proceedings , as there was no obvious procedural error . Furthermore , ORG had respected the obligation to expedite the proceedings by preparing the requests for letters rogatory in order to begin the main hearing by DATE or DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . That court confirmed that the applicant remained under strong suspicion of having ordered the attack in GPE . This suspicion was primarily based on testimony given by witness LOC during the main hearing on DATE and DATE and statements made by witness PERSON during his interrogation by NORP police on DATE . This was not called into question by the fact that the judgment of ORG had been quashed on the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . The contradiction in PERSON \u2019s testimony did not concern the core content of his statement , which remained unchanged .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that witness PERSON had stated , during interrogations by the NORP authorities on DATE , that the applicant had given him the order to carry out the attack on DATE . The court considered that it was not prevented from taking into account this statement by PERSON \u2019s repeated claims that he had made this statement under torture , as his vague and general allegations were not confirmed .", "CARDINAL . ORG finally considered that the length of detention ( DATE ) was not disproportionate . The court gave a full account of the proceedings and concluded that the length of the proceedings was primarily determined by the complexity of the subject matter and by the very strong international dimension of the case . Conversely , there had not been any considerable delays imputable to the trial court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , relying on its Rules of Procedure , refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the fresh hearing of the applicant \u2019s case started before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention on the basis of the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a new request lodged by the applicant on DATE , ORG quashed the arrest warrant and ordered the applicant \u2019s release from detention . The applicant was released on that DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the further execution of detention would be disproportionate . According to that court the applicant remained firmly suspected of having ordered the attack of DATE , in which CARDINAL policemen were killed . This assessment was based on the testimony given by PERSON in the first set of proceedings as well as on further corroborative evidence . ORG considered that to prolong the detention would be disproportionate . In cases involving pre - trial detention , the criminal courts were under a constitutional obligation to expedite the proceedings ( PERSON ) . This principle had to be applied even more strictly given the long duration of the applicant \u2019s detention . ORG considered that it could not foresee when it would hear witness testimony from PERSON , who was the primary witness for the prosecution . In spite of several reminders , the requests for letters rogatory lodged with the NORP authorities in DATE and DATE had not so far been disposed of . As it was unclear when the witness could be heard , ORG considered that it was unable duly to expedite the proceedings as would have been necessary in view of the fact that detention had already lasted DATE . ORG noted that the statements made by witness PERSON to ORG in DATE could not be used because it could not be ruled out that they had been obtained by torture .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the criminal proceedings were still pending before ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
