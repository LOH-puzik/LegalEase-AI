ORG In TIME of CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON was arrested by the police ( ORG ) in GPE , GPE , on the north - west coast of GPE . He was found driving a lorry which contained QUANTITY of hashish . The lorry belonged to the applicant . He was also found in possession of a pistol with its serial number chiselled off and of a radio pre - tuned to a station which coincided with that of another set found later in the possession of PERSON , who was also arrested ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL more people were subsequently detained for allegedly being involved in a CARDINAL - stage operation to deliver QUANTITY of hashish .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the applicant 's statement to the police , made with the assistance of a lawyer and an interpreter on CARDINAL DATE , an unknown person had approached him sometime in DATE and again in DATE and offered him MONEY to transport QUANTITY of \" dope \" ( droga ) from PERSON to the GPE . After some hesitation PERSON had finally accepted . Late in the TIME of CARDINAL DATE , following the unknown person 's instructions , he had taken his truck to PERSON , where another man had loaded the drugs and then gone away . The applicant had only been driving for TIME when he was arrested .", "This statement was confirmed by the applicant on CARDINAL DATE before the relevant judicial authority ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , PERSON investigating judge no . CARDINAL , who then ordered PERSON detention pending trial ( auto de prisi\u00f3n ) . Basing his decision on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal , \" LECrim \" - see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) , the judge held that there was sufficient reason to believe that the applicant was criminally responsible for the commission of a public - health offence . According to the applicant , the other persons detained , all NORP nationals , were unconditionally released .", "On DATE Mr PERSON made a written statement to ORG investigating judge no . CARDINAL in which he explained that , contrary to his previous statements , he had not known that he was transporting drugs at the time of his arrest . He had thought the consignment was tobacco but had said drugs because of the pressure put on him and language difficulties .", "CARDINAL . ORG In an order of CARDINAL DATE ( auto de procesamiento ) investigating judge no . CARDINAL decided that the available evidence was sufficient to charge the applicant with an offence against public health ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL bis ( a ) of LAW - see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) and unlawful possession of a firearm ( section CARDINAL of LAW - see paragraph DATE below ) . The applicant 's detention was confirmed . An appeal by the applicant against this order appears to have been dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE and CARDINAL DATE Mr PERSON lodged with investigating judge no . CARDINAL his first applications for provisional release . Arguing that he had throughout been unaware of the real nature of the consignment , he insisted that he was not involved with any drug - trafficking organisation . He further complained that during his DATE detention he had only been questioned twice by the judge - in DATE and DATE - and was the only person still held in custody despite the relatively minor character of his offence . PERSON also undertook to comply with any conditions attached to his release .", "These applications were rejected on DATE and DATE respectively by means of orders not containing reasons .", "CARDINAL . ORG A similar application for provisional release followed on DATE and was rejected on DATE by an auto ( reasoned decision ) . The ground for the decision was the seriousness of the offences - illegal possession of a firearm and drug trafficking in large quantities ; the second offence in itself attracting a prison sentence of \" prisi\u00f3n menor en su grado medio \" ( that is , from DATE , DATE and DATE to DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG By an order of DATE ( auto PERSON del sumario ) the applicant was committed for trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG Further applications for provisional release were addressed to FAC in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor ( Ministerio Fiscal ) stated that he would not oppose the applicant 's release provided that he paid security of MONEY , handed in his passport and reported DATE to the police . However , on DATE the ORG refused the applications for release , briefly stating : \" The original circumstances on which the detention pending trial was decided remain unchanged \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant then requested ORG to reconsider its decision , complaining , inter alia , that several co - detainees in respect of whom the prosecution was seeking sentences of DATE ten years ' imprisonment had obtained conditional release upon payment of MONEY . In the applicant 's submission , only the fact of his being a foreigner seemed to account for his long period of detention . On DATE the ORG declined to reconsider its decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the course of DATE the NORP authorities had launched a nationwide operation ( Operaci\u00f3n N\u00e9cora ) to combat a large - scale drug - trafficking organisation which operated mainly in GPE . Central investigating judge no . CARDINAL in FAC , GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was put in charge of the overall investigation .", "The applicant 's case was considered to be closely linked with other files relating to ORG and was therefore transferred to GPE on DATE . ORG had heard the parties beforehand ; the applicant 's lawyer did not make any submissions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE central investigating judge no . CARDINAL issued an order ( auto de procesamiento ) whereby new charges were added against the applicant without any alteration to the established facts . He was now charged not only with an offence against public health and unlawful possession of a firearm of foreign origin ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) but also with smuggling and criminal association ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . An appeal by the applicant against these orders which included a request for release was eventually rejected on DATE by ORG of the Audiencia Nacional . The grounds for the decision not to release the applicant were the seriousness of the alleged offences , considerations of public order and the high risk of absconding on account of the applicant 's foreign nationality .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant had lodged a fresh application for release with investigating judge no . CARDINAL in which he repeated arguments adduced earlier and additionally submitted that the transfer of his case to GPE would inevitably mean that his trial would be further delayed . The public prosecutor opposed the applicant 's release , and on DATE central investigating judge no . CARDINAL decided to continue the applicant 's detention in view of the available evidence , the nature of the offence and its seriousness , the prison sentence that it would attract , the extent of the applicant 's involvement and the likelihood of his absconding .", "PERSON challenged this in ORG of the Audiencia Nacional . In his appeal the applicant submitted , inter alia , that as his alleged offence was wholly unconnected with the charges relating to drug trafficking , he could easily have been tried DATE after his arrest . He further submitted that , in any case , even if he were to be found guilty of the offences with which he was charged , he would already have served his sentence in detention pending trial ( over DATE ) . On DATE the Audiencia Nacional dismissed the appeal , thereby confirming the investigating judge 's decision .", "The applicant 's subsequent constitutional complaint ( recurso de amparo ) was declared inadmissible by ORG on DATE on the ground that none of the issues raised by the applicant were of a constitutional nature .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the meantime , in a telegram of CARDINAL DATE addressed to central investigating judge no . CARDINAL , the applicant had renewed his application for release . The public prosecutor attached to the Audiencia Nacional requested that the applicant 's detention be prolonged to the statutory maximum of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . PERSON responded by offering to make a formal undertaking that he would reside in PERSON should his release be granted . On DATE central investigating judge no . CARDINAL decided to continue the applicant 's detention and to adjourn any decision on the public prosecutor 's request for its extension .", "CARDINAL . ORG As PERSON period of detention approached DATE , the central investigating judge no . CARDINAL decided on CARDINAL DATE , in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and after hearing the parties , that the maximum duration of the detention should be extended by DATE . He based this decision on the seriousness of the charges and the sentence which could be imposed in the event of conviction .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the central investigating judge no . CARDINAL concluded the preliminary investigation . The case was sent to ORG of the Audiencia Nacional for trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant lodged a new application for release , this time with the Audiencia Nacional , which on DATE allowed it subject to the following conditions : ( a ) the applicant was to pay in cash a security of MONEY ; ( b ) he was to give an address and inform the court of any subsequent change ; ( c ) he was to report DATE to the police in GPE ; and ( d ) he was not to leave NORP territory .", "The Audiencia Nacional gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\" There is prima - facie evidence that ... the accused did not play a major role in any of the organisations concerned , as he merely transported the illegal substance in question , the nature of which also has to be taken into account by the court .", "The time that has elapsed since PERSON was placed in custody - over DATE ( he has been in detention far longer than any of the other defendants in this case ) - means that it is possible to rule out his being able to conceal or suppress evidence .", "The period of time that has elapsed clearly - why not be frank about it ? - owes much to ill fortune and the vicissitudes of the proceedings . He could have been tried in GPE DATE , when the GPE public prosecutor did not oppose his provisional release .", "The same lapse of time , viewed in the context of the brief provisional summary of the facts , argues in favour of varying the order placing him in detention pending trial , relaxing the conditions of detention by making it possible to avoid it altogether , provided that the measures referred to in the operative provisions below are taken so as to ensure that he appears for trial .", "The court did not consider that the accused 's foreign nationality constituted an insurmountable obstacle to reaching this conclusion , because other foreign defendants in the case are in fact not being held in detention . The court simply took the view that it was just another factor which , combined with the accused 's lack of close ties with GPE , could lend support to the idea that he might be likely to seek to evade trial ; but that can not be presumed without additional evidence . Furthermore , this type of fear , which is always relative , can not in such circumstances have the effect of inexorably making the accused serve in advance the sentence which may be imposed on him . This is particularly so as the accused has shown , at least to some extent , that he is able to remain on NORP territory and obtain a contract of employment there which would enable him to engage in a lawful activity for the duration of the contract . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , in response to a request by the applicant for a reduction in the amount of the security , the Audiencia Nacional set it at MONEY either to be paid in cash or to be guaranteed by a bank .
