On DATE ORG , acting pursuant to a report from the state financial control authorities , which had audited a company whose chairperson the applicant had been , and reports by the economic police and by the company \u2019s trustee in bankruptcy , decided to open criminal proceedings against the applicant . At that time the applicant was living in GPE , where he had arrived on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged in his absence with misappropriation of funds in large amounts , contrary to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the CC\u201d)(see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was alleged that in DATE , when he had been the chairperson of the board of directors of the abovementioned company , he had misappropriated MONEY . Reasoning that the applicant was accused of a \u201c serious \u201d offence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that he had gone into hiding , the investigator in charge of the case decided that , once apprehended , the applicant should be placed in pretrial detention . This decision was approved by the prosecutor in charge of the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant averred that , after having been notified by relatives that the NORP media were circulating information that criminal proceedings had been opened against him and that he was wanted by the authorities , and after reading copies of newspapers brought by his wife in DATE , he decided to return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant arrived at GPE airport on DATE and was immediately arrested , questioned and brought to the detention centre at ORG .", "CARDINAL . The following day , DATE , the applicant was apprised of the charges against him by an investigator and was questioned . The investigator confirmed the order for his detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s lawyer requested ORG to release the applicant , arguing that there was not enough evidence to prove that the applicant had committed an offence .", "CARDINAL . ORG denied the request in a decision of DATE . It reasoned that , since the applicant had been charged with a serious intentional offence , he had to remain in custody , as mandated by LAW ( \u201c the CCrP\u201d)(see paragraphs DATE below ) . The exception provided for by paragraph CARDINAL of that Article was not applicable , because the applicant could jeopardise the investigation in view of the number of impending investigative steps . The issues whether there was enough evidence to sustain the charges against the applicant and whether the applicant had committed other offences would arise after the conclusion of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed to ORG , contending that there was no risk of the applicant absconding , committing an offence , or jeopardising the investigation . In particular , the applicant had returned from abroad of his own accord , despite the fact that he had known that a criminal investigation had been pending against him .", "CARDINAL . The Chief Prosecutor \u2019s Office dismissed the appeal in a decision of DATE . It reasoned that in view of the rule of LAW of the CCrP the applicant had to remain in custody . There was nothing to indicate that the applicant came within the exception provided for in paragraph CARDINAL of that Article . In particular , no medical reports indicating bad health of the applicant had been submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed with ORG a request for his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was also charged with abuse of office , contrary to LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in the context of a new investigation against him , and his pretrial detention was confirmed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to release the applicant on bail . It reasoned that the full elucidation of the facts of the case necessitated the questioning of a witness who had absconded and was impossible to find . Hence the proceedings against the applicant had to be stayed pending the apprehending and the questioning of the witness . The applicant \u2019s continued detention was therefore unwarranted and he was to be released against giving an undertaking to not leave town . Concerning the measure to secure appearance in the second proceedings against the applicant , the offence with which he had been charged DATE abuse of office \u2013 was not \u201c serious \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and detention was therefore not mandatory under LAW CCrP. The applicant could thus be released on bail .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant paid the bail on DATE and was released DATE .", "CARDINAL . It seems that almost no investigative actions were performed DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal proceedings against the applicant were stayed by decision of ORG . It reasoned that it was necessary to question CARDINAL witnesses whose whereabouts were unknown . The proceedings were to be resumed immediately after the CARDINAL witnesses were tracked down .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dropped the charges under LAW ORG , reasoning that , as certain witnesses could not be found and questioned , these charges could not be proven . It seems that the proceedings relating to the charges under LAW ORG continued , and , as of the date of the latest information from the parties ( DATE ) , were still pending .", "CARDINAL . From DATE of his arrest on DATE until he was released on CARDINAL DATE the applicant was kept in the detention facility of ORG .", "CARDINAL . There the applicant was held in a cell measuring QUANTITY , which he had to share with CARDINAL other persons during most of the time . There were no beds and the detainees had to sleep on the cement floor , which they covered with dirty blankets . During DATE and DATE that the applicant spent in the cell the blankets were allegedly not changed or washed . The cell was illuminated by a single electric bulb . There was no window or access to sunlight . The airing of the cell was apparently very poor . During the DATE the temperature in the cell was QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . Food , the quantity and quality of which were , according to the applicant , very insufficient , was served without cutlery , in plastic mugs which were apparently not washed between meals . It seems , however , that the applicant was able to have food brought from the outside .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , as the other detainees , was allowed to go out of the cell for TIME twice a day \u2013 in the morning and in TIME \u2013 to go to the toilet . During the remaining time the detainees had to relieve themselves in a plastic bucket kept in the cell . They had to empty the bucket and clean it themselves when leaving the cell to use the sanitary facilities .", "CARDINAL . No possibility for spending time in the open or for physical exercise was provided . The detainees could only leave the cell when they received visits , were taken for questioning , or were taken to court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that there were periods of CARDINAL or forty days during which he was not allowed to bathe . According to the Government , detainees were allowed to bathe once a week .", "CARDINAL . In an action brought by a person detained in the same detention facility at the same time as the applicant , ORG stated that the conditions in the facility were \u201c a manifestation of cruel , inhuman and humiliating treatment , contrary to the absolute prohibition of ... LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after his release , on DATE , the applicant filed an action against ORG under ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . He alleged that the conditions of his detention had constituted inhuman and degrading treatment , imputable to the defendant which was in charge of the administration of pretrial detention facilities , and claimed CARDINAL old NORP levs ( ORG ) as compensation for nonpecuniary damage : pain , suffering and loss of self - respect . He described in detail the conditions of his detention and submitted that they had not been the result of a bias of the authorities against him , but an objective fact which had negatively affected all detainees for lengthy periods of time . These conditions had been violative of , inter alia , LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG held its first hearing in the case on DATE . It declared the action admissible , instructed the applicant that he bore the burden of proof and invited him to produce evidence in support of his claim . It also invited the defendant and a prosecutor , who participated as a \u201c special party \u201d to the proceedings , to present their observations .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing took place on DATE . The applicant requested that the director of ORG be summoned as a witness and that an onthespot inspection be carried out in the detention facility and asked for leave to CARDINAL witnesses to prove the nonpecuniary damage the applicant had sustained as a result of the conditions of his detention . Counsel for ORG requested that the applicant appear in person to testify about the facts laid out in his statement of claim . She also requested that ORG be added as a defendant . The applicant insisted that the proper defendant was solely ORG . The court ordered the applicant to appear for questioning . It denied the request to summon the director of ORG , holding that the facts could properly be established through other evidence . It also denied the request for an onthespot inspection , holding that DATE had elapsed since the applicant had been released and that the current state of the detention facility could not be used as a basis for establishing its state at the time when the applicant was kept there . The court gave the applicant leave to call CARDINAL witnesses . It denied the request to add ORG as a defendant , holding that the entity against which the action had been brought was ORG .", "CARDINAL . By an order made in private on DATE the court held that the complaint had been improperly characterised by the applicant as CARDINAL under ORG . It held that the proper legal characterisation was under general tort law . Accordingly , in order for the proceedings to continue the applicant had to pay the requisite court fee ( MONEY of the amount claimed , i.e. BGL CARDINAL ) within DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not pay the fee and the court discontinued the proceedings by an order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the order to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the order and remitted the case to ORG for continuation of the proceedings , holding that the proper legal characterisation of the facts alleged by the applicant was under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing before ORG was listed for DATE , but was adjourned because of the improper summoning of the defendant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that ORG be replaced as a defendant by ORG and that ORG be added as a second defendant in view of legislative changes whereby ORG was liquidated and the administration of the pretrial detention facilities was transferred from ORG to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested an expert opinion on the hygienic and sanitary conditions in the detention facility .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing took place on DATE . The court granted the applicant \u2019s request to replace the defendant and add a new defendant and adjourned the proceedings for CARDINAL DATE in order to allow the new defendant to prepare .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was held on DATE . The prosecutor did not appear . Noting that there was no indication that the prosecutor had been duly summoned , the court decided to adjourn the case . On the motion of the applicant the court struck out ORG as a defendant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that ORG be added as a defendant , arguing that this was necessary in view of the unclear regulation of the succession between ORG and ORG as regards the administration of the pretrial detention facilities .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was held on DATE . The court questioned CARDINAL witness called by the applicant who testified about the conditions in the detention facility . The applicant reiterated his request for an expert report and asked leave to call CARDINAL more witnesses . The court stated that it would rule on all motions in private .", "CARDINAL . By an order made in private on CARDINAL DATE the court denied the request for adding ORG as a defendant , holding that the facts alleged in the statement of claim did not point to a cause of action against it . It allowed the request for an expert opinion and invited the GPE Hygienic and ORG to designate an expert who could draw up a report on the conditions in the detention facility .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing , scheduled for DATE , failed to take place because of the improper summoning of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the court to revoke its order of CARDINAL DATE as regards the refusal to add ORG as a defendant .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing took place on DATE . The court denied the applicant \u2019s request to revoke its order , holding that ORG had nothing to do with the subjectmatter of the case before it . The court invited the applicant to call the allowed witnesses . Pursuant to the motion of the defendant , the court also ordered the applicant to indicate specifically which government bodies and officials had , through their actions or omissions , caused the alleged damage .", "CARDINAL . The court , sitting in private on DATE , appointed an expert to draw up a report on the hygienic and epidemiological conditions in the detention facility .", "CARDINAL . A hearing listed for DATE was adjourned because the judge in charge of the case was on sick leave .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was held on DATE . The expert informed the court that she could not draw up the requested report . The court gave leave to ORG to call one witness and replaced the expert . The court also instructed the applicant to rectify his statement of claim within DATE , holding that he had not specified which illegal actions or omissions of which officials had occasioned the damage he alleged to have sustained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant indicated that the officials allegedly responsible for these conditions were \u201c the administration of ORG \u201d . Expressing his surprise that the court had not found this alleged omission in the statement of claim until the eighth hearing , the applicant requested that the judge withdraw from the case , averring that her conduct denoted bias against him .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the court denied the request for withdrawal , holding that it had power to instruct the plaintiff to rectify its statement of claim during the entire duration of the proceedings before it and its having done so was not indicative of bias , but fully compliant with the rules of procedure . The court also discontinued the proceedings , holding that the applicant had not complied with its instructions to indicate the officials responsible for the conditions in the pretrial detention facility and their exact allegedly illegal actions or omissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the order for the discontinuation of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the order and remitted the case , holding that the proper defendant in proceedings under ORG were the government bodies and not the specific officials alleged to have caused the damage . The instructions of ORG had therefore been without purpose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG listed a hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a \u201c complaint for delays \u201d under Article CARDINALa of the Code of Civil Procedure ( \u201c the CCP\u201d)(see paragraph CARDINAL above ) with the chairperson of ORG , alleging that ORG had not proceeded with due diligence in examining his action . The chairperson of ORG dismissed the complaint on CARDINAL DATE , holding that the case had been adjourned many times because of changes in the legislation , the adding of new defendants and the making of evidentiary motions by the parties . The intervals between the hearings had been justified by the busy schedule of the panel examining the case .", "CARDINAL . As CARDINAL and DATE the case file was being transferred from ORG to ORG in connection with the examination of the above complaint , the hearing listed for DATE did not take place .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing took place on DATE . The court questioned CARDINAL witnesses called by ORG , who testified about the conditions in the detention facility . The applicant reiterated his request for an onthespot inspection of the facility . The court invited the applicant to specify the facts which he wanted to have proven through the inspection . It also repeated its invitation to the applicant to call the witnesses for whom leave had previously been given .", "CARDINAL . The last hearing took place on DATE . The court noted that out of CARDINAL witnesses whom the applicant had been allowed to call , CARDINAL had actually been called . It further noted that the applicant had not complied with its instructions to concretise the facts which he intended to establish through the requested inspection of the detention facility . The court thus denied the request to carry out an inspection . It also excluded the requested expert report from the evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action in a judgment of DATE . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... [ The applicant ] bears the burden of establishing the facts which are favourable to him . He was many times invited to do so by the court , but has not presented evidence about the conditions in the detention facility as a result of which he has allegedly suffered nonpecuniary damage . Neither has he adduced evidence in support of the proposition that the damage which is the subjectmatter of the claim is in a causal connection with illegal actions or omissions of officials of ORG , which participated in the administration of the pretrial detention facilities at the time when the applicant was in custody . Therefore the court considers that these facts have remained unproven . The court could not hold otherwise even if account is taken of the testimony of the witness [ ORG ] , because the witness and the [ applicant ] were not in the same cell ... It is true that that the witness testified about the conditions in the detention facility and the cell in which he had been , but ... his testimony does not establish the nonpecuniary damage suffered by the [ applicant ] , as averred in the statement of claim . Nor does it establish that the nonpecuniary damage suffered by the applicant is a result of the conditions in the detention facility .", "The court could not hold otherwise even if it takes into account the testimony of the witnesses [ P. ] and [ I. ] , because in their testimony they describe the conditions in the detention facility and in the cell in which the [ applicant ] was kept , but do not establish the non - pecuniary damage claimed by the [ applicant ] and the fact that this damage is in a causal connection with the hygienic and material conditions in the detention facility . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG . He reiterated his request for an onthespot inspection of the detention facility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private , gave the applicant leave to call one witness and denied his request for an inspection of the detention facility . It held that , since DATE had elapsed after the applicant \u2019s release , an inspection could not establish the conditions in the facility as at the time he was kept there .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE . The applicant did not show up and did not bring the witness for whom leave had been given .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal in a judgment of DATE . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c On the basis of the evidence adduced before this court and the court below , the [ court ] considers that the claim has remained unsubstantiated . The claim was for compensation for nonpecuniary damage suffered by the [ applicant ] . However , apart from proof about the general state of the hygiene in the detention facility at the time of the [ applicant \u2019s ] stay there , there is no proof about the specific damage suffered by him . The finding that the detention facility was in a poor hygienic condition does not per se lead to the conclusion that [ the applicant ] has suffered real moral , nonpecuniary damage , because the objective fact of the hygiene and the regime in the detention facility has a subjective and very individual impact on persons with different mentalities and social status . Due to the lack of evidence about the specific effects which the conditions in the detention facility had on the [ applicant ] , as averred in the statement of claim , the claim remains unsubstantiated . The nongathering of evidence about this is the result of the inactivity of the [ applicant ] alone . The witness called by him and questioned by the firstinstance court did not testify about the applicant \u2019s condition during his stay in custody , and the other CARDINAL witnesses for whom leave was given by the firstinstance court and the third witness for whom leave was given by this court were not actually called by the [ applicant ] without him specifying good reasons for this omission . In view of this the [ court ] considers that the [ applicant \u2019s ] lack of procedural activity is tendentious and seeks to surmount the admissibility criteria for lodging an application with ORG Rights ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG .", "DATE . The court listed a hearing for DATE . However , in DATE the ORG was amended , providing that appeals on points of law to ORG were possible only in respect of actions where the amount in controversy was above ORG CARDINAL . Since the amount claimed by the applicant was ORG CARDINAL , ORG discontinued the proceedings by an order of DATE , and ORG judgment became final .", "CARDINAL .

The offence is punishable by MONEY or by compulsory labour .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time and until the reform of the CCrP of DATE an arrested person was brought before an investigator who decided whether or not he or she should be remanded in custody . The investigator \u2019s decision was subject to approval by a prosecutor .
