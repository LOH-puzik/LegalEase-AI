The applicants are all represented by PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Ms Mehida ORG is the widow of the late Mr PERSON . PERSON and Mr PERSON are the daughter and son , respectively , of the late Mr PERSON . Mr PERSON is the son of the late Mr PERSON and the brother of the late Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON died on or shortly after DATE in what has come to be known as the GPE massacre .", "CARDINAL . The Socialist GPE ( SFRY ) was made up of CARDINAL GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . GPE and GPE declared their independence from the SFRY on DATE following referenda held earlier . Thereupon the Presidency of the SFRY ordered the JNA ( ORG Armija/\u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0458\u0430 , or ORG ) into action with a view to reasserting the control of the federal government .", "CARDINAL . Other component GPE of the SFRY followed GPE and GPE in declaring independence . Eventually only GPE and GPE were left to constitute the SFRY \u2019s successor state , GPE ( FRY ) . Hostilities ensued , largely along ethnic lines , as groups who were ethnic minorities within particular GPE and whose members felt difficulty identifying with the emerging independent states sought to unite territory that they inhabited with that of GPE with which they perceived an ethnic bond .", "CARDINAL . By its LAW ( DATE ) of DATE , ORG of ORG set up ORG ( UNPROFOR ) intended to be \u201c an interim arrangement to create the conditions of peace and security required for the negotiation of an overall settlement of the NORP crisis \u201d . Although PERSON \u2019s mandate was originally for DATE , it was extended ; PERSON ( later renamed ORG , the name UNPROFOR coming to refer only to the operation in GPE ) continued in operation until DATE . Troop - contributing nations included the GPE .", "CARDINAL . GPE and GPE declared independence on DATE as GPE . Thereupon war broke out , the warring factions being defined largely according to the country \u2019s pre - existing ethnic divisions . The main belligerent forces were the ORG ( PERSON i ORG , or ORG of GPE , mostly made up of Bosniacs and loyal to the central authorities of GPE ) , the ORG ( PERSON vije\u0107e obrane , or ORG , mostly made up of NORP ) and the ORG ( PERSON Srpske/\u0412\u043e\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0430 PERSON , or ORG of ORG , also called ORG , mostly made up of NORP ) .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that CARDINAL people were killed and CARDINAL people were displaced . It is estimated that CARDINAL people went missing ; in DATE , CARDINAL of them were still so listed .", "CARDINAL . The conflict came to an end on DATE when ORG for Peace ( \u201c FAC \u201d , adopted in GPE , GPE , GPE ) entered into force .", "CARDINAL . The bulk of the ORG withdrew from GPE in DATE , leaving behind units whose members were nationals of GPE and GPE with their weapons and equipment . These became the backbone of the ORG . In its operations the ORG obtained the assistance of paramilitary units , most of which were composed of NORP but some of which comprised non - NORP including nationals of countries outside the former SFRY .", "CARDINAL . NORP The municipality of GPE in eastern GPE is constituted of a number of towns and villages , among them PERSON and the town of GPE from which the municipality takes its name . Before the outbreak of the war its population was almost entirely PERSON and NORP , Bosniacs outnumbering NORP by CARDINAL to one . It is now part of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Being an obstacle to the formation of ORG as a continuous territorial entity as long as it remained in the hands of the central government of GPE , PERSON came under ORG attack already in the course of DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the central government of GPE refused to countenance any evacuation of GPE \u2019s civilian population , since that would amount to the acceptance of \u201c ethnic cleansing \u201d and facilitate the surrender of territory to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG adopted , by a unanimous vote , a resolution ( LAW ( DATE ) ) demanding that \u201c all parties and others concerned treat the eastern NORP town of GPE and its surroundings as a safe area which should be free from any armed attack or any other hostile act . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By DATE the GPE \u201c safe area \u201d was an enclave surrounded by territory held by the ORG . It contained ORG combatants , most of them disarmed , and civilians . The latter numbered in MONEY , mostly Bosniacs ; these included by then , in addition to the local residents , persons displaced from elsewhere in eastern GPE .", "CARDINAL . There was also an UNPROFOR presence within the enclave , nominally consisting of CARDINAL lightly - armed GPE air - mobile infantry , known as Dutchbat ( from \u201c NORP \u201d and \u201c battalion \u201d ) . In fact , however , Dutchbat was under - strength by this time , troops returning from leave having been prevented by the ORG from rejoining their unit . In DATE ORG \u2019s leadership consisted of its commander , Lieutenant Colonel NORP ; its deputy commander , Major PERSON ; and other commissioned and non - commissioned officers including Warrant Officer PERSON who was in charge of personnel matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the ORG attacked the LOC \u201c safe area \u201d in overwhelming force , overrunning the area and taking control despite the presence of Dutchbat .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE the ORG entered the town of GPE meeting little resistance from either the ORG or UNPROFOR . By this time the civilian population had left the town . A throng of civilians consisting of women , children and mostly elderly men were converging on the Dutchbat compound in the village of GPE . The Dutchbat commander estimated the number of civilians inside the compound at CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . At the ORG Commander \u2019s request , the acting UNPROFOR Commander then issued instructions to Dutchbat , ordering them to enter into negotiations with the ORG to secure an immediate ceasefire . He ordered Dutchbat to concentrate their forces in the PERSON compound and to \u201c take all reasonable measures to protect refugees and civilians in [ their ] care \u201d . He added that Dutchbat should \u201c continue with all possible means to defend [ their ] forces and installation from attack \u201d . This was \u201c to include the use of close air support if necessary \u201d .", "CARDINAL . That night , as meetings were taking place between the Dutchbat Commander and ORG , a column of PERSON men , possibly numbering CARDINAL , started to move out of the enclave in the direction of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In TIME DATE a meeting took place between ORG and Lieutenant Colonel NORP . Among other matters discussed , ORG threatened to shell the Dutchbat compound in retaliation if air power was used against the ORG . He also demanded to see all the men between the ages of CARDINAL and DATE because , as he alleged , there were \u201c criminals \u201d in the crowd gathered at ORG and he would need to question each of them . It was also arranged that the civilian population would be transported by bus to GPE , the nearest town in the hands of the government of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of the same day the ORG entered PERSON in force and the deportation of the civilians began , beginning with those outside the compound . ORG soldiers separated the men ( between the ages of CARDINAL and DATE ) from the women , children and elderly who were allowed to board the buses . Major PERSON instructed civilian representatives to draw up a list of all the men between the ages of DATE and DATE both inside and outside the compound . The resulting list eventually included CARDINAL names . He later explained that his intention had been to forward the information to ORG and other authorities , so as to keep track of the men . He also explained afterwards that he had protested to the ORG about the separation of the men from the others , but had relented upon being told that the men would not be harmed and would simply be questioned as prisoners of war in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Lieutenant Colonel PERSON was instructed by the PERSON command in GPE to ensure that Dutchbat left the enclave together with locally recruited ORG staff . Lieutenant Colonel NORP informed ORG accordingly . Lieutenant Colonel PERSON interpreted these instructions so as to include staff of the non - governmental organisation ORG . Major PERSON drew up a list of the persons concerned , which came to comprise CARDINAL names . It was later learned that the ORG leadership had given Major PERSON the names of persons who were related to its staff members but who were not actually employed by that body for inclusion on that list , misrepresenting them as staff members .", "CARDINAL . Also on CARDINAL DATE Dutchbat personnel in GPE turned men out of the compound . Once the men had left the compound they were taken prisoner by the ORG . Dutchbat personnel later stated that they had believed the ORG would treat the men in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE that followed , PERSON men who had fallen into the hands of the ORG were killed . Others managed to evade immediate capture and attempted to escape from the enclave ; some succeeded in reaching safety but many were caught and put to death , or died en route of wounds , or were killed by landmines . It is now generally accepted as fact that upwards of CARDINAL , perhaps CARDINAL PERSON men and boys died in this operation at the hands of the ORG and of NORP paramilitary forces .", "CARDINAL . The remains of the victims were buried in mass graves . In DATE that followed , attempts were made to hide evidence of the massacre by re - burying remains in secondary mass graves in remote locations .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was employed by Dutchbat as an electrician . On DATE he sought refuge on the compound in PERSON with his wife and children . Although he did not hold a ORG identity pass , he was placed on the list of CARDINAL locally recruited ORG staff who would be allowed to leave with Dutchbat on account of the length of his service . Nevertheless , on CARDINAL DATE Warrant Officer PERSON \u2013 who was unaware of the existence of the list of DATE ordered Mr PERSON to leave the compound with the other refugees . Warrant Officer PERSON was later reprimanded by Major PERSON for this \u201c incredibly stupid mistake \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was the younger brother of the applicant Mr PERSON . The latter was at that time employed as an interpreter for Dutchbat and for that reason his name was on the list of CARDINAL ORG employees who would be evacuated with Dutchbat . It appears that Mr PERSON had intended to join the column of PERSON men breaking out on foot in the direction of ORG , but had changed his mind and sought the protection of Dutchbat on the compound at PERSON on the strong urging of Mr PERSON . Both Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON asked Major PERSON to place Mr PERSON on the list of ORG staff . Major PERSON asked the battalion security and intelligence officer whether a ORG pass could be made on the compound but was told that this was not possible : such passes came from the ORG office in GPE . Major PERSON then refused to place Mr PERSON on the list , reasoning that he would compromise the safety of legitimate ORG staff members by including among their number a person who did not meet the relevant criteria . Major PERSON ordered Mr PERSON to leave the compound .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , the father of Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , acted as the ORG representative and attended the meeting between Lieutenant Colonel NORP and ORG on DATE . He was permitted for this reason by Major PERSON to stay in the compound and leave with Dutchbat . However , when Mr PERSON was ordered to leave the compound Mr PERSON elected to leave with him .", "CARDINAL . It is known that all CARDINAL , Mr PERSON , ORG and PERSON , were killed after having left the compound , either by ORG or by NORP paramilitary forces . Their remains were found buried in mass graves on various dates in DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a criminal complaint in writing with the public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) to ORG ( rechtbank ) . The complaint included a request for a criminal investigation to be initiated into the alleged complicity of Lieutenant Colonel NORP , Major PERSON and Warrant Officer PERSON in genocide or alternatively in war crimes committed by the ORG against PERSON PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON . Their argument was that Lieutenant Colonel NORP , Major PERSON and Warrant Officer PERSON had exposed the CARDINAL men to the likelihood of death at the hands of the ORG in full awareness of their probable fate . The complaint made made reference to , inter alia , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . The public prosecutor acknowledged receipt on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 counsel , PERSON , wrote to the public prosecutor asking for the applicants to be allowed to make statements . On various dates in DATE she submitted information including inter alia statements made by witnesses in the parallel civil proceedings ( see below ) , and excerpts from the debriefing report ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the report of the Secretary General of ORG ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor wrote to PERSON informing her that ORG ( Openbaar Ministerie ) had decided to enter into \u201c particular reflection \u201d ( nadrukkelijke reflectie ) on the results of the investigation up to that point with a view to deciding whether a full criminal investigation was called for . On DATE this was followed up by a letter informing PERSON that a national reflection chamber ( nationale reflectiekamer ) had been appointed to consider the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON wrote to the public prosecutor stating that she had been contacted by the NOS ( PERSON , ORG ) , a domestic public service radio and television broadcaster , who had apparently been informed that the reflection chamber had recommended that the prosecution go ahead . She asked the public prosecutor to confirm this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG published a press item to the effect that the national reflection chamber had recommended the prosecution of Lieutenant Colonel PERSON , Major PERSON and Warrant Officer PERSON . The press item cited unnamed sources and added that ORG was refusing to give any details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor confirmed to PERSON that the reflection chamber had expressed an opinion but declined to give any details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON wrote to the public prosecutor complaining that DATE had passed since the criminal complaint had been lodged and asking that a decision be taken .", "CARDINAL .
