The application was lodged by Mr PERSON . On DATE he submitted evidence showing that he had changed his name to PERSON . He is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a criminal indictment was issued by the authorities of GPE against the applicant . He was charged with several offences , including wire fraud ( use of electronic communication for fraudulent purposes ) , bribery , major fraud against GPE and money laundering . The charges concerned a period DATE and DATE and related to the applicant \u2019s employment in an organisation which received funds from the GPE government for the performance of certain services in GPE . On DATE an arrest warrant was issued by the authorities of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the authorities of GPE requested that the NORP authorities place the applicant under provisional arrest with a view to his extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested . On DATE ORG , having heard the public prosecutor and the applicant , assisted by a lawyer , remanded him in custody for DATE . In ORG decision the charges brought against the applicant by GPE authorities as well as the legal grounds for his extradition were set out in detail . In respect of the applicant \u2019s detention , the court considered that there were sufficient grounds to believe that if at liberty , he could evade the proceedings and abscond . Therefore , the applicant was to be remanded in custody . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against that order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a request to ORG from GPE authorities , dated DATE , for the applicant \u2019s extradition . ORG noted that ORG had requested that the applicant be kept in custody until his extradition . On DATE the extradition papers were forwarded to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE was legally admissible in respect of the charges of wire fraud and major fraud against GPE . These offences carried maximum sentences of DATE in prison respectively . The court established that the offences in question were listed in LAW between GPE and GPE , signed in DATE , and were also punishable in GPE under LAW . In respect of the charges of bribery and money laundering extradition was not admissible , as these offences were not listed in LAW . ORG found that the applicant \u2019s detention was justified and noted that he had been taken into custody in accordance with its decision of DATE . It extended the applicant \u2019s detention until his extradition or until a decision to refuse to extradite him was made . It also noted that there was nothing to rule out the applicant \u2019s extradition , that the general conditions for his extradition were fulfilled and that an arrest warrant had been issued in respect of the applicant whereas the court had no reason to doubt its validity .", "CARDINAL . Although according to LAW ORG seadustik ) no appeal lay against ORG decision , the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . He complained , inter alia , that ORG decision had contained no reasons for his detention in breach of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . On DATE ORG refused to examine it . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed an appeal against the appellate court \u2019s decision . It agreed with ORG that ORG decision concerning the legal admissibility of the applicant \u2019s extradition was not subject to appeal and rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that the lack of an opportunity to appeal against the first - instance court \u2019s decision was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the Government decided to extradite the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the Government \u2019s decision , mainly because of insufficient reasoning and failure to consider all relevant circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government took a new decision to extradite the applicant in respect of the charges of major fraud against GPE and wire fraud . The extradition was refused in respect of the remaining charges . The Government , in taking their decision , considered the applicant \u2019s written objections , records of his CARDINAL meetings with officials of ORG , and the applicant \u2019s and his ORG submissions made before ORG , as well as a medical expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . In their decision , the Government addressed the legal grounds for the applicant \u2019s extradition ( including whether the statutory limitation period had expired and whether the possibly harsher sentence in GPE prevented the applicant \u2019s extradition ) and weighed the public and international interests against the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights . They considered , inter alia , that it was not possible to try the applicant in GPE , but that in the event of his conviction in GPE he could request to be transferred to GPE to serve his sentence . They were of the opinion that the fact that the applicant had a child and a sick father in GPE did not prevent his extradition . In respect of the applicant \u2019s health , the Government relied on a medical expert opinion , which stated that he was able to travel to GPE and stand trial , despite the fact that he was suffering from hypertension .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint against the ORG \u2019s decision with ORG . He also requested suspension of the proceedings pending the outcome of the proceedings concerning the legal admissibility of his extradition ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against the Government \u2019s extradition decision . In respect of the suspension request it noted that there were no other pending proceedings since ORG decision on legal admissibility of extradition was not subject to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , and reiterated to ORG the request he had previously made to ORG , for the proceedings to be suspended . On DATE ORG suspended the proceedings as requested by the applicant . After the resumption of the proceedings , on DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG declined to hear the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant requested that ORG \u201c review the reasons for [ his ] arrest ( vahistuse p\u00f5hjendatuse kontroll ) ( and release [ him ] ) \u201d . He noted that he had been in custody for DATE without having been extradited or his extradition having been refused . He argued that the rules of LAW governing pre - trial detention should be applied . According to these provisions , the maximum duration of pre - trial detention was DATE and this could only exceptionally be extended beyond that limit . No such extension had been ordered in his case . He also disputed the existence of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence and argued that there were no grounds for his detention such as a risk that he would abscond or reoffend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a ORG judge replied by letter as follows :", "\u201c LAW of LAW , which governs extradition proceedings , does not provide for review of reasons for remand in custody . By a decision of a preliminary investigation judge of ORG , dated DATE , [ the applicant \u2019s ] extradition to GPE was declared legally admissible in part . At the same time [ the applicant \u2019s ] remand in custody was extended until his extradition to GPE or until a decision to refuse extradition ; the said decision has become final . I am therefore returning to you the request sent to ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , relying upon , inter alia , LAW requiring periodic review of the lawfulness of detention in cases where its grounds might change over time .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was dismissed by a decision of ORG on DATE . ORG agreed with the applicant that ORG letter had to be considered a decision , as it concerned the resolution of a procedural matter , and that a request sent to the court should not have been returned by letter . As to the substance of the complaint , ORG endorsed ORG decision to refuse to examine the request because of a lack of procedural grounds for it to do so in LAW of LAW and , in particular , in LAW , which governs provisional arrest in connection with extradition . The court noted that according to that provision , detention following provisional arrest in connection with extradition proceedings must not be longer than DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to examine the applicant \u2019s appeal as , under LAW , ORG decision could not be appealed against .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant asked ORG \u201c to take a decision on the question of [ his ] release from detention \u201d . He relied on LAW , which set DATE as the maximum length of custody following provisional arrest related to extradition proceedings . The applicant asked the court to issue a ruling explicitly providing in its operative part that he would be released from custody on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to examine the request . It noted that the applicant \u2019s custody had a legal basis in LAW and was in compliance with LAW ( ORG p\u00f5hiseadus ) and LAW . Furthermore , it noted that LAW prohibited the keeping of a person in custody for DATE following provisional arrest . In the applicant \u2019s case the DATE period had not yet elapsed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal brought by the applicant against the above - mentioned decision . It considered that in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG could not have specified the final date of the applicant \u2019s custody , as it would not have been possible to foresee the exact date of his extradition . ORG noted that the applicant was to be released if he had not been extradited by DATE , despite the lack of any explicit order to that effect in the operative provisions of the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant requested that the Government quash its decision of DATE to extradite him . The applicant argued that owing to the DATE limitation period applicable under NORP law his prosecution had become time - barred on DATE : his extradition was therefore no longer permissible . In a complaint of CARDINAL DATE lodged with ORG , the applicant asked the court to oblige the Government to decide that the decision to extradite him should be quashed . He also applied for a stay of the extradition as an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the applicant \u2019s extradition until DATE . On DATE , on an appeal by the Government , ORG quashed ORG decision . It considered that the applicant \u2019s indictment on CARDINAL DATE and an arrest warrant issued on DATE by the authorities of GPE had interrupted the limitation period .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request of CARDINAL DATE for the decision to extradite him to be quashed . On DATE the applicant amended his previous complaint to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , additionally challenged the Government \u2019s latest decision , and again applied for an interim measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was handed over to the authorities of GPE and removed from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant pleaded guilty to major fraud against GPE in a plea bargain made in GPE for LOC of GPE . On DATE ORG sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , in his sentence in GPE , the different periods the applicant had spent under arrest were taken into account , including the time spent under provisional arrest in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released : he returned to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Part CARDINAL of LAW of LAW ( ORG seadustik ) sets out the procedure for extradition . A request for extradition is sent through ORG and ORG to ORG , which verifies the legal admissibility of the extradition . Thereafter , in the case of an NORP national , it is for the Government to decide on his or her extradition . That decision can be challenged before the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW contains rules on the provisional arrest and subsequent detention of a person to be extradited . LAW CARDINAL provides that provisional arrest must not be applied if legal impediments to the extradition have become evident . Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , as in force at the material time , provided that a person could not be kept in custody for DATE following provisional arrest .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that if extradition is refused , the person concerned is released from custody .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL set out rules for the content of a court \u2019s decision concerning the legal admissibility of extradition .
