{"ITEMID": "001-5285", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "GEORGIOU v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is a NORP national , born in GPE in DATE , and the second applicant is his wife . The applicants live in GPE and are represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicants purchased a take - away food shop in GPE and began trading as \u201c PERSON \u2019s Chippery \u201d . Most of their sales were of hot food , subject to value added tax ( \u201c LOC ) at the standard rate .", "After a routine control visit in DATE , ORG officers ( \u201c ORG officers \u201d ) , who collect ORG on behalf of the Government , checked with several of the applicants\u2019 suppliers and discovered that certain purchases had been understated . On DATE from DATE , ORG officers secretly kept watch on the premises from a window on the upper floor of a property which was obliquely across the road from the LOC and recorded details of customers entering and leaving and the number of \u201c packets \u201d or bags of food bought . They also observed and recorded all deliveries made .", "On DATE the applicants were interviewed by CARDINAL ORG officers and DATE their till readings were analysed . In mid DATE the shop had been refitted with a new electronic till . On demand the till could produce reports which summarised the transactions entered onto it . The relevant grand total reading for takings from DATE to CARDINAL DATE was \u00a3 MONEY . This was compared with declared takings of \u00a3 MONEY .", "On DATE the applicants admitted that they had been under - declaring takings and removing cash from the till since DATE . They also admitted to withholding purchase invoices from their accountants .", "In DATE assessments were made by ORG in respect of under - declared tax between DATE and DATE . These were based on a DATE suppression rate derived from the till grand total for the period from DATE to DATE . The grand till total was assumed to be tax exclusive and , with an adjustment for CARDINAL - rated sales , ORG at PERCENT was added . \u00a3 MONEY was deducted to allow for keying errors and training and other non - transaction entries . The difference between the result and the declared takings for the same period was divided by DATE for which the shop was open , to obtain the DATE suppression rate . This rate was then applied to earlier periods with periodic reductions to reflect assumed price increases . The assessment figure reached was \u00a3 MONEY . The tribunal later found that the observation figures were used as supporting evidence only .", "On DATE the applicants changed accountants and formally asked for the case to be reconsidered . The new accountants argued that the till memory was an unfair basis for assessing the tax as it included matters besides takings , and that it was impossible to ascertain the sums attributable to those matters . The figure put forward for tax due was \u00a3 MONEY .", "The matter was reconsidered and ORG issued amended assessments on DATE for the sum of \u00a3 MONEY ; this took the figure of \u00a3 MONEY as inclusive of GPE and deducted \u00a3 MONEY ( as opposed to \u00a3 MONEY ) for keying and training errors . On DATE the applicants appealed against the reduced assessment of CARDINAL DATE ( the first appeal ) .", "On DATE ORG formally issued the applicants with a notice of assessment of a penalty under LAW of LAW DATE for dishonest evasion of GPE for CARDINAL accounting periods DATE and DATE . The tax evaded was stated to be \u00a3 MONEY and the penalty was assessed at \u00a3 MONEY , PERCENT of the total , giving a reduction of PERCENT for co - operation under section CARDINAL ) of the LAW . The applicants appealed against this penalty on DATE ( the second appeal ) .", "The NORP tribunal heard the consolidated appeals over DATE from DATE . The applicants were represented by counsel with a specialised LOC practice , who had , according to their own case :", "\u201c an in depth familiarity with the theory of ORG law and extensive experience of taking NORP cases to both the tribunal and ORG . She was at the time of the domestic proceedings the author of a leading practitioners\u2019 work on the subject \u2018 The Encyclopaedia of VAT\u2019 \u201d .", "The applicants\u2019 principal argument was that the review of the tax assessment in DATE ought to have been made according to the Commissioners\u2019 best judgment ( using the \u201c best judgment \u201d test which applied to the assessments themselves ) . They argued that the till readings were an unreliable indicator of the takings and should not have been used as the basis of the assessment . Accordingly , the Commissioners could not have used their best judgment in assessing the tax due and the assessments were void . They further submitted that the penalty reduction of PERCENT for co - operation was too low in the circumstances .", "In its judgment of DATE , the NORP tribunal held that nothing in either LAW DATE or LAW DATE required a review of an assessment to be made according to \u201c the best judgment \u201d test . Nevertheless , it found that , in the circumstances , the review had indeed been made according to the Commissioners\u2019 best judgment .", "During the course of proceedings an issue had been raised by the applicants as to the Commissioners\u2019 compliance with certain directions for discovery . The NORP tribunal commented :", "\u201c Although the discovery directions were not fully complied with , we are satisfied that eventually the [ applicants ] saw every existing document and were sufficiently informed of the contents of every other document which could possibly be considered as material to the applicants\u2019 case and which was not privileged from production .", "In our judgment the Commissioners\u2019 failure to comply with the directions did not amount to wilful disobedience , and it was caused mainly by the GPE office \u2019s unfamiliarity with such directions and by the fact that the Commissioners took a relatively narrow view of the matters in issue in the case and of the documents which related to those matters , as opposed to the very wide view taken by the NORP advisers . \u201d", "Although the applicants\u2019 attack on the validity of the assessments failed as to quantum , the NORP tribunal held that \u00a3 MONEY should be deducted as the proper figure for keying and typing errors ( as opposed to \u00a3 MONEY ) , and it allowed an increase of PERCENT in takings for DATE following the shop \u2019s refurbishment period . The tax due was reduced to \u00a3 GPE , the penalty having been reassessed at PERCENT .", "The applicants appealed to ORG . In its judgment of DATE , the court held that there was no point of law upon which ORG could intervene , since it was satisfied that the NORP tribunal had not misdirected itself in law in reaching the decision that ORG had exercised their best judgment in making the assessments .", "The applicants further appealed to ORG , challenging the tribunal \u2019s decision that the Commissioners had exercised their best judgment . ORG , following the case of PERSON v ORG and Excise Comrs [ DATE ] STC CARDINAL , reiterated that the NORP tribunal \u2019s function is twofold : first to consider whether the commissioners have duly discharged their function and second to consider any further grounds put forward for reducing the assessment . Giving judgment on DATE , ORG held that it was impossible to find fault with the figures reached by the tribunal . ORG declined to decide the issue of whether the \u201c best judgment \u201d test applied to the review as well as the assessment , because it was not relevant to the case before it .", "ORG criticised the approach of the appeal petition , Lord Justice PERSON noting at page CARDINAL \u00a7 j :", "\u201c What is not permitted , in my view , is a roving selection of evidence coupled with a general assertion that the tribunal \u2019s conclusion was against the weight of evidence and was therefore wrong . A failure to appreciate what is the correct approach accounts for much of the time and expense that was occasioned by this appeal to ORG . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON commented again at page CARDINAL \u00a7 d ,", "\u201c The notice of appeal to ORG raised what were essentially factual issues stated as questions of law to the general effect that the tribunal had no right to make the findings which it did in the light of the evidence that it heard . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON noted the failure to identify the issues in advance of , or even at the hearing , noting at page CARDINAL \u00a7 c :", "\u201c it must be said that there was a wholly indiscriminate and unnecessary attention to detail throughout . \u201d", "On the issue of the length of proceedings , Lord Justice PERSON commented , at page CARDINAL \u00a7 b :", "\u201c I would say that the length of these proceedings was largely due to the failure to identify either at or before the beginning of the hearing , and to formulate , the issues that were raised . If this had been done the process of discovery would have been eased and the tribunal would have been better able to exercise control over the close examination of highly detailed evidence to which it was subjected . \u201d", "The appeal was dismissed and leave to appeal to ORG was refused .", "The applicants\u2019 petition to ORG was refused on DATE . Bankruptcy proceedings , commenced by ORG , have been adjourned pending consideration of the ORG case before the ORG .", "Relevant domestic law", "The relevant part of paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL of the Value Added Tax Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , now LAW ) of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where a person has failed to make any returns under this LAW or to keep any documents and afford the facilities necessary to verify such returns or where it appears to the Commissioners that such returns are incomplete or incorrect they may assess the amount of tax due from him to the best of their judgment and notify it to him . \u201d", "A provision for appeals is made in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL LAW ( sections CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) .
