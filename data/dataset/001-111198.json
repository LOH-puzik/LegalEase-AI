The first applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE . The second applicant , PERSON , is an NORP and NORP national who was born in DATE . The President decided that their identity should not be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The applicants live in GPE , GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr T. Pilv and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant met PERSON , an NORP national and the father of the second applicant , their daughter , during her studies in the GPE . They developed a relationship and after completing her studies she often stayed with NORP in GPE near GPE . On DATE the second applicant was born in GPE . After the birth of the child , relations between the parents deteriorated . According to the first applicant she suffered mental abuse from ORG , NORP had only wished to bring the child up in accordance with NORP traditions and with assistance from his parents , whereas the first applicant \u2019s opinions had been disregarded . NORP had worked TIME and had barely participated in taking care of the child .", "CARDINAL . The applicants travelled to GPE on a number of occasions , including for DATE starting from DATE . Thereafter , they went to GPE on DATE with ORG \u2019s consent . However , they did not return to GPE on DATE , as had been agreed , but stayed in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant asked ORG to award her sole custody of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE NORP travelled to GPE . He wished to see the child but refused to do so in a law firm , as proposed by the first applicant . However , he met the first applicant who gave him the keys to his apartment in GPE at his request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE R. made a request to ORG for the child \u2019s return under LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction ( \u201c LAW ) . On DATE the NORP authorities forwarded the request to ORG and on DATE it was sent to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG dealt with the requests of both parents in the same proceedings . A hearing took place on DATE , with the participation of the first applicant , NORP , the second applicant \u2019s ORG - appointed lawyer and a social worker from the GPE rural municipality where the applicants resided in GPE . At the closure of the hearing , the court announced that it would make its ruling after the receipt of an opinion from the NORP child protection services . The subsequent proceedings were conducted in writing .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG issued a temporary injunction concerning NORP \u2019s access rights to the child according to which he could meet her in the presence of her mother and CARDINAL person of his choice . This arrangement was later amended by the court so as to enable the first applicant to be also accompanied by a person of her choice during the meetings . NORP met the child on CARDINAL weekends between May and DATE . At least at some of the meetings both NORP and NORP psychologists were present . According to the first applicant , NORP subsequently ceased to show interest in the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG notified the first applicant that she had until DATE to send them her written submissions concerning PERSON \u2019s claim for the return of the child to GPE . It informed her of its intention to rule on the matter by DATE at the latest . In her submissions the first applicant referred to the need for several items of evidence yet to be received ( opinion of the GPE rural municipality , medical expert opinion , and additional information from the NORP authorities ) and requested the postponement of ORG ruling until the receipt of further evidence . She raised the issue of the child \u2019s sexual abuse by NORP The first applicant also submitted to the court written statements from a number of persons ( her mother and other relatives , friends , colleagues and a teacher ) describing the relations between the parties and NORP \u2019s abusive behaviour , as well as a psychotherapist \u2019s observations based on the first applicant \u2019s counselling . According to a note by a child psychiatrist the child was restless and nervous and had sleep disorders ; it was suggested that the meetings with NORP be conducted at home in a secure environment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG transferred to its NORP counterpart a report by ORG . It was noted that no extensive replies to the questions formulated by the NORP authorities could be given on the basis of the information gathered . The NORP authorities had met PERSON and his parents and visited NORP \u2019s residence . They had also met the first applicant \u2019s music teacher . It was noted in the report that NORP had a controlling and egocentric character and traits of dependence . Latent depressive tendencies could be seen in NORP \u2019s family of origin where the woman \u2019s natural role was seen as that of taking care of children , even at the expense of her professional self - fulfilment . A family pattern of this kind could have also been established in the relationship between NORP and the first applicant and caused her uneasiness . It was noted that NORP had denied that his mother had been treated for mood disorders , although this had been the case . Lastly , it was noted that in order to conclusively answer the questions posed it was necessary to assess both of the parents and to observe the father \u2019s relationship with the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a psychology expert drew up a written opinion at the request of ORG . She had met the applicants on CARDINAL and DATE . In response to ORG questions she noted that it was not possible to decide on the issue of sexual abuse as alleged by the first applicant . In respect of whether her transfer to GPE would cause her serious mental suffering , the expert noted that the child needed a secure , customary and stable environment , that she had a close attachment relationship with her mother and that her separation from her mother would definitely cause her serious mental suffering and could have a serious life - long negative influence on her . At the age in question the child and mother belonged together . Even if the mother could stay in GPE without being prosecuted , she would be fully dependent on the child \u2019s father and at risk of mental and physical violence ; there would be a resurgence of the situation from which the mother had escaped from GPE . Traumatisation of the mother would have a negative effect on the child \u2019s development . The expert concluded that in these circumstances the return of the child to GPE would cause her serious mental suffering and would definitely not proceed from the child \u2019s well - being and needs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant submitted further written observations and documentary evidence to ORG and noted , inter alia , that all the relevant circumstances had not been established and that the court \u2019s delivery of its ruling on the matter should be postponed .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the second applicant \u2019s return to GPE pursuant to LAW . It established that the child had resided in GPE together with her parents until DATE and that this finding was not affected by the first applicant \u2019s argument that she had only studied and temporarily lived in that country . The court further established that the parents had joint custody of the child in GPE ; the father had consented to the child \u2019s travelling to GPE but not to her settling in GPE . The court found that the retention of the child in GPE was wrongful within the meaning of LAW and that the father was entitled to claim her return under LAW . In respect of the question whether the return of the child was excluded under LAW ( b ) of LAW , the court noted that it had to consider the information concerning the child \u2019s social background provided by the central authority or other competent authority of the child \u2019s habitual residence . It referred to ORG judgment of DATE , according to which a child could only not be returned on the basis of LAW ( b ) of LAW if this would result in extremely serious damage to the child \u2019s well - being . Such exceptional threat to the child \u2019s well - being had to be sufficiently specific and probable .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the second applicant \u2019s return to GPE would not cause her more suffering than it would an average DATE . On the basis of evidence at the court \u2019s disposal ( expert opinion by a psychologist and information from DATE ) it could not be concluded that the father had ill - treated the child or been violent towards the first applicant . Nor could it be established on the basis of the information provided by the FAC child protection agency that the child \u2019s return to GPE would be contrary to her interests . As the NORP authorities had referred to the need to monitor relations between the father and the child , their supervision of what was going to happen in the family was ensured . The court noted that pursuant to LAW the child was not returned to the other parent but to the other country ; therefore , the court did not find the first applicant \u2019s arguments about the separation of mother and child relevant . A close relationship between the mother and child would also contribute to the child \u2019s sense of security in GPE where she had been living until DATE . NORP had confirmed at the court \u2019s hearing that he was ready to provide the applicants with lodging and subsistence . The conflict between the parents could not determine the choice of the child \u2019s country of residence ; these matters could be taken into account in the determination of the GPE rights of custody . The first applicant \u2019s arguments related to her impossibility to return to GPE because of the risk of arrest were irrelevant because the NORP authorities could in any event make use of the NORP arrest warrant . The court concluded that there were no circumstances that allowed dismissing the request for the second applicant \u2019s return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court acknowledged that the second applicant had developed certain routines and a feeling of security in GPE . Nevertheless , courts could not favour a parent altering a child \u2019s country of residence without the consent of the other parent . The first applicant should have sought the determination of her custody rights in the first place and only thereafter changed her and DATE depending on the custody rights awarded \u2013 the child \u2019s residence .", "CARDINAL . ORG ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the first applicant \u2019s claim for sole custody as the child was to be returned to GPE . The court dismissed the first applicant \u2019s requests for a further hearing to be held , for her and witnesses to be examined and for a psychiatric expert examination of NORP to be ordered . It noted that owing to exceptional circumstances ( delayed receipt of the reply from the NORP social services and the lodging of complaints of abuse ) it had not been able to resolve the matter within DATE . Nevertheless , further suspension of the proceedings was not possible but it was open to the first applicant to make the requests in question in the proceedings concerning the custody rights .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against ORG decision , requesting the dismissal of PERSON \u2019s request for the second applicant \u2019s return to GPE and resumption of the examination of the first applicant \u2019s claim for sole custody of the second applicant . The first applicant submitted to ORG , inter alia , an extract of the second applicant \u2019s medical record according to which the applicants had been examined in a psychiatric department of ORG in DATE . It had been found that the child had a secure attachment relationship with her mother and that in the event of the continuation of the stressful period related to the court proceedings the mother and child would need psychological support .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the first - instance court \u2019s ruling . It considered that the child had lived with her parents in GPE until DATE and had become accustomed to her social and family environment in that country . It was natural that she had also developed such relations in GPE after her unlawful retention but neither this nor the child \u2019s earlier visits to GPE meant that her habitual residence was in GPE . ORG agreed with ORG finding that the return of the child was not excluded under LAW of LAW . It considered that according to the spirit of LAW the child \u2019s swift return to her habitual living environment was presumed to be in her best interests . This also had a general preventive effect ensuring that parents would not take their children unlawfully to another country . Accordingly , a child could only not be returned in exceptional circumstances .", "CARDINAL . ORG was of the view that the second applicant \u2019s return to GPE would not necessarily lead to her separation from her mother and accordingly the related arguments of the appeal were unfounded . It referred to several items of evidence adduced by NORP including , inter alia , an opinion of NORP experts , according to which the child \u2019s return to GPE was in her interests , and a notice from the kindergarten the second applicant had attended in GPE , according to which there had been nothing to indicate the use of physical or mental violence against the child . ORG concluded that the second applicant would not be placed in an intolerable situation upon her return to GPE and that the first applicant \u2019s claims of the abuse of the child by her father were groundless .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the evidence adduced by the first applicant , which the first - instance court had disregarded , did not demonstrate reliably that NORP had abused the child . The psychology expert who had examined the second applicant had not confirmed that she had been abused by her father . The expert \u2019s opinion that the child \u2019s return to GPE would cause her serious suffering had been based on the first applicant \u2019s groundless claim that the child would be separated from her on return . ORG noted that the first applicant had confirmed at ORG hearing that NORP had not been violent towards the child and only later in the proceedings had she claimed that NORP had abused the child . ORG was in agreement with NORP \u2019s opinion that the first applicant had raised the accusation about the abuse of the child in order to justify her retention in GPE . The allegation of abuse had not been raised in GPE or immediately after the applicants\u2019 arrival in GPE ; it had only been made to the police on DATE . ORG considered the first applicant \u2019s allegations of abuse were not credible . The GPE mutual accusations indicated that there were strained relations between them but did not in themselves prove the existence of the grounds for refusing the return of the child under LAW ( b ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to ORG judgment of DATE , according to which a child could only not be returned on the basis of LAW ( b ) of LAW if this would result in extremely serious damage to the child \u2019s well - being . The harmful effects that could arise from the separation of the child from the parent could be avoided by the return of the child together with the parent in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to examine appeals lodged by the first applicant and the second applicant \u2019s representative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to reopen the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant received a bailiff \u2019s notice ( deposited on DATE ) , according to which the child had to be returned to GPE within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON made a request to ORG seeking the return of the child and a prohibition on her leaving GPE ; he also claimed sole custody of the child with visitation rights accorded to the first applicant . On CARDINAL DATE ORG suspended the proceedings . It appears that a time - limit was subsequently set for NORP to settle the case , regard also being had to the proceedings pending in GPE , and that the first applicant \u2019s submissions in LANGUAGE were not admitted by ORG . Pursuant to ORG provisional ruling of DATE , the first applicant was ordered to return the child to GPE to her father to whom sole custody of the child was accorded . In the event of her failure to do so she would lose her parental rights . ORG were requested to take the matter under their supervision and arrange the meetings between the child and the mother in a neutral environment as well as give the court feedback about the relationship between the child and each of the parents .", "CARDINAL . A hearing before ORG took place on DATE with the participation of the first applicant and NORP According to the first applicant , the court considered that she and the child should move into NORP \u2019s residence for DATE and stay there with NORP and a psychologist or psychiatrist of his choosing . Thereafter the mother \u2019s access rights to the child would be terminated and the child would remain under the supervision of social workers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in GPE , the NGO J\u00e4rva Naiste Varjupaik ( J\u00e4rva Women \u2019s Shelter ) reported NORP for sexually assaulting the second applicant on the basis of information received from the first applicant in the course of counselling . On DATE the first applicant was interviewed by a police investigator . She submitted that she had seen NORP sexually abusing their daughter in DATE . The first applicant further submitted that in DATE NORP had pushed her over while she had been holding the then DATE child .", "CARDINAL . A similar criminal investigation was opened in GPE on the basis of the first applicant \u2019s complaint of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the police informed ORG of the state of the investigation . According to the information provided , the first applicant \u2019s music teacher and NORP \u2019s former wife had been interviewed in DATE . The first applicant had talked to the music teacher about her problems with NORP and his parents and had also made comments about R. \u2019s behaviour towards their daughter . PERSON \u2019s former wife had described NORP as reliable and affectionate in a relationship , and said that he had never been violent , aggressive , disrespectful , controlling or jealous . What had been decisive for ending their marriage had been the influence that NORP \u2019s parents , particularly his father , had exercised over him . Such influence had never been contested by NORP who had had very strong ties , verging on dependence , with his family . She had also made reference to NORP \u2019s obsession with cleanliness . The police also examined a report by ORG in GPE concerning the second applicant \u2019s living conditions in GPE DATE which were described in positive terms \u2013 and information from the ORG child protection agency . In respect of the alleged sexual abuse , the police considered that there was a lack of information allowing this to be put into context and found that a precise understanding of the circumstances and sequence of the events was necessary for assessing their criminal relevance or their inappropriateness from a parental education point of view . The information available demonstrated the first applicant \u2019s difficulty in living with NORP , above all in relation to the interference and influence exercised by his father . At the same time , nothing had emerged to suggest that NORP was sexually deviant . Lastly , the police noted that there were separate criminal proceedings pending concerning child abduction and detention abroad in respect of the first applicant initiated on the basis of a complaint by NORP", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings have also been opened in GPE in respect of NORP \u2019s alleged violence towards the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant reported NORP to the NORP authorities for allegedly making a false accusation and using a forged document . It appears that NORP , in turn , has reported the first applicant for allegedly making a false accusation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ORG of ORG dealt with a case under LAW . It noted , inter alia , that as a rule , a child who had been wrongfully removed or retained in another Contracting State had to be promptly returned . Pursuant to LAW ( b ) a wrongfully removed or retained child could only not be returned in exceptional circumstances , that is when his or her return would cause extremely serious harm to the child \u2019s well - being . In this connection , the child \u2019s well - being had to be under extraordinary threat that was sufficiently specific and probable . An extensive interpretation of LAW ( b ) and other grounds for refusal to return a child would undermine the purpose of LAW . Proceeding from the above , ORG considered it impossible not to return the child concerned merely because the mother \u2019s care was important for an infant and the child had continuously been with the mother up until the material time and had no experience of living alone with the father . Since the dispute between the parties did not concern the child \u2019s place of residence but the return of the child under LAW , there was no need to resolve the question of which parent should be given priority in bringing up the child . The only matter to be determined was that of the child \u2019s prompt return . Under LAW the child was not to be returned to the other parent but , as a rule , simply returned to the country of his or her habitual residence . The harmful effects that could arise from the separation of the child from a parent could in most instances be avoided by the return of the child together with the parent , separation from whom could cause serious damage to the well - being of the child . ORG also noted that the risk to the child \u2019s well - being , referred to in the provision concerned , had to be proved .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW , which entered into force in respect of GPE on DATE , read , in so far as relevant , as follows .", "\u201c The objects of the present Convention are :", "( a ) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any ORG ; and", "( b ) to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of CARDINAL ORG are effectively respected in GPE . \u201d", "\u201c The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where DATE", "a ) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person , an institution or any other body , either jointly or alone , under the law of the ORG in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention ; and", "b ) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised , either jointly or alone , or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention .", "The rights of custody mentioned in sub - paragraph a ) above , may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision , or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that ORG . \u201d", "\u201c The Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident in a ORG immediately before any breach of custody or access rights . The Convention shall cease to apply when the child attains DATE . \u201d", "\u201c The judicial or administrative authorities of Contracting States shall act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children .", "If the judicial or administrative authority concerned has not reached a decision within DATE from the date of commencement of the proceedings , the applicant or ORG of the requested ORG , on its own initiative or if asked by ORG of the requesting ORG , shall have the right to request a statement of the reasons for the delay . If a reply is received by ORG of the requested ORG , that ORG shall transmit the reply to ORG of the requesting ORG , or to the applicant , as the case may be . \u201d", "\u201c Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of LAW and , at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of ORG where the child is , a period of DATE has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention , the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith .", "The judicial or administrative authority , even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of DATE referred to in the preceding paragraph , shall also order the return of the child , unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment .", "Where the judicial or administrative authority in the requested ORG has reason to believe that the child has been taken to another ORG , it may stay the proceedings or dismiss the application for the return of the child . \u201d", "\u201c Notwithstanding the provisions of DATE , the judicial or administrative authority of the requested ORG is not bound to order the return of the child if the person , institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that \u2013", "a ) the person , institution or other body having the care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention , or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention ; or", "b ) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation .", "The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views .", "In considering the circumstances referred to in this LAW , the judicial and administrative authorities shall take into account the information relating to the social background of the child provided by ORG or other competent authority of the child \u2019s habitual residence . \u201d", "\u201c A decision under this Convention concerning the return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue . \u201d", "\u201c The return of the child under the provisions of LAW may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested ORG relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
