ORG The applicants in this case ( who are hereinafter together referred to as \" S.T. \" ) are ORG , the publisher of the GPE national DATE newspaper ORG , and Mr PERSON , its editor . They complain of interlocutory injunctions imposed by the NORP courts on the publication of details of the book Spycatcher and information obtained from its author , Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG In litigation where the plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction against the defendant , the LANGUAGE courts have a discretion to grant the plaintiff an \" interlocutory injunction \" ( a temporary restriction pending the determination of the dispute at the substantive trial ) which is designed to protect his position in the interim . In that event the plaintiff will normally be required to give an undertaking to pay damages to the defendant should the latter succeed at the trial .", "The principles on which such injunctions will be granted - to which reference was made in the proceedings in the present case - were set out in ORG v. Ethicon Ltd([CARDINAL ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL ) and may be summarised as follows .", "( a ) It is not for the court at the interlocutory stage to seek to determine disputed issues of fact or to decide difficult questions of law which call for detailed argument and mature consideration .", "( b ) ORG the material before the court at that stage fails to disclose that the plaintiff has any real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction , the court should consider , in the light of the particular circumstances of the case , whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought .", "( c ) ORG If damages would be an adequate remedy for the plaintiff if he were to succeed at the trial , no interlocutory injunction should normally be granted . If , on the other hand , damages would not provide an adequate remedy for the plaintiff but would adequately compensate the defendant under the plaintiff \u2019s undertaking if the defendant were to succeed at the trial , there would be no reason to refuse an interlocutory injunction on this ground .", "( d ) It is where there is doubt as to the adequacy of the respective remedies in damages available to either party or both that the question of balance of convenience arises .", "( e ) ORG Where other factors appear evenly balanced , it is a counsel of prudence to take such measures as are calculated to preserve the status quo .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr PERSON was employed by ORG as a senior member of ORG ( MICARDINAL ) from DATE , when he resigned . Subsequently , without any authority from his former employers , he wrote his memoirs , entitled GPE , and made arrangements for their publication in GPE , where he was then living . The book dealt with the operational organisation , methods and personnel of MICARDINAL and also included an account of alleged illegal activities by ORG . He asserted therein , inter alia , that MICARDINAL conducted unlawful activities calculated to undermine the DATE ORG , burgled and \" bugged \" the embassies of allied and hostile countries and planned and participated in other unlawful and covert activities at home and abroad , and that Sir PERSON , who led MICARDINAL during the latter part of Mr PERSON \u2019s employment , was a NORP agent .", "PERSON had previously sought , unsuccessfully , to persuade ORG to institute an independent inquiry into these allegations . In DATE such an inquiry was also sought by , amongst others , a number of prominent members of the DATE ORG , but in vain .", "CARDINAL . ORG Part of the material in Spycatcher had already been published in a number of books about ORG written by PERSON . Moreover , in DATE PERSON had given a lengthy interview to ORG ( an independent television company operating in GPE ) about the work of the service and the programme was shown again in DATE . Other books and another television programme on the workings and secrets of the service were produced at about the same time , but little Government action was taken against the authors or the media .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE the Attorney General of GPE and GPE ( \" the Attorney General \" ) instituted , on behalf of ORG , proceedings in ORG , GPE , to restrain publication of ORG and of any information therein derived from PERSON work for ORG . The claim was based not on official secrecy but on the ground that the disclosure of such information by PERSON would constitute a breach of , notably , his duty of confidentiality under the terms of his employment . On DATE he and his publishers , ORG , gave undertakings , by which they abided , not to publish pending the hearing of the Government \u2019s claim for an injunction .", "Throughout the NORP proceedings the ORG objected to the book as such ; they declined to indicate which passages they objected to as being detrimental to national security .", "CARDINAL . ORG Whilst the NORP proceedings were still pending , the GPE national DATE newspaper ORG and the GPE national DATE newspaper ORG published , on DATE respectively , short articles on inside pages reporting on the forthcoming hearing in GPE and giving details of some of the contents of the manuscript of Spycatcher . These CARDINAL newspapers had for some time been conducting a campaign for an independent investigation into the workings of ORG . The details given included the following allegations of improper , criminal and unconstitutional conduct on the part of MICARDINAL officers :", "( a ) ORG MICARDINAL \" bugged \" all diplomatic conferences at ORG in GPE throughout DATE and DATE \u2019s , as well as the GPE independence negotiations in DATE ;", "( b ) ORG MICARDINAL \" bugged \" diplomats from GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , as well as Mr GPE \u2019s hotel suite during his visit to GPE in the DATE \u2019s , and was guilty of routine burglary and \" bugging \" ( including the entering of NORP consulates abroad ) ;", "( c ) ORG MICARDINAL plotted unsuccessfully to assassinate President PERSON of GPE at the time of the LOC crisis ;", "( d ) ORG MICARDINAL plotted against PERSON during his premiership from DATE ;", "( e ) ORG MICARDINAL ( contrary to its guidelines ) diverted its resources to investigate left - wing political groups in GPE .", "The Observer and ORG articles , which were written by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON and by Mr PERSON - PERSON respectively , were based on investigations by these journalists from confidential sources and not on generally available international press releases or similar material . However , much of the actual information in the articles had already been published elsewhere ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The LANGUAGE courts subsequently inferred that , on the balance of probabilities , the PERSON sources must have come from the offices of the publishers of ORG or the solicitors acting for them and the author ( see the judgment of DATE of Mr Justice PERSON ; paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Attorney General instituted proceedings for breach of confidence in ORG of ORG and GPE against ORG , the proprietors and publishers of the Observer , Mr PERSON , its editor , and PERSON and PERSON , and against ORG , the proprietors and publishers of The ORG , Mr PERSON , its editor , and Mr ORG .", "The Attorney General sought permanent injunctions against the defendants ( who are hereinafter together referred to as \" O.G. \" ) , restraining them from making any publication of Spycatcher material . He based his claim on the principle that the information in the memoirs was confidential and that a third party coming into possession of information knowing that it originated from a breach of confidence owed the same duty to the original confider as that owed by the original confidant . It was accepted that an award of damages would have been an insufficient and inappropriate remedy for the Attorney General and that only an injunction would serve his purpose .", "CARDINAL . ORG The evidential basis for the Attorney General \u2019s claim was CARDINAL affidavits sworn by Sir PERSON , Secretary to ORG , in the NORP proceedings on CARDINAL and DATE . He had stated therein , inter alia , that the publication of any narrative based on information available to PERSON as a member of ORG would cause unquantifiable damage , both to the service itself and to its officers and other persons identified , by reason of the disclosures involved . It would also undermine the confidence that friendly countries and other organisations and persons had in ORG and create a risk of other employees or former employees of that service seeking to publish similar information .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ex parte interim injunctions were granted to the Attorney General restraining any further publication of the kind in question pending the substantive trial of the actions . On an application by PERSON and after an inter partes hearing on DATE , Mr Justice PERSON ( sitting in ORG ) decided that these injunctions should remain in force , but with various modifications . The defendants were given liberty to apply to vary or discharge the orders on giving CARDINAL hours\u2019 notice .", "CARDINAL . ORG The reasons for Mr Justice PERSON \u2019s decision may be briefly summarised as follows .", "( a ) ORG by PERSON of information acquired as a member of ORG would constitute a breach of his duty of confidentiality .", "( b ) ORG wished to be free to publish further information deriving directly or indirectly from PERSON and disclosing alleged unlawful activity on the part of ORG , whether or not it had been previously published .", "( c ) ORG Neither the right to freedom of speech nor the right to prevent the disclosure of information received in confidence was absolute .", "( d ) ORG In resolving , as in the present case , a conflict between the public interest in preventing and the public interest in allowing such disclosure , the court had to take into account all relevant considerations , including the facts that this was an interlocutory application and not the trial of the action , that the injunctions sought at this stage were only temporary and that the refusal of injunctive relief might cause irreparable harm and effectively deprive the Attorney General of his rights . In such circumstances , the conflict should be resolved in favour of restraint , unless the court was satisfied that there was a serious defence of public interest that might succeed at the trial : an example would be when the proposed publication related to unlawful acts , the disclosure of which was required in the public interest . This could be regarded either as an exception to the NORP ORG principles ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) or their application in special circumstances where the public interest was invoked on both sides .", "( e ) ORG The Attorney General \u2019s principal objection was not to the dissemination of allegations about ORG but to the fact that those allegations were made by CARDINAL of its former employees , it being that particular fact which PERSON wished to publish . There was credible evidence ( in the shape of Sir PERSON affidavits ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that the appearance of confidentiality was essential to the operation of ORG and that the efficient discharge of its duties would be impaired , with consequent danger to national security , if senior officers were known to be free to disclose what they had learned whilst employed by it . Although this evidence remained to be tested at the substantive trial , the refusal of an interlocutory injunction would permit indirect publication and permanently deprive the Attorney General of his rights at the trial . Bearing in mind , inter alia , that the alleged unlawful activities had occurred some time in the past , there was , moreover , no compelling interest requiring publication immediately rather than after the trial .", "In the subsequent stages of the interlocutory proceedings , both ORG ( see paragraphs DATE below ) and all the members of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) considered that this initial grant of interim injunctions by Mr Justice PERSON was justified .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by PERSON and upheld the injunctions , with minor modifications . It referred to the NORP ORG principles ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and considered that Mr Justice PERSON had not misdirected himself or exercised his discretion on an erroneous basis . It refused leave to appeal to ORG . It also certified the case as fit for a speedy trial .", "As amended by ORG , the injunctions ( \" the PERSON injunctions \" ) restrained PERSON , until the trial of the action or further order , from :", "\" CARDINAL .

ORG On DATE the Vice - Chancellor decided the preliminary issue of law in the Independent case . He held that the reports that had appeared on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) could not , as a matter of law , amount to contempt of court because they were not in breach of the express terms of the PERSON injunctions and the CARDINAL newspapers concerned had not been a party to those injunctions or to a breach thereof by the persons they enjoined . The Attorney General appealed .", "CARDINAL .

ORG On DATE ORG published FAC in GPE ; some copies had , in fact , been put on sale on DATE . It was an immediate best - seller . ORG , which had been advised that proceedings to restrain publication in GPE would not succeed , took no legal action to that end either in that country or in GPE , where the book also became a best - seller .", "CARDINAL . ORG A substantial number of copies of the book were then brought into GPE , notably by NORP citizens who had bought it whilst visiting GPE or who had purchased it by telephone or post from NORP bookshops . The telephone number and address of such bookshops willing to deliver the book to GPE were widely advertised in that country . No steps to prevent such imports were taken by ORG , which formed the view that although a ban was within their powers , it was likely to be ineffective . They did , however , take steps to prevent the book \u2019s being available at GPE booksellers or public libraries .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG announced that it would reverse the judgment of the Vice - Chancellor in the Independent case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Its reasons , which were handed down on DATE , were basically as follows : the purpose of the PERSON injunctions was to preserve the confidentiality of the Spycatcher material until the substantive trial of the actions against PERSON ; the conduct of ORG , The London Evening Standard and ORG could , as a matter of law , constitute a criminal contempt of court because publication of that material would destroy that confidentiality and , hence , the subject - matter of those actions and therefore interfere with the administration of justice . ORG remitted the case to ORG for it to determine whether the CARDINAL newspapers had acted with the specific intent of so interfering ( sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused the defendants leave to appeal to ORG and they did not seek leave to appeal from the ORG itself . Neither did they apply to ORG for modification of the PERSON injunctions . The result of ORG decision was that those injunctions were effectively binding on all the NORP media , including ORG .", "CARDINAL . S.T. made it clear that , unless restrained by law , they would publish the second instalment of the serialisation of Spycatcher on DATE . On DATE the Attorney General applied for an injunction to restrain them from publishing further extracts , maintaining that this would constitute a contempt of court by reason of the combined effect of the PERSON injunctions and the decision in the NORP case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "On DATE the Vice - Chancellor granted a temporary injunction restraining publication by ORG until DATE . It was agreed that on DATE he would consider the application by PERSON for discharge of the PERSON injunctions ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and that , since they effectively bound PERSON as well , the latter would have a right to be heard in support of that application . It was further agreed that he would also hear the Attorney General \u2019s claim for an injunction against ORG and that that claim would fail if the PERSON injunctions were discharged .", "CARDINAL .

ORG In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that :", "( a ) ORG the Vice - Chancellor had erred in law in various respects , so that ORG could exercise its own discretion ;", "( b ) ORG in the light of the NORP publication of Spycatcher , it was inappropriate to continue the PERSON injunctions in their original form ;", "( c ) ORG it was , however , appropriate to vary these injunctions to restrain publication in the course of business of all or part of the book or other statements by or attributed to PERSON on security matters , but to permit \" a summary in very general terms \" of his allegations .", "The members of ORG considered that continuation of the injunctions would : serve to restore confidence in ORG by showing that memoirs could not be published without authority ( Sir PERSON , Master of the Rolls ) ; serve to protect the Attorney General \u2019s rights until the trial ( Lord Justice PERSON ) ; or fulfil the courts\u2019 duty of deterring the dissemination of material written in breach of confidence ( Lord Justice PERSON ) .", "ORG gave leave to all parties to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG After hearing argument from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE ( when neither side supported ORG compromise solution ) , ORG gave judgment on DATE , holding , by a majority of CARDINAL ( Lord PERSON of ORG , Lord Templeman and Lord PERSON ) to CARDINAL ( Lord Bridge of GPE - the immediate past Chairman of ORG - and Lord PERSON of GPE ) , that the PERSON injunctions should continue . In fact , they subsequently remained in force until the commencement of the substantive trial in the breach of confidence actions on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "The majority also decided that the scope of the injunctions should be widened by the deletion of part of the proviso that had previously allowed certain reporting of the NORP proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , since the injunctions would be circumvented if LANGUAGE newspapers were to reproduce passages from Spycatcher read out in open court . In the events that happened , this deletion had , according to the Government , no practical incidence on the reporting of the NORP proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG The members of ORG gave their written reasons on CARDINAL DATE ; they may be briefly summarised as follows .", "( a ) Lord PERSON of ORG", "( i ) The object of the Attorney General \u2019s actions against PERSON was the protection of an important public interest , namely the maintenance as far as possible of the secrecy of ORG ; as was recognised in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the right to freedom of expression was subject to certain exceptions , including the protection of national security .", "( ii ) The injunctions in issue were only temporary , being designed to hold the ring until the trial , and their continuation did not prejudge the decision to be made at the trial on the claim for final injunctions .", "( iii ) The view taken in the courts below , before the NORP publication , that the Attorney General had a strong arguable case for obtaining final injunctions at the trial was not really open to challenge .", "( iv ) Publication in GPE had weakened that case , but it remained arguable ; it was not clear whether , as a matter of law , that publication had caused the newspapers\u2019 duty of non - disclosure to lapse . Although the major part of the potential damage adverted to by Sir PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had already been done , the courts might still be able to take useful steps to reduce the risk of similar damage by other ORG employees in the future . This risk was so serious that the courts should do all they could to minimise it .", "( v ) The only way to determine the Attorney General \u2019s case justly and to strike the proper balance between the public interests involved was to hold a substantive trial at which evidence would be adduced and subjected to cross - examination .", "( vi ) Immediate discharge of the injunctions would completely destroy the Attorney General \u2019s arguable case at the interlocutory stage , without his having had the opportunity of having it tried on appropriate evidence .", "( vii ) Continuing the injunctions until the trial would , if the Attorney General \u2019s claims then failed , merely delay but not prevent the newspapers\u2019 right to publish information which , moreover , related to events that had taken place DATE in the past .", "( viii ) In the overall interests of justice , a course which could only result in temporary and in no way irrevocable damage to the cause of the newspapers was to be preferred to CARDINAL which might result in permanent and irrevocable damage to the cause of the Attorney General .", "( b ) Lord Templeman ( who agreed with the observations of Lords PERSON and PERSON )", "( i ) The appeal involved a conflict between the right of the public to be protected by ORG and its right to be supplied with full information by the press . It therefore involved consideration of the LAW , the question being whether the interference constituted by the injunctions was , on DATE , necessary in a NORP society for one or more of the purposes listed in DATE . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) .", "( ii ) In terms of the LAW , the restraints were necessary in the interests of national security , for protecting the reputation or rights of others , for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence and for maintaining the authority of the judiciary . The restraints would prevent harm to ORG , notably in the form of the mass circulation , both now and in the future , of accusations to which its members could not respond . To discharge the injunctions would surrender to the press the power to evade a court order designed to protect the confidentiality of information obtained by a member of the ORG .", "( c ) Lord PERSON ( who agreed with the observations of Lord PERSON )", "( i ) It was accepted by all members of ORG that : the Attorney General had an arguable case for a permanent injunction ; damages were a worthless remedy for the ORG which , if the PERSON injunctions were not continued , would lose forever the prospect of obtaining permanent injunctions at the trial ; continuation of the PERSON injunctions was not a \" final locking - out \" of the press which , if successful at the trial , would then be able to publish material that had no present urgency ; there was a real public interest , that required protection , concerned with the efficient functioning of ORG and it extended , as was not challenged by the newspapers , to discouraging the use of the GPE market for the dissemination of unauthorised memoirs of ORG officers .", "( ii ) It would thus be a denial of justice to refuse to allow the injunctions to continue until the trial , for that would sweep aside the public - interest factor without any trial and would prematurely and permanently deny the Attorney General any protection from the courts .", "( d ) Lord Bridge of GPE", "( i ) The case in favour of maintaining the PERSON injunctions - which had been properly granted in the first place - would not be stronger at the trial than it was now ; it would be absurd to continue them temporarily if no case for permanent injunctions could be made out .", "( ii ) Since the Spycatcher allegations were now freely available to the public , it was manifestly too late for the injunctions to serve the interest of national security in protecting sensitive information .", "( iii ) It could be assumed that the Attorney General could still assert a bare duty binding on the newspapers , but the question was whether the PERSON injunctions could still protect an interest of national security of sufficient weight to justify the resultant encroachment on freedom of speech . The argument that their continuation would have a deterrent effect was of minimal weight .", "( iv ) The attempt to insulate the NORP public from information freely available elsewhere was a significant step down the road to censorship characteristic of a totalitarian regime and , if pursued , would lead to the ORG \u2019s condemnation and humiliation by ORG .", "( e ) Lord PERSON of GPE", "( i ) Mr Justice PERSON \u2019s initial order was entirely correct .", "( ii ) The injunctions had originally been imposed to preserve the confidentiality of what were at the time unpublished allegations , but that confidentiality had now been irrevocably destroyed by the publication of Spycatcher . It was questionable whether it was right to use the injunctive remedy against the newspapers ( who had not been concerned with that publication ) for the remaining purpose which the injunctions might serve , namely punishing PERSON and providing an example to others .", "( iii ) The newspapers had presented their arguments on the footing that the Attorney General still had an arguable case for the grant of permanent injunctions and there was force in the view that the difficult and novel point of law involved should not be determined without further argument at the trial . However , in the light of the public availability of the Spycatcher material , it was difficult to see how it could be successfully argued that the newspapers should be permanently restrained from publishing it and the case of the Attorney General was unlikely to improve in the meantime . No arguable case for permanent injunctions at the trial therefore remained and the PERSON injunctions should accordingly be discharged .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG of Appeal delivered judgment dismissing the Attorney General \u2019s appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; the majority held that his claim was not justiciable in an NORP court since it involved either an attempt to enforce indirectly the public laws of a foreign ORG or a determination of the question whether publication would be detrimental to the public interest in GPE .", "The Attorney General appealed to ORG of GPE . In view of the publication of ORG in GPE and elsewhere , that court declined to grant temporary injunctions restraining its publication in GPE pending the hearing ; it was published in that country on DATE .
