On DATE ORG \u2019s GPE office was searched by ORG ( ORG \u0420\u0424 \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The ORG seized the draft report , interrogated the applicant and instituted criminal proceedings on suspicion of treason , since the draft report allegedly contained information , classified as officially secret , concerning accidents on NORP nuclear submarines .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s trial on a charge of treason through espionage and a charge of aggravated disclosure of an official secret began before GPE . After DATE of hearings , the case was remitted for further investigation on DATE . The court considered that the indictment was vague , which impaired the applicant \u2019s defence and prevented the court from carrying out an examination on the merits . It also found that the investigation file left open the question whether the report contained any official secrets as such , and that it did not contain a \u201c proper and complete \u201d expert evaluation of possible public sources of the information in question or of the estimated damage . The court ordered the prosecution to conduct an additional expert examination into the possibility that the applicant had obtained the disputed information from public sources and to take other steps to complete the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution appealed against this decision , claiming that the case was clear enough for determination by a court and that there was no need for further investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the order for further investigation was upheld by ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE resumed the applicant \u2019s trial on the same charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE acquitted the applicant on all the charges , having found that the applicant had been prosecuted on the basis of secret and retroactive decrees .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the acquittal . The court found that the charges were based on secret and retroactive decrees which were incompatible with the LAW . The acquittal thus became final .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Procurator General filed a request with the Presidium of ORG to review the case in supervisory proceedings ( \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 , \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0443 ) . He challenged the judgment on the grounds of wrongful application of the law governing official secrets , the vagueness of the indictment DATE which had led to procedural prejudice against the applicant \u2013 and other defects in the criminal investigation , in particular the lack of an expert report as to whether the disputed information had originated from public sources . He called for a reassessment of the applicable law and of the facts and evidence in the case file , and for the case \u2019s remittal for fresh investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG dismissed the Procurator General \u2019s request and upheld the acquittal . While it acknowledged that the investigation had been tainted with flaws and shortcomings , it found that the prosecution could not rely on them in calling for a remittal , as it had been entirely within the prosecution \u2019s control to redress them at an earlier stage in the proceedings . Moreover , the ORG pointed out that the investigation authority had earlier been required to remedy exactly the same defects as those relied on in the request to quash the acquittal . It observed that on DATE the court had expressly instructed the investigating authority , inter alia , to conduct a study of information in the public domain in order to ascertain whether the applicant could have obtained the disputed data from public sources .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE examined the applicant \u2019s challenge to the laws which allowed supervisory review of a final acquittal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its ruling of the same date , ORG declared incompatible with the LAW the legislative provisions permitting the re - examination and quashing of an acquittal on the grounds of a prejudicial or incomplete investigation or court hearing or on the ground of inaccurate assessment of the facts of the case , save in cases where new evidence had emerged or there had been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court \u2019s judgment stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... LAW provides that the right not to be tried or punished twice does not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law and criminal procedure of the ORG concerned , if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts , or if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings , which could affect the outcome of the case .", "It follows ... that , subject to the above requirements , the national legislation may provide for a system by which a case may be reopened and a final judgment be quashed , and may specify where , depending on the case , a procedure for reopening on the grounds of new or newly discovered evidence or a supervisory review should apply .", "Any exemption from the general prohibition on resuming proceedings to the detriment of the acquitted or convicted person may be justified only in exceptional circumstances , where a failure to rectify a miscarriage of justice would undermine the very essence of justice and the purpose of a verdict as a judicial act and would upset the required balance between the constitutionally protected values involved , including the rights and legitimate interests of convicted persons and those of the victims of crime . In the absence of any possibility of reversing a final judgment resulting from proceedings tainted by a fundamental defect that was crucial for the outcome of the case , an erroneous judgment of this type would continue to have effect notwithstanding the principle of general fairness ... and the principle of judicial protection of fundamental rights and freedoms .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW and the LAW ] any possibility provided for at national level of quashing a final judgment and reviewing a criminal case must be subject to strict conditions and criteria clearly defining the grounds for such review , given that the judgment concerned is already binding and determinative of the individual \u2019s guilt and sentence .", "However , the grounds for review of final judgments provided for in LAW [ of DATE ] go beyond these limits . When establishing a procedure for the review of final convictions and , especially , acquittals ... definite grounds should have been formulated to ensure that such a procedure would be implemented with sufficient distinctness , precision and clarity to exclude its arbitrary application by the courts . In failing to do so , [ the legislature ] misapplied the criteria which derive from [ the LAW ] and LAW quashing of final judgments in criminal cases ...", "Furthermore , [ the power ] of a supervisory instance to remit a case for fresh investigation where it concludes , through its own assessment of evidence , that the previous investigation has been prejudicial or incomplete , is incompatible with the constitutional principles of criminal procedure and with ORG jurisprudence , in that it gives the prosecution an unfair advantage by providing it with additional opportunities to establish guilt even after the relevant judgment has become operative . It follows that a court of supervisory instance can not quash a final acquittal only on the ground of its being unfounded ... Accordingly , the prosecutor is not entitled to request the supervisory review of such a judgment on the ground that it is unfounded ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
