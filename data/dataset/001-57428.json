On CARDINAL DATE , the chairman of ORG for co - ordinating the disbandment of the NORP / LAW ( ORG ) and the ORG ( ORG ) \" ordered the applicant \u2019s immediate arrest on the grounds that he was a \" dangerous reactionary \" and that it was necessary to \" investigate his reactionary activities \" . At the time , following the attempted coup of CARDINAL DATE , GPE was going through a difficult period , which lasted until the adoption of the new LAW on DATE .", "Having learned that he was about to be arrested , the applicant fled to GPE with his family and did not return to GPE until DATE , after the warrant for his arrest had been revoked .", "CARDINAL . ORG In his absence the employees of his civil - engineering firm took over the company and other assets of his , including his house , furniture and bank accounts . On DATE , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s business insolvent . Furthermore , ORG , a public bank from which the applicant had bought his house , repossessed the house for default on payment and sold it to someone else .", "The applicant was later able to reach a friendly settlement and recover possession of the house on payment of certain sums to the bank and to the other person involved .", "CARDINAL .

He contended that the warrant for his arrest had been illegal as it did not specify an offence and did not have a \" proper purpose \" . The applicant claimed CARDINAL escudos in compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "DATE , the court registered the originating application ( peti\u00e7\u00e3o inicial ) and issued a summons to the defendant - represented by ORG ( minist\u00e9rio p\u00fablico ) - requesting a reply within DATE , in accordance with Article QUANTITY Civil Procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

The court granted the application on DATE . CARDINAL further applications for exceptional DATE extensions were made by ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , on the ground that he did not yet have all the material with which to prepare his reply . The court granted these applications on DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant complained to the court of this series of extensions and requested copies of some of the documents in the file in order to complain to ORG and to ORG breach of LAW ( article DATE ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , he lodged notice of an appeal against an interlocutory order ( de agravo - \" interlocutory appeal \" ) to ORG ( Supremo Tribunal Administrativo ) in respect of ORG decision of DATE in allowing ORG more time .

Such an extension of time could not be granted by the court arbitrarily , but only on exceptional grounds , and it could not exceed DATE . Yet on this occasion DATE had passed without ORG submitting his pleadings or giving valid reasons for not doing so .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG applied for another exceptional DATE extension on the ground that ORG had moved into other LOC and that for a time this had halted his office \u2019s work . When invited by the court on DATE to comment on this application , the applicant replied - on CARDINAL DATE - that he considered it unjustified ; he further demanded that it should be refused and that the time allowed to ORG should be declared to have expired .", "CARDINAL . ORG State Counsel \u2019s pleadings were filed with ORG on DATE and immediately forwarded to Mr. PERSON by the registrar of the court .", "In the belief that ORG had decided to include these in the file and have a copy served on him , the applicant lodged with that court notice of an interlocutory appeal to ORG on DATE and requested that the appeal should be forwarded immediately to the higher court and should have suspensive effect .", "On DATE , the applicant nevertheless filed his reply ( r\u00e9plica ) to the pleadings lodged by ORG , who made a rejoinder ( tr\u00e9plica ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG submitted his observations ( contra - alega\u00e7\u00f5es ) on the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal of DATE . As grounds for the requested extensions , he alleged the need not only to assemble evidence but more particularly to decide on the general thrust of his pleadings , especially as regards objections . Moreover , there was no requirement under LAW of LAW to give detailed reasons for his application ; a general justification was sufficient . Admittedly , LAW required the court to remove any hindrance delaying the proceedings , but that was a discretionary power which in the present case could not be usefully exercised .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG reversed its decision of CARDINAL DATE to allow ORG more time and instead refused the application .

ORG On DATE , under LAW of LAW , the applicant lodged a complaint against this decision . He argued that , as ORG pleadings had been withdrawn from the case file , all the allegations he had made in his own statement of claim were to be regarded as admitted , since LAW sub - paragraph ( b ) and LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been abrogated by LAW ( article LAW , which laid down the principle of equality of arms . Consequently , all the matters which the court had considered needed clarification at the hearing should have been put in the especifica\u00e7\u00e3o as having been conceded .", "ORG comments on the complaint were lodged with the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the registrar submitted the file to the court , and on DATE the judge dismissed the complaint , apologising for the delay caused by his absence abroad on official business from DATE . He acknowledged that the applicant \u2019s arguments were lent support by a learned article and by a court decision at first instance ; but the latter had been set aside by ORG on DATE , and he stated his agreement with that court \u2019s decision : ORG had less opportunity to meet those it represented , particularly where the defendant was a ORG body . In addition , the law , in order to be fair , sometimes had to treat the parties differently if they were not to be equal on paper only ; the principle of equality of arms entailed compensating for initial inequality - for example , by providing legal aid or setting more generous time - limits in the case of persons resident in a distant country or whose whereabouts were unknown .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG was in any case differently placed from private companies . Accordingly , not all Mr. PERSON \u2019s submissions as to the facts were to be regarded as having been conceded ; it was for ORG to consider them in the light of evidence adduced at the hearing .", "CARDINAL .
