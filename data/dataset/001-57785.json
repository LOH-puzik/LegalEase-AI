GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-4;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr GPE is a NORP citizen who has been living in GPE since DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after proceedings had been instituted against the applicant with a view to his confinement in a psychiatric hospital , he was provisionally detained in such an institution .", "On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) , before which the applicant was represented by officially - appointed counsel , ordered that he be detained in a psychiatric hospital , pursuant to LAW . The court found that he had performed acts which constituted criminal offences ( insulting behaviour , assault occasioning bodily harm , resisting the police , causing a traffic hazard and unauthorised departure from the scene of an accident ) but that he could not be held responsible because he was suffering from a schizophrenic psychosis with signs of paranoia . Relying in particular on a medical expert \u2019s opinion , the court stated that ORG posed a danger to the general public because it had to be expected that he would commit further serious unlawful acts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) , in one of numerous proceedings instituted by the applicant concerning his detention , declared that he was incapable of conducting ( betreiben ) court proceedings himself . The court considered that his mental illness was so obvious that it was not necessary to order an expert opinion on the point .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and again on CARDINAL DATE ORG , referring to LAW . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , directed that the detention should continue . In the latter decision the court found that Mr GPE \u2019s delusions had become more severe and suggested that guardianship proceedings ( GPE ) be instituted against him .", "On DATE Mr Megyeri , who had tried to have the criminal proceedings against him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) reopened , asked ORG to replace the lawyer who had acted for him in those proceedings ; he also asked why that lawyer had not been present when his detention had subsequently been reviewed . The court informed him in writing , on DATE , that there was no legal provision to the effect that counsel had to be officially assigned to detainees in review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again considered the applicant \u2019s possible release on probation under LAW . CARDINAL of LAW and decided against it . Referring to its decision of CARDINAL DATE , it found that it was too early to put to the test whether he would no longer commit offences if he were not in hospital . It relied in particular on a written report by CARDINAL experts , including CARDINAL doctors from the hospital , according to which Mr GPE \u2019s state of mental health had further deteriorated , he was not willing to undergo treatment and he showed a distinct propensity towards aggressive behaviour and violence . It also relied on its own impression of the applicant , formed when it heard him on DATE , on which occasion he had made numerous complaints and claimed to be someone else . Referring to recent case - law of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s continued detention was proportionate to the aim pursued , that is the protection of the public . It also noted that proceedings with a view to placing him under guardianship were pending .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed Mr GPE \u2019s immediate appeal ( sofortige Beschwerde ) against ORG decision .", "The applicant was not represented by counsel in the DATE proceedings concerning his possible release . Whilst he had previously raised the question of legal assistance ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , he apparently did not specifically ask ORG or ORG to assign counsel to him and this point was not mentioned in their decisions . According to ORG , it was to be assumed , since NORP law required the appointment of counsel in certain circumstances , that those courts had considered the matter of their own motion .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG ( which , in accordance with its usual practice in such cases , had not held a hearing ) declined to accept for adjudication the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( ORG ) against the decisions of ORG and ORG , on the ground that it did not offer sufficient prospects of success . ORG considered that there could be no objection under constitutional law to the fact that the courts had not assigned defence counsel in the DATE proceedings , since it had not until then been obvious that the applicant could not defend himself due to his illness ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It added , however , that having regard to the stabilising clinical situation and the fact that the end of his detention was not foreseeable , the appointment of an official lawyer would in future come into the picture ( in Betracht kommen wird ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG ( ORG ) decided to place Mr GPE under guardianship . After hearing the applicant and having regard to an expert opinion of DATE , it found that he was suffering from a serious mental illness that prevented him from dealing with his private affairs .", "CARDINAL . In subsequent review proceedings after DATE the applicant was represented by court - appointed counsel . Continuation of his detention was ordered by ORG on DATE , but it reduced to DATE the period for a further review as it was expected that medical treatment would lead to an improvement in his state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which regarded as particularly relevant the fact that Mr GPE was now under guardianship , directed that he be released on probation as from CARDINAL DATE . It fixed a period of DATE for supervision of his conduct and instructed him not to leave specified accommodation without the supervisory agency \u2019s approval .", "CARDINAL . Since then , the applicant has been living in an open ward of a psychiatric hospital in GPE . His requests for restoration of his legal capacity have , to date , been rejected , on the ground that his condition has not improved .", "CARDINAL . The following provisions of LAW ) are relevant in the present case .", "\" Where there is no provision for a maximum period ... , the court shall suspend on probation the further execution of the detention as soon as the detainee can responsibly be allowed out of the psychiatric hospital to see whether he will desist from further unlawful acts . Suspension shall be followed by supervision of conduct . \"", "\" ( CARDINAL ) The court may at any time review the question of whether the further execution of the detention should be suspended on probation . It shall review this before the expiry of certain periods .", "( CARDINAL ) The periods shall be :", "- ...", "- [ for detention ] in a psychiatric hospital , DATE ;", "- ... \"", "CARDINAL . According to case - law of ORG ( decision of CARDINAL DATE - CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL - Entscheidungssammlung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , the principle of proportionality governs the detention of a person in a psychiatric hospital and its continuance . When deciding whether to suspend on probation the further execution of such detention , the court has to consider in particular the risk of significant ( erhebliche ) criminal offences , the detainee \u2019s previous conduct and criminal behaviour , relevant changes in the circumstances since his detention was ordered and the detainee \u2019s future living conditions . The longer the detention in a psychiatric hospital lasts , the stricter the test of proportionality becomes .", "CARDINAL . The question of the defence of an accused by counsel is governed by LAW ) . Paragraph CARDINAL lists a number of specific cases in which the participation of counsel is obligatory ; paragraph CARDINAL provides :", "\" In other cases , the presiding judge , upon request or ex officio , shall appoint a defence counsel if , having regard to the seriousness of the crime or the difficulty of the factual or legal issues involved , the assistance of a defence counsel appears to be necessary , or if it is obvious that the accused can not defend himself ... \"", "Paragraph CARDINAL is applied by analogy to review proceedings under LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
