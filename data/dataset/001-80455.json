On DATE the department initiated criminal proceedings against Mr M.", "CARDINAL . On DATE both criminal cases were joined . On DATE ORG terminated the criminal proceedings on the ground of absence of corpus delicti in the actions of Mr B.I. and Mr M. The police established that Mr M. had not been a member of the ORG in DATE . It also found that there were CARDINAL different copies of the decision of the general assembly of ORG , CARDINAL of which confirmed the membership of PERSON and contained his name instead of the name of PERSON , the latter being mentioned in the other copy of that decision . The police held that the existence of CARDINAL different versions was of no importance , as none of the copies had been duly certified by a notary . It further stated that , according to the expert examination of the sales contract of DATE , the contract had been forged by way of combination of CARDINAL printed texts . The police also found that the contract had no binding force , as it had not been certified by a notary or by the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

After her husband 's death she inherited his property , including the left part of the house . The construction works were carried out at her and her late husband 's expense . She further argued that , although her son had initially agreed to sell the part of the house to Mr M. , the latter had refused to pay the price , upon which they had agreed . Thus , the left part of the house was not sold to Mr M.", "CARDINAL . Mr M. , in his turn , argued that in DATE he had bought from Mr B.I. the foundation of the left part of the house and some construction materials , which formally belonged to Mr B. P. Mr PERSON further argued that they had agreed that Mr B. I. would complete the construction works . The latter having failed to do so , Mr PERSON built the left part of the house at his own cost . DATE , Mr M. paid Mr B. I. around NORP CARDINAL by instalments . Following this , Mr PERSON refused to pay Mr B. I. higher amounts , as he had completed the construction works himself .

CARDINAL karbovanets ( the former transitional currency of GPE before DATE ) for the left part of the house and that the latter had built that part of the house and reimbursed the money , which Mr B. I. had paid for the construction materials . Mr M. alleged that Mr B. I. had signed these documents as the head of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , in reply , contended that the documents , submitted by PERSON M. in support of his claim that he had constructed the house and that he had purchased it , including the contract of DATE , had been forged .

The ORG submitted that its decision of DATE was lawful , as Mr M. had provided it with the documents which had proved that he had constructed the left part of the house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found for the applicant and quashed the ORG 's decision of DATE . It further ordered the ORG to grant the applicant the right to use the land at issue for an indefinite period of time . The court held that Mr M. had not qualified to be granted that right , as he had not been a member of the ORG and there was no information in the notary 's register that the ORG had transferred the plot of land in question to him .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed in cassation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed ORG of GPE about the ORG 's request for the case to be transferred to another court . The ORG alleged that the applicant 's son was a member of the family of CARDINAL of the judges of ORG . On DATE ORG ordered that the appeal in cassation against the first instance court 's decision was to be heard by ORG , instead of ORG . The applicant was not informed either about the ORG 's request or about the decision of ORG to reassign the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Moreover , the parties failed to submit documentary evidence in support of their claims for ownership rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered ORG to transfer the case to ORG , the latter being responsible for selecting a first instance court to reconsider the case . According to the Government , ORG did not comply with the instructions of ORG and did not transfer the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found for the applicant . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the first instance court . The courts of both instances held that there was enough evidence that Mr ORG had been a member of the ORG . This fact had been established by ORG in its judgment of DATE , which had not been appealed against and had become final , and the applicant could not be held responsible for the absence of other documents proving the membership of her deceased husband . The courts also held that the decision of the general assembly of ORG had , in fact , provided for the transfer of certain objects situated on the plot of land at issue , i.e. the foundation and some construction materials , erroneously referring to them as a building . With regard to the sales contract of DATE , the courts stated that Mr PERSON had not been entitled to sell the left part of the house , irrespective of whether he had acted in his capacity as the head of the ORG or as a private person . They also referred to the findings of the police of DATE that the contract had been falsified . Similarly , they found that the documents submitted by PERSON , in particular a copy of the decision of the general assembly of ORG , stating that he had been one of its members and had been granted the left part of the building , and the receipts in respect of the construction expenses were not valid . In any event , a contribution to the construction expenses could not be a valid ground for an ownership claim .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the Deputy President of ORG requested ORG to send the case file to ORG for supervisory review . By the same letter , he informed the ORG and PERSON that the execution of the judgment of DATE was suspended .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG allowed the protest , quashed the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , and remitted the case for a fresh consideration . It held that there was no evidence that the left part of the house was owned by either the ORG or Mr B.P. Moreover , there was no information as to the latter 's membership of that ORG , and the lower courts had not verified whether the house had been erected by him in compliance with relevant regulations . The panel further stated that the first instance court had failed to take into consideration the written testimonies of the persons , who had participated in the construction of the house . It stressed that its findings should be taken into account in the new consideration of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found for the applicant . The court for the most part reiterated the findings contained in the decision of DATE . It also held that the ORG had been the owner of every construction object on the land at issue before it transferred the title to these objects to its members , including Mr B.P. On DATE ORG upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy President of ORG lodged a protest with ORG of that court , seeking again the initiation of supervisory review proceedings in the applicant 's case . On DATE the panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG allowed the protest , quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE , and remitted the case for a fresh consideration . It held that the lower courts had failed to take into account the instructions contained in its decision of DATE . The panel reiterated that the first instance court had failed either to verify whether the ORG had been the owner of the objects in question ; whether the ORG had been in fact liquidated and , if so , when it had been liquidated ; whether the ORG had been granted a construction permit ; or to establish who had actually constructed the part of the house at issue . The panel found that the ORG had not had authority to transfer the land to third parties and its members had not had rights to build houses on that land . It finally held that Mr M. had in fact obtained the plot of land at issue as well as all the documentation in respect of the left part of the house , which remained in his actual possession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following the request of Mr M. , invited ORG to assign the case to CARDINAL of the first instance courts in the GPE region . On DATE the regional court transferred the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr M. lodged a counter claim , seeking recognition of his ownership rights in respect of the left part of the house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of Mr M. and rejected the applicant 's claims . It held that Mr M. had lawfully bought the foundation of the left part of the building and had completed the construction himself , which was supported by the evidence examined in the proceedings . In particular , the court stated that the contract of DATE was valid , as it had been seized by the police from the flat of PERSON in DATE , and the CARDINAL documents of DATE were , according to the expert 's conclusions , also valid . The court further noted that the written testimonies , certified by a notary , of CARDINAL witnesses , who had carried out construction works , and Mr NORP , who had been heard by the court as a witness , confirmed that PERSON PERSON had built the left part of the house at his own cost . The court also relied on the letter of CARDINAL DATE , submitted by PERSON M. , in which ORG stated that , according to the conclusions of its inquiry into the matter , the left part of the house was built by Mr M. The court also found that the latter was in actual possession of that part of the house , as he had been paying all the communal charges in its respect . The court refused to admit as evidence copies of the bills of costs in respect of construction materials , submitted by the applicant , on the ground that it was not possible to establish whether these construction materials had been used to build the left part of the house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to transfer the case to another court on the grounds that it would be difficult for her to participate in the hearings before ORG with regard to her age and state of health , on one hand , and the distance between her place of residence and the place of the hearing , on the other . On DATE ORG rejected her request as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE . It also considered that Mr B.P. had not been a member of the ORG , as there were no documents proving his membership and he had resided in another location .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings before ORG and ORG , the applicant requested the courts to summon the witnesses , on whose written statements PERSON PERSON had relied to show that he had constructed the left part of the building . She argued that these testimonies were false and that some of these witnesses could confirm her submissions that certain construction works had been carried out at her and her late husband 's expense . The courts did not reply to her request .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged an appeal in cassation against the decisions of DATE and DATE under the new transitional cassation procedure . She complained of the lower courts ' incorrect assessment of the evidence . The applicant also argued that the courts had refused to summon the witnesses on whose written testimonies they had relied in their decisions . She maintained that neither she nor her representative had had an opportunity to question these witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG considered the merits of the applicant 's appeal in cassation and rejected it . ORG held that Mr M. had lawfully purchased a part of the foundation of the building and had valid grounds to use the plot of land on which the left part of the building had been constructed . The court also held that the written statements of the witnesses , confirming that Mr M. had completed the construction , had been lawfully admitted as evidence in the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant and Mr B. I. instituted another set of proceedings in the ORG against Mr M. , CARDINAL other members of the family of PERSON M. , and ORG , seeking the annulment of the ownership certificate of Mr M. in respect of the house . The applicant and Mr B. ORG also sought the annulment of certain other official documents , in which it was mentioned that PERSON M. had built a part of the house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court found against the applicant and Mr B. I. On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , ORG and ORG upheld the decision of the first instance court .", "CARDINAL .
