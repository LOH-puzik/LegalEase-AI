{"ITEMID": "001-81239", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "PAUL v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who lives in Lebrade .", ", may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a farmer and horse breeder . During DATE , CARDINAL of his horses were on a paddock near a sewage treatment plant operated by the Lebrade municipality . In DATE , after he had returned the horses from the paddock , the applicant noted alterations to the horses\u2019 hide at the croup , the neck and the back . Subsequently , some horses suffered from diarrhoea and lameness . DATE and DATE , all horses except CARDINAL died naturally or had to be put down .", "The applicant subsequently sued the municipality . After he had filed an objection to a default judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed his claim on DATE . It found that , irrespective of the legal basis for his claim and whether chemical or biological substances from the plant had reached the applicant \u2019s property , the applicant had not established that there was a causal link between the impact of the sewage plant and the horses\u2019 diseases . An expert opinion prepared for the court had concluded that there was hardly any available medical evidence which could clarify the cause of the death of the horses with any certainty . ORG heard CARDINAL veterinary surgeons who were familiar with horse diseases but found that none of them had established a reason for the horses\u2019 demise : there was no support for the applicant \u2019s suspicion that corrosive vapours from the plant had reached the skin of the horses , and it was not likely that the skin diseases of the animals had been caused by a form of corrosion . Rather , it was likely that the animals had died from enteritis caused by salmonellae . ORG also noted that the applicant had filed a motion to hear the expert in person during the court hearing , but had not sufficiently substantiated his criticism of the expert \u2019s findings .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that ORG had no reason to obtain a further expert opinion or to hear the expert in person . The applicant had not submitted substantiated claims concerning the extent of the plant \u2019s emissions or concerning the link between the alleged emissions and the damage . ORG found that section CARDINAL of LAW , which provides for a shifting of the burden of proof if a facility listed in LAW is inherently capable of causing the damage ( see Relevant domestic law , below ) , did not apply because the sewage plant was not listed in DATE the LAW . ORG also considered that the applicant had not sufficiently substantiated how the plant could possibly produce corrosive vapours and how they could reach his property , which was not located in the prevailing wind direction . Thus , ORG saw no need to obtain further evidence at the appeal stage .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint on DATE .", "Relevant provisions of LAW of DATE :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Facility liability for environmental impacts", "If a person suffers death or injury to his body or health , or if property is damaged , due to an environmental impact that issues from one of the facilities named in DATE , then the operator of the facility shall be liable to the injured person for the damage caused thereby .", "CARDINAL . Presumption of causation", "( CARDINAL ) If a facility is inherently capable , on the facts of the particular case , of causing the damage that occurred , then it shall be presumed that this facility caused the damage . Inherent capability in a particular case is determined on the basis of the course of business , the structures used , the nature and concentration of the materials used and released , the weather conditions , the time and place at which the damage occurred , the nature of the damage , as well as all other conditions which speak for or against causation of the damage in the particular case .", "( CARDINAL ) Paragraph ( CARDINAL ) shall not apply if the facility has been properly operated . A proper operation is present if the special operational duties have been complied with and no disruption of operations has occurred .", "... \u201d", "The sewage treatment plant operated by the defendant municipality is not among the facilities listed in DATE to LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
