In many cases it is clearly right for a court in discharging its responsibilities to have regard solely or mainly to the needs of the offender , but the present case in my view is one of such magnitude that I can not only have regard to such needs . It is true , to send you to ORG would involve you being kept under secure conditions and to that extent would keep the public from you . But there are other matters which I must take into account in the public interest , not the least of which is to make it clear that crimes of this kind committed against ordinary housewives in their ordinary homes doing their every day business while their men - folk are away at work are such as must , when brought home to a particular offender , be dealt with in such a way as to make plain that the law is concerned and ever will be concerned to protect people who suffer as you caused these women to suffer by these quite appalling sexual attacks that you made upon them . Punishment must be an element in this case , and that punishment can only be achieved by imprisonment . Imprisonment will afford security to the public from you , and the Home Secretary has ample power if and when the need for treatment arises , to transfer you to any institution where such treatment can be received .", "In my judgment there is CARDINAL sentence which is appropriate in this case , and I will deal with count CARDINAL first .

More important , it has to be observed that this dangerous psychopath has already been released on licence from ORG . Bearing the interests of the public in mind , this court thinks it far safer that he should be kept in prison for as long as is necessary rather than he should be left to be dealt with as a hospital might deal with him , on a doctor and patient relationship under which it might be considered safe for him to be free , whereas from the public angle he remains a menace .", "This court is quite satisfied that the sentence was right and the application is refused . \"", "CARDINAL .

There are no statutory conditions for the imposition of a discretionary life sentence other than this , but its use in practice is reserved , broadly speaking , for cases where the offence is a very grave one in itself , and it appears that the accused is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future , thus making him dangerous to the public in respect of his probable future behaviour unless there is a change in his condition ( see PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL , ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ; PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports ( S ) CARDINAL ) .", "In his judgment in R v.

Rather it is necessary to cater for the presently perceived risk that , upon completion of any lawful determinate sentence , the prisoner would , if freed , remain a grave danger to society . This is achieved by passing a life sentence so as to ensure that the public will be protected and the risk reassessed after the tariff period expires .", "...", "... the sentencing ORG recognises that passing a life sentence may well cause the offender to serve longer , and sometimes substantially longer , than his just desserts . It must then not expose him to that peril unless there is compelling justification for such a course .

It is the practice to obtain this assessment before referring a case to ORG . Before ORG review a case , a member of the ORG shall interview the prisoner if he is willing to be so interviewed .", "CARDINAL . ORG The review procedures applicable to all life sentences within the framework of LAW DATE have evolved in CARDINAL stages :", "( a ) ORG When LAW of LAW DATE came into operation it was the practice to refer all life sentence cases to ORG when the prisoner had served not longer than DATE , irrespective of whether there was any prospect of early release . In making its recommendations to the Secretary of ORG as to the release of a life prisoner , the ORG took into account the views of the judiciary as required by LAW .", "( b ) ORG In DATE a ORG was set up to recommend to the ORG Secretary a date for the first formal review by ORG as the first stage in a review by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They gave initial consideration to the timing of the first review usually after the prisoner had been detained for DATE , but this system became less and less effective as the ORG only recommended dates in CARDINAL the cases referred to it . Under these arrangements , the judiciary were consulted - as required by LAW - only at the stage when release seemed a realistic possibility .", "( c ) ORG In DATE , ORG was disbanded and new arrangements were made for fixing the date of the first formal review by ORG . Under these arrangements the judiciary were consulted , usually , after a life prisoner had been detained for DATE , and asked for their views on the period necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence for the offence - the tariff period . In the light of these views the ORG Secretary would decide the date of the first reference of the case to ORG , normally set for DATE before the expiry of the tariff period .", "( d ) ORG On DATE , in a parliamentary written answer to ORG , the ORG Secretary made the following statement in response to the ORG judgment in the case of GPE and Others ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) :", "\" I accept the conclusion of ORG that there are strong arguments for carrying out this consultation exercise \" - with the judiciary on the question of the period necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence - \" as soon as practicable following the imposition of a discretionary life sentence .", "Following consultation with the Lord Chief Justice it has been agreed that the most satisfactory way of obtaining the judicial view is to ask the trial judge to write to me , through him , in every case where a discretionary life sentence is passed giving his view on the period necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence . This view will be related to the determinate sentence that would have been passed but for the element of mental instability and/or public risk which led the judge to pass a life sentence and will also take account of the notional period of the sentence which a prisoner might expect to have been remitted for good behaviour had a determinate sentence been passed . The date of the first formal review by ORG machinery will then be fixed in accordance with the judicial view on the requirements of retribution and deterrence , and the review will , as before , normally take place DATE before the expiry of that period . I have agreed with the Lord Chief Justice that this new procedure will be introduced with effect from DATE .", "... I shall arrange for a review to be undertaken of all discretionary life sentence cases with a first formal review date of DATE or later . Where account has been taken of factors other than the judicial view on the requirements of retribution and deterrence in fixing the date , the date will be adjusted to bring it into line with the judicial view .", "... In cases of prisoners serving life sentences for murder , where the sentence is not at the discretion of the court , the question of the notional equivalent determinate sentence does not arise . I shall continue to take into account the view of the judiciary on the requirements of retribution and deterrence in such cases as a factor amongst others ( including the need to maintain public confidence in the system of justice ) to be weighed in the balance in setting the first review date . I shall ensure that the timing of the first formal review in such cases is fixed in accordance with my overall policy for ensuring that the time served by prisoners serving life sentences for the worst offences of violence fully reflects public concern about violent crime .", "... no life sentence prisoner will be detained for DATE without a formal review of his case even where the period thought necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence exceeds DATE .", "... However , as was made clear by ORG , the release of a life sentence prisoner is solely at my discretion and it is for me to decide , after receiving ORG recommendation and after consulting the judiciary as required by LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , when actual release should take place . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In addition to his right to make representations to ORG under the provisions of LAW DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , a prisoner detained pursuant to a discretionary life sentence may take proceedings in ORG to obtain the judicial review of any decision of ORG or of the Home Secretary on the ground that it is tainted by illegality , irrationality or procedural impropriety ( see judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the DATE case , Series A no .
