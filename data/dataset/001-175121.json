NORP Since DATE the first applicant company , PERSON collected data from the NORP tax authorities for the purpose of publishing information about natural ORG taxable income and assets in the PERSON newspaper . Several other publishing and media companies also publish such data which , pursuant to NORP law , are accessible to the public ( see paragraph CARDINAL below for an explanation of the NORP access to information regime ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON appeared CARDINAL times , with each issue concentrating on a certain geographical area of the country . The data published comprised the surnames and forenames of CARDINAL natural persons whose DATE taxable income exceeded certain thresholds , mainly from MONEY ( CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) , as well as the amount , to the nearest LAW , of their earned and unearned income and taxable net assets . When published in the newspaper , the data were set out in the form of an alphabetical list and organised according to municipality and income bracket .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant company worked in cooperation with the second applicant company , PERSON , and both were owned by the same shareholders . In DATE the first applicant company started to transfer personal data published in PERSON , in the form of CD - ROM discs , to the second applicant company which , together with a mobile telephone operator , started a text - messaging service ( SMS service ) . By sending a person \u2019s name to a service number , taxation information could be obtained concerning that person , on the requesting person \u2019s mobile telephone , if information was available in the database or register created by the second applicant company . This database was created using personal data already published in the newspaper and transferred in the form of CD - ROM discs to the second applicant company . DATE the second applicant company also published PERSON .", "CARDINAL . It transpires from the case file that in DATE the Minister of ORG requested that the police instigate a criminal investigation into the publishing activities of the applicant companies . No information is contained in the file as to the outcome of this request or of any subsequent investigation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant companies ordered taxation data from ORG ( verohallitus , skattestyrelsen ) . Following the first order , ORG requested an opinion from ORG , on the basis of which ORG invited the applicant companies to provide further information regarding their request and indicating that the data could not be disclosed if PERSON continued to be published in its usual form . The applicant companies subsequently cancelled their data request and paid people to collect taxation data manually at the local tax offices .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , probably in DATE , ORG ( tietosuojavaltuutettu , dataombudsmannen ) contacted the applicant companies and advised them that , although accessing and publishing taxation data were not prohibited as such , they had to cease publishing such data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in DATE , when they had published data concerning the DATE tax year . The applicant companies refused to abide by this request , which they considered violated their right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the ORG Ombudsman asked ORG ( tietosuojalautakunta , datasekretessn\u00e4mnden ) to prohibit the applicant companies from processing the taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in DATE and from passing those data to the SMS service . He claimed that under LAW the companies had no right to collect , store or pass on personal data and that the derogation provided by that LAW concerning journalism did not , in his view , apply to the present case . The collecting of taxation information and the passing of such information to third parties were not for journalistic purposes and therefore were not covered by the derogation in LAW , but rather constituted the processing of personal data in which the applicant companies had no right to engage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed ORG request . It found that the derogation laid down in LAW concerning journalism applied to the present case . As regards the SMS service , the data used in the service had already been published in PERSON and therefore the LAW did not apply to it .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE ORG appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) reiterating his request that the applicant companies be prohibited from processing taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in DATE and from passing such data to the SMS service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It found that the derogation laid down in LAW concerning journalism , which had its origins in Directive PERSON of ORG and of the ORG on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data was adopted ( OJ DATE L CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , hereafter \u201c ORG Directive \u201d ) , should not be interpreted too strictly , as an overly strict interpretation would favour protection of privacy over freedom of expression . That court considered that PERSON had a journalistic purpose and that it was also in the public interest to publish such data . It emphasised , in particular , that the published data were already accessible to the general public . The journalism derogation thus applied in the circumstances of the present case . As regards the SMS service , ORG agreed with ORG that , as the information had already been published in the newspaper , the LAW did not apply to it .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE ORG lodged an appeal with ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to request a preliminary ruling from ORG of ORG ( which became ORG of ORG on DATE , hereafter the \u201c CJEU \u201d ) on the interpretation of Directive CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the CJEU handed down its judgment ( see Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Tietosuojavaltuutettu v. PERSON and PERSON , ORG : C:CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . It found , first of all , that the activities in question constituted \u201c processing of personal data \u201d within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ) of Directive CARDINAL . According to the ORG , activities involving the processing of personal data such as those relating to personal data files which contained solely , and in unaltered form , material that had already been published in the media , also fell within the scope of the Directive ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE of the judgment ) . The object of the derogation in LAW personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes was to reconcile the protection of privacy with freedom of expression . In order to take account of the importance of the latter in every democratic society , it was necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom , such as journalism , broadly . However , in order to achieve a balance between those CARDINAL fundamental rights , the protection of the fundamental right to privacy required that the derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of data had to apply only in so far as were strictly necessary ( see paragraphs CARDINAL of the judgment ) . Journalistic activities were not limited to media undertakings and could be undertaken for profit - making purposes ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , when interpreting the journalistic purposes derogation , account must be taken of the evolution and proliferation of methods of communication and the dissemination of information . Activities such as those involved in the domestic proceedings , relating to data from documents which were in the public domain under domestic legislation , could be classified as \u201c journalistic activities \u201d if their sole object was the disclosure to the public of information , opinions or ideas , irrespective of the medium which was used to transmit them . Whether or not that was the case , was for the national court to determine ( see paragraphs CARDINAL of the judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , applying the ruling of the LAW and with reference to the case - law on LAW , quashed the impugned decisions of ORG and ORG and referred the case back to ORG for a fresh examination with a view to issuing an order pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . ORG requested ORG to prohibit the processing of taxation data by the applicant companies in the manner and to the extent carried out in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its legal assessment , ORG gave the following reasoning :", "\u201c Scope of the matter", "The present case does not concern the question of the extent to which taxation data and official documents concerning taxation are public under LAW on ORG and ORG .", "Nor does it concern the right to publish taxation data as such but only the processing of personal data . Therefore , there is no issue of possible prior interference with the content of the publications , but rather an assessment of whether the legal conditions set for personal data processing and protection of privacy are fulfilled .", "The reconciliation of protection of privacy with freedom of expression is part of the legal assessment of personal data processing in the matter .", "...", "Reconciliation of the protection of privacy and freedom of expression", "Interpretation of the exception concerning journalistic purposes in ORG . ORG of ORG emphasised that the purpose of ORG is to ensure that when processing their personal data , the Member GPE guarantee ORG fundamental rights and freedoms , and in particular their right to privacy , while allowing the free movement of such information . The ORG further emphasised that these fundamental rights must be reconciled to a certain extent with the fundamental right to freedom of expression , and that this task belongs to GPE .", "...", "It therefore appears from the aforementioned ruling of ORG of ORG that the concept of journalism must , as such , be interpreted broadly within the meaning of LAW , that , on the other hand , the protection of privacy can be derogated from only in so far as it is strictly necessary , and that this task of reconciliation of the CARDINAL fundamental rights is the task of GPE . Ensuring proper balance between the rights and interests at stake , including the fundamental rights guaranteed in the GPE legal order , is the task of the domestic authorities and courts ( see also case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON ) .", "Interpretation of the exception in LAW concerning journalistic purposes . ... It transpires from the preparatory work on LAW ( HE CARDINAL/CARDINAL vp ) that the purpose of the adoption of LAW was to maintain the existing situation in respect of journalistic files kept by the media , provided it remained within the limits imposed by ORG . Therefore , in order to conclude that processing of personal data is conducted for journalistic purposes within the meaning of LAW , inter alia , that data must be used solely for journalistic activities and the data must not be made available to persons other than those involved in those journalistic activities .", "When interpreting section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , particular regard must be had to the fact that it concerns the reconciliation of CARDINAL fundamental rights , namely the freedom of expression and the protection of privacy .", "...", "The case - law of ORG has also adopted a position on reconciling freedom of expression with the protection of privacy . The ORG has held , inter alia in its PERSON judgment of DATE , that the press plays an essential role in a NORP society . Although it must not overstep certain bounds , in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others , its duty is nevertheless to impart , in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities , information and ideas on all matters of public interest .", "On the other hand , the ORG also held in the above - mentioned judgment that increased vigilance as regards the protection of private life was necessary in order to contend with the new communications technologies which make it possible to store and reproduce personal data .", "According to the ORG , when balancing the protection of private life against freedom of expression , the decisive criterion had to be the contribution made by publishing the data to a debate of public interest . If a publication is only meant to satisfy the curiosity of a certain audience , freedom of expression must be interpreted more narrowly .", "In the present case , it must be assessed to what extent the impugned processing of personal data as carried out in the course of the ORG activities falls within the scope of the exception concerning journalistic purposes that is provided for in section CARDINAL ) of LAW . The starting point is whether the aim of their activities was to disclose information , opinions or ideas to the public . In this assessment , account must be taken of whether or to what extent those activities can be seen as contributing to a debate in a NORP society rather than solely satisfying the curiosity of certain individuals .", "Processing of personal taxation data in the background file of PERSON and in the PERSON newspaper", "PERSON collected for the PERSON newspaper taxation data from different tax offices in which ORG names appear together with information on their taxable income .", "As mentioned above , the case concerns the processing of personal data to which the general requirements in LAW of LAW are applicable , unless the LAW allows for an exception from the application of these provisions . It must first of all be assessed whether the processing of personal data in the company \u2019s background file before the publication of such data in the PERSON newspaper falls within the scope of the exception concerning journalistic purposes .", "From the preparatory work on the amendment of LAW ( HE CARDINAL vp ) , which was the LAW in force before LAW , it transpires in particular that the press considers that the right to freely disclose information also requires journalists to be able , in advance , to freely collect and store information . Restricting the processing of personal data at this stage , that is to say before publication , could in practice mean that a prior decision is taken on what can be published . Such an outcome would be incompatible with the fundamental right guaranteeing freedom of expression .", "The issue at stake in the present case concerns publicly accessible personal data received from the tax authorities . The collection and processing of such data in the company \u2019s internal files for the purpose of the company \u2019s publishing activities can , on the basis of above - mentioned grounds , be regarded as processing of personal data for journalistic purposes . The processing of large quantities of such data from the various municipal taxation records may well be necessary as background information for the purpose of the editing of a publication concerning taxation and from the point of view of free communication and open debate . At this stage of activities the protection of the privacy of the persons concerned can also be sufficiently secured , provided that the data collected and stored in the file are protected against unlawful processing as required by section CARDINAL of LAW .", "PERSON has published the personal data collected from the tax offices as wide - ranging municipality - based catalogues in the PERSON newspaper . As already stated above , in this regard too it is a question of processing personal data within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . As part of the case file , ORG had at its disposal PERSON newspaper no . CARDINAL , published by PERSON and covering the GPE metropolitan area .", "In this respect it must be decided whether a derogation is possible from the requirements relating to the processing of personal data on the basis of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , that is to say whether the impugned processing of personal data by publishing those data in the PERSON newspaper came within the scope of the exception provided for journalistic purposes .", "...", "It transpires from the preparatory work on LAW ( HE PERSON ) that the processing of data in the background file referred to in LAW must relate solely to journalistic activities and that the processed data must not be made available to any persons not engaged in journalistic activities . The purpose of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW was to maintain the existing situation in respect of journalistic files kept by the media , within the limits allowed by ORG . Therefore , the purpose of LAW in this respect can be seen as guaranteeing the possibility for free journalistic work prior to the publication of information .", "The term \u201c processing of personal data for journalistic purposes \u201d can not be regarded as covering the large \u2013 scale publication of the journalistic background file , almost verbatim , as catalogues , albeit split into different parts and sorted by municipality .", "Since the disclosure of registered data on such a scale is equivalent to the disclosure of the entire background file kept for journalistic purposes by the company , such disclosure does not represent solely an expression of information , opinions or ideas . As stated above , with a view to reconciling the requirements of freedom of expression with the protection of privacy , the collection of data before publication has been made permissible under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW without any requirement of compliance with general conditions set out in LAW . By contrast , the processing of personal data collected in the company \u2019s background file by publishing it and by rendering it available to the general public to the extent that has been done in the present case , and beyond the scope of the minimum requirements set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , can not be regarded as compatible with the purpose of LAW .", "Open public - interest debate , the monitoring of the exercise of power in society and the freedom to criticise , which are necessary in a NORP society , do not require the disclosure of the personal data of specific individuals in the manner and to the extent described above . When regard is also had to the foregoing comments on the narrow interpretation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW and the fact that a strict literal interpretation of that provision would result in a situation incompatible with the purpose of the LAW as regards protection of personal data , the processing of personal data with a view to publishing them in the PERSON newspaper , and as far as the contents of this publication itself are concerned , was not conducted for journalistic purposes within the meaning of LAW .", "...", "Having regard to sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW and LAW , as interpreted by ORG of ORG in its preliminary ruling , the collection of personal data prior to its publication in the PERSON newspaper and its processing in the background file of PERSON can not as such be regarded as contrary to the regulations concerning the protection of personal data , provided that , inter alia , the data have been protected properly . However , with reference to all the clarifications on how and to what extent the personal data in the background file were further processed in the PERSON newspaper , PERSON did in fact process personal data concerning natural persons in violation of LAW .", "Handover of data in a CD - ROM", "PERSON handed over a CD - ROM containing the published data to PERSON so that the latter could start up an SMS service using that data . As mentioned above , that action amounts to the processing of personal data within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "Having regard to the preliminary ruling of ORG of ORG and its effect on the interpretation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , as well as all that has been said above about the processing of personal data in the PERSON newspaper , the handover to PERSON of personal data collected in the background file of PERSON , even though they were published in the PERSON newspaper , can not be regarded as processing of personal data for journalistic purposes within the meaning of LAW . Nor can the processing of personal data in such a manner be regarded as having been effected for journalistic purposes within the meaning of LAW . Therefore , in that regard too , PERSON processed personal data in violation of LAW .", "Processing of personal data for the realisation of a SMS service by ORG", "As stated above in the \u201c Facts \u201d section , PERSON handed over the above - mentioned personal data to a third company in order to start up a SMS service , which company operated the SMS service on behalf of PERSON .", "It was pointed out above that PERSON had no right under LAW to process the personal data at issue by handing it over to PERSON . Consequently , PERSON also had no right under LAW to process personal data received in this manner .", "In addition , it follows from the preliminary ruling of ORG of ORG that the exception provided for in ORG , which concerns the processing of personal data for journalistic purposes , requires the disclosure of data to the public . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW on the Exercise of Freedom of Expression in ORG , the term \u201c the public \u201d in that Act refers to a group of freely determined message recipients . ORG SMS service involves the company processing personal data relating to the taxation of a specific individual on the basis of a request by another individual . It therefore does not concern disclosure of data to the general public , as explained above , but replying to a request by an individual concerning the personal data of another individual .", "Open public - interest debate , the monitoring of the exercise of power in society and the freedom to criticise , which are necessary in a NORP society , do not require the possibility of processing the personal data of specific individuals as has been done in this case . Freedom of expression does not require any derogation from the protection of privacy in such a situation .", "ORG further stated in its preliminary ruling that the technical means used for the transfer of information is not relevant when assessing whether there is any question of activities undertaken solely for journalistic purposes . As regards the SMS service operated by PERSON , it is irrelevant that the data were transferred via mobile phones and text messages . Therefore , this is not a case of treating this mode of transmission of data differently from other modes of transmission . The assessment would be the same if the company processed , on the basis of a request by an individual , the personal data of another individual by using some other mode of transmission . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the above - mentioned judgment of ORG , on DATE ORG prohibited the first applicant company from processing taxation data in the manner and to the extent that had been the case in DATE and from forwarding that information to an SMS service . It found that the collection of personal data prior to its publication in PERSON and its processing in the background file of the first applicant company could not as such be regarded as contrary to the data protection rules , provided , inter alia , that the data had been protected properly . However , considering the manner and the extent to which the personal data in the background file had been published in PERSON , the first applicant company had processed personal data concerning natural persons in violation of LAW . The second applicant company was prohibited from collecting , storing or forwarding to an SMS service any data received from the first applicant company \u2019s database and published in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE , after ORG had made its decision , ORG asked the applicant companies to indicate what action they were envisaging in response to the ORG \u2019s decision . In their reply , the applicant companies asked for ORG views on the conditions under which they could continue to publish public taxation data at least to a certain extent . In his reply ORG stated , with reference to the decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE , that \u201c when data on taxable income were collected in a database and published in large catalogues almost as it stood , LAW was applicable ... \u201d . He reminded them of his duty to report any breach of LAW to the police .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant companies appealed against the decision of ORG to ORG , which transferred the case to ORG . They complained that the decision violated the LAW prohibition of censorship as well as their right to freedom of expression . According to the applicants , under domestic law , it was not possible to prevent publication of information on the basis of the amount of information to be published or of the means used for its publication . Nor was it possible to rely on the \u201c public interest \u201d as a criterion for preventing publication where preventive restriction of freedom of expression was concerned . Accepting that would mean that the authorities would be able to prevent publication if they thought that the publication did not promote discussion of a topic of public interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant ORG appeal . It found that ORG had stated in its decision of DATE that the case concerned neither the public accessibility of taxation data nor the right to publish such information per se . As the court was now examining only the DATE decision rendered by ORG , it could not examine the issues which ORG had excluded from the scope of its DATE decision . As the ORG \u2019s decision corresponded to the content of the latter decision , there was no reason to change it .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant companies further appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG , reiterating that the case concerned neither the right to publish taxation information as such , nor preventive censorship .", "CARDINAL . According to the information submitted by the applicants , the SMS service was shut down after the DATE decision of ORG was served on the applicant companies . The newspaper continued publishing taxation data in DATE when its content was CARDINAL of the previous content . Since then the newspaper has not appeared .
