NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is currently serving a prison sentence in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and Mr C. PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , within the space of TIME , the mother and the father of CARDINAL different DATE girls separately contacted ORG on account of suspicions that their children had been sexually abused by the applicant , who was their psychomotor development teacher . They reported that their children had told them that the applicant had introduced his hand through their underwear and had touched their pubic region and their genitals while they were doing physical exercises .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested . In his statement to the police , in which he was assisted by counsel , the applicant denied the accusations . On DATE , parents of CARDINAL other girls in the same school class reported similar facts to the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was brought before an investigating judge . In his statement to the judge the applicant confirmed his statement to the police . He was released on remand subject to certain conditions . A non - molestation order was issued against him for the protection of the minors . The applicant appointed counsel and a legal representative for his defence and representation before the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the parents of CARDINAL other DATE girls contacted the police to report incidents involving their children similar to those reported by the above - mentioned parents . Their daughters had told them that the applicant had touched their genitals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge requested that the forensic psycho - social team in the NORP courts perform an examination of the first CARDINAL alleged under - age victims and of the applicant . On DATE the examination of the minors was extended to include the last QUANTITY girls whose parents had made a criminal complaint . The report on the minors was prepared by a forensic social worker and a forensic social psychologist . Their interviews with the minors were all video - recorded . The report on the applicant was prepared by a different forensic psychologist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the psychological reports were submitted in writing to the investigating judge . They were added to the case file . The applicant was provided with a copy of the report on the minors .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant made a request to the investigating judge that the forensic psycho - social team who had interviewed the minors submit all notes and documents which had been put at their disposal by the school personnel and cited in the report . The investigating judge requested those notes and documents from the members of the forensic psycho - social team with a view to providing the applicant with them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the forensic psycho - social team informed the investigating judge that they had not kept notes of the interviews . All information deemed important had been included in the final report and the notes destroyed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge brought the investigative stage of the proceedings to a close and made the case file available to the parties with a view to holding a public hearing . The applicant did not appeal against that decision . The public prosecutor accused the applicant of CARDINAL counts of child abuse . The private prosecutor accused him of CARDINAL counts of child abuse . In his statement of defence the applicant denied the charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public hearing took place before the NORP criminal judge no . CARDINAL . The applicant was defended by counsel of his own choice . The applicant , the parents and the alleged GPE CARDINAL school tutors were questioned . The video - recording of the forensic experts\u2019 interview with the minors was played in its entirety and the members of the forensic psycho - social team were questioned in relation to the report they had produced . They confirmed the contents of their report . The alleged under - age victims were not questioned at the hearing since none of the parties to the proceedings had so requested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP criminal judge no . CARDINAL sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment as a principal on CARDINAL counts of sexual abuse of children . He was acquitted of CARDINAL count of sexually abusing a child . The judge found that on DATE the applicant , driven by an impulse to satisfy his lustful desires , had asked for volunteers to lead their classmates in the exercises ; that he had selected multiple volunteers , including the CARDINAL female victims , taking them away from the group in turn ; that he had brought the under - age victims close to him and that whilst practising the exercises he had touched their genitals , concealing his actions behind the ORG smocks .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reaching this conclusion the judge relied mainly on the statements given by the under - age victims to the CARDINAL members of the forensic psycho - social team . Those interviews had been video - recorded and played in their entirety at the hearing . The judge emphasised that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL minors interviewed had repeated in a spontaneous fashion what they had previously said to their parents and that the other CARDINAL had given their account of the facts after the experts had asked them whether anything particular had happened in the psychomotor development class on the specific date of the events . The answers provided by these CARDINAL minors were consistent with regard to both the circumstantial evidence and the way in which the events had taken place . The seventh child who had been interviewed had not given an account of the events .", "CARDINAL . The judge further relied on the expert psycho - social report on the minors , the findings of which the CARDINAL authors had confirmed at the hearing . The experts were available for cross - examination at the hearing . According to them , the reliability of the alleged ORG accounts ranged from \u201c indeterminate \u201d to \u201c most probably reliable \u201d on a scale consisting of CARDINAL different values of credibility : reliable , most probably reliable , indeterminate , probably not reliable and not reliable . The report contained a detailed assessment of each alleged victim \u2019s statement , of its consistency with other statements , and of the reasons supporting their conclusions . The judge also relied on hearsay evidence given by some of the LOC parents and the tutors of the CARDINAL classes to which the minors concerned belonged .", "CARDINAL . The judge rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that he should be acquitted for lack of direct evidence against him . The applicant had argued that he had not examined the minors either in the investigative stage of the proceedings or at the hearing and that therefore the LOC pre - trial statements should not be admitted as valid evidence against him because he had not been present during their examination .", "CARDINAL . The judge conceded that the minors had not been cross - examined by the applicant or his counsel either at the investigative stage of the proceedings or at the hearing . This fact , however , did not prevent the ORG statements being admitted as evidence against the applicant . The judge pointed out that neither of the parties to the proceedings had requested that the children attend the hearing as witnesses . She further referred to domestic case - law and to international instruments regulating children \u2019s rights , stating that in sex - related criminal cases involving minors it was possible to dispense with their cross - examination in open court if it was deemed inappropriate having regard to the ORG young age or its probably adverse psychological impact , and that their statements could be submitted at the hearing through other means .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , the judge emphasised that in the present case an expert report had been prepared by a forensic psycho - social team whose members had confirmed its contents in open court ; that for the preparation of that report the experts had conducted a series of interviews with the minors ; that the report had been passed on to the applicant during the investigative stage of the proceedings ; and that those interviews had all been video - recorded and played at the trial . The applicant had been able to prepare his defence and challenge the truthfulness of the ORG statements , submit evidence in his favour , and cast doubt on the accuracy or scientific value of the expert report . The fact that the full content of the interviews had not been transposed into the final expert report was irrelevant in so far as the video - recording of the interviews had been viewed in its entirety in open court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the first - instance judgment before FAC . He invoked his rights to be presumed innocent and to a fair hearing .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the La Rioja Audiencia Provincial upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction . The appellate court emphasised that the applicant had requested the production of the evidence requested by the public and private prosecutors , who had asked that the interviews conducted with the minors be viewed and that the experts who had conducted those interviews be questioned in open court . The prosecutors had not requested that the minors be questioned and neither had the applicant . The court considered that in admitting those statements in evidence , the first - instance judge had struck a proper balance between the protection of the minors from secondary victimisation and the applicant \u2019s right to defence . The applicant \u2019s right had been respected in so far as the video - recording of the interviews had been played in its entirety at the hearing and the members of the psycho - social team had been available for cross - examination by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court emphasised that the statements given by the CARDINAL under - age victims were consistent and that they were corroborated by hearsay evidence , by the expert report and by the statements made at the hearing by the experts who had prepared the report . As regards the expert report , the court pointed out that the applicant had been provided with a copy immediately after it was produced and that he had not raised any objection to or submitted an appeal against the investigating judge \u2019s decision to request its production and inclusion in the case file . The members of the psycho - social team had confirmed its contents at the hearing . The court praised the report for its completeness and accuracy and emphasised that its findings were based on a renowned scientific method called ORG ) , of which the core component was a criteria - based content analysis ( CBCA ) of the credibility of accounts . It was also pointed out that the applicant had failed to submit any evidence that raised doubts as to the reliability of the report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG , invoking his constitutional rights to a fair hearing and to be presumed innocent . He argued that he could not be blamed for not having requested the cross - examination of the minors at the hearing in so far as it was incumbent on the prosecution to prove him guilty and therefore to request the production at the hearing of all the evidence against him . This failure on the part of the prosecutors had prevented him from cross - examining the alleged victims , thereby breaching his right to a fair hearing . The applicant further argued that the only direct evidence on the basis of which the courts had found him guilty consisted of the statements given by the minors to the experts at the investigative stage of the proceedings but contended that those statements should have been excluded from the evidential material as they had been obtained in breach of his right to defence . The interviews with the minors had been conducted without his being present . The exclusion of that evidence would result in his acquittal of all the alleged offences for lack of sufficient evidence to override his right to be presumed innocent . The evidence against him was in any case insufficient to prove him guilty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s amparo appeal . It stated that the first issue raised by the applicant concerned the potential restrictions which could be placed on the right to defence of a person charged with sexual offences vis - \u00e0 - vis his alleged victims , taking into account the undesirable emotional and psychological impact that cross - examination in open court might have on the latter .", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterated that as a general rule defendants should be afforded the opportunity to cross - examine their victims in open court . However , this rule allowed for certain exceptions . Making copious citations from the ORG \u2019s case - law , ORG referred to the special nature of criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences , which often represented an ordeal for the victims , and to the fact that this aspect was even more clearly apparent in cases involving minors . The courts were allowed to take measures for the purpose of protecting under - age victims , including the possibility of dispensing with their cross - examination . This measure should nonetheless be reconciled with the adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence . Courts were thus required to implement safeguards compensating defendants for the disadvantage of having been prevented from cross - examining the direct witnesses to the offences in open court .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court went on to state that in sex - related offences the only direct evidence was frequently the victim \u2019s own statement , the other evidence normally being hearsay evidence or expert evidence assessing the credibility of the victim \u2019s account . In this connection , the legal debate usually turned on the legal safeguards surrounding the examination of the minor and the manner in which his or her statements could be used as evidence at the hearing . ORG stated that in cases such as the instant CARDINAL the constitutional standard of review coincided with the standard established by ORG in the case of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) , according to which :", "\u201c the suspected person shall be informed of the hearing of the child , he or she shall be given an opportunity to observe that hearing , either as it is being conducted or later from an audiovisual recording , and to have questions put to the child , either directly or indirectly , in the course of the first hearing or on a later occasion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Turning to the instant case , ORG stated that the under - age girls had not been questioned by the police or the public prosecutor or the investigating judge . They had been examined by a social worker and a psychologist from the forensic psycho - social team from whom the investigating judge had commissioned a report . The relevant legislation provided for that possibility , which had been accepted as a constitutionally valid option by ORG in a previous judgment . The court emphasised that \u2012 given the young age of the minors , all of whom were below DATE at the material time \u2012 their examination by experts was advisable not only in order to prevent additional unnecessary damage but also to reinforce the reliability of their statements .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that the investigating judge had made the psycho - social report available to the parties , including the applicant \u2019s counsel , shortly after its production by the experts . However , the applicant had limited himself to requesting some additional documents ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) DATE . He had not requested that a fresh examination of the minors be conducted in his presence . The legislation by no means prevented such a course of action but the applicant had not availed himself of that possibility . In his subsequent statement of defence , the applicant had not requested the cross - examination of the alleged victims in open court , which reinforced the inference that his rights had been duly respected at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings . The applicant \u2019s failure to request the GPE cross - examination meant that the judicial authorities dealing with his case did not have to decide whether or not the applicant should have been given the opportunity to have his alleged victims cross - examined . In fact , the domestic authorities had not obstructed or in any way prevented such an examination since they had not been confronted with the issue to begin with .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the foregoing , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s right to adversarial proceedings had not been restricted to an unacceptable extent . Its finding might have been different had the judicial authorities prevented the applicant from examining the under - age victims despite his having so requested ( the ORG cited ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALV ; PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ; and Accardi and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALII ) or if the applicant had not been able to challenge effectively the examination conducted by the experts owing to a lack of sufficient information or some legal impediment .", "CARDINAL . As regards the assessment of the evidence conducted by the judicial authorities , the Constitutional Court emphasised from the outset that its role was not that of a court of third instance and that in cases such as the instant one it would intervene only if it could not be concluded \u2012 or could be concluded only arbitrarily \u2012 from the evidential material in the case file , which should have been obtained with due respect for the defendant \u2019s fundamental rights , that the defendant was guilty .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , ORG stated that the only direct evidence on which the trial courts had based the applicant \u2019s conviction comprised the incriminating statements given by the minors at the investigative stage of the proceedings , the video - recording of which had been viewed in its entirety at the hearing . The admission of those statements as evidence had been lawful and , from a constitutional standpoint , they could be considered sufficient evidence to override the applicant \u2019s right to be presumed innocent . The hearsay evidence provided by parents and experts had served exclusively as corroborating evidence . This complaint was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
