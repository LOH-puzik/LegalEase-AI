However , the record of his statement to the judge did not include that piece of information , indicating merely that he had no fixed address in GPE .", "The Fuengirola ( PERSON ) investigating judge opened a criminal investigation . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE he ruled that the facts did not disclose the commission of a major offence ( delito ) but , being of the view that a minor offence ( falta ) might have been committed , forwarded the case file to the appropriate district judge ( juzgado de distrito ) .", "On DATE the Fuengirola district judge set the case down for trial on DATE . The applicants were summoned to the hearing by means of a notice published in ORG of the province of GPE . As they lived in GPE , they were unaware of the summons .

He invited the ORG to quash all the steps in the proceedings after the parties had been summoned to attend the trial .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , however , ORG dismissed the appeal as being out of time , pointing out that by section CARDINAL ) of LAW , the amparo appeal should have been lodged within DATE of the service of the investigating judge \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , in which the applicants had been informed of the course of the proceedings since the trial and of the defendant \u2019s acquittal , the notice given of the judgment through its publication in ORG , and the fact that the judgment had become final and the proceedings had been terminated .", "ORG referred to its settled case - law , according to which the time allowed for lodging an amparo appeal began to run at the point when those persons who should have appeared as parties to the proceedings in the ordinary courts had had sufficient notice of the existence and content of the judgment which they wished to challenge ; that notice coincided with the service of the judgment . In the instant case , the relevant point in time had occurred on DATE , when the decision of CARDINAL DATE had been served on the applicants . In spite of the content of that decision , which had informed them of the course of the proceedings , of the defendant \u2019s acquittal , which had subsequently become final , and of the termination of the proceedings , the applicants had asked to inspect the case file and DATE after admittedly unjustifiable delays \u2013 had been sent the relevant documents and had then appealed against the acquittal , DATE after it had become final .", "The Constitutional Court emphasised that by the time the applicants \u2013 assisted by a lawyer \u2013 had finally applied to it to protect their constitutional rights , their right of appeal had already lapsed . It added that they should have lodged an amparo appeal within the statutory period of DATE from the date on which they had been informed of the existence and content of the judgment which had brought the proceedings in the ordinary courts to an end . Submitting an application to set aside once a judgment had already become final neither extended the time allowed by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW for lodging an amparo appeal nor caused time to cease to run for that purpose . Nor could it be left to the appellants to determine the terminus a quo for themselves as they pleased .", "Without excusing or justifying the district judge \u2019s lack of diligence , ORG held that in view of its special nature as a remedy , the appeal should be dismissed as being out of time , but also drew attention to the remedies available for rectifying irregularities or malfunctions in the system of justice , noting that the facts of the case might \u201c provide an effective basis on which to seek redress for non - pecuniary damage sustained and compensation for the malfunctioning of the criminal - justice system \u201d .", "\u201c CARDINAL . All contentions that proceedings should automatically be declared void or that formal irregularities have occurred in procedural steps such that conditions essential for the fulfilment of their purpose have not been satisfied or such that a defence effectively becomes impossible shall be raised by means of the appeals provided by law against the decision in question or by the other means laid down in procedural laws .", "CARDINAL . Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions and proprio motu , a judge or court may , before a final decision has been issued , declare void all or some of the steps in the proceedings , provided that no compensation is payable and that the parties have been consulted . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
