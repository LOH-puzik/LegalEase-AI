This man had been walking very slowly , at snail \u2019s pace . The police officer had wanted to grab hold of the man , by his left arm , as it appeared to Mr van den ORG . The coloured man had made a gesture as if to repulse the police officer . He had hit the police officer , knocking him off balance somewhat , which enabled the coloured man to pass . After he had passed the police officer , the coloured man had drawn a pistol or a revolver , a firearm at any rate , which he had held in his right hand . He had held his arm slanted downwards , thus pointing the pistol towards the ground , and had tried to continue on his way . Mr van den PERSON had not seen the police officers draw their pistols .

Driving in the direction reported , Officers Brons and ORG had seen a scooter and a driver fitting the description given them turning into the doorway of a lift in the NORP block of flats .

Officers Brons and ORG had agreed that Officer PERSON would go after the thief while Officer PERSON parked the car . Officer PERSON had run towards the doorway holding a CARDINAL - way radio .

Officer PERSON had not seen whether or not the pistol was cocked .

The thief had not reacted by dropping his pistol , much to the surprise of Officer PERSON seeing that Officer PERSON had him covered . Given that the thief was armed and apparently had no intention of doing as he was told , Officer PERSON had considered that Officer PERSON was under threat . He had considered it highly possible that the thief would use his weapon against Officer PERSON . He had been completely fixated on the thief . He had seen only the thief , holding a pistol with his finger on the trigger . At that point Officer PERSON had not yet considered it necessary to draw his own service pistol because the thief was covered by Officer PERSON .

If there had been more time to take aim then it is conceivable that , as has been argued , the shot fired by ORG might have hit a less vulnerable part of ORG \u2019s body .

The reliability of the foregoing evidence established by ORG is not affected in its essentials by the fact that the police gave a somewhat different version of events in a press release . That also applies to the differing statements of the witness ORG ( in whose case it may be considered likely , given demonstrable inconsistencies as regards place and time , that he was not actually present at all ) and the witness GPE , who claims not to have seen any pistol in LOC \u2019s possession at any time , which is unlikely , since there was in fact a pistol , whereas the witness FAC , whose reliability is not in doubt , actually went for cover when he saw that weapon .

In addition , ORG considers the public prosecutor sufficiently independent and qualified to assess , by objective standards , in the light of the results of the investigation carried out under his responsibility , whether a prosecution should be brought . Except for the ( investigating ) judge , no other public official should , in principle , be involved in the matter .", "...", "ORG considers it necessary that a reconstruction of events take place under the responsibility of the investigating judge , an independent official par excellence , with the co - operation of [ the police officer involved ] and eyewitnesses . ...", "It should be noted already at this stage that ORG is allowing for the possibility that in this case it can not be found that merely stopping [ the deceased ] by a blocking gesture \u2013 a suggestion made by CARDINAL eyewitness \u2013 and the use of pepper spray may be considered realistic alternatives for the shot fired and stated by [ the police officer ] to have been in self - defence , given the considerable likelihood that those methods might prove ineffective in the circumstances described .
