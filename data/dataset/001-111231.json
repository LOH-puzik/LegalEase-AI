In DATE a psychiatrist treating the applicant advised the applicant to take PERSON ( PERSON ) which , in contrast to previous drugs , had positive effects on his condition . The drug was initially provided by a pharmaceutical company free of charge to the applicant \u2019s doctor . Subsequently , the drug became available in pharmacies but was not listed on ORG register of refunded drugs . The applicant could buy the drug at his own expense .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was admitted to ORG at ORG in GPE . He was diagnosed with narcolepsy and breathing difficulties while sleeping .

He also had a stroke . He had frequently lost consciousness and was hospitalised on account of those ailments . He claimed that the psychiatrists and neurologists treating narcolepsy were of the view that PERSON ( PERSON ) was the only effective drug for his condition . He submitted opinions of CARDINAL doctors from private practice to that effect . The applicant was not able to afford to buy the drug and submitted that there was no generic drug available .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was informed that the ORG refunded the cost of drugs in accordance with the Ordinance of ORG on the register of drugs which were distributed free of charge , against the payment of a lump sum or against a partial payment ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . The contents of the register of the refunded drugs and related matters were determined by ORG .

In addition , the applicant suffered from hypertension , ischaemic heart disease , type CARDINAL diabetes and epilepsy . The applicant \u2019s sleep disorders increased the risk of strokes . The expert concluded that the applicant \u2019s narcolepsy together with his numerous ailments required that he was treated with PERSON ( PERSON ) , which in his case was a life - saving drug . The conclusions of the opinion were similar to those in the opinion of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its letter of DATE LOC of the ORG again informed the applicant that , despite the positive opinion of the regional consultant in neurology , there was no possibility of individual reimbursement of the cost of the drug which remained fully at the patient \u2019s charge since PERSON ( PERSON ) was not a life - saving drug and narcolepsy was not a fatal condition . The drug PERSON ( PERSON ) was not listed on the Minister of ORG \u2019s register of refunded drugs and thus it was to be purchased exclusively at the expense of the patient . He was further informed that persons in a difficult financial situation could have recourse to social services .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date LAW transmitted the case to ORG of the court , since the latter instance was competent to hear the case .

In reply , he was informed that no decision could be given until the delivery of a decision in the case pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a similar request . On DATE the ORG refused his request . It found that PERSON ( PERSON ) was neither included on the relevant register of refunded drugs of ORG nor on the separate register of specific serious diseases and drugs which could be refunded in the treatment of those diseases . The drugs which were not listed in those registers were nonrefundable and remained fully at the patient \u2019s charge . The applicant was further advised that the regional branch of the ORG could , in necessary cases , authorise non - standard medical treatment at the request of ORG , the establishment where he was treated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing , inter alia , that he was unable to afford to buy PERSON ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the ORG upheld the contested decision . He noted that LAW provided that citizens were ensured equal access to health care services , financed from public funds . However , the conditions and the scope of the provision of services should be established by statute . At the material time those issues were regulated by ORG from LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . In accordance with the LAW , the ORG was to refund to a pharmacy the price of a drug which appeared on the list of fully or partially refunded drugs .", "The LAW introduced the rule that patients were to pay a part of the price of drugs sold by pharmacies and designated the Minister of Health as the competent authority to determine the scope of the partial payment as well as of the financing from public funds . It was noted that the ORG had no discretion to exercise in this respect . The Minister of ORG was competent to establish the list of drugs which were to be fully or partially refunded in his CARDINAL ordinances of DATE and the drug PERSON ( PERSON ) did not appear on that list . Lastly , it was noted that the refund of the cost of a drug by the ORG was only allowed in cases of administering the drug in the framework of the provision of health services by health establishments to patients in accordance with contracts concluded between the ORG and those establishments .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a complaint against that decision with ORG . He alleged that the refusal to refund the cost of PERSON ( PERSON ) amounted to a violation of NORP CARDINAL ( equality ) , CARDINAL ( protection of life ) and CARDINAL of the LAW ( equal access to health care services ) and a breach of section CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . He pointed out that for DATE he had been suffering from a rare neurological disease and that according to medical expert opinions PERSON ( PERSON ) was a life - saving drug in his case . Furthermore , the cost of the DATE intake of the drug was in the region of PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL , while the joint income of the applicant and his wife ( both retired ) was ORG and they were already spending DATE LAW on various medications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the decision of the President of the NHF and the preceding decision null and void for the lack of competence on the part of that authority to deal with the matter . It noted that LAW did not envisage the possibility that a patient could seek reimbursement of the cost of medical treatment . Such a possibility was reserved exclusively for entities providing health care services . The court observed that there was no legal basis for the ORG \u2019s decision in respect of the refund for a particular drug . It appears that the applicant did not lodge an appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again requested the President of the NHF to refund the cost of PERSON ( PERSON ) . In his reply of CARDINAL October DATE the Director of ORG of the NHF informed the applicant that , in accordance with ORG judgment , the ORG was not competent to issue decisions in respect of the refund of costs of health care services .", "CARDINAL .

His request was forwarded to the Minister of Health as the competent authority to list a drug on the register of drugs which were partially or fully refunded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the company making PERSON ( PERSON ) had not applied for the listing of the drug on the register of refunded drugs and therefore the Ministry could not act on the matter .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE LOC of the NHF , acting in line with ORG judgment , discontinued the proceedings in respect of the applicant \u2019s request for refund .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant continues to buy PERSON ( PERSON ) at his own expense .", "CARDINAL . DATE the LAW reads in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
