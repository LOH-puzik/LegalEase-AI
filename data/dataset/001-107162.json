In order to answer this question correctly , one should consider section CARDINAL of LAW under which rights specified in sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of that LAW can be transferred from the former owner to ... heirs ... Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the former owner has a right to use undeveloped land . LAW ( CARDINAL ) provides for the pre - emptive right of the former owner to construct a family house on building land .
