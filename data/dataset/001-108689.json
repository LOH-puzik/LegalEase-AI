She had burn wounds on her upper body and around her genitals , multiple broken ribs , a fractured skull , bruises everywhere and a deep cut in her arm \u2018 almost as though an attempt had been made to amputate it\u2019 ( one of the trial participants ) . \u2018 The child could just as easily have been dead\u2019 Judge PERSON told the girl \u2019s father , one of the accused , in no uncertain terms in ORG on DATE . A [ age ] , and his second wife , B [ age ] , are accused of reducing C to this state .", "AT HOME In her GPE flat in the GPE district of X , C was beaten , tortured , ill - treated and severely sexually abused DATE , when A fetched C from her GPE home in Y \u2018 to give her a better life\u2019 ( the accused \u2019s words ) and DATE , when he took his daughter to hospital with life - threatening injuries . That is beyond doubt . The couple both try to place ( the bulk of ) the blame on each other . C stated that it was her stepmother who had deprived her of her virginity using a cooking spoon and who had pressed down on her private parts with a soup spoon heated over a candle . She accused her stepmother and her father of kicking her , binding and gagging her , tying her to the bedpost and leaving her kneeling beside the bed like that for TIME . This was described as \u2018 corporal punishment\u2019 by defence lawyer PERSON , meted out because , according to A , \u2018 my wife told me that C was constantly ORG .

B puts most of the blame on her husband . She claims to have hit C only once , when the girl was being really bad . She regards herself \u2018 as a victim too\u2019 ( defence lawyer PERSON ) . The victim of a husband who was \u2018 incredibly\u2019 violent , who beat her and the children ; a husband who would not allow her to take her children to the doctor when he had beaten them .

On DATE it was the turn of the court experts and C to give evidence . However , the girl was spared the ordeal of appearing before ORG . Now aged twelve , she gave her evidence on film during the preliminary proceedings . \u2018 How far away are they , those bad people?\u2019 C had asked at the time , before describing her ordeal . The video footage shown to the jury lasted TIME . The public was prohibited from watching . C \u2019s lawyer , PERSON , had requested that they be excluded . \u2018 The girl was so frightened of giving evidence . She made her statements on the understanding that they would be treated with discretion . Her sense of modesty , integrity and trust would be damaged again if her statements were to reach the media.\u2019 The request was granted . According to forensic medical expert ORG , a plugged - in iron had been placed on the girl \u2019s upper body \u2018 CARDINAL FAC , \u2018 not just gliding over it , but held in one place\u2019 . The CARDINAL-year - old had third - degree burns , including burn wounds around her genitals , when she was taken to hospital by her father in DATE . In addition she had a fractured skull , multiple broken ribs and a cut which went down almost to the bone . The abuse perpetrated against \u2018 torture victim C\u2019 ( the words of forensic child psychologist PERSON ) will have lasting psychosexual effects .

You deserve the maximum DATE said Judge PERSON father lodged an appeal immediately , while his wife asked for time to consider . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In subsequent proceedings under section CARDINALa of LAW , C , represented by ORG , sought compensation from the applicant company for the damage caused by the publication of her name , the names and pictures of her parents and further details given in the CARDINAL articles of CARDINAL and DATE , which together made her identifiable to the wider public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the X Regional Criminal Court ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) rejected C \u2019s request for compensation . It observed that already at an early stage of the criminal proceedings the case had attracted considerable media attention . The case and the identity of the offenders had therefore been known to the public .", "CARDINAL . As regards the articles at issue , ORG found that by mentioning the first name of the victim , her age , the first names and family names of the offenders , indicating their family relationship to the victim and publishing pictures of the father and the stepmother , the victim had become recognisable to a wide number of persons beyond the circle of those directly informed . Therefore , these articles constituted an intrusion into the victim \u2019s strictly private life and injured her legitimate interest in remaining anonymous and she was in principle entitled to compensation .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the interest protected by LAW had to be weighed against the interest protected by LAW . If there existed an overriding public interest in the information about the particular circumstances which allowed for the identification of offender and victim , such interest outweighed the interest of the victim to remain anonymous .", "CARDINAL . Even though the publication of the identity of the persons involved in a criminal offence was normally unnecessary for understanding how the offence was committed , how the investigations progressed or whether the perpetrator had been convicted , there was a public interest in being informed of the identity of persons who had committed a criminal offence against a child , as such information might serve to prevent similar acts in the future . Despite the interest of the victim in not having her identity disclosed , the disclosure was justified because of the public interest in knowing the identity of the perpetrators and the subsequent wider public discussion on violence against children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on an appeal by C , quashed the decision of ORG and granted C compensation in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) for each of the CARDINAL articles published .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal agreed with ORG that the articles at issue , which described in detail the severe ill - treatment and sexual abuses of which C was the victim constituted an intrusion into her strictly private life and injured her legitimate interest to remain anonymous . It also agreed with ORG that the identity of the offenders , A and B , was not protected under LAW and it was therefore , in principle , allowed to report on them while citing their names and also publishing pictures .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the permissibility of disclosing the victim \u2019s identity had to be examined separately and with due diligence . The mere fact that she had become the victim of a crime which attracted considerable public attention was not sufficient to consider her a person connected with public life . Under section CARDINAL of LAW the predominant public interest which outweighs the victim \u2019s personal interest in not disclosing his or her identity must relate to the identity of the person , and that particular information should have a genuine news value . A mere general interest in appropriate press reporting on criminal cases was not sufficient to establish such a predominant public interest . In the present case such a genuine interest in the identity of the victim could not be established . There was no predominant public interest in revealing the identity of the offenders as the public could have been informed on the psychological dynamics of violent crimes and sexual abuse committed within the family without revealing the identity of the victim . The reporting also did not serve the purpose of warning and protecting the public ( Warn- und ORG ) because the accused had already been taken into detention and there was no indication that they had assaulted other minors .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , the publication of articles disclosing the identity of the offenders and indicating the family relationship between the offenders and the victim in such a way that the identity of the victim is revealed in cases which touch upon a victim \u2019s strictly private life was in breach of section ORG of LAW .", "CARDINAL .
