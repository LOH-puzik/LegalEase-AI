The applicant is of GPE ethnic origin . She was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the delivery of her second child , the applicant was sterilised by means of tubal ligation at the gynaecology and obstetrics department of the hospital in PERSON ( \u201c the LOC \u201d ) . ORG was a public hospital administered by ORG at that time and until DATE .", "CARDINAL . During her pregnancy the applicant visited her doctor regularly . She was informed that the delivery would be via caesarean section .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s medical records , the applicant was brought to the hospital in labour by an ambulance at TIME on DATE . At TIME on DATE , when her contractions were occurring at TIME intervals , the applicant was administered premedication in view of the envisaged caesarean section . It included a benzodiazepine derivative which is used for its sedative , anxiety - relieving and muscle - relaxing effects .", "CARDINAL . Following a handwritten entry on the administration of the premedication , the medical record contains a typed entry on the next page , according to which the applicant had requested that a sterilisation procedure be carried out on her reproductive organs during the delivery , and that she had been informed about the irreversible nature of such an operation and of her being unable to conceive a child in the future . The entry is signed by a doctor and it also bears the signature of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant later declared that , after the administration of the premedication , she had been approached by a member of the medical staff who was carrying CARDINAL ACARDINAL size pieces of paper . The staff member had taken her hand to help her sign the papers . The applicant had been in labour and had felt as if she were intoxicated under the influence of the medication . She had neither had the strength nor the will to ask what the documents contained . She remembers a doctor who was present saying that she would die unless she signed the papers . She had therefore not objected to signing the papers with the assistance of the staff member .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s child was born at TIME", "CARDINAL . Another section of the medical records , dated DATE , indicates that the child was delivered by caesarean section .", "CARDINAL . According to a surgical report in the applicant \u2019s medical file , in the course of the operation the doctors discovered a large fissure running the length of the scar from a previous caesarean section on the applicant . After the child \u2019s delivery , the doctors discovered a rupture of the applicant \u2019s uterus . It had probably been the result of the secondary healing of a suture which had become loose during the course of the applicant \u2019s second pregnancy . As a result , the applicant \u2019s life had been at risk . The doctors had therefore considered a hysterectomy as a radical solution to the problem . However , in view of the patient \u2019s age , they had preferred to carry out reconstructive surgery despite the risk of complications . Since the applicant \u2019s uterus was severely damaged , it had been considered certain that a similar situation would occur in any future pregnancy and would pose a grave risk to the life of the applicant and her foetus . After the reconstructive surgery , the doctors had therefore decided to sterilise the applicant in accordance with the request she had made prior to the operation . The report indicates that no complications occurred in the course of the surgery .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The medical records also contain a copy of a decision of the sterilisation commission established at FAC . The decision is dated DATE and indicates that the commission approved , ex post facto , the applicant \u2019s sterilisation , which had been carried out at her request . According to the document , a sterilisation procedure had been justified within the meaning of the Sterilisation Regulation DATE in view of the applicant \u2019s health .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the delivery and sterilisation procedure the applicant was underage . She reached the age of majority DATE . Her mother , who was the applicant \u2019s representative while she was under the age of majority , was not present during the delivery and she had not been asked to give her consent to the sterilisation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant learned about the operation and its nature in DATE , when her lawyer reviewed her medical file in LOC .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , as a result of the operation , she has suffered from serious physical and mental health problems . The applicant \u2019s psychological problems were recognised by a psychologist in a statement dated DATE . She maintained that she had been ostracised by her husband and the GPE community because of her infertility .", "CARDINAL . With a view to describing the overall situation and context in which she had been sterilised , the applicant submitted that she had experienced inferior treatment during her stay at ORG . In particular , the applicant indicated that patients in the gynaecological and obstetrics ward had been segregated according to their ethnic origin . The applicant had been accommodated in a \u201c Gypsy room \u201d separated from women who were not of GPE ethnic origin . The applicant considered that her ethnic origin had played a decisive role in the decision of the medical staff to sterilise her . Citing a number of international reports , the applicant submitted that discrimination against GPE in GPE extended to all facets of their lives .", "CARDINAL . The Government were in disagreement with the applicant \u2019s allegations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sued ORG for damages before FAC . Apart from the relevant provisions of LAW , she also relied on Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Convention . The applicant argued that she had been sterilised contrary to the relevant provisions of NORP law , as her mother had not given consent to the operation . It had also run counter to relevant international human rights standards . The applicant claimed the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) in damages and also claimed reimbursement of her costs .", "CARDINAL . Following the privatisation of ORG , ORG substituted GPE as the defendant in the proceedings on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . With reference to the evidence available , it concluded that the operation had been necessary with a view to saving the applicant \u2019s life . As such , it could have been performed without her prior consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . She maintained , inter alia , that her ethnic origin had motivated the doctors to sterilise her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the firstinstance judgment . It expressed the view that the sterilisation operation on the applicant could not be considered as life - saving surgery and ordered the first - instance court to re - examine the case in light of that opinion .", "CARDINAL . An expert opinion submitted to ORG indicated that during the caesarean section the doctors had discovered an extensive injury to the applicant\u2019 uterus . A hysterectomy , which they had originally considered carrying out , would have been , in the expert \u2019s view , acceptable medical practice in the circumstances . The expert considered the alternative solution which the doctors had chosen , namely reconstructive surgery of the uterus , as an intervention which had saved the applicant \u2019s life in the circumstances . However , the subsequent sterilisation of the applicant had not been indispensable with a view to preventing an imminent danger to her life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a psychology centre conducted an examination of the applicant and issued a report at the request of the applicant \u2019s representative . It was noted that during the examination the applicant had indicated that there was conflict in her marriage , as her husband frequently reproached her for her inability to have more children . The applicant had further indicated that she suffered from stomach pains , loss of appetite and breathing problems . The psychologist concluded that the depressive and pessimistic moods from which the applicant suffered were possibly related to her inability to conceive .", "CARDINAL . In her submissions to ORG the applicant also relied on views expressed by several experts on sociology and GPE culture indicating that the inability to have children strongly diminished the position of a woman and her family in the GPE community .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the defendant to pay the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the applicant . It further held that none of the parties were entitled to have the costs of the proceedings reimbursed .", "CARDINAL . ORG established that the medical staff had failed to obtain informed consent to the applicant \u2019s sterilisation prior to the operation . At the relevant time , the applicant had been underage and her legal representative had not signed the request . It determined the amount of compensation with reference to Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The court did not consider it necessary to avail itself of its right to increase the award of compensation above the rates indicated in the regulation . It noted that the applicant had married the father of her children since bringing the action and had not shown that her position in the ORG had deteriorated .", "CARDINAL . By an additional judgment of DATE ORG formally rejected the remainder of the applicant \u2019s claims and ordered the defendant to reimburse the ORG \u2019s costs incurred in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . She argued that the compensation awarded to her was insufficient in view of the scope and consequences of the damage which she had suffered , and complained that ORG had dismissed her request for reimbursement of her legal costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment on the merits to the extent that it was challenged by the applicant . ORG referred to the opinion of an expert indicating that a third pregnancy would be highly risky for both the applicant and the foetus . If the applicant had not agreed to her sterilisation , she would have been required to confirm in writing that she had been advised that any future pregnancy would threaten her life . Albeit that it could not be established with absolute certainty that such a situation would occur , the existence of such a risk nevertheless justified the conclusion that an increase in compensation under sections PERSON ) and CARDINAL ) of Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL was not justified in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . ORG further quashed the first - instance decision as to the costs of the proceedings and ordered ORG to re - examine the issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a criminal complaint with ORG in Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves . She alleged that the sterilisation operation had been unlawful and had caused her serious bodily harm . The applicant also relied on her rights under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It concluded that no offence had been committed , as the medical staff involved had acted with a view to protecting the applicant \u2019s life and health . Furthermore , it was still possible for the applicant to conceive by means of in vitro fertilisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the lower prosecutor \u2019s decision as being premature .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the police started a criminal investigation . They took statements from the applicant , her mother and a doctor from ORG . The doctor stated that complications had occurred in the course of the delivery , as a result of which the applicant \u2019s life had been at risk . It had therefore been decided to perform a sterilisation , with the applicant \u2019s approval , as a life - saving procedure . In contrast , an expert provided an opinion to the effect that it had not been necessary to sterilise the applicant during the delivery with a view to saving her life . Both the doctor and the expert concurred that the operation had not prevented the applicant from becoming pregnant by means of assisted reproduction .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the police closed the investigation , concluding that no criminal offence had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against that decision . It held , with reference to an expert opinion , that the operation had become necessary as , in the course of the delivery , extensive bleeding had occurred due to a rupture of the applicant \u2019s uterus . In that situation , the doctors had had to take a decision immediately . After consultation with the head physician , they had decided not to carry out a hysterectomy , which was normally indicated in similar situations , but had elected to reconstruct the uterus with a view to preserving it . The surgical team had then carried out a sterilisation by means of tubal ligation so that the applicant could lead a normal life . The applicant had not suffered irreversible damage to her health and she had given her consent to the procedure . She had reached the age of majority DATE thereafter . Prior to the delivery she had lived with her partner and had taken care of CARDINAL child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in response to a complaint by the applicant , upheld the findings reached by the police and ORG . The letter informing the applicant of this decision further stated that the above - mentioned findings of the civil courts in relation to the case did not bind the prosecuting authorities .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s request , a prosecutor from ORG reviewed the case . In a letter of DATE the prosecutor admitted that the operation had not been consented to by the applicant \u2019s representative , contrary to the relevant law . That did not mean , however , that the doctors had committed an offence . In particular , they had acted in good faith with a view to protecting the applicant , as they had considered the operation necessary in view of the applicant \u2019s health .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecutor noted that the applicant had signed the request while experiencing labour pains and that her sterilisation had not been a lifesaving intervention . The provisions of the Sterilisation Regulation DATE had been interpreted and applied for DATE in such a manner that , where it was medically indicated and where the prior agreement of the woman concerned was obtained , sterilisation was carried out immediately after delivery by means of caesarean section .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . She alleged a breach , in the above civil and criminal proceedings , of her rights under LAW , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention , of several provisions of LAW , of ORG , and a number of constitutional provisions . As regards the civil proceedings , she also alleged a breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the complaint on DATE . It held that the prosecuting authorities involved could not be held liable for the alleged breach of the applicant \u2019s substantive rights which had primarily resulted from her sterilisation in LOC . As to the civil proceedings , ORG found that ORG had given sufficient and relevant reasons for its judgment of DATE , which had therefore not been arbitrary . There was no appearance of a breach of LAW in the proceedings leading to that judgment . ORG further found no causal link between ORG judgment and the other rights on which the applicant had relied .", "CARDINAL .

The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with Regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine ( Council of Europe Treaty Series No . CARDINAL ) was ratified by GPE on DATE and entered into force in respect of GPE on DATE . The corresponding notification , together with the text of the ORG , was published in LAW under number CARDINAL on DATE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c Where , according to law , a minor does not have the capacity to consent to an intervention , the intervention may only be carried out with the authorisation of his or her representative or an authority or a person or body provided for by law .", "The opinion of the minor shall be taken into consideration as an increasingly determining factor in proportion to his or her age and degree of maturity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , in force at the relevant time , made medical treatment subject to the patient \u2019s consent . A patient \u2019s consent to medical procedures of a particularly serious character or which substantially affected a person \u2019s future life had to be given in writing or in another provable manner ( section CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act , in the case of patients under the age of majority consent to medical procedures of a particularly serious character within the meaning of section CARDINAL ) was to be given by their representative upon the recommendation of a group of CARDINAL experts . Patients over DATE who were deemed to be intellectually capable of assessing the envisaged procedure had to give their consent to such a procedure as well . The only exception to the foregoing concerned indispensable medical procedures which could not be delayed ( section PERSON ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( \u201c the Regulation \u201d ) governed compensation for pain and impediments to a person \u2019s integration in society which resulted from an injury , occupational disease or other damage to one \u2019s health . It was repealed with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Regulation provided for compensation for pain resulting from damage to a person \u2019s health , and for subsequent medical treatment and the elimination of the effects of such damage . The amount of the compensation for pain was to be determined in accordance with the principles and rates attached to the Regulation . It was to correspond to the scope of the damage to one \u2019s health and the course of its treatment .", "CARDINAL .
