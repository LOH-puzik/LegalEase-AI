GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was arrested on DATE on suspicion of having bought cocaine from H. and of having subsequently sold it to unknown consumers . H. had previously acquired the drugs in the GPE where he had travelled for this purpose in the company of GPE and S.", "In the course of preliminary investigations against the drug supplier H. , B. and PERSON , who had both been involved only in the importing of the drugs by PERSON but not in the subsequent sale to the applicant , were questioned by police officer PERSON and gave , inter alia , hearsay evidence about statements made by PERSON and other circumstances indicating that ORG had subsequently sold part of the imported drugs to the applicant .", "On DATE a chamber of ORG ( ORG ) , with judge PERSON presiding , convicted PERSON of drug trafficking , sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered him to undergo treatment in a detoxification centre . The judgment was primarily based on a full confession made by PERSON following an unrecorded plea bargain reached with the court providing for mitigation of ORG \u2019s expected prison sentence in return for a confession . The veracity of the confession was confirmed by the testimony given by police officer P. regarding the statements made by B. and PERSON during previous police questionings .", "The judgment enumerates the several clients to which ORG had sold drugs on various occasions and among them mentions a person called \u201c J\u00fcrgen Kriegisch \u201d , to whom he had sold cocaine on CARDINAL occasions . The related passages of the judgment establishing the facts of the case which refer to the said person read as follows :", "\u201c ... he [ H. ] ... brought the narcotics to ORG and sold them there as follows : - to PERSON QUANTITY of cocaine at a price of QUANTITY ; - to ... ; ... ... he [ H. ] ... brought the narcotics to GPE and sold them there as follows : ORG to PERSON at DATE of its acquisition QUANTITY but at most QUANTITY of cocaine at a price of CARDINAL and at most QUANTITY ; - to ... ; ... He [ H. ] brought the narcotics to GPE . From the quantity he had purchased in this manner , he sold a gross amount of QUANTITY of cocaine directly following his return to PERSON , who is being prosecuted separately , at a price of CARDINAL and at most QUANTITY and to ... \u201d", "On DATE the main hearing in CARDINAL cases against the applicant on charges of drug trafficking was opened before a chamber of ORG presided over by the same judge , PERSON , who had previously presided over the trial against PERSON The applicant was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG heard evidence from , inter alia , police officer PERSON , regarding the statements made by PERSON and B. when questioned earlier by the police . PERSON refused to give evidence regarding the case as such and , on a request by the applicant to testify , stated that all he could do for the applicant was to remain silent .", "During a break the presiding judge made an offer to the applicant that if he confessed , any prison sentence imposed on him would not exceed DATE ; otherwise the hearing would be adjourned and should the charges brought against the applicant prove true in the course of the resumed proceedings , a term of imprisonment of DATE was to be discussed . The applicant refused the offer , which was not recorded .", "Evidence was also heard from B. and S. as hearsay witnesses . B. refrained from making statements about the case as such . S. gave hearsay testimony on statements made by ORG in relation to the sale of the drugs to the applicant following their importation but stated that he could not give any information regarding the sale of the drugs by ORG to the applicant as such .", "By a decision of DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges including PERSON , ordered the continuation of the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial on the ground that the outcome of the main hearing had confirmed the suspicion of drug trafficking against the applicant . The court based its decision essentially on the information given by police officer PERSON , the hearsay testimony given by PERSON , and on H. \u2019s refusal to testify .", "At the opening of the resumed hearing on DATE the applicant objected to the participation of the presiding judge , PERSON , on the ground of possible bias . He argued , in particular , that PERSON had already presided in the previous trial against PERSON and had obtained a confession from the latter after having indicated that if PERSON confessed he would not impose preventive detention ( GPE ) on him . Pursuant to NORP law , a ruling on preventive detention constituted a legal consequence that was not subject to the discretion of the judge , and any such plea bargain was therefore unlawful . Furthermore , the assessment of the evidence given by the witnesses during the hearing of CARDINAL DATE and the interpretation of ORG \u2019s refusal to testify as reflected in the court \u2019s decision to continue the applicant \u2019s detention had been partial . Finally , the applicant maintained that the offer to terminate the trial made by the presiding judge at the hearing of CARDINAL DATE showed that the judge had sought to exert undue pressure on the applicant with a view to expediting the proceedings and avoiding a proper investigation of the case .", "The applicant \u2019s objection against presiding judge PERSON was dismissed by the substitute chamber ( Vertreterkammer ) of ORG DATE . As regards the court \u2019s order continuing the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial , the court found that it was based on the outcome of the discontinued hearing of CARDINAL DATE and did not anticipate the judges\u2019 assessment following examination of the case in the course of the proceedings . As regards the offer to terminate the proceedings , the substitute chamber found that an accused person would reasonably presume that such an offer by the presiding judge could only mean that in the event of a confession the accused would not face a sentence longer than DATE and that otherwise he could be acquitted or face a sentence of DATE , depending on the outcome of the trial . Under no circumstances could the offer be interpreted to imply that in respect of the same facts and circumstances the applicant would be liable to CARDINAL or CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment depending on whether or not he made a confession .", "At subsequent hearings , on CARDINAL and DATE and on CARDINAL and CARDINAL November CARDINAL , the ORG again heard H. , S. , B. and police officer PERSON The court also heard PERSON , who had been a non - presiding judge ( beisitzender PERSON ) during the previous hearing of CARDINAL DATE and whose testimony gave an account of the statements made by PERSON that hearing . S. again stated that he could not give any information regarding the sale of the drugs by ORG to the applicant as such , and withdrew any statements previously made to police officer PERSON during the police interview , indicating that PERSON had mentioned the applicant as purchaser of the drugs . PERSON himself denied having been involved in drug trafficking with the applicant . The court heard a number of further witnesses called by the applicant in his defence , but refused the applicant \u2019s request for expert opinions , with a view to verifying the credibility of B. \u2019s testimony . The applicant refrained from making statements regarding the case as such throughout the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of drug trafficking in CARDINAL case and acquitted him in the other CARDINAL cases . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . ORG based its judgment mainly on the testimony given by PERSON , police officer PERSON and judge PERSON The court pointed out that PERSON had only been a hearsay witness but had also testified as to her own perception of the events . The court stated that it was aware that the credibility of PERSON \u2019s statements required particular scrutiny , and gave reasons as to why the content and circumstances of her testimony before the court had confirmed its credibility . ORG further reasoned that its finding was supported by PERSON \u2019s refusal to testify in order to protect the applicant and the evidence given by PERSON during his interview with police officer PERSON court further pointed out that PERSON \u2019s confession during his own trial had not been taken into consideration in the trial against the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( ORG ) arguing that the presiding judge had been biased and should have been excluded from the trial . He further complained , inter alia , that the admission of evidence and the assessment of the ORG statements by the court had been arbitrary .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal as unfounded , following a statement of ORG ( ORG ) .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint alleging that the decisions of ORG and ORG infringed his right under LAW , second sentence , of the German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) , which provided that no one should be deprived of his right to a decision rendered by the court established by law ( gesetzlicher Richter ) , on the ground that the presiding judge had been biased and the refusal to exclude him from the trial had been arbitrary . The conduct of the proceedings against ORG and the plea bargain offered to the applicant at the beginning of his trial showed that the presiding judge had been convinced of the applicant \u2019s guilt from the beginning of the proceedings . He further complained that ORG \u2019s confession had been obtained in violation of LAW and should therefore not have been admissible as evidence in his own trial .", "By a decision of DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint on the ground that it was unfounded . It held that the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s objection to the presiding judge by the relevant courts had not been based on arbitrary considerations and did not therefore constitute a violation of the applicant \u2019s right under LAW , second sentence , of the German Basic PERSON . As regards the participation of the presiding judge in the proceedings against PERSON , ORG pointed out that the lower courts could rely on the principle that the participation of a judge in separate proceedings did not generally give rise to bias on that judge \u2019s part .", "ORG specified that even though the considerable difference in the length of the prison sentences mentioned by the presiding judge in his offer to the applicant might give cause for concern , the alternatives given were only meant to indicate the scope within which a possible sentence was \u201c to be discussed \u201d and not to give binding alternatives regarding the length of a possible prison sentence depending on whether the applicant confessed or not . An indication by the presiding judge that a confession might entail a substantial mitigation of sentence and an offer of an upper limit on the prison sentence did not in itself constitute an attempt by the presiding judge to unduly influence the applicant . The fact that the offer was made by the presiding judge at a time when important witnesses had not yet made a statement during the main hearing , but only during police interviews , did not establish bias on his part either , particularly as ORG had already heard the police officer who had previously interviewed those witnesses .", "ORG further held that the presiding judge \u2019s attempt to reach a plea bargain with the applicant with a view to terminating the proceedings did not amount to a violation of his basic rights , since in any event it had been to no avail and the judgment of ORG had thus not been based on it . The same applied to the alleged violation of the provisions of LAW in connection with the confession obtained from ORG , since ORG did not base its judgment in the proceedings against the applicant on PERSON \u2019s previous confession .", "The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL", "\u201c An objection can be raised on the ground of fear of bias if there is a reason which may justify doubts regarding the impartiality of a judge . \u201d", "Article CARDINALa", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The accused \u2019s freedom to make up his mind and to manifest his will shall not be impaired by ill - treatment , induced fatigue , physical interference , administration of drugs , torture , deception or hypnosis . Coercion may be used only as far as this is permitted by the statutory criminal procedure . Threatening the accused with measures not permitted under its provisions or holding out the prospect of an advantage not envisaged by statute shall be prohibited .", "... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c An appeal on points of law may be lodged against judgments of the penal chambers ... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c A judgment shall always be considered to be based on a violation of the law", "... CARDINAL . if a professional judge or lay judge has participated in the drafting of a judgment after being challenged for bias and if the application to challenge was either declared to be well - founded or erroneously rejected ... \u201d .", "LAW , second sentence , of the German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) provides that no one shall be deprived of his right to a decision rendered by the court established by law ( gesetzlicher Richter ) . In its case - law , ORG has consistently dealt with the issue of whether a judge should be excluded for suspicion of bias as a problem of the right to a decision rendered by the legally competent judge ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
