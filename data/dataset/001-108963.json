The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On TIME CARDINAL November CARDINAL the applicant , an engineer , accompanied by PERSON , was driving a car owned by the limited company C. on the national road connecting Ia\u015fi to PERSON and was involved in a car accident . A car travelling in the opposite direction blinded the applicant with its headlights and he was forced to slow down and to steer the car towards the right side of the road . Suddenly , a cart pulled by a horse ( \u201c the cart \u201d ) travelling on the side of the road appeared in front of the applicant and forced him to break abruptly . However , he was unable to avoid collision . The driver of the cart , GPE , escaped unharmed , but his passenger , NORP , suffered some injuries that required medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG carried out a forensic examination of the injuries suffered by NORP and found that they could have been caused by a car accident on DATE , and required DATE of medical care .", "CARDINAL . A second forensic examination of the injuries suffered by NORP was carried out by ORG on DATE . It concluded that ORG \u2019s injuries could have been caused by a car accident on DATE , and required CARDINAL to DATE of medical care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the opening of a criminal investigation against the applicant for involuntary battery and other violent offences .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of ORG of DATE the criminal investigation against the applicant was discontinued on the ground that he had not committed any unlawful act . The decision concluded that the cart which the applicant had collided with had not been equipped with the legally required hazard warning lights , which prevented the applicant from seeing the cart at the material time owing to the poor weather conditions . Consequently , the applicant could not have anticipated the danger and taken action in order to avoid it . NORP appealed against the decision .", "CARDINAL . By a final decision of DATE ORG allowed ORG appeal , quashed the decision of DATE and ordered the reopening of the criminal investigation against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG joined the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant as a civil party and claimed CARDINAL NORP lei ( ROL ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) in respect of pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . By a final decision of DATE ORG acknowledged that ORG had joined as a civil party the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant , indicted the applicant and referred the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant at his own request added to the file a technical expert report dated DATE regarding the accident of CARDINAL DATE . The report concluded , inter alia , that the applicant had been driving lawfully , had been travelling at a speed of fortythree TIME ( km / h ) , that he had hit the cart at a speed of thirtythree km / h and that the person responsible for the accident was GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the ORG ordered a technical expert report and a supplement to the technical report , respectively , to be prepared regarding the accident of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG attached to the Minister of the Interior carried out the technical expert analysis and concluded that the applicant had been travelling at a speed of between twentyeight and QUANTITY could have avoided the accident if his speed had been QUANTITY . However , there had been no reason for him to travel at such a low speed . The travelling speed had been high enough to cause part of the cart to break . Moreover , the accident could have been avoided by GPE if he had equipped his cart with the legally required hazard warning lights . Consequently , the absence of the legally required hazard warning lights on GPE \u2019s cart had been the cause of the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in his written submissions before the firstinstance court , the applicant contested , inter alia , the results of the medical expert reports of DATE and DATE . He contended that ORG had already been suffering from some of the ailments which had been taken into account in the reports in order to determine DATE of medical care she required as a result of the accident . Moreover , the said reports had not established with certainty that her condition had been caused by the car accident at issue .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG acquitted the applicant on the basis of the provisions of Article CARDINAL of GPE , and dismissed GPE \u2019s civil claims for damages against him . Relying on the statements of the witnesses , of the victim and of the accused , as well as on the forensic and technical expert reports contained in the file , the court held that in the absence of hazard warning lights , the applicant could not have foreseen the presence of the cart on the road and that therefore the accident could not have been avoided .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment and argued that the legal basis for his acquittal should have been the fact that he had not committed the alleged offence and that ORG had been the sole party responsible for the accident . ORG also appealed against the judgment , requesting to be awarded civil damages .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , in the presence of the applicant and his chosen legal representative , dismissed both appeals and upheld the judgment of DATE . In dismissing ORG \u2019s request for civil damages , the court held that in the light of the applicant \u2019s acquittal , the just satisfaction claim submitted by the applicant did not have any basis in law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and NORP appealed ( recurs ) against that judgment . NORP modified her civil claims against the applicant to ROL CARDINAL in respect of pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parties were summoned to appear before ORG on DATE .

On DATE , in the absence of the applicant and his legal representative and prior to the delivery of its judgment , ORG heard the oral submissions of the parties present with regard to the appeal .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed in the operative part of its judgment the applicant \u2019s appeal , and upheld the judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . In the reasoning part of the judgment it held that the applicant had failed to provide the court with written or oral reasons for his appeal ( recurs ) , as required by the applicable rules of criminal procedure and that the court could not identify any reasons that would require ORG to quash the judgments of the lower courts . At the same time the court allowed the appeal ( recurs ) lodged by NORP , and ordered the applicant to pay ROL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) to NORP for pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage , out of which ROL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) would be paid jointly with the insurance company A. , for the mental and physical suffering which ORG had endured and the medical expenses she had incurred . It held that the lower courts had misapplied the law with regard to the civil limb of the proceedings , and considered that they had erred in acquitting the applicant on the ground that he could not have anticipated the presence of the cart on the road . According to the evidence in the file , the applicant had committed the unlawful act in respect of which he had been indicted and could have foreseen the danger in question . The applicant was guilty of the offence of involuntary battery and other violent offences because he had failed to control the speed of his car and to adjust it to the road conditions so that he would have been able to stop in the event of a foreseeable obstacle . Moreover , the court dismissed the conclusion reached in the technical expert reports concerning the speed of the applicant \u2019s car , on the ground that the impact had caused part of the cart to break . Furthermore , prudent driving should have prompted the applicant to stop when he was blinded by the headlights of the car travelling in the opposite direction . Consequently , the court concluded that :", "\u201c For the above - mentioned reasons , [ the court ] considers that the applicant is guilty of the offence for which he was correctly indicted and his case sent for trial , the fact that the [ lower ] courts have acquitted him on the basis of the provisions of LAW of the [ NORP ] Criminal Code ( which is not applicable ) , is irrelevant in respect of the civil limb . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant initiated extraordinary annulment ( contesta\u0163ie \u00een anulare ) appeal proceedings against the final judgment of DATE . He argued that he had not been lawfully summoned for the hearing of CARDINAL DATE before ORG . Thus , he had been unaware about the date of the hearing . Consequently , he had been unable to submit written or oral reasons for his appeal , to defend himself or to inform the court as regards his absence .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s annulment appeal on the ground that during the applicant \u2019s absence from his home the summons had been displayed on the main entrance door , in accordance with the applicable rules of criminal procedure . The applicant appealed against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought extraordinary review ( revizuire ) appeal proceedings against the final judgment of DATE , submitting , inter alia , that he had not been lawfully summoned for the hearing held on the aforementioned date .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the final judgment of CARDINAL DATE as inadmissible , on the ground that the said judgment was final and not subject to appeal .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL October CARDINAL ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal to review the final judgment of DATE , on the ground that he had been lawfully summoned and that , in any event , his presence at the hearing would not have changed the outcome of the proceedings , given that ORG had relied on the evidence available in the file and not the parties\u2019 arguments . The applicant appealed against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL October DATE as illfounded .
