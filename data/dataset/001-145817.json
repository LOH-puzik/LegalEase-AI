The ORG appeals against the detention order were dismissed by ORG of GPE in its decision of DATE . In upholding ORG detention order , ORG noted that one of the victims , Mr Ya . B. , had asked for the case to be examined without his participation as he had been afraid to give evidence in open court .

On DATE ORG examined the appeals against the judgment lodged by a co - defendant , one of the victims and the prosecution .

They had also made remarks which did not concern the issues to be decided by the jury and which had been aimed at discrediting the evidence against them , thus creating a negative impression of the victims and the presiding judge , and a positive one of themselves . This was held by ORG to have unlawfully influenced the jury \u2019s verdict . It was also noted that the jury \u2019s verdict had not been entirely clear as some of the answers to the questions put to them had been contradictory .

The court examined the vast body of evidence , including the testimony of CARDINAL victims and witnesses , and numerous expert reports .", "CARDINAL . For DATE the trial was delayed because a co - defendant was ill .
