The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( \u201c the SFRY \u201d ) was a federal ORG composed of CARDINAL republics : GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . Nationals of the SFRY had \u201c dual citizenship \u201d for internal purposes , that is to say they were citizens of both the SFRY and one of the CARDINAL GPE . They had freedom of movement within the federal ORG and could register as permanent residents wherever they settled on its territory .", "CARDINAL . The SFRY had CARDINAL pension systems \u2013 military and civil . The pension rights of military personnel were regulated by and secured through the federal authorities . In particular , members of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the armed forces of the SFRY , paid their contributions to and received their pensions from a special military pension fund based in GPE ( GPE za socialno osiguranje vojnih osiguranika , hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . ORG paid pensions to military pensioners irrespective of where they undertook military service or lived once retired . This was the only pension fund existing at federal level . In parallel , each republic had in place its own pension legislation and public pension fund set up for the payment of civil pensions .", "CARDINAL . DATE the SFRY broke up . On DATE GPE declared its independence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG issued the LAW on the payment of advances on military pensions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below , hereinafter \u201c the Ordinance \u201d ) which regulated , on a temporary basis , the payment of military pensions to former ORG military personnel residing in GPE who had applied for or fulfilled the conditions for retirement under the rules governing the pension and disability insurance of military personnel ( hereinafter \u201c the SFRY military rules \u201d ) by DATE , the date of withdrawal of the ORG from GPE ( see PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , ORG and Reports ( DR ) CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . This was followed in DATE by a new LAW from ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) which put in place a comprehensive regulatory framework for the pension rights of former ORG military personnel , in most cases allowing for pensions to be paid only to NORP nationals .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE ( succeeded in DATE by GPE ) transformed ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) into ORG on the basis of LAW . The ( transformed ) ORG continued paying ORG pensions to the citizens of GPE . However , it remains uncertain to what extent , if at all , the ORG continued paying ORG pensions to the citizens of GPE residing in the other former ORG ( see also , mutatis mutandis , PERSON v. GPE , and PERSON v. GPE , ( dec . ) , nos . ORG and CARDINAL others , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . At the inter - State level , however , the question of responsibility for the payment of pensions to military personnel who had acquired or applied for pensions with ORG under the rules governing the pension and disability insurance of military personnel ( hereinafter \u201c the SFRY military rules \u201d ) remained unresolved until LAW entered into force in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was a citizen of GPE in the SFRY . Following its dissolution , he retained citizenship of the then GPE . He has been residing in GPE since DATE and has had permanent resident status since DATE . In DATE he married a NORP woman , with whom he had CARDINAL children . He was a non - commissioned officer in active military service in the ORG until DATE , when he retired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he applied for retirement to the GPE military district headquarters , and was then \u201c available \u201d ( na razpolago ) until his retirement . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG found him to be entitled to an old - age pension under the SFRY military rules as from DATE with CARDINAL pensionable years with bonus ( benificirana PERSON ) in the ORG . The applicant maintained that he had only received his pension from ORG twice ( in DATE and DATE ) , when he had personally gone to GPE to collect it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for NORP citizenship under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed his application . It based its decision on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and section PERSON ) of LAW , which stipulated that the Ministry was allowed to refuse an application where there was reason to believe that the person posed a threat to public order , security or national defence . After ORG quashed the decision and the case was remitted to ORG for fresh consideration , the latter on DATE again dismissed his application on the same grounds . The applicant instituted court proceedings , which were unsuccessful . On DATE ORG rejected a constitutional complaint by him on the grounds that it was no longer relevant because he had acquired NORP citizenship in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for an advance on his military pension under the Ordinance ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE he requested ORG to discontinue the payment of his pension . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE his payments were stopped with effect from DATE . The applicant lodged this request after realising that ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the Institute \u201d ) only granted advances under the LAW provided that ORG stopped paying the pension .

It held that he had been a permanent resident of GPE since DATE and had fulfilled the conditions for pension entitlement under the SFRY military rules by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , issued of its own motion a decision not to convert the applicant \u2019s advance on his military pension into an old - age pension under LAW . His advance was suspended as of DATE . ORG decided that since the applicant had been in active military service in the ORG from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and from DATE had been on leave , he did not fulfil the statutory conditions for converting the advance on his military old - age pension into an old - age pension under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining that at the relevant time he had not been on leave , but had been available until his retirement . On DATE the ORG dismissed his appeal , holding that he could not be considered a beneficiary under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act as he did not have NORP citizenship and did not comply with the requirements applicable to foreign beneficiaries . It added that he could re - apply for an old - age pension under LAW once he acquired NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently applied for judicial review of the ORG \u2019s decision before ORG , maintaining that , as a resident of GPE , he should have been treated in the same way as NORP citizens .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant acquired citizenship by naturalisation under section CARDINAL of the amended LAW read in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG dismissed the application for judicial review ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It pointed out that the applicant \u2019s situation had to be assessed with regard to the different categories of beneficiaries listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . It concluded that the applicant had not fulfilled the conditions for an old - age pension set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW . Likewise , as a foreigner he had not met the conditions set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW . He had therefore been eligible for an old - age pension under section CARDINAL of LAW only from DATE , the date on which he had acquired NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . On DATE the appeal was dismissed , essentially on the grounds that in the legally relevant period the applicant had been a foreigner who had not had rights to a pension or other benefits under the SFRY military rules by CARDINAL DATE as required by section DATE ) of LAW . The court held that the other provisions of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act were applicable only to NORP citizens and , thus , the applicant , who had not fulfilled the condition of nationality , should not have relied upon them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , claiming he should have been treated the same as NORP citizens . On DATE it was dismissed by ORG , which followed the lower courts\u2019 reasoning . It held that in the period at issue the applicant had not met the requirements of any of the categories of beneficiaries under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , having applied for the pension under the SFRY military rules on DATE and having only acquired NORP citizenship on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to accept a constitutional complaint by the applicant for consideration , finding that it did not concern an important constitutional issue or entail a violation of human rights which had serious consequences for him ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
