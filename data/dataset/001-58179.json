SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-2;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants are all NORP nationals who live in GPE . They are the widow , the son and the daughter of the late Mr L.", "CARDINAL . Mr L. was the owner of a mail - order company . In DATE he declared certain moneys to the tax authorities ; he maintained that these were profits lawfully made in GPE from capital speculation and investments , and were not taxable in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr L. died on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE period within which the applicants could have rejected the inheritance ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Swiss Civil Code ) expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having come to the conclusion \u2013 in the absence of vouchers supporting Mr L. 's allegations \u2013 that the moneys declared were in reality income generated by Mr L. 's mail - order firm which he had unlawfully failed to declare in GPE , initiated proceedings against the applicants for recovery of unpaid cantonal and federal taxes , and at the same time imposed fines for tax evasion .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicants cooperated with the tax authorities , enabling them to make a correct assessment of the taxes due .", "CARDINAL . The DATE 's file contains no information about any proceedings to contest the recovery of cantonal tax arrears or the related fine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG against the decision of CARDINAL DATE in so far as it related to direct federal taxes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave its decision . It considered that the tax authorities had failed to prove that the moneys in question were undeclared taxable income , but found it established that Mr L. had deliberately failed to declare the interest received from it . Accordingly , it partly upheld the applicants ' appeal , significantly reducing the amount of back tax to be paid . It also reduced the fine to CARDINAL of the additional amount normally due in view of the fact that Mr L. had himself reported the moneys concerned to the authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG lodged an administrative - law appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants filed a written defence arguing , inter alia , that it was contrary to LAW to impose a fine on the heirs of a taxpayer for tax evasion committed by the latter .", "CARDINAL . ORG and ORG were invited to submit written comments pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW .", "ORG declined to do so . ORG expressed the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the appeal .", "It held that ORG had erred in imposing the burden of proof on the tax authorities . Since their investigations had revealed prima facie evidence that Mr L. had been guilty of tax evasion , it had been for the applicants to demonstrate that the moneys in question had not in fact been undeclared taxable income . Since the applicants had not done so , the assessment of back taxation should be allowed to stand .", "ORG rejected the suggestion that the imposition of a tax fine on the heirs of the taxpayer for tax evasion committed by the latter was contrary to LAW . After referring to its case - law , it went on to hold :", "\u201c [ In earlier cases ORG ] has held that although the tax fine constituted a real penalty , it was directed at the deceased personally and not at the heirs ; the heirs were required , under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax , only to ensure that the fine was paid and only up to the value of their share of the estate . That the fine was not directed at the heirs also appeared from the fact that the fine was determined in principle [ grunds\u00e4tzlich ] according to the guilt of the deceased and the heirs could escape their liability by renouncing the inheritance . As ORG has held , the effect of the arrangement laid down in LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax \u2013 according to which in pending proceedings the heirs take the place of the deceased , and [ new ] proceedings were to be initiated and pursued against the heirs if the evasion was discovered only after the death of the deceased \u2013 is only that all cases are dealt with in the same way , irrespective of the time factor . \u201d", "However , as the fine had to be determined anew , the case was referred back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied to the ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision setting the fine at MONEY ( CHF ) , or PERCENT of the amount that would normally have been due , in view of the applicants ' basically cooperative attitude .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an administrative - law appeal to ORG on DATE . They produced , inter alia , medical evidence from which it appeared that in DATE of his life Mr L. had not been wholly responsible for his actions and they suggested that a fine of not MONEY CARDINAL,CARDINAL would be more appropriate to reflect his guilt .", "ORG and ORG and ORG were invited to submit written comments , and they asked ORG to dismiss the appeal .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE ORG upheld the applicants ' appeal in so far as it was argued that the question of Mr L. 's diminished responsibility should have been considered and referred the case back to ORG for a second time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision in which it reduced the fine that would have been payable by Mr L. himself on the ground of his diminished responsibility , and in view of the applicants ' attitude set the final amount at PERCENT of that figure , or CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , tax evasion was punishable by a fine of CARDINAL times the amount evaded , the fine being payable in addition to the amount due ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided , inter alia :", "\u201c If the evasion is discovered only after the death of the taxpayer , proceedings shall be brought against his heirs .

According to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Swiss Civil Code , an inheritance passes upon the death of the deceased .", "CARDINAL .

Subject to the statutory exceptions , all claims and actions , property rights and other rights in rem and possessions of the deceased shall automatically pass to them , and they shall become personally liable for the deceased 's debts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Swiss Civil Code , the heirs have the right to renounce the inheritance which has devolved to them . The time - limit for so doing is DATE ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It was open to the taxpayer to lodge an objection against an assessment of direct federal tax to the authority which had made it ( Article CARDINAL of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax ) .", "CARDINAL . An appeal against the decision given in the objection proceedings lay to ORG ( Article CARDINAL of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax ) . ORG of the canton and the federal tax authorities could also bring such an appeal ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An administrative - law appeal lies to ORG against the decision of ORG ( section CARDINAL ( e ) of LAW ) . Such an appeal may be lodged by both the tax debtor and the federal tax authorities ( LAW of the Ordinance on Direct Federal Tax ) .", "CARDINAL .

At the material time , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG made it possible for a CARDINAL - judge ORG to dismiss an administrative - law appeal as manifestly ill - founded without a hearing , provided that its decision was unanimous .", "CARDINAL .

According to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , the heirs shall not be so liable if the tax evasion proceedings are concluded after the death of the taxpayer , provided that the heirs themselves are guiltless and do what they can to enable the tax authorities to make a correct assessment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
