The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was the acting chief editor of the PERSON newspaper . The second applicant was a journalist working for the same newspaper .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its issue of CARDINAL DATE , the newspaper published an article named \u201c Grain Mafia in GPE \u201d ( \u201c GPE tax\u0131l mafiyas\u0131 \u201d ) , under the by - line of PERSON , a pseudonym of the second applicant . The article was accompanied by a picture of J.A. , who was a member of ORG , a well - known expert in agriculture , and a member of PERSON ( ORG ) . The article generally spoke about a number of problems in the country \u2019s agricultural sector . It also appeared to imply , amongst other things , that J.A. was in charge of the breeding of certain experimental crops in \u201c experimental \u201d fields in several agricultural regions . ORG name was printed in full in the article itself .", "CARDINAL . Specifically , the article read as follows ( translated from NORP ) :", "\u201c [ President ] Heydar PERSON \u2019s famous conference in PERSON was rich in memorable moments . Naturally , in the essence of this richness , it is impossible not to notice the scale of arbitrariness and corruption and how the entire nation is held up to ridicule . But we are not talking about the dismissal ... of [ certain government officials ] for reasons which remain obscure to many .", "We are also not talking about how it was far from logical to accuse of stinginess a businessman named ORG who has spent MONEY on charity in DATE , while not a single member of the clan which has misappropriated MONEY of the country \u2019s wealth is willing to expend MONEY on development of our motherland . What is interesting is that the Head of ORG accused the people , whom he had turned into an object of reproach , of nepotism ... and monopolisation of the private sector in ORG . PERSON says that he has refused to appoint his relatives to any [ official ] positions despite [ having received ] insistent requests in this regard . But what he does not say is that there is no person in this country other than the son PERSON who simultaneously occupies CARDINAL \u201c armchairs \u201d . Speaking of seizing control over [ well - to - do sectors of economy ] , DATE even a baby who is just learning to speak knows which people control such a huge sphere of the NORP economy as the agricultural sector . CARDINAL of hectares of fertile land in GPE have been turned into an experimental zone for \u201c valuable sorts \u201d of grains . For DATE the agricultural sector has been plundered as if it were in the private ownership of the certain known person .", "During the NORP period agriculture was the main contributor to the gross domestic product and the main area of the population \u2019s employment . However , in the GPE era of independence , the agrarian sector , like all other sectors of the economy , has been monopolised to serve the interests of peri - governmental circles . With the exception of grain and livestock farming , other leading branches of agriculture have slumped . The productivity level of poultry farming has decreased from QUANTITY in DATE to QUANTITY in DATE . Viticulture can be said to have been completely ruined , while cotton growing is in such an acute state of decline that within DATE its share in the total agricultural product has decreased from PERCENT . As a result of appropriation of the cotton - processing industry by a group of monopolists , cotton planters are being seriously exploited . At the moment DATE cotton - ginning plants existing in the country are controlled by a company named ORG . This company \u2019s share of all the cotton processed in the country DATE was PERCENT . [ A description is given of various specific monopolistic policies pursued by this company . ]", "The development of the grain - growing industry is under the special care of a group [ of persons ] who have monopolised this sphere . For DATE the people in the provinces either can not sell the grain they have grown under considerable hardship or , in the best - case scenario , are forced to sell it for CARDINAL manats per kilogramme . For example , during DATE in such big grain - growing regions as PERSON , PERSON and GPE , the local executive authorities either prevented the major grain buyers from GPE from entering these regions or forced them to buy grain from specified fields . [ This was done ] for a simple reason \u2013 in order to sell , in a timely manner , all the grain from the QUANTITY of [ ORG ] \u2018 ORG in these regions . It is clear that , as simple peasants do not possess necessary facilities ( such as special buildings ) for storage of grain , they are forced to sell their crop at low prices .", "The land reform is often spoken about . But at the same time several important issues are forgotten . Firstly , CARDINAL of those who are given a share of land do not possess even the minimum facilities to cultivate it . Secondly , QUANTITY of fertile land , labelled as \u2018 state land fund\u2019 during the land reform , are held hostage by the \u2018 agrarian ORG , and not MONEY goes to the state budget from its lease .", "Nowadays this mafia ... bends over backwards to obtain from the ORG MONEY in DATE subsidies for the development of agriculture . But no one is asking PERSON why , if he cares so much about the development of agriculture , he sells the equipment donated by the NORP government , and not even for discount prices , but for prices higher than the ex - factory price . These people \u2013 those who sell a plough , which they have obtained free of charge , to the peasant for MONEY , a tractor for MONEY , and a grain combine harvester for MONEY \u2013 now they want to get money from the ORG to revive agriculture . Sorry , but we are n\u2019t duped by you . Your \u2018 ORG to CARDINAL\u2019 , which you have submitted to the Government [ for implementation ] , is not a programme aimed at supporting the peasant , but a programme allowing you to increase your personal wealth at a cost of MONEY which you snatch from the ORG budget DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE J.A. filed a criminal complaint with ORG using the procedure of a private prosecution . He claimed that the article clearly referred to him in a defamatory , slanderous and insulting manner . Specifically , he cited the following extracts as defamatory :", "\u201c ... DATE even a baby who is just learning to speak knows which people control such a huge sphere of the NORP economy as the agricultural sector . CARDINAL of hectares of fertile land in GPE have been turned into an experimental zone for \u201c valuable sorts \u201d of grains .

J.A. argued that the article clearly implied that he was in close contact with certain alleged criminal circles and thus , in essence , accused him of serious crimes such as the misappropriation of state funds allocated for agricultural research . He contended that the second applicant had deliberately made false statements damaging to his reputation and that the first applicant , as an acting chief editor , had failed to prevent this . He requested the court to convict the applicants under Articles CARDINAL ( defamation ) and CARDINAL ( insult ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , the applicants argued that the article had not contained any defamatory or insulting statements about J.A. They maintained that the phrase \u201c the certain known person \u201d did not refer to J.A. The picture of J.A. was placed in the article because of his general achievements in the development of grain farming . Lastly , they noted that the article was concerned with the general situation of the agricultural sector and that it contained no information specifically accusing LAW of any criminal activity .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG convicted the applicants of defamation and insult under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW . Having examined the extracts from the article quoted above ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) , the court noted that the applicants\u2019 denial of the fact that the article had anything to do with PERSON was groundless , because the text of the article clearly mentioned PERSON \u2019s name in full and clearly stated that QUANTITY of grain fields belonged to him . The court went on to find that :", "\u201c ... expression by PERSON of the idea of the existence of a mafia that does not exist in reality and his dissemination of this idea through the mass media constitutes defamation , that is , deliberate dissemination of false information tarnishing J.A. \u2019s honour and dignity and damaging his reputation . Therefore , the court finds that , by disseminating [ through the mass media ] the information about the existence of a mafia that does not exist in reality , PERSON committed an offence under LAW , and that , by making and disseminating the statement \u2018 in order to sell , in a timely manner , all the grain from the QUANTITY of hectares of [ ORG ] \u2018 ORG in these regions\u2019 , ORG committed an offence under LAW . The other accused person , PERSON , bears the same criminal responsibility for [ allowing such dissemination as the newspaper \u2019s acting chief editor ] . Accordingly , NORP ORG and PERSON must be found guilty under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court sentenced each applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment under LAW and three months\u2019 imprisonment under LAW . By partially merging these sentences , the court fixed a total sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment in respect of each applicant . At the same time , applying section CARDINAL of the Milli Mejlis ( Parliament ) Resolution on ORG in ORG with the Anniversary of the Victory over Fascism in World War II , dated DATE , the court exempted them from serving their sentences .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . They argued that the article discussed a number of problems in the agricultural sector and did not specifically relate to J.A. The fact that it contained ORG picture and a statement that he possessed QUANTITY of grain fields did not amount to defamation or insult . In respect of that statement , they argued that it was a generally known fact and did not offer any evidence in its support . The applicants also argued that J.A. and ORG had wrongly construed the totality of statements contained in the article as defamatory whereas their intended meaning was harmless .", "CARDINAL .
