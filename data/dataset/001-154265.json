In a decision of DATE the judicial investigation into the cause of death and the CARDINAL investigations in respect of premeditated murder were joined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted a request by the applicant to withdraw the case from the LOC court and it was transferred to the tribunal de grande instance of GPE , where it was assigned on DATE to PERSON , assisted by Mr GPE on DATE , both investigating judges , who were to conduct the judicial investigation jointly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a lawyer at ORG informed the police that A. , a former senior officer and member of ORG , who had found asylum in GPE , had certain revelations to make concerning Judge PERSON . The information thus disclosed was transmitted to the NORP authorities via ORG . A judgment of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) records the following sequence of events : Judges PERSON and GPE did not reply , owing to the fact that the witness wished to remain anonymous , and the information was not followed up ; the witness \u2019s NORP lawyer thus contacted the applicant , who arranged for the witness to be interviewed by journalists from the DATE newspaper ORG and the NORP TV channel TFCARDINAL , at DATE ; lastly , it was as a result of the publication and broadcasting of that interview in DATE that Judges PERSON and PERSON decided to go to GPE to assist the NORP investigator in taking evidence from the witness .", "CARDINAL .

It was subsequently alleged by A. that he had been pressurised and intimidated by Judge PERSON so that he would withdraw his testimony , those complaints being expressly made in a letter of DATE from his lawyer to ORG . In addition , the witness accused the public prosecutor of GPE of having threatened him to make him recant his statement , and alleged that the head of the GPE secret services had ordered the head of ORG , PERSON , to draft a statement discrediting him . Captain I. confirmed A \u2019s accusations concerning him .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings were brought in GPE against the public prosecutor of GPE and the head of the country \u2019s secret services for the procuring of false evidence , and Judge PERSON \u2019s widow and son , the witness NORP , Captain PERSON , and a NORP lawyer PERSON , who was implicated , intervened as civil parties .

NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the investigating judges PERSON and GPE accepted the request concerning PERSON , finding that a new interview was absolutely necessary . They refused , however , to agree to a site visit , as such a visit had already been made twice , once in DATE and again DATE before the decision in question , as they did not see \u201c how a visit to the site in the presence of the civil party would , at th[at ] stage of the proceedings , be helpful for the discovery of the truth \u201d .

They also requested that ORG take over the case from the investigating judges and continue the investigation itself .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG of ORG found that after CARDINAL site visits in the absence of the civil parties , CARDINAL of which closely resembled a reconstruction , the need to organise an on - site reconstruction in the presence of the civil parties so that they could exercise their rights was indispensable for the discovery of the truth . Accordingly , it set aside the decision of Judges PERSON and PERSON on that point . In addition , it withdrew the case from them and appointed a new investigating judge , Judge PERSON , to continue the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor , further to the request of the investigating judge then handling the case , on the basis of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , issued a statement to clarify publicly that \u201c whilst suicide had once been the preferred theory , the evidence gathered , especially DATE , now point[ed ] to a criminal act \u201d , adding that the experts\u2019 reports had determined that \u201c PERSON was lying on the ground when liquids were poured over him in a random manner \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings are currently still pending .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister of Justice , by acts of DATE and DATE , referred to ORG ( ORG magistrature DATE the \u201c FAC ) , in its capacity as disciplinary board for judges , certain shortcomings attributable to Judge PERSON in the judicial investigation into the \u201c NORP \u201d case for which she was responsible and in which the applicant also represented the civil parties . Judge PERSON was criticised for not devoting the necessary care and attention to the case file , leaving it practically untouched for DATE , for having recourse to a friendly settlement procedure which went beyond the jurisdiction of an investigating judge and for not making copies of all the documents in the case file , thus making it impossible to reconstruct the file after its partial disappearance from her chambers . Judge PERSON requested that the referral to the ORG be declared null and void , particularly on account of the fact that it had been made public by the director of the Minister \u2019s private office at a press conference , even before she had been personally notified of the decision .

The general meeting drafted the following motion , which was adopted unanimously :", "\u201c The general meeting of judges of the GPE tribunal de grande instance held on DATE , without disputing the authority conferred on the Minister of ORG to take disciplinary proceedings in the conditions prescribed by law , is surprised to learn from the press that such proceedings have been initiated against Judge [ M. ] , investigating judge in GPE , whereas to date neither the judge herself nor her judicial hierarchy have been officially informed thereof . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the context of a magazine interview published in DATE , the chair of PERSON magistrature , a civil party in the GPE case , criticised the \u201c lack of impartiality on the part of Judge M. in the GPE and [ L. ] cases \u201d , adding that the judges who had signed the motion \u201c could not have been unaware that in CARDINAL sensitive cases , the GPE case and the [ L. ] case , her impartiality was seriously called into question \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the GPE tribunal de grande instance , in a case brought by the applicant as counsel acting for CARDINAL civil parties , had found the ORG liable for gross negligence on the part of the courts service on account of the disappearance of the so - called \u201c Scientology \u201d file from the office of Judge PERSON It awarded damages to the complainants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed a plea of nullity from Judge PERSON and , on the merits , while reproaching her for a certain lack of rigour or a failure to keep track of the case sufficiently , did not impose any disciplinary penalty on her .", "CARDINAL .
