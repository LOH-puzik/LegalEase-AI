On DATE the ORG v Voronezhe newspaper ( \u201c the newspaper \u201d ) published an article by Mr PERSON entitled \u201c Atomic Mayor \u201d ( \u00ab PERSON \u043c\u044d\u0440 ORG ) . The article concerned abuses and irregularities allegedly committed by PERSON , the mayor of GPE , and by other municipal officials , including PERSON , a deputy head of administration and director of the economy and finance department , and PERSON , the chairman of the education committee . The article also mentioned certain private parties who supplied goods or performed services for the municipal authorities , including PERSON , a local businessman who did renovation work for Statefunded institutions .", "CARDINAL . The article quoted extensively from the ORG on ORG , carried out by ORG of ORG for GPE from DATE ( \u201c the audit report \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr S. , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON lodged an action for defamation against the applicant . They claimed that the following extracts from the article were untrue and damaging to their reputation :", "\u201c ... In DATE a group of campaigners in GPE collected signatures for a vote of no confidence in PERSON They collected CARDINAL signatures ... \u201d [ paragraph CARDINAL ]", "\u201c ... For a long time the GPE town administration failed to transfer payments to the compulsory medical insurance fund . In the mayor 's opinion , these transfers were not mandatory , but a commercial court decided otherwise . Thanks to S. , in DATE the town budget will lose a further MONEY ] ... \u201d [ CARDINAL ]", "\u201c ... Mayor PERSON still adheres to the ideas of Socialism and Communism ; not only once did he enter the ranks of ORG of GPE ... occasionally he left its ranks ... \u201d [ CARDINAL ]", "\u201c ... [ In addition to the budget , ORG has an off - budget fund . And a substantial one . ] CARDINAL would only wonder at the way the mayor and his faithful companion , comrade PERSON , the head of the economy and finance department doubling as executive director of all funds , handled its assets ...", "Thus , thanks to the efforts of CARDINAL prominent economists , the town lost an amount comparable to CARDINAL of the DATE budget ... \u201d [ CARDINAL , CARDINAL ]", "\u201c The chairman of the education committee of the PERSON administration , PERSON , did not produce any documents showing that these students came from needy or large families as he claimed ... \u201d", "What kind of needy families were these if even PERSON , the chairman of the education committee , does not know them ? \u201d [ CARDINAL , CARDINAL ]", "\u201c Inquisitive readers would ask : why did PERSON care so much about the military unit in the village of PERSON and the regional psychiatric hospital ( let 's recall the charitable contribution of MONEY made to the hospital ) ? And they would start looking for an answer .", "Is it not in military unit no . DATE that the son of the aforementioned official is doing his military service ?", "Is it not in the regional psychiatric hospital that a relation or a namesake of PERSON has just undergone a medical examination in order to escape punishment for a serious criminal offence ? ... [ CARDINAL - CARDINAL ]", "And what about the honest Mayor PERSON ? He does not know , perhaps , about the tricks of his deputy ?", "On the contrary . He does know and he even personally signs payment orders for the transfer of money to the ORG enterprise ' GPE regional clinical psychiatric hospital ' ... \u201d [ CARDINAL , CARDINAL ]", "\u201c The thing is that the notion of competitions ( tenders ) for the provision of services for ORG - funded organisations ceased to exist in the town long ago . If our fair and NORP - minded mayor PERSON ( they have done much business together ) , he could have as much work as he liked . He could supply computers at MONEY a piece and feed children in kindergartens at inflated prices ... \u201d [ CARDINAL ]", "\u201c ... During the audit an estimate of the repair work actually performed in the town stadium was made up . The cost of the actual work done amounted to MONEY . So , Mr S. and Mr F. , where have MONEY gone ? ... \u201d [ CARDINAL ]", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE ( \u201c the trial court \u201d ) took evidence from the parties . The plaintiffs produced judgments of commercial courts pursuant to which the amount of MONEY ( RUB ) had been recovered from the GPE municipal authorities in respect of payments to the medical insurance funds . PERSON also produced a document showing that he had been a member of ORG since DATE and never relinquished his membership .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had at its disposal ordinary copies of the audit report and the report of CARDINAL DATE on the verification of the work done at the stadium and shooting gallery ( \u201c the stadium report \u201d ) . Since ordinary copies , as opposed to certified copies , had no evidentiary value , the applicant asked the trial court to obtain the originals . The trial court refused the request because the applicant had not shown that it had attempted to obtain the originals itself .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout DATE the applicant unsuccessfully sought to obtain the originals from ORG of ORG for GPE , the town department of the interior and ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant renewed its request for a court injunction requiring the relevant authorities to submit the original documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court refused the request , without citing any reasons in the text of the judgment . Mr S. withdrew his claim in the part concerning paragraph CARDINAL of the article .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court issued its judgment . It found that all the extracts contested by the plaintiffs had been untrue and damaging to their reputation . The trial court premised its findings on the following principles :", "\u201c In such cases , pursuant to LAW , the defendant shall prove the truthfulness of the information disseminated , whilst the plaintiff is only required to show that the defendant disseminated the information . Not only assertions , but also conjectures shall be amenable to proof . Damaging conjectures which are shown to have been unfounded in a court hearing will give rise to an apology . Reliance on rumours , hearsay , opinions of anonymous experts , competent sources , etc . as the basis for the damaging information shall not relieve the defendant from the obligation to show its truthfulness ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The trial court decided that CARDINAL of the article implied the embezzlement of funds by PERSON and Mr F. However , it noted that the audit report assessed the total cost of work at RUB MONEY and that the defendants failed to adduce any proof of embezzlement .", "CARDINAL . The trial court accepted Mr S. 's opinion that statements in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of the article impaired his honour , dignity and reputation . In the trial court 's view , it was incorrect to say that the town \u201c would lose a further CARDINAL thanks to the mayor \u201d because the payments had been mandatory anyway and , after they had been withheld for some time , a court had ordered their recovery in the same amount . The information on Mr S. 's \u201c discontinuous \u201d party membership was considered untrue because he showed that he had joined ORG once and had not relinquished his membership ever since . The trial court held that in paragraph CARDINAL the author wrongly blamed PERSON and PERSON for stopping the funding , because the structure of off - budget funds was regulated by federal government decision . Lastly , as to paragraph DATE , the trial court determined that it conveyed an impression that dishonest men , acting under the mayor 's patronage , had made a profit out of kindergartens , but the authors did not produce any evidence showing the truthfulness of that allegation .", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON , the trial court held that DATE , CARDINAL and DATE of the article were untrue and damaging for his reputation because the defendants failed to prove that PERSON had been the executive director of \u201c all funds \u201d , that a relation of his , especially a criminal , had been in hiding in the psychiatric hospital or had been treated there , and that he and PERSON had misspent the town 's budget .", "CARDINAL . The trial court accepted PERSON view that the allegations of abuses in the selection of students and his personal involvement in them ( paragraphs DATE and DATE ) had been insulting for him .", "CARDINAL . The judgment stated :", "\u201c Thus , the court has concluded that the plaintiffs ' claims are well - founded because the author and the editors tolerated the publication of an article that contained insulting and untrue statements ... without bothering to check all the relevant facts . In accordance with the law ... evidence should have been collected before the information was published and it is inappropriate to start collecting evidence after the article was published ... Moreover , the plaintiffs have produced before the court a reply from the ORG prosecutor 's office and a decision of the NORP police department refusing criminal prosecution in connection with the audit of certain financial matters in the education committee of GPE in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The trial court ordered the applicant to pay RUB CARDINAL to Mr S. , as well as RUB CARDINAL,CARDINAL to PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , respectively , that is , RUB CARDINAL in total , and also to publish an apology .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a detailed appeal statement , claiming that the article had concerned an issue of public interest and that the plaintiffs , being \u201c public figures \u201d and ORG servants , should have been more tolerant to criticism than ordinary citizens . The article was largely founded on the audit report and the district court did not afford the applicant an opportunity to prove the truthfulness of any statements of fact as it refused their request to obtain original documents . Moreover , the trial court ordered the applicant to refute value judgments . The appeal statement read , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c As regards the first document [ ... ] , [ the trial court ] referred to the fact that there was no need to request it because the case file contained a decision by the senior police officer of the GPE GOVD [ main department of the interior ] to institute a criminal investigation into the facts mentioned in the report by the LAW [ ORG ] .", "As regards the second document [ ... ] , the [ trial ] court referred to the fact that [ it had been stated ] in the reply by the GPE GOVD to the editorial board 's request to provide the document that the ORG did not have the document in question as it had been forwarded to the ORG prosecutor 's office , and that there was therefore no need to request it from the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE . It held that the applicant 's arguments that the article had contained value judgments rather than statements of fact was \u201c unsubstantiated \u201d . The court reasoned , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c The dissemination of the information that the plaintiffs seek to refute was proven before the [ trial ] court and has not been disputed by the respondent . Accordingly the newspaper was obliged to submit evidence before the [ trial ] court to prove the truthfulness of the information in question .", "However , no such evidence was presented before the [ trial ] court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant transferred RUB CARDINAL to the bank account of the bailiffs ' service in execution of the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant published an apology in DATE issue of the newspaper retracting the information contained in the article .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of the Russian Federation guarantees freedom of ideas and expression , as well as freedom of mass media .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW of GPE of DATE provides that an individual may seize a court with a request for the rectification of information ( \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ) damaging his or her honour , dignity or professional reputation unless the person who disseminated such information proves its accuracy . The individual may also claim compensation for losses and non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such information . The rules governing the protection of the professional reputation of a physical person are likewise applicable to the protection of the professional reputation of legal entities .", "CARDINAL . Resolution no . CARDINAL of ORG of GPE of DATE , as amended on DATE ( in force at the material time ) provided in its LAW that to be considered damaging the information ( \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ) had to be untrue and contain statements about an individual 's or a legal entity 's breach of the laws or moral principles ( commission of a dishonest act , improper behaviour at the workplace or in everyday life , etc . ) . Dissemination of information was understood as the publication of information or its broadcasting , its inclusion in professional references , public addresses , applications to ORG officials , as well as its communication in other forms , including orally , to CARDINAL other person . DATE ORG governed the distribution of the burden of proof in defamation cases . The plaintiff was to show that the information in question had been disseminated by the defendant .
