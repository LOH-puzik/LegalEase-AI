De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE . He is detained at ORG , PERSON . He is represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP On TIME CARDINAL DATE , DATE woman , ORG , was raped both vaginally and anally in the course of a burglary at her home . Soon afterwards , ORG gave a statement to the police in which she stated CARDINAL black men had broken into her house and she had been raped by a large black man with an ordinary LANGUAGE accent . She stated that she had the impression that the men were older than teenagers but could not be sure . In the course of the police investigation , semen was found on her nightdress , on a bed sheet and on swabs taken from her body . The samples were placed in storage . No - one was charged at the time of the offences and ORG died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is white , slightly built and has an NORP accent . He was DATE at the time of the offences . In DATE his DNA was found to match that found on the nightdress and bed sheet . He was arrested , charged with rape , false imprisonment , buggery and burglary , and went to trial before a judge and jury at the ORG from CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL DATE . The applicant \u2019s defence was that he had been having an affair with ORG and that they had consensual sex on a number of occasions , the last being DATE before the rape took place , which explained the DNA on the bed sheet and nightdress . He denied , however , that he had been responsible for the burglary and rape .", "CARDINAL . At the start of the trial the prosecution applied for ORG \u2019s police statement to be read to the jury under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE . The trial judge allowed the application . He considered that it was proper to have regard to the likelihood of it being possible for the defence to controvert the statement of the witness by the defendant himself giving evidence and/or calling evidence of other witnesses . He noted that , while the evidence of ORG was important , and without it there would be no prosecution , it was not the sole or decisive evidence in the prosecution case . The trial judge further considered the defence complaint that they could not explore the grounds for ORG \u2019s belief that she had been raped by a black man and could not be examined as to the affair the applicant said they had been having . The trial judge took the view that these were important matters but could be addressed by an appropriate direction to the jury in his summing up .", "CARDINAL . After ORG \u2019s statement had been read to them , the police officer who took the statement gave live evidence to the effect that ORG was well - spoken , \u201c old school \u201d , stoic , and prim and proper . ORG had told the police officer that she had not married until she was DATE , that she had been a virgin when she had married and that she and her husband had sexual intercourse infrequently .", "The jury also heard evidence from ORG \u2019s friends to whom she had confided that she had been raped by a black man . The friends also gave evidence that ORG had been a lively , intelligent and active woman , who was involved in her local church . She had developed a tendency to be forgetful after she turned DATE .", "A neighbour , ORG , aged CARDINAL at the time of trial , also gave evidence that she and ORG had met the applicant at a caf\u00e9 . She ( ORG ) had exchanged numbers with him . She had seen him a few times afterwards , once in the company of a black man . ( The applicant denied this last part of her evidence . ) They had slept together once . ( The applicant maintained it was on CARDINAL occasions . ) To her knowledge , the applicant and ORG had never met each other after their meeting at the caf\u00e9 .", "The jury also heard expert evidence that the chances of the DNA on the bed sheet and nightdress belonging to someone other than the applicant were CARDINAL in CARDINAL . There was also forensic evidence that the applicant \u2019s fingerprints had been found in CARDINAL places in ORG \u2019s home , including the window which had been forced open to obtain entry .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution also applied for leave to introduce the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL previous convictions for domestic burglaries , which had been committed DATE , on the ground that they were relevant to an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution , namely whether the applicant had a propensity to burgle . The defence opposed that application , arguing that there was not a sufficient degree of similarity between the past burglaries ( which had not involved targeting the elderly or any sexual offences ) and the present case , where the principal charge was CARDINAL of rape . The trial judge nonetheless allowed the introduction of the previous convictions , agreeing with the prosecution that the test was only whether the applicant had a propensity to burgle and whether this was an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution . He was satisfied that this was the case and was further satisfied that the admission of the convictions was not so prejudicial as to outweigh its probative value .", "CARDINAL . The applicant gave evidence in his own defence . He said that , after meeting ORG at the caf\u00e9 , he had performed odd jobs for her , including repairing her window , which explained the fingerprints . In any event , given his previous experience of burglary , he would have known to use gloves , had he been the burglar . On CARDINAL occasions ORG had complained of joint or muscle pains and he had rubbed some oil on the painful areas . On a further occasion he had been helping ORG move items into her bedroom . He had made a pass at her and they had proceeded to make love on the bed . In total , they had sex on CARDINAL or nine occasions and at least twice in the bedroom . After the last occasion , on CARDINAL DATE , he finished his relationships with ORG and ORG and moved away from the area . He did so because he worked in the building industry and was obliged to move wherever there was work .", "CARDINAL . In respect of ORG \u2019s statement , the trial judge directed the jury in these terms :", "\u201c ... you should examine it with particular care , bearing well in mind that it does have certain limitations which I draw your attention to now .", "You have not had the opportunity of seeing or hearing [ ORG ] in the witness box or of assessing her as a witness . When you do see and hear a witness you may get a much clearer idea of whether their evidence is honest and accurate . Her statement was not made or verified on oath and her evidence has not been tested in cross - examination , and you have not had the opportunity of seeing how her evidence would have survived some form of challenge . Her statement only forms part of the evidence and it must be considered in the light of all of the other evidence in the case . You must reach your verdict having considered all of the evidence . You should also have regard to the following discrepancies between her statement and her complaint and the prosecution evidence and the discrepancy [ that ] she was adamant that she was raped by a black man . \u201d", "The trial judge went to outline for the jury the ways in which they could test the reliability of ORG \u2019s statement , including the circumstances in which it was made , her comments to her neighbours after the rape , her lifestyle ( including her tendency , later in life , to become forgetful ) , whether the statement was supported by or consistent with the other evidence in the case , and whether ORG had any reason to be untruthful . He also instructed them that , to find the applicant guilty , they had to be sure that ORG had been wrong in thinking that a black man had been responsible . They also had to discount the possibility that ORG was having a secret affair with the applicant . Finally , the trial judge reiterated that the jury had to consider the amount of difficulty involved in challenging the statement in the absence of cross - examination .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant \u2019s previous convictions , the jury were directed as follows :", "\u201c The prosecution argue that those convictions are relevant because it establishes that the defendant has a propensity to burgle people \u2019s houses , as happened to [ ORG ] on TIME that she was also tied up , handcuffed , raped and buggered . If you agree , then the prosecution suggest that it makes it more likely that this defendant committed the offence alleged , namely , burglary . The defendant admits those convictions . You must decide whether it establishes a propensity in him to burgle [ ORG ] \u2019s home , in other words a propensity to commit burglary and therefore help you as to whether he is the burglar . The defence case , as you know , is that it was not this defendant , he was not the burglar and was not at the home of [ ORG ] on the night she was attacked , and in consequence could not and is not therefore guilty of any of these offences . ... So you must ask yourselves , does it establish the propensity that the prosecution contend for then if it does then it is a matter for you to judge how far that assists you in resolving the question of whether it was this defendant who acted as the burglar on this occasion , and whether , whilst burgling the property , it was him who tied up and sexually assaulted [ ORG ] .", "Evidence of previous behaviour is only part of the evidence in the case . Its importance should not be exaggerated and it does not follow that just because the defendant behaved in a certain way in the past that he did so again on this occasion . Bad behaviour in the past can not alone prove guilt ; that is obvious . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The trial judge concluded his summing up by reminding the jury , as he had done at the starting of his summing up , of the respective cases of the defence and prosecution . He first summarised the defence case and then that of the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was convicted by the jury of rape , false imprisonment , buggery and burglary . The total sentence was CARDINAL of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed against his conviction , inter alia on the ground that the trial judge erred in admitting ORG \u2019s statement and the evidence of his previous convictions . He also argued that the trial judge \u2019s summing up had been unfair to him . On DATE the appeal was dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In respect of ORG \u2019s statement , the court concluded :", "\u201c [ W]e in fact agree with the [ trial ] judge that the complainant \u2019s [ ORG \u2019s ] evidence was not the sole or decisive evidence , albeit it is true that the prosecution might not have been pursued without it . The significance of the complainant \u2019s statement was that it established that these offences had taken place . [ Counsel for the applicant ] conceded that had the statement not made any identification of the persons who had committed this offence , and had it merely established that the relevant offences had been committed , then he could not sensibly have opposed it being adduced before the jury . What makes the difference , he submits , is that there was this identification and he was not able to cross - examine in relation to it . It is , we have to say , a somewhat bizarre submission , given that the identification itself is , of course , the most powerful evidence in favour of [ the applicant ] .", "It is true that the ORG was seeking to introduce the complainant \u2019s evidence and then seeking to persuade the jury that they could be sure that she was wrong about part of it , namely the colour of the attacker and that he had an LANGUAGE accent . As the court noted in NORP v. PERSON , PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON ) CARDINAL , there is no rule of law prohibiting the ORG from calling a particular witness in order to rely on a part only of the evidence . [ Counsel ] does not dispute that principle , but say that a different principle applied where the ORG is relying only on hearsay evidence . He referred us specifically to paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment of Lord PERSON in the PERSON case , where Lord PERSON said this , after referring to the provisions of the DATE Act :", "\u201c I believe that those provisions strike the right balance between the imperative that a trial must be fair and the interests of victims in particular and society in general that a criminal should not be immune from conviction where a witness , who has given critical evidence in a statement that can be shown to be reliable , dies or can not be called to give evidence for some other reason . \u201d", "[ Counsel for the applicant ] submits that the key here is that the ORG is not relying on the reliability of the statement . That is not entirely accurate . It is reliable , say the Crown , with respect to the fact that those offences were committed in precisely the way that the complainant alleges . What the ORG say is not reliable is the identification evidence which she provides . But the statement does not have to be reliable in every respect before it can be properly admitted .", "In this case , in our judgment it would have been contrary to the interests of justice to deprive the court of this statement . Indeed , it would have the effect that this defendant would effectively be immune from conviction because a witness has died , which is precisely what the DATE Act was designed to prevent . In this case there was a strong prima facie case against the defendant on various serious charges and it would have been wrong , it seems to us , to have deprived the jury of an opportunity to consider his guilt because of the unfortunate death of the victim .", "Accordingly , we consider that it was entirely in accordance with the principles in PERSON that this statement should be admitted . Insofar as it assisted the [ applicant ] to establish his innocence , it was in his favour . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant \u2019s previous convictions , the court found that they were plainly relevant to a propensity to burgle , CARDINAL of the charges on the indictment . The court did not accept that , because a more serious charge was also on the indictment , it became unfair to admit the evidence .", "CARDINAL . For the trial judge \u2019s summing up , the court accepted that it might have been better if the judge , in his summary of the respective cases , had put the defence case last , but that was of no real moment . Moreover , although he had failed to refer to the fact that ORG had identified her attacker as a black man with an LANGUAGE accent , that was plainly at the forefront of the jury \u2019s mind ; it had been a fundamental pillar of the applicant \u2019s defence . The point had been made earlier in the summing up ; it was an unfortunate oversight on the part of the trial judge that it was not referred to specifically when the summary of the respective cases had been given , but nothing more .", "CARDINAL .
