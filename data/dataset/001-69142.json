The prosecuting authorities further issued a search warrant in respect of the applicant . Having established that the applicant had left the country , the NORP authorities issued in his respect an international search and arrest warrant .", "On DATE ORG , relying on LAW of DATE between GPE and GPE ORG , Family , Labour and Criminal Matters ( Umowa mi\u0119dzy PERSON a ORG o pomocy prawnej i stosunkach prawnych w sprawach cywilnych , rodzinnych , pracowniczych i karnych ) ( \u201c the DATE Agreement \u201d ) , asked ORG Ministry of Justice to extradite the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE under the above - mentioned international search and arrest warrant and , on DATE , brought before ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) . The court , having regard to the provisions of LAW , ordered that the applicant be detained pending extradition until DATE .", "On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( Prokurator Wojew\u00f3dzki ) asked ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) to issue a ruling as to whether the applicant 's extradition to GPE was permissible .", "On DATE the applicant applied for asylum .", "On DATE the applicant 's lawyer requested ORG to adjourn consideration of the extradition request until the termination of the asylum proceedings . Alternatively , the applicant 's lawyer requested that the court rule against the applicant 's extradition . He also requested the applicant 's release .", "On DATE ORG considered the matter . In view of a formal shortcoming in the extradition request , it decided to ask the NORP authorities , through ORG , for rectification of that shortcoming . That request was submitted to ORG . ORG further asked the Minister of ORG for information on whether the applicant had applied for asylum in GPE . It also dismissed the applicant 's request for release , considering that there was a risk that he would leave GPE .", "On DATE ORG requested ORG to provide information on the asylum proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to release him on bail . He argued that the charges against him were unsupported by any evidence and that they in fact constituted a form of punishment for his political activities in a NORP opposition movement . That application was referred to ORG who , at that stage of the procedure , was competent to deal with it . On DATE ORG refused to release the applicant on the grounds that the charges against him had been sufficiently supported by evidence produced by the NORP authorities and that there was a risk that he would go into hiding .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Prokurator Apelacyjny ) on DATE . He argued that he had never gone into hiding , which , he added , was clearly shown by the fact that his stay in GPE was , and had been , legal , that he had had a place of residence and that he had worked in GPE . He also stressed that he had suffered from depression and had received treatment in GPE . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG .", "In the meantime , on DATE , ORG granted ORG application for the applicant 's detention to be prolonged . The ORG ordered that the applicant be held in custody until DATE .", "The applicant appealed on DATE . He submitted , inter alia , that , pursuant to LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , his detention should have been lifted because the requesting ORG had not produced the necessary evidence in support of the extradition request within DATE . He stressed that ORG request for the rectification of formal shortcomings had still not been forwarded to the NORP authorities . It was posted , after DATE , to ORG , which subsequently decided that it had no competence to deal with the matter and referred it to ORG ( Prokurator PERSON ) . ORG decided that he had no competence to handle it either . He referred it back to ORG on DATE . The applicant concluded that his detention was no longer lawful .", "On DATE the contested decision was upheld by ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) . The court stressed that the applicant 's detention was the only preventive measure which could ensure the proper conduct of the extradition proceedings .", "On DATE ORG again requested ORG to enquire with the NORP authorities about rectification of their extradition request .", "On DATE ORG informed ORG that the asylum proceedings were pending .", "On DATE ORG submitted to ORG supplementary information produced by the NORP authorities .", "In the meantime , on DATE , ORG had prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It relied , inter alia , on the risk that the applicant would go into hiding .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) on DATE . He asked to be released on bail and argued that his detention had been unlawful because the NORP authorities had not yet rectified shortcomings in their request for extradition . He alleged , inter alia , a violation of LAW DATE Code and a breach of LAW .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It considered that the lifting of the applicant 's detention was not , as he claimed , mandatory pursuant to LAW because the application of that provision was excluded by a special rule laid down in LAW . In consequence , the applicable provision was LAW , under which the lifting of detention in such circumstances was optional . ORG also observed that the prolongation of detention was necessary in order to ensure the proper conduct of the extradition proceedings in view of the risk that the applicant would go into hiding . Lastly , ORG pointed out that there had been no circumstances in the case which would justify the applicant 's release pursuant to LAW .", "On DATE ORG informed ORG that the applicant 's request for asylum was being examined by ORG .", "On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It considered that the original grounds for keeping him in custody were still valid and that there were no grounds for releasing him , as provided in LAW . It stressed that there were justified fears that the applicant would go into hiding because he had already been wanted under the international search and arrest warrant . The applicant 's appeal against that decision was dismissed by ORG on DATE . ORG considered that the applicant 's continued detention was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the extradition proceedings , taking into account that the asylum proceedings were still pending .", "ORG session scheduled for DATE was cancelled due to an illness of the presiding judge .", "On DATE ORG held a session . It adjourned its examination of the extradition request since the applicant had applied to the Minister of ORG for reconsideration ( wniosek o ponowne rozpatrzenie sprawy ) of the decision refusing to grant him asylum . The court also dismissed the applicant 's request for release .", "On DATE ORG notified ORG that the asylum proceedings should be terminated by DATE .", "On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention pending extradition until DATE .

On DATE the ORG replied that the applicant 's asylum request had been rejected by the final decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "ORG session scheduled for DATE was cancelled .", "On DATE ORG held a session . It adjourned the consideration of the extradition request since the applicant had in the meantime applied for review of the unfavourable asylum decisions by ORG ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention pending extradition until DATE . It stressed that the delay in the extradition proceedings had been caused by circumstances which could not be attributed to the court before which those proceedings were pending .", "On DATE ORG informed ORG that the asylum proceedings were still pending .", "On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE . It considered that the extradition procedure had been prolonged on account of circumstances for which the NORP judicial authorities could not be held responsible . In particular , it emphasised that the need to await the outcome of the asylum proceedings brought by the applicant had made it impossible for them to rule on the extradition request . Were the applicant to be granted asylum , he could not be extradited pursuant to the relevant provisions of LAW . The court went on to find that the relevant material strongly supported a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and concluded that the previous reasons for his detention were still valid .", "On DATE ORG informed ORG that the asylum proceedings were still pending .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be held in detention pending extradition until DATE . It considered , inter alia , that keeping him in detention was necessary pending the asylum proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to order his release . That request was rejected on DATE .", "On DATE ORG made an application to ORG for prolongation of the applicant 's detention pending extradition until DATE . On DATE ORG refused that application .", "On DATE ORG ruled that the applicant 's extradition was permissible . It observed that the applicant had been charged with an ordinary criminal offence of appropriation of property . It also found that the applicant 's allegations of his persecution on account of his activities in the NORP opposition group had not been corroborated by evidence . It also noted in this respect that the applicant 's inconsistent submissions indicated that he had attempted to avoid criminal responsibility for the offence in question . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG on DATE . He alleged , among other things , a breach of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention . He maintained that all available sources , for example reports of international human rights organisations and daily press materials , consistently showed GPE as a country that did not respect fundamental human rights . Reported instances of unlawful arrests and unfair trials , as well as of beating and maltreatment were so wide - spread that they justified the applicant 's fears that if he were extradited , he would be denied a fair trial and would be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in NORP prisons . Lastly , the applicant submitted that he had already informed the NORP authorities that CARDINAL DATE he had been arrested by the NORP police in connection with his participation in an anti - government demonstration . In his opinion , all those circumstances showed that the request for extradition was made for the purpose of punishing him for his political activities .", "ORG upheld the contested decision on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant asked the ORG to apply Rule CARDINAL of its Rules of Procedure and to stop his extradition to GPE . That application was rejected on DATE .", "On DATE ORG gave a decision fixing the final deadline for the applicant 's detention in the extradition proceedings for DATE . That decision was upheld on appeal on DATE .", "The applicant was extradited to GPE on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant , while in detention pending extradition , applied to the Minister of ORG for asylum in GPE . He submitted that for DATE he had been a member of a NORP dissident organisation , i.e. ORG \u201c Restitution \u201d ( ORG \u201c Odrodzenie \u201d ) and that , because of his political activity , he risked revenge from the ORG authorities . He further alleged that the charges against him were based on entrapment by a former officer of the ORG .", "The Minister of ORG , pursuant to section QUANTITY , requested the Minister of ORG to issue an opinion on the applicant 's request . On DATE the Minister of ORG objected to the grant of asylum . This decision was upheld on appeal on DATE . The Minister of ORG , having made relevant inquiries , found no reliable evidence of the applicant 's alleged activities in the opposition movement in GPE . It also observed that the applicant had applied for asylum only after he had been detained with a view to extradition , while he had had sufficient time to do so earlier .", "On DATE the Minister of ORG rejected the applicant 's request for asylum . He upheld his decision on DATE . The Minister found that the actions of the NORP prosecuting authorities against the applicant had not been politically motivated . He observed that there had been many inaccuracies in the applicant 's account given in support of his asylum request . He also considered that the applicant lacked even basic knowledge about the opposition group of which he had allegedly been a member . The Minister further observed that the applicant had applied for asylum only after he had been placed in detention pending extradition despite the fact that during the period of his alleged persecution he had been in GPE on a few occasions . It noted that at the relevant time the applicant had left GPE legally and that he had travelled back to his home country on CARDINAL occasions . Furthermore , he did not apply for asylum immediately after he had entered GPE , but instead took steps to regularise his stay in GPE . Those facts indicated , in the Minister 's view , that the applicant had no reason to fear for his life or limb and that his application for asylum constituted an abuse of the relevant procedures .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against the unfavourable decisions of both Ministers .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It upheld the findings of the Ministers and considered that the applicant could not be granted asylum as he had not demonstrated that he had been persecuted in GPE on account of his alleged political activities in the opposition movement .", "In his application of DATE the applicant stated that during his detention his correspondence had been opened and intercepted by the NORP authorities . He has not submitted any documentary or other evidence in support of his submissions .", "In his application of DATE the applicant submitted that if he were extradited to GPE , he would be exposed to a serious risk of torture and be denied a fair trial . He relied on the fact that he was a member of ORG \u201c Restitution \u201d and that he had received from that organisation a silver medal for his activity . He further produced a copy of the document entitled \u201c Information of ORG on Violation of Human Rights in DATE \u201d . In the opinion of the authors of that document , the NORP authorities were responsible for several physical attacks on persons criticising President PERSON , as well as on independent journalists . Those attacks were carried out by unknown persons . Culprits had not been found . The authorities had also made some attempts to discredit their political opponents by , for instance , bringing criminal proceedings against them . That document also described the very difficult conditions of detention in NORP prisons .", "Until DATE , i.e. the date on which the Law of DATE ( commonly referred to as the \u201c new Code of Criminal Procedure \u201d ) entered into force and repealed the DATE Code , the rules governing detention and extradition proceedings were contained in the latter statute .", "LAW read :", "\u201c If there are no special reasons to the contrary , detention on remand should be lifted , in particular , if :", "( CARDINAL ) it may seriously jeopardise the life or health of the accused ; or", "( CARDINAL ) it would entail excessively serious repercussions for the accused or his family . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL read :", "\u201c Extradition shall be refused if a person to be extradited is a NORP national or has been granted asylum in GPE . \u201d", "LAW specified :", "\u201c If information contained in a request for extradition is insufficient and the court or the prosecutor has asked for it to be supplemented and if , within DATE following the date on which [ the requesting ORG ] has been served with the request for supplementary information , [ that ORG ] has not produced the necessary documents or information , detention shall be lifted . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided :", "\u201c The provisions of this LAW shall not apply if an international agreement , to which GPE is a party , provides otherwise . \u201d", "LAW reads , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
