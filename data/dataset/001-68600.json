The investigating judge seized it .", "In a statement made on oath and dated DATE , Chief Inspector PERSON , commander of the GPE - Rijnmond arresting team , declares that Police Officer CARDINAL joined the FAC - Rijnmond arresting team on DATE .

The location of the injury found on Mr FAC is consistent with the position of someone who has turned to the right and is holding his arm outstretched in the direction of the staircase .

The fact that Mr R.C. de Pool 's and PERSON blood was found on a firearm makes it likely that this weapon was handled by Mr R.C. de Pool . \u201d", "The letter went on to express the opinion that the finding of a trial court would most probably be that Police Officer CARDINAL had acted in self - defence .

This document mentions that the incident was re - enacted ( reconstructie ) CARDINAL times and recorded on video tape , with the active involvement of the applicant , Police Officers CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL ( the suspect ) and CARDINAL and CARDINAL investigators ; it gives a detailed reconstruction by ORG of the probable course of events .", "On DATE the Advocate General to ORG submitted an advisory opinion recommending that the applicant 's complaint be dismissed .", "On DATE the applicant , now represented by different counsel , lodged additional submissions to the effect that it was open to doubt that Mr ORG had in fact pointed a pistol at Police Officer CARDINAL and arguing in addition that Police Officer CARDINAL might have done more to avoid causing casualties .", "A hearing was held in camera on DATE .
