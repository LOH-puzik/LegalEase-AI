He suffers from chronic schizophrenic psychosis , with hallucinations , delusions and aggressive and addictive behaviour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sent to GPE - La Farl\u00e8de prison after causing damage in ORG psychiatric hospital , where he had asked to be admitted . As a result , on DATE he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , of which DATE were suspended . On his arrival at the prison he allegedly set fire to his mattress .

On DATE a fire broke out in the applicant 's cell . Both detainees suffered serious injuries . With burns on PERCENT of his body , the applicant 's cell mate died from his injuries on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the applicant stated that he \u201c could not remember exactly how his mattress caught fire \u201d , and that he \u201c suffered from schizophrenia , heard voices and saw strange things \u201d , but that \u201c everything was better at the moment \u201d ; he added \u201c I feel freer since the fire in my cell ... everything has become clearer in my head . I can say that everything is calm now \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed under judicial investigation for arson resulting in total unfitness for work for DATE , and placed in detention pending trial . He denied the charge , claiming that he had no recollection of the events leading up to the fire because he had been on medication at the time . On DATE the public prosecutor 's office made an application for the additional charge of arson aggravated by constructive manslaughter to be preferred against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in execution of an order of the investigating judge of DATE , PERSON , an expert at the ORG - en - ORG , carried out a psychological examination of the applicant in the psychiatric unit at FAC prison in GPE , where he had been held since DATE . The relevant passages from the report submitted on DATE read as follows :", "\u201c The onset of the disorder at the age of CARDINAL ... heralded in a process of gradual marginalisation for this young adult during which he alternated periods of hospital treatment , voluntary or otherwise , incarceration , training courses and homelessness .", "He has lived in this way for DATE , caught up in his illness , with no place in society ...", "From the legal standpoint , his convictions bear witness to bouts of violence and excessive drinking , which he says had stopped prior to his incarceration ...", "During the examination , PERSON came across as a man with a schizoid personality , an introvert with no interest in the outside world , save for a few recurring scenes in which he sees himself as a victim .", "Be that as it may , and whatever part he may have played in the case , PERSON needs regular , long - term psychiatric support . While he is in prison , therefore , it is preferable that he be held in a medical unit , as he was when we met him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL subsequent psychiatric examinations carried out respectively on DATE by Professor PERSON and on DATE by PERSON confirmed the existence of chronic hebephrenic schizophrenia manifested in behavioural disorders and aggressive and addictive conduct . The first expert concluded that the offences in issue were related to the psychiatric disorders and that the applicant 's judgment had been disturbed at the time , and that \u201c the subject appears difficult to cure or rehabilitate , and requires neuroleptic treatment in strong doses combined with regular supervision or even placement in a ORG \u201d ( a difficult patients ' unit : UMDs are psychiatric hospital wards specialised in the treatment of dangerous mental disorders , including patients committed under LAW of LAW , or \u201c CCrP \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The second expert found that it was not possible to say for sure that the applicant 's behaviour was the result of his mental illness , and that there was no way of telling whether , at the material time , he had been suffering from a psychological or neuropsychological disorder which destroyed , affected , or diminished his discernment or his ability to control his actions within the meaning of LAW , and that he would require specialised care even after his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's lawyer wrote to the investigating judge requesting his client 's release . He argued that the applicant was known to suffer from psychiatric disorders , even prior to his incarceration , and could not be held criminally responsible . He went on to say \u201c it is therefore difficult to see what purpose his incarceration might serve in that regard , especially as the offence with which he is charged occurred in prison . It appears , therefore , that prison is not the right place for my client . His place is clearly in a hospital environment . I believe it is the duty of the prosecuting authorities and possibly the prefecture to assume their responsibilities in this regard in the event of his release ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , the request for the applicant 's release was rejected because according to PERSON report a criminal penalty would not be inappropriate in the applicant 's case , and pre - trial detention was the only means of preventing pressure being put on the witnesses , ensuring that the accused remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities and putting an end to the disturbance to public order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON examined the applicant again , \u201c to determine whether his alleged losses of memory were real or invented and , if they were real , to determine the possible cause or causes ( regard being had to the treatment he was following , for example ) . He submitted his report on DATE . In it he concluded that it was not possible to say for certain whether the alleged memory losses were real or invented , but they were definitely not caused by the mental disorder he had long been suffering from ; they might , on the other hand , be related to ( sedative ) side effects of the psychotropic drugs used to treat him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyer asked for a second opinion , but his request was rejected by an order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an order was issued for the applicant 's indictment and committal for trial before ORG . On DATE he appealed . His lawyer argued that at the time of the events that had led to his incarceration the applicant had been confined to a psychiatric institution ; on arriving there he had tried to commit suicide by fire , and yet the prison authorities had taken no steps to ensure his safety and that of his fellow detainees . He maintained that his client was not criminally responsible and requested his release , whereupon the prosecuting authorities would be able to request his administrative detention . On DATE the principal public prosecutor at the Aix - en - Provence Court of Appeal requested confirmation of the applicant 's indictment and committal for trial before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was placed in the regional psychiatric unit ( RPU ) at FAC prison from CARDINAL April to CARDINAL DATE , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE , and from CARDINAL DATE to DATE . From CARDINAL au CARDINAL DATE , when going through a period of anxiety scarcely compatible with detention in the ORG , the applicant was once again placed by the authorities in a specialised hospital under LAW of the CCrP.", "CARDINAL . In the interim , on CARDINAL DATE an expert report by PERSON found that the applicant had indeed been suffering from psychological or neuropsychological disorders at the material time , although it was not certain whether this had \u201c destroyed , affected , or diminished his discernment or his ability to control his actions within the meaning of LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the Aix - en - ORG of Appeal gave a prison warder a DATE suspended prison sentence for having inflicted violence on the applicant that resulted in DATE total unfitness for work .

After the sentence was pronounced the applicant was taken back to the RPU at FAC prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prefect ordered the applicant 's compulsory hospitalisation in ORG . On CARDINAL DATE his detention there was extended for DATE , until DATE , for the raisons stated in a medical certificate of CARDINAL DATE mentioning that the applicant \u201c has displayed increased anxiety in DATE , and his old delusions ( of grandeur and of being a father ) have resurfaced \u201d . It appears from the file that the applicant was again placed in the prison psychiatric unit from CARDINAL to DATE and from CARDINAL April to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while in the prison hospital , the applicant applied to be released , relying on LAW . He argued that his constant moves back and forth between prison and hospital amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment . He explained that when his condition deteriorated to the point where it was no longer compatible with detention , he was placed in hospital , and when he recovered his \u201c stability \u201d he was sent back to prison until his condition deteriorated again . He considered that his return to prison constituted a form of torture . Lastly , he argued that the decision to put him back in normal detention at FAC was absurd considering his extreme vulnerability vis - \u00e0 - vis the other detainees and the danger to his safety . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the investigation chamber of the Aix - en - ORG of Appeal rejected his request :", "\u201c There is no medical evidence that PERSON 's state of health is currently incompatible with detention , considering that his compulsory hospitalisation in an approved establishment on several occasions since he was placed in detention , followed by his return to prison , were strictly based on his health needs , in conformity with the provisions of LAW of LAW , and did therefore not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment , and certainly not to torture as alleged ;", "It should also be noted that the charges against PERSON concern criminal acts that caused an exceptional , persistent disturbance to public order that his release would be likely to rekindle , namely the destruction by fire of a prison cell resulting in the death of a fellow prisoner ;", "Regard being had to the length of the sentence incurred , the guarantees that the accused will appear in court are uncertain in so far as he has no fixed abode and no job and is a repeat offender , having already been convicted of arson ;", "In addition , his release would probably disrupt the normal course of the proceedings and the establishment of the truth , bearing in mind the oral nature of the proceedings , and the execution of the sentence in the event of a conviction ;", "Detention is therefore necessary before the hearing as a precaution , the obligations under judicial supervision , however strict they may be , being insufficient with regard to the aims pursued . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In its Opinion no . CARDINAL on \u201c ORG in Prison \u201d ( DATE ) ORG on ORG stated :", "\u201c ... Prisons are increasingly faced with mental illnesses .", "Prisons are increasingly being used to confine psychiatric patients : the percentage of psychiatric pathologies is CARDINAL times higher in prison than in the general population . In DATE an epidemiological survey commissioned by ORG and ORG revealed that PERCENT of detainees ( over CARDINAL ) suffered from psychosis and CARDINAL of those ( CARDINAL ) suffered from schizophrenia .", "The tendency is away from psychiatric hospitals towards prisons . The incarceration of people suffering from serious mental disorders can only lead to a loss of bearings and of meaning : the loss of the very meaning of punishment and imprisonment , and in particular of the notion of criminal responsibility ; the loss of the very meaning of treatment and the role of the carer ; and the same loss of the meaning of the role of the prison warder .", "A source of suffering for the sick person ( \u201c prison in itself has an aggravating effect on mental disorders \u201d , according to a report of the IGAS and the ORG in DATE ) , mental illnesses are also a source of suffering and confusion for the other prisoners , faced on a DATE basis with insufferable , contagious madness . ...", "The incarceration of people suffering from serious mental disorders : \u201c madness \u201d in prison . This situation , mentioned above , is one of the major ethical problems concerning , on the one hand , the increasing confusion between the respective meanings of punishment and treatment , and on the other , the right to the protection of health and access to treatment . These serious ethical problems of health protection and access to treatment concern both the right of the mentally ill to the best possible medical and psychiatric treatment of their disorders in conditions respectful of their dignity , and the right of their fellow prisoners to the protection of their mental health in the face of permanent exposure to \u201c madness \u201d . ...", "Recommendations", "Look for solutions outside prisons so that the very elderly , people with severe disabilities and those suffering from serious psychiatric disorders are taken out of the prison system for ever . \u201d", "...", "CARDINAL . In a report of CARDINAL DATE on \u201c handling offenders suffering from mental disorders \u201d the NORP ORG stressed the shortcomings of medical treatment at the RPUs and reiterated the warning of ORG concerning health and medicine in prison ( cited in paragraph CARDINAL above ) that incarceration can aggravate the mental condition of certain detainees . The relevant parts of the report read as follows :", "\u201c ( a ) Shortcomings in medical treatment", "While there has been considerable progress in medical treatment in the RPUs , there are certain limits that are difficult to overcome :", "- there are still not enough medical staff in spite of the significant progress made in DATE ...", "- treatment at the RPUs is mainly day care , generally because of the lack of medical staff and the fact that detainees can not be admitted without their consent . Furthermore , as the above - mentioned study shows , \u201c conditions in the RPUs are not really comparable to conditions in hospitals ; the rooms are no different from the cells at CARDINAL RPUs . This is often a problem in terms of the treatment available , particularly the existence of first - level intensive - care facilities , the risks linked to metal beds when patients suffer attacks , or the presence of alarm systems .", "The most objectionable aspect of the treatment of detainees with mental disorders , however , is no doubt the way they are treated in psychiatric hospitals when they need hospital treatment . They are generally admitted without their consent , and often \u2013 for security reasons \u2013 placed in solitary confinement cells , where they may sometimes be restrained , without any real medical justification . The duration of the treatment in these conditions is particularly brief , often CARDINAL or three days , which is scarcely enough to secure the patient 's stabilisation . ...", "b ) The deterioration of certain pathologies and the risk of suicide . As stated in DATE in the opinion of ORG concerning health and medicine in prison , incarceration can aggravate the mental condition of certain detainees as a result of the combined effects of the aforementioned shortcomings in the treatment dispensed and the living conditions in prisons ( overcrowding , difficulty sleeping ... ) . This state of affairs puts the people concerned in danger , as they may harm themselves ( self - mutilation , suicide ) or the prison staff or other detainees ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its report on the organisation of psychiatric treatment ( \u201c the effects of the DATE psychiatry and mental health plan \u201d ) published in DATE , in a chapter entitled \u201c The health - justice programme : unfinished progress \u201d , ORG , stated that the premises of some RPUs were still antiquated , and mentioned the disgraceful state of the RPU at FAC prison :", "...", "CARDINAL . The report by the ORG ( ORG ) on \u201c Conditions of detention in GPE \u201d ( PERSON . ORG , DATE ) stated in a chapter on \u201c Psychiatry \u201d that PERCENT of detainees suffered from some form of psychosis , and PERCENT of detainees suffered from schizophrenia . It stressed the confusion between punishment and treatment , which is all the more problematic if one considers , \u201c like a ORG information report in DATE , that prison is no place for treatment \u201d . As the Inspector General of prisons observed , \u201c that we actually contemplate treating mental illnesses in prison is in itself disturbing \u201d ... Hence the finding \u2013 difficult for the authorities to accept DATE of the ORG 's rapporteur on the draft Prisons Act in DATE that \u201c for many people suffering from mental disorders prison makes no sense \u2013 they waste away in the prison environment , complicating the lives of the other prisoners and the prison staff without receiving proper care \u201d . The report shows the limits of treatment in prison ( lack of staff , conditions in the RPUs ) . Concerning the RPU in GPE , it notes that \u201c the general state of the RPU premises is run - down , dilapidated , deplorable ( mouldy ) \u201d . It quotes a psychiatrist as explaining that \u201c RPUs are not strictly speaking places where people should be hospitalised for treatment ; they are places where people are taken care of , generally on a part - time basis , in a prison , subject to the imperatives of prison life ... They are not equipped for intensive care ... They are insanitary places where it is difficult to imagine that certain cells are supposed to offer appeasement , protection and hope \u201d when in fact they are \u201c quite frightening in terms of their appearance and the conditions of hygiene and comfort they offer . \u201d The report also addresses the question of compulsory hospitalisation : \u201c In fact , the time prisoners spend in compulsory treatment does not always allow the requisite treatment to be dispensed . Often reduced to a matter of DATE , at best it only serves to treat a phase of acute decompensation , but never properly to treat the pathology \u201d . Lastly , the creation of specially equipped hospital units ( Unit\u00e9s hospitali\u00e8res sp\u00e9cialement am\u00e9nag\u00e9es \u2013 UHSAs ) is mentioned .
