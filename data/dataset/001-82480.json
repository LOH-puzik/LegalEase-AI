GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Snejana Botoucharova", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in ORG in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON of the lawfirm Rumpenhorst \u2013 Gockel \u2013 Rettig , practising in GPE .", "The applicant is the father of a son ( M ) , born on DATE . The applicant and the child \u2019s mother divorced in DATE , but lived together at the time of M \u2019s birth and held joint parental authority over the child . In DATE , M lived with his mother .", "On DATE the G\u00fctersloh municipal authority informed the G\u00fctersloh ORG ( ORG ) about tensions and physical violence between the parents . Following CARDINAL court hearings the parents agreed that the mother should be granted the right to decide about the child \u2019s place of residence and that the father should be granted supervised access rights within the LOC of the child protection agency ( PERSON ) . The mother declared that she would accept social - pedagogical family support .", "On DATE the municipal authority informed ORG that the parents had refused to accept further support by the child protection agency and that the mother had refused to accept family support , which she did not deem necessary .", "On DATE the G\u00fctersloh ORG , following expert recommendation , withdrew by interim order the mother \u2019s rights to decide about the child \u2019s place of residence and to care for the child and transferred these rights to the municipal authority . The municipal authority placed the child temporarily in a children \u2019s home . On DATE M was placed in a foster family .", "On DATE , following an oral hearing , the G\u00fctersloh ORG confirmed its interim order . All parties to the proceedings waived their right to appeal .", "On DATE the applicant and the child \u2019s mother lodged separate requests to be restored parental authority , alternatively to be granted access rights .", "On DATE the psychological expert O. , having examined the child , both parents and the foster parents , submitted her expert opinion . She considered that , while the mother was not able adequately to take care of the child , the father was in principle able to take care of him . Furthermore , PERSON enjoyed a positive relationship with his father . The expert observed , however , that during the period of one year and DATE he had spent in the foster family , M had developed bonds to the foster family . Taking into account the fact that the child had spent CARDINAL of his life with the foster family and that DATE until the child \u2019s reaching DATE were decisive for the formation of such bonds , which stayed unchanged for the remainder of childhood , the expert considered that it would jeopardise the child \u2019s welfare to remove him from the foster family .", "On DATE ORG restored parental authority to the parents and ordered that M should remain with the foster family ( PERSON ) . All parties to the proceedings waived their right to appeal .", "The applicant is currently living with his new wife , their daughter and a stepdaughter .", "The proceedings relating to the GPE access rights were severed from the proceedings on parental authority .", "On DATE the parties agreed , on a preliminary basis , that the applicant should have the right to visit M once DATE for TIME within the premises of a social organisation . The mother was granted access rights for TIME DATE . The visits took place as envisaged .", "On DATE the G\u00fctersloh ORG , following an oral hearing , temporarily suspended access rights . On DATE the ORG judge visited M in the foster GPE home .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant should have the right and the duty to visit M DATE for TIME in the presence of an appropriate third person within the LOC of the social organisation . The mother was granted access rights for TIME DATE .", "Taking into account the reports submitted by the social organisation on the visiting contacts , the results of the oral hearing , the personal impression the judge had gained of the child and the submissions by the child \u2019s court - appointed curator ad litem , ORG considered that this regulation on access rights best served the child \u2019s interests .", "ORG considered , at the outset , that M could not be returned to his parents within DATE . This had been the outcome of the proceedings on custody rights , as manifested in the decision that M should remain with the foster family . ORG judge had hoped that further access rights would be beneficial for the child if the parents ceased to argue about M \u2019s place of residence . However , as became clear during the oral hearing held on DATE , this had not been the case . Neither the mother nor the father had been able to discuss access rights separately from the question of residence . It had been impossible to talk reasonably with the applicant . The fact that the applicant \u2019s counsel requested the order that M should remain with the foster family be lifted further demonstrated that the parties did not agree on the child \u2019s place of residence .", "Referring to the report submitted by the child \u2019s curator ad litem , ORG further noted that the visiting contacts which took place DATE and DATE had not been beneficial for the child . M had been very strained before and after the contacts . The conflicts about his place of residence unsettled the child .", "Following this assessment , ORG considered that M was burdened by the unresolved question of his place of residence . It had not been possible to keep the child out of these conflicts , as the parents were unable to accept that the child remained with the foster family . It was , however , essential for M to have the security to remain with the foster family .", "ORG further observed that the foster parents had fully cooperated and had made no effort to avoid or restrict access rights . The applicant , on the other hand , had never expressed his concern for the child \u2019s well - being , but merely stressed that the child was \u201c his flesh and blood \u201d .", "The ORG further considered that M suffered from a serious eating disorder and that his condition , which had improved before the oral hearing held on DATE , had aggravated .", "By way of conclusion , ORG considered that M had the right to know his parents and to have access to them . Having regard to the feeling of uncertainty which had been caused by the recent contacts , it appeared to be in the child \u2019s best interest to limit contacts to once in a DATE period . On the one hand , there was the reasonable hope that M could settle down , on the other hand , there was sufficient contact to the biological parents .", "Both parents lodged appeals , the applicant with the aim to be granted access DATE from DATE TIME to Sunday TIME", "On DATE the ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) ordered the preparation of an expert opinion as to which regulation of access rights best served the child \u2019s interests .", "On DATE the expert B submitted her expert opinion . She considered that M had shown massive behavioural disorders in connection with the former regulation on access rights . These had mainly been caused by the child \u2019s insecurity and conflicts of loyalty and the fear of losing the foster family , which had been intensified by the visiting contacts . Since the installation of the new regulations on access rights , the behavioural disorders had diminished . The visits had contributed to maintaining the relationship to his family of origin .", "With the aim of preserving the positive aspects of the visiting contacts while limiting the negative effects , the expert considered that the meetings should take place within a predictable and stable framework . As the biological parents did not accept that M remained with the foster family , the only possibility to limit the negative effects was to put a limitation on access rights . The expert considered that the present regulations had proved to be successful .", "The expert further considered that it would be positive if the applicant could be granted more generous access rights in the mid - term future . She recommended offering the applicant special counselling which would allow him to come to terms with the child \u2019s stay in the foster family and enable him better to understand the child \u2019s feelings and needs .", "On DATE the ORG , having heard all parties to the proceedings , rejected the GPE complaints against ORG decision of DATE . ORG noted that the expert , when personally heard , considered that the child enjoyed good contacts with the applicant and that the parents had to assure M that he could stay with the foster family .", "The foster parents submitted that M had cried for TIME before the court hearing . He was always very agitated when fearing changes of his situation and soiled himself , but had calmed down recently .", "Having regard to the parties\u2019 submissions and personal statements and to the expert opinion , the court considered that it would jeopardise the child \u2019s welfare to grant more extensive visiting rights . According to ORG , it was understandable that the biological parents had the wish that the child be returned to them . However , this attitude imposed a serious strain on M , who felt torn between his biological parents and the foster parents . As had been confirmed by the personal statements given by the relevant parties , M had the wish presently to remain with the foster parents , whom he regarded as his relevant attachment figures . During the visiting contacts the conflict of interests became apparent and unsettled the child considerably . The child was in need of the firm knowledge that he was not taken from the foster family against his own wishes .", "It would be preferable if the biological parents could convey him this confidence . As this was presently not the case , it was necessary to limit access rights . The court further considered it necessary to order supervision in order to avoid conflicts .", "By way of conclusion , ORG conceded that the time - frame of visiting contacts was restrictive . However , having regard to the previous development of visiting contacts , that court considered that the visits were sufficient to maintain the appropriate contacts between M and his parents . It was thus assured that the bonds to his parents and the emotional relationship remained intact .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "According to section DATE of LAW , a child is entitled to have access to his or her parents ; each parent is obliged to have contact with , and entitled to have access to , the child . The family courts can , however , restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare .", "A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if otherwise the child \u2019s well - being would be jeopardised ( section DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
