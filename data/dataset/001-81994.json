All the applicants , but the fifth , were members of a motor cycle club named \u201c Screwdrivers \u201d , which was based in PERSON and was , at the time of the events giving rise to the proceedings described below , the \u201c Hang - Around Club \u201d of ORG . On DATE it became a ORG of the latter and , as from DATE , a \u201c LAW . The fifth applicant was a member of ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , along with CARDINAL other defendants , PERSON and PERSON , were indicted ( count I ) under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( second alternative ) of LAW for having instigated fire or explosion capable of causing loss of human life and extensive material damage and resulting in death , or for aiding and abetting in this . On DATE , DATE at TIME in GPE , they had , after having planned the operation , blown up parts of the club house in CARDINAL , FAC , of another motor cycle club , named GPE . A ORG had been placed in the latter 's courtyard , loaded with explosives that were detonated . The force of the explosion had been such that metal and rubber parts of the vehicle had hit and killed the driver of a passing car . The building in question had in part subsided and a massive fire had broken out , putting at risk the lives of CARDINAL persons inside the building . The building had burned down to the ground and a neighbouring property had been severely damaged , several vehicles had been totally or largely destroyed . The total damage had amounted to at least NOK CARDINAL . Moreover , the applicants were indicted ( count II ) under Article CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) for the acquisition , confection or storage of explosives , or for aiding or abetting thereto , with the knowledge that the explosives had been intended to be used for the commission of the offence described under count I above , during the period before DATE . Furthermore , the applicants were indicted ( count III ) under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL for aggravated offences of serious material damage in respect of CARDINAL , GPE and a number of properties adjacent to or in the vicinity thereof , amounting to ORG ( approximately LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( tingrett ) acquitted the first , second and third applicants of counts I and II but convicted them of count III and sentenced each of them to DATE imprisonment . The fourth applicant was acquitted of count II but convicted of counts I and III and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . For each of them the time spent in pre - trial detention was to be deducted . The fifth applicant was acquitted of all the charges .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL co - defendants , PERSON and PERSON , were convicted of all the charges and were sentenced respectively to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , sitting with CARDINAL judges , including Judge PERSON , rejected an appeal by the fourth applicant against a decision of DATE by ORG to prolong his provisional detention . The decision included the following reasons :", "\u201c ORG has ordered detention of [ the fourth applicant ] on the ground of danger of evasion , see LAW CARDINAL of LAW , and the defence counsel 's first supporting letter concerned imprisonment on this ground . ORG found it correct to assess whether there were grounds for imprisonment on the basis of law enforcement considerations pursuant to LAW , and notified the defence counsel and prosecutor of this by telephone . The defence counsel 's second supporting letter concerns this issue .", "According to ORG convicting judgment , the basic condition for remanding the prisoner in custody pursuant to LAW ... ] on ground of reasonable suspicion has been fulfilled . ORG does not find it necessary to consider whether the danger of evasion ought to lead to imprisonment , but points out that if [ the fourth applicant ] does not attend court for the hearing of the appeal , his conviction will remain in force . This , and his personal circumstances as described by the defence counsel , are factors which indicate that the danger of evasion is not sufficiently great .", "The defence counsel has stated that the basic condition for imprisonment pursuant to Article CARDINAL [ ... ] , namely the existence of factors which particularly strengthen the suspicion , has not been met and has alleged that the conviction is based on the statement of a co - defendant which is contradicted by other statements and evidence . The High Court bases its judgment , as in ORG ruling of DATE in the ORG case ( appeal case DATE ) on the fact that when there is a convicting judgment , the qualified requirement of suspicion stated in Article CARDINAL has usually been fulfilled . It is true that in that case this was not contested by the defence counsel , nor during the subsequent hearing by ORG ( see PERSON ( \u201c FAC ) DATE , page CARDINAL ) , but this is a matter the courts must consider of their own motion . In ORG opinion , there are no grounds for taking a different view in this case either . The basic condition stated in Article CARDINAL is regarded as having been met .", "As regards the discretionary decision regarding whether imprisonment under Article CARDINAL should take place , the High Court refers to the extensive discussions in the case mentioned above . The present case was widely covered by the media just after the explosion , regularly during the subsequent period , and later in connection with the arrest and the ORG proceedings . It appears from the judgment that this was a planned crime , within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , organised by several persons where a passer - by lost her life . The explosion took place in a town and could easily have led to the loss of more lives . Damage amounting to great sums was caused . ORG based its ruling on the fact that the matter arose out of rivalry between CARDINAL Motor Cyclist milieus . ORG adds , as a factor when assessing the case pursuant to LAW , that this rivalry in NORP countries has led to a number of violent confrontations , including several deaths . This case is undoubtedly likely to cause such a reaction among the general public as Article CARDINAL is intended to counteract and must be said to lie in the core area for the application of this provision . On the basis of an overall assessment , ORG has found that the law enforcement considerations which form the basis of Article CARDINAL are so prominent here that the accused should remain in prison also after judgment . The accused 's personal and family circumstances pointed out by the defence counsel can not be given sufficient weight in the opposite direction , and continued imprisonment can not be said to be a disproportionate measure under Article CARDINAL", "The decisions by ORG to which the defence counsel has referred \u2013 reported in GPE DATE , page CARDINAL , ORG , page CARDINAL , ORG , page DATE , and Rt CARDINAL , page CARDINAL - can not lead to any different result . ORG has also considered decisions included in DATE , page CARDINAL , page DATE and page DATE .", "Unless it is of importance for the decision regarding whether or not the accused is to be released , especially in relation to the consideration of proportionality , where the accused is placed during the remand period is outside ORG control . The regime he is now subject to is found to be of no importance to ORG assessment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first , second and third applicants appealed to ORG against ORG assessment of facts concerning the question of guilt and the application of the law with respect to count III . The fourth applicant appealed against the assessment of facts concerning the question of guilt , the application of the law and sentencing with regard to counts I and III . The prosecution appealed against the acquittals of the first , second and third applicants on count II and that of the fifth applicant 's acquittal on counts I and III .", "M did not appeal whereas B only pursued an appeal against the sentence which ORG dismissed by a separate decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . As for the appeal brought by the applicants , ORG held an oral hearing DATE and DATE . ORG was sitting with a jury of CARDINAL members ( reduced to CARDINAL on DATE as one of the jury members was disqualified , see below ) and with CARDINAL professional judges , CARDINAL of whom was Judge PERSON In the questions put to the jury the offences were described in the way set out in the indictment . The jury answered all the questions in the affirmative , except for CARDINAL regarding count II with respect to the fourth applicant . The professional judges decided to pass judgment on the basis of the jury 's verdict ( Article CARDINAL , first section , of the Code or Criminal Procedure ) and , by a judgment of DATE , convicted all CARDINAL applicants on counts I and III .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , ORG , composed of the CARDINAL professional judges , the jury chairperson and CARDINAL other jurors drawn by lots among the jury ( LAW ) , unanimously sentenced the first , second and third applicants to DATE imprisonment and the fourth and fifth applicants to CARDINAL and DATE , respectively . For each applicant , DATE spent in provisional detention was to be deducted from the sentence .", "Finally , the CARDINAL professional judges awarded ORG CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage to the husband of the woman killed by the explosion .", "The issue of compensation for pecuniary damage was postponed .", "CARDINAL . The applicants all appealed to ORG against the High Court procedure and the sentences . As regards the former appeal ground they all argued that they had not been afforded an impartial hearing before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , they argued that Judge PERSON had taken part in the ORG decision of DATE rejecting an appeal against a prolongation by ORG of the fourth applicant 's provisional detention . Unlike ORG , which had applied the ordinary grounds for such detention in LAW , ORG had applied a special ground contained in Article CARDINAL , which authorised such detention , even if the ordinary grounds under Article CARDINAL were not fulfilled , namely where it concerned an offence punishable by imprisonment for DATE or more and provided that there was a confession or ( as found here ) other circumstances which strengthen particularly the suspicion ( som i s\u00e6rlig grad styrker mistanken ) against the defendant . The decision of DATE , it was argued , had also had implications for the other defendants .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , they submitted that on DATE of the trial hearing , after having taken part for DATE , a member of the jury had stated that on DATE she had made a witness statement to the police that related to the case . Her name had not been included on the list of witnesses . ORG had then discharged the jury member in question and had continued the trial , despite a request by the defence to postpone it and to have the case tried by a differently composed court .", "CARDINAL . However , on DATE ORG unanimously rejected both appeal grounds , on procedure and sentencing , subject to certain adjustments to DATE to be deducted on account of provisional detention . The first voting judge , Mr Justice PERSON , gave inter alia the following reasons :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) I will first deal with the allegation that ORG judge , Judge PERSON , was disqualified . ...", "( CARDINAL ) From the outset , I find reason to point out that our rules of procedure for criminal cases in a High Court that sits with a jury are based on a distribution of functions . The decision regarding the question of guilt is the jury 's alone , while the court proceedings are determined by ORG CARDINAL professional judges . These decide on the issue of sentencing together with the jury 's foreman and CARDINAL members of the jury . In cases that are heard and ruled on in the first and second instance by a court sitting with professional judges and lay judges , the lay judges and professional judges have the same authority regarding all issues , which are decided on jointly .", "( CARDINAL ) Following the landmark judgment by ORG DATE in the case GPE v. GPE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) regarding disqualification by reason of prejudice due to participation in decisions regarding remand in custody , there is extensive ORG case law on this . In criminal cases which at first and second instance are heard and decided on by a court sitting with professional and lay judges , a professional judge who has previously taken part in a remand case in which imprisonment has been ordered under LAW is regarded as being disqualified and shall therefore not take part in any subsequent main hearing to determine , inter alia , the question of the guilt of the same accused in the same body of cases . In RtCARDINAL , ORG has stated that the same applies to the presiding judge in a ORG case involving a jury . The first voting judge stated , on page CARDINAL , the following regarding the relationship to section CARDINAL of ORG :", "' As regards the relationship with section CARDINAL of ORG , I would point out : Article CARDINAL of LAW stipulates that there must be a very strong probability that the accused is guilty , see the wording of the section according to which , in the serious crimes covered , there must be ' a confession or other circumstances that strengthen the suspicion to a particularly high degree ' . This is clearly a stronger suspicion than the one which is sufficient pursuant to LAW , which stipulates ' reasonable grounds ' for suspicion . '", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) In the above - mentioned judgment , the question of imprisonment was decided during the investigation and without a conviction by any court . In CARDINAL , the presiding judge of ORG was , with dissenting votes , also regarded as being disqualified in a situation where the order to remand the accused in custody pursuant to LAW had been made after there was a conviction by a first instance court .", "( CARDINAL ) In our case too , the relevant remand order had been made after a conviction by the court of first instance . But here the objection on the grounds of disqualification is not aimed at the presiding judge of ORG , but at CARDINAL of the other CARDINAL professional judges who took part . It appears from what I have previously quoted from the first voting judge 's vote in GPE - CARDINAL , that the emphasis was placed on the fact that the presiding judge in a jury case had a key function , with particular emphasis on his / her instructions to the jury , in which the evidence in the case was regularly reviewed . The question now is whether the other professional judges in a High Court that is convened with a jury are to be regarded as disqualified under section CARDINAL of ORG due to the fact that they have previously been involved in applying Article CARDINAL of LAW as a basis for imprisoning CARDINAL or more of the accused in the same criminal case .", "( CARDINAL ) I find that there are insufficient grounds for regarding the other professional judges as being disqualified in such a situation , and refer to what I have already stated about the distribution of functions in criminal cases that are heard by a jury . It is for the presiding judge to give instructions to the jury , see LAW , and this is his responsibility alone . It is true that all the professional judges take part in the subsequent assessment of whether the jury 's decision is to form the basis of the judgment , or in exceptional cases be set aside , see ORG , PERSON and CARDINALC of LAW . However , such a setting aside of decisions does not determine the question of guilt and is also so exceptional that , in my opinion , it can not be given any significance worth mentioning in this context .", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) My conclusion is thus that Judge PERSON of ORG was not disqualified .", "( CARDINAL ) I will now deal with the allegation that the jury members were disqualified . The factual basis for this allegation is as follows :", "( CARDINAL ) PERSON went to the police at an early stage of the investigations , due to a newspaper article on DATE which described , inter alia , the car that was used in the explosion . She believed she had seen such a car on CARDINAL occasions at the ORG petrol station on the LAW near PERSON toll station , on DATE May and on DATE , when the explosion took place . She gave a statement regarding this to CARDINAL of the detectives on DATE . When questioned by the police , she described CARDINAL people she had seen both near the car and inside the shop , and stated she believed she had seen that CARDINAL of them was carrying a black petrol can . She also stated what she believed she remembered of the car 's licence number .", "( CARDINAL ) When ORG presiding judge discussed the impartiality rules with the jury members on DATE in court , on DATE , PERSON did not give any account of her previous statement to the police . She had not heard any more from the police and was not on the list of witnesses . The jury was constituted with CARDINAL members , according to LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) After the hearing had been adjourned on DATE , juror PERSON contacted a policeman she knew and asked if she could sit on the jury even though she had been questioned by the police on CARDINAL occasion . This question was then put to the public prosecutor , and the matter was made known to ORG when it convened on DATE . Her statement to the police , which was given on DATE , was read out and the parties were given the opportunity to make a statement . ORG thereafter ordered that PERSON was to withdraw from the jury , and stated :", "' It has become known that jury member PERSON gave a statement to the police on DATE [ presumably DATE . She has not been called as a witness in the case , and her impartiality must be assessed under LAW . According to this provision , no one can be a jury member if there are special circumstances that may weaken confidence in the impartiality of the person concerned . All the defence counsel have petitioned for her to withdraw and have also stated that the entire jury is disqualified .", "The High Court finds that such special circumstances exist in this case . It bases its decision on the fact that the jury member reported to the police as a witness and told the police about her observations in close connection to DATE of the explosion . Her observations are of such a nature that it can be questioned whether she is impartial in this case .", "However , ORG does not find that the jury member may , by having possibly stated her observations to the other members of the jury , have influenced the other jury members so that they are disqualified . It must be assumed that the jury members will be able to disregard any information she may have told the jury , as they are assumed to be able to disregard other information on the case that has arisen outside the court room , for example in the media . '", "( CARDINAL ) After this , PERSON withdrew from the jury and the hearing continued with CARDINAL jury members .", "( CARDINAL ) I agree with ORG that PERSON was prejudiced . The question is then whether the other CARDINAL members of the jury became prejudiced as a result of PERSON serving on the jury for DATE of the hearing .", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) What is decisive for our case is therefore whether the aforementioned matter can be regarded as a procedural error that may be considered pursuant to the provision stated in LAW . The question here is whether PERSON 's presence as a member of the jury during DATE of the hearing may have influenced the jury 's verdict .", "( CARDINAL ) The defence counsel have alleged to ORG that ORG has , in its reasons for regarding the other jury members as being impartial , incorrectly treated any information from PERSON on the same footing as information on the case that arose outside the court room , for example in the media . I agree that , when considering the impartiality issue , one can not always treat these matters as being equal . The jury members will regularly be told by the presiding judge that , when deciding on the question of guilt , they must only place emphasis on what is stated as evidence in court , and that they must not discuss the case with third parties . There is no corresponding barrier to the jury members discussing the case among themselves \u2013 even continuously during the court hearing DATE and it is realistic to expect that this actually happens to a certain extent .", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) When I nonetheless have decided that the jury members can not be regarded as having been disqualified to serve as a result of jury member PERSON 's disqualification , I have placed decisive emphasis on the following : the statements that the foreperson of the jury and PERSON have given to the police for use in ORG do not provide any basis for assuming that she had given the other members of the jury factual information regarding her private knowledge of the case or in any other way influenced the others before she withdrew on DATE . I refer to the fact that PERSON was at no time called as a witness in the case , by either the prosecuting authority or the defendants . The prosecutor has stated to ORG that the observations she had told to the police on DATE including about parts of the vehicle in question 's licence number \u2013 were clarified early on as being of no importance to the further investigation .", "( CARDINAL ) The jury foreperson has explained that the situation that arose after PERSON had withdrawn was discussed by the jury members and that they agreed that her participation during DATE had not had any effect on the jury 's verdict .", "( DATE ) Accordingly , I can not see that PERSON 's presence as a member of the jury during the introductory presentation of evidence in DATE of the hearing can be regarded as a procedural error to which LAW applies . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
