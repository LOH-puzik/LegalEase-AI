The trial bench dismissed the application by the defence on the grounds that the recordings which were to be examined at the trial as evidence had been duly transcribed by an expert and that the relevant transcripts had been served on the defence .

The trial bench dismissed the request by the defence on the grounds that the case file concerning the secret surveillance order had been incorporated into the case file concerning the criminal proceedings at issue and could therefore have been consulted by the defence . The trial bench also reiterated its previous arguments concerning the reason for the dismissal of the application by the defence to obtain the copies of the CD and DVD material .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence counsel sent a letter to ORG asking for access to and the possibility to examine the secret surveillance recordings . They stressed that the CD and DVD material had never been made available to the defence and that there were no technical means available in the court - house which would allow for the examination of the recordings by the defence . They also pointed out that because of the technical impossibility of examining the recordings in the court - house , the practice of ORG in several other cases had been to make copies of the CD and DVD recordings and to send them to the defence . In these circumstances , the defence argued that the Convention rights of the accused to effectively prepare their defence had been breached .", "CARDINAL .

The trial bench dismissed the applicant \u2019s arguments on the grounds that nothing suggested that he had been entrapped .", "CARDINAL .

The court sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . At the same time , it acquitted the applicant on charges of bribe - taking related to the privatisation of the company ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG explained that all the relevant facts concerning the circumstances of the case had been duly established and that therefore there was no reason for the examination of further evidence requested by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . As regards the application by the defence to obtain the secret surveillance recordings and a complaint of non - disclosure of certain recordings , ORG noted :", "\u201c With regard to the recordings which [ the State Attorney \u2019s Office ] asked to be examined at the trial , an expert report was commissioned , that is to say , transcripts were prepared which were served on all the parties , the accused and their lawyers , who were thereby fully informed of the substance of the recordings submitted into evidence . In addition , this panel finds , that , with regard to the recordings which were to be examined at the trial , there was no obstacle to the defence lawyers examining [ those recordings ] in the court - house before the commencement of the trial .", "With regard to the other conversations of the accused , these [ recordings ] were not submitted into evidence but the defence could have examined their substance by the examination of the written reports filed in the [ special investigation case file ] after the submission of the indictment .", "This panel also considers that the recordings at issue were made solely for their examination at the trial and had they been provided to the parties , the court would not have had any legal basis at its disposal to prevent and prohibit the parties from reproducing [ them ] outside of the PERSON ] before their examination at trial , and [ the court would not have had any legal means ] to prevent possible misuse of the recorded material .", "This in particular concerns the recordings which were not submitted into evidence ; that is to say [ the recordings ] which concern other individuals and not the accused . Since these recordings were not submitted into evidence , the application by the defence to obtain them is completely unfounded .", "Furthermore , this panel has found that ... CARDINAL CD and CARDINAL DVD recordings were given [ to the court ] whereas the remaining CARDINAL CD recordings concern individuals who had been under secret surveillance ... but were not [ subsequently indicted ] .", "...", "Moreover , as was noted above , the defence had knowledge of the substance of the material submitted into evidence and they had no right to examine material which does not concern these proceedings ; that is to say [ material which concerns ] individuals who were not indicted in these criminal proceedings ...", "This is because section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG provides that if within DATE following the termination of a secret surveillance operation criminal proceedings have not been instituted against the [ individual under surveillance ] , all the material collected [ during the operation ] must be destroyed .", "It is clear that , since criminal proceedings were not instituted against these individuals , the recordings at issue are still confidential and should have been destroyed ; they could not be and were not evidence in these criminal proceedings ...", "If these recordings were put at the disposal of the defence , that would amount to a breach of the above - cited provisions of law , particularly because [ the recordings constitute ] confidential material concerning individuals who are not under indictment .", "Moreover , LAW guarantees respect for the private life of every individual , and the court is obliged to act LAW ... , so if it provided the defence with the recordings concerning other individuals ... that would amount to breach of the above - cited provision of the LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s plea of entrapment , ORG noted :", "\u201c ... This panel finds that [ the evidence obtained by the use of informants ] is not unlawful evidence because it was obtained on the basis of an investigating judge \u2019s orders . The substance of the adduced evidence and the examined recordings do not show that there was incitement by the informant ... as was further demonstrated . \u201d", "DATE . With regard to the charges against the applicant and the evidence obtained by the use of informants , ORG extensively examined the secret surveillance recordings . It in particular analysed the recordings concerning a meeting on DATE where the applicant had indicated to PERSON that a deposit should be made with regard to the investment and where he had also assured PERSON that the project would pass the procedure . During the conversation the applicant had explained to PERSON that it was usual to remunerate for lobbying and he had further stated the following :", "\u201c However , for [ the investor ] , these [ things ] , this information , this access and the [ action ] which will be taken while the project is [ in the pipeline ] \u2013 for this lobbying ... that is worth ... what I told you the last time .

After that , if the decision goes through something ... is to be given to me , that is , for him ... let \u2019s say QUANTITY more or less when the whole thing goes through . Because on an investment of QUANTITY to give CARDINAL ... for him that would not be even PERCENT ... I would be overly modest if that would be so , you understand [ sic ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the first - instance judgment by lodging an appeal with ORG ( PERSON ) . He contended that he had been entrapped and unlawfully and unjustifiably placed under secret surveillance . He pointed out in particular that the secret surveillance orders had not been properly reasoned and had been issued under LAW and not ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the OSCOC Act \u201d ) . He also complained that the relevant evidence had not been disclosed to the defence , and that the first - instance court had erred in the legal qualification of his position as falling under the term \u201c public official \u201d under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the first - instance judgment in respect of the charges of bribery of the President of the ORG related to ORG investment project in the GPE region and ordered a retrial . At the same time , it upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction on charges of bribe - taking under LAW and abuse of power and authority under LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the unlawfulness of the secret surveillance measures , ORG noted :", "\u201c The first complaint to the effect that the results of the special investigative measures are unlawfully obtained evidence because the investigating judge \u2019s orders were made under LAW and not the [ OSCOC Act ] is ill - founded .", "It is true that the [ OSCOC Act ] is lex specialis , but the appellants failed to observe that LAW ) of that LAW provides that the investigating judge may order , \u2018 save for the measures under LAW , CARDINAL additional measures which are not provided under LAW , namely the use of simulated business services and simulated business contracts .

This is because LAW provides that unlawfully obtained evidence is evidence which has been obtained in breach of LAW , and is expressly provided for by LAW ] .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that evidence obtained by the use of secret surveillance , under LAW , can not be used as evidence in criminal proceedings only [ in a case where ] it is unlawful . That is to say , evidence which is obtained without a warrant issued by the investigating judge , or if the [ police ] acted contrary to ORG and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , but [ this does not concern ] the evidence obtained contrary to LAW , which provides that the order [ authorising special investigative measures ] should , inter alia , refer to the facts which warrant the application of such measures , specifically that there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed a criminal offence and that the investigation could not have been carried out by other means or that [ to do so ] would have been extremely difficult .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW is compatible with the legal nature of [ special investigation ] orders . Such orders [ made by the investigating judge ] are transmitted to the ORG Attorney , who is authorised to request them , and they are executed by the police . There is no legal avenue [ to challenge ] such orders since the [ ORG Attorney ] has no legal interest in challenging them . The police were therefore , moreover , not allowed to challenge the orders . If the argument of the appellants that secret surveillance orders would be unlawful when they are not sufficiently reasoned were to be accepted , it would call into doubt the [ use of ] secret surveillance measures , particularly in situations where all other legal conditions had been met but the order was merely not sufficiently reasoned , which would be absolutely unacceptable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s plea of entrapment , ORG held :", "\u201c The complaints ... that the informants PERSON and PERSON had incited the accused were raised by all the accused during the first - instance proceedings , and the [ first - instance ] court correctly found that [ this claim ] was not clear from the reviewed material . The same complaints are now raised by the accused , PERSON , PERSON and GPE , and this court considers that their complaints are ill - founded .", "The witnesses PERSON and PERSON testified that they had become informants after certain accused asked them for bribes [ for carrying out the investment ] .

With respect to the complaint about the non - disclosure of evidence , ORG noted :", "\u201c The argument that the rights of the defence were violated by the non - disclosure of CARDINAL CD and CARDINAL DVD recordings , which were the result of the secret surveillance operation , can not be accepted ...", "...", "It is undisputed that at the hearing held on DATE the trial court established the exact number of recordings and found that CARDINAL CD and CARDINAL DVD recordings had been submitted with the indictment , while it was found that the [ special investigation ] case file contained a further CARDINAL CD recordings concerning the secret surveillance of other persons who are not accused in the proceedings at issue . It is also not disputed that the ORG Attorney asked that CARDINAL CD and CARDINAL DVD recordings be examined as evidence , and that the telecommunications expert made transcripts of these recordings , which were then forwarded to the parties . It is further undisputed that the recordings were reviewed at a hearing , that the accused and their lawyers were present , and that they made their objections concerning the transcripts and not concerning the recordings . It is to be noted that the transcripts are not evidence on which a conviction can be based but are only of auxiliary technical assistance . The only evidence on which a conviction can be based is the recordings , in respect of which no objections were made .", "Therefore , the defence had access to all the evidence from the secret surveillance , and the trial court allowed them to comment on the evidence adduced and they exercised that right .", "The trial court rightly held that , given that the defence had been informed of the substance of the evidence adduced , they had no right to have the other material which did not concern the accused in the proceedings at issue disclosed . The trial court also rightly pointed to the provision of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which provides that the material obtained by the use of secret surveillance shall be destroyed if , within the DATE time - limit , criminal proceedings have not been instituted against the persons under surveillance ...", "Whether the ORG Attorney , when he was making his selection of the secret surveillance material [ to be submitted to the court ] , excluded certain evidence in favour of the accused ... is of no relevance to the lawfulness of the proceedings at issue .

As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint of the erroneous legal qualification of his position , ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s position in the ORG had not been CARDINAL of a \u201c public official \u201d but rather of a \u201c responsible person \u201d under LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . However , in ORG view , this did not render the conviction unlawful . In this connection ORG explained :", "\u201c ...
