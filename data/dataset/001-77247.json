In DATE , the applicant and a company engaged in negotiations with the city of GPE to obtain a building permit for a plot of land they had bought . In the course of these negotiations , the applicant and the said company undertook to pay CARDINAL ORG ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) of the costs for the provision of the public infrastructure ( GPE ) . The applicant also undertook to construct a shopping centre within DATE following the grant of the building permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for the building permit with the municipal authorities . He offered to submit a bank security to cover the costs for the provision of the public infrastructure concerning the shopping centre , estimated to amount to some DEM CARDINAL . He also suggested that a contract on this point be signed by him and the city .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following municipal elections , the city requested the applicant to submit a bank security of DEM CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) to cover the costs for the provision of the public infrastructure for the plot of land as a whole . Upon his refusal to do this , the city refused its consent to his request for a building permit . It also refused to conclude a contract concerning the construction of the shopping centre and the costs for the provision of the public infrastructure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an official liability action ( Amtshaftungsklage ) for compensation in the ORG against the city of GPE . He complained that the city 's sudden decision to request a bank security of DEM CARDINAL , thereby setting up further inequitable conditions for its agreement to the applicant 's building project , was a result of informal negotiations between different local political parties before the municipal elections . It constituted a voluntary breach of the principle of continuity in administrative actions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local building authorities refused to grant the applicant the requested building permit . This decision was later confirmed by the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's official liability action . According to ORG , nothing suggested that the city of GPE had acted in breach of its obligations as a public organ .", "CARDINAL .

It requested ORG to examine whether the city had discontinued abruptly the contractual negotiations with the applicant for arbitrary reasons , because the city was liable to pay damages to the applicant if it had done so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Fourth ORG ) again dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It found that , even assuming that the city had breached its duty as a public organ to act in a consistent manner , the applicant had failed to establish that there was a causal link between the city 's conduct and the damage sustained by him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided partly to admit the applicant 's renewed appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG partly quashed ORG decision and remitted the case to the Seventh ORG of that court . It found that ORG , in its finding that a causal link was missing between the city 's conduct and the damage sustained by the applicant , erroneously did not assess the evidence offered by him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Seventh ORG ) amended ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . It declared that the applicant was entitled to compensation , but did not yet assess the exact amount of the damages payable ( ORG ) . ORG found that the city of GPE had unforeseeably and without legitimate reasons requested the applicant to submit a bank security of DEM CARDINAL , thereby willingly causing the breakdown of the negotiations about the grant of a building permit . Therefore , it breached its duty as a public organ to act in a consistent manner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the appeal on points of law lodged by the city of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the city 's constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG allowed the applicant 's constitutional complaint about the length of the official liability proceedings ( see in detail paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , CARDINAL different ORG rejected the applicant 's challenges of the judges of ORG on grounds of bias as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Seventh ORG ) , after having held a hearing , dismissed the applicant 's action for compensation . It found that it was not established that the applicant would have been in a financial position to realise his building project if he had been granted the building permit , regardless of the city 's behaviour . The city 's actions thus had not caused any financial losses to him . The court ordered the applicant to pay the costs of the court proceedings ( amounting to some ORG MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant 's appeal on points of law against ORG judgment of DATE . It fixed the value in dispute ( PERSON ) at some EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ordered the applicant , being the party failing in his action , to bear the costs of the proceedings ( amounting to another approximately ORG MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG , arguing that his right to a hearing within a reasonable time had been violated in the official liability proceedings pending in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the applicant 's right to an effective judicial remedy under LAW had been violated in that ORG did not render a decision on the amount of compensation to be granted to the applicant within a reasonable time . In its reasoning , it found that , despite the complexity of the case , the length of the proceedings , which had been pending since DATE , was obviously excessive . It concluded that , pursuant to Section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz ) , it was restricted to the finding of a violation of LAW . ORG was now obliged to take effective measures in order to terminate the proceedings as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought another official liability action under LAW of LAW taken in conjunction with Section CARDINAL of LAW against ORG with ORG . He applied for a declaration ( PERSON ) that ORG was liable to compensate him for the damage which has been and will be caused by the excessive length of the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant 's action and ordered the defendant Land to pay the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Land Saarland lodged an appeal against the judgment of ORG of DATE with ORG . The proceedings , which had been suspended on the motion of both parties awaiting the outcome of the official liability proceedings against the city of GPE , are to date still pending .", "CARDINAL .
