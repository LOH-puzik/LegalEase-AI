He found that the NORP authorities had charged the applicant with criminal offences in connection with his membership of ORG ut - GPE . PERSON ut - GPE had been classified as a terrorist organisation by ORG and thus constituted a serious danger for the national security of all GPE . The applicant had earlier been convicted by a NORP court for creating and leading a section of PERSON ut - GPE in GPE . Moreover , he had submitted false information about the date of his arrival in GPE .

Moreover , the applicant had not applied for refugee status within DATE of crossing the NORP border , as required by NORP law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Given that his close relatives continued to live in GPE , his return there was possible . The court also found it established that the applicant had in fact arrived in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL .

It also stated that after serving his sentence he would be free to leave GPE . It further stated that NORP law prohibited any discrimination on grounds of sex , race , ethnic origin , language , religious or other beliefs or social status , as well as torture , violence or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment . ORG Office of GPE gave an undertaking that the relevant provisions of NORP law would be respected in the criminal proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked ORG of GPE to refuse the request for his extradition . He submitted , in particular , that he would run a real risk of torture or inhuman treatment if extradited to GPE .

Finally , he submitted that he had already been convicted for membership of ORG ut - GPE by a NORP court and had served his sentence , and that his extradition would therefore be in breach of his right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE . The prosecutor listed the charges against the applicant and found that his actions were punishable under NORP criminal law . An extradition order was granted in respect of the charge of founding a criminal organisation . The prosecutor found that the said offence corresponded to the offence of leadership of a criminal organisation under NORP criminal law . However , the prosecutor rejected as grounds for extradition the charges of attempted overthrow of the constitutional order , dissemination of materials damaging to public order , membership of a religious extremist group , and smuggling of extremist materials because those offences were either time - barred , had not been punishable under NORP criminal law at the time of their alleged commission by the applicant , or had later been decriminalised .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the extradition order before ORG . He submitted , in particular , that the charges against him were politically motivated , that he would be subjected to a serious risk of torture in GPE , and that he had been already convicted for the same offence by a NORP court . To substantiate the risk of ill - treatment he relied on the case - law of the ORG cited above and on reports by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , ORG and ORG according to which the human rights situation in GPE in general , and in NORP detention facilities in particular , was alarming because ill - treatment in order to obtain self - incriminating statements was widespread and members of prohibited religious organisations , such as ORG ut - GPE , were at an increased risk of ill - treatment . The applicant also submitted to the court letters from ORG and ORG in which they expressed their concern about his impending extradition to GPE where , being a member of ORG ut - GPE , he would certainly face a serious risk of torture or inhuman treatment", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the extradition order . It held that the NORP and NORP authorities had followed the extradition procedure set out in the applicable international and domestic law . The applicant was charged with offences punishable under NORP and NORP criminal law and there was no evidence that he was being persecuted for his political opinions . ORG further held that the applicant \u2019s allegations of a risk of ill - treatment were based on assumptions . The international reports and the case - law of the ORG relied upon by the applicant were irrelevant because they described the general situation in GPE rather than the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances . It was significant that the competent NORP authorities , such as ORG , had not detected any obstacles to the applicant \u2019s extradition , that his application for refugee status had been dismissed , and that assurances of humane treatment had been provided by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He reiterated the arguments he had advanced before ORG and ORG and argued that ORG had disregarded those arguments and the evidence he had adduced of the existence of a serious risk of ill - treatment . He further submitted that the diplomatic assurances that he would not be ill - treated were unreliable as there was no mechanism for monitoring compliance , or accountability for a breach of such assurances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed his appeal and upheld the decision of DATE , endorsing the reasoning of ORG . In reply to the applicant \u2019s argument that his extradition would be in breach of his right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence , ORG held that he had been convicted by a NORP court for acts he had committed in his capacity as a member of PERSON ut - GPE DATE in GPE , while his extradition was sought in respect of acts he had committed in the same capacity DATE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as the date of expiry of the maximum detention period established by domestic law was approaching , the applicant made a written statement that he had no intention of returning to GPE and that if he disappeared it should be understood that he had been abducted and forcibly transferred to GPE . For the same reason of fear of abduction he also requested that his representatives , PERSON and Mr GPE , be present at the moment of his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor of GPE ordered the applicant \u2019s release because the maximum detention period established by domestic law had expired .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE .
