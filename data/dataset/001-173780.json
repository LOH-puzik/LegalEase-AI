Also , his bill had been established together with the second applicant in DATE when the latter had stated that he needed documentation to present to the supervisory board of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants disputed PERSON \u2019s confession and argued that the fee paid to him had been reasonable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant asked the court not to include the expert report of ORG in the case file . He argued that ORG had to be treated as a witness for the prosecution and not as an impartial expert assisting the court . Moreover , ORG was a professional lawyer and university professor in GPE and not registered in GPE as an expert for book - keeping , cost accounting or financial auditing in the list of court appointed experts and therefore lacked the necessary expert knowledge for assessing whether the remuneration of PERSON had been appropriate . Lastly he submitted that ORG had been biased because in the course of the preliminary investigations he had answered questions of assessment of evidence and questions of law . Should the court not appoint another official expert for the trial , the third applicant requested that the privately commissioned expert reports presented to the court be included in the file . He also requested that the experts who had drawn up those reports be summoned for questioning as official experts in the trial . The other applicants joined those requests .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed all the requests . As regards the challenge for bias of GPE and the request not to hear him as expert or to read out his report , it found that from the case file and the evidence collected hitherto it did not appear that there were reasons for considering him as being biased . Since ORG had been summoned to the hearing by the trial court , he had at the same time been appointed as expert by that court . As regards the argument that he had answered questions of assessment of evidence and questions of law in the preliminary proceedings , the court found that , even assuming that this had been the case , such statements had to be disregarded by the court . As regards the private experts commissioned by the applicants as court appointed experts ORG pointed out that only after having examined and discussed the report by the court appointed expert , the necessity of appointing other experts could be decided .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor extended the charge , claiming that the damage caused by the accused amounted to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON confessed that in DATE , after his bill had been paid by ORG , the first applicant had asked him to share the money with him and PERSON had handed over part of the payment to the first applicant . Other leading members of the Alliance for the Future of GPE party had asked for money as well .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing , the first applicant conceded that after the deal with ORG had been concluded , he and PERSON had decided that part of PERSON \u2019s fee should be used to finance ORG in LOC and the Alliance for the Future of GPE party . He further confessed that he had received a portion of the fee from PERSON", "CARDINAL . The second applicant and the third applicant maintained their initial statements and claimed that they had acted in good faith without knowing that PERSON \u2019s fees were not reasonable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was heard by the court . He gave a brief summary of his written expert report and answered the questions raised by the court and the parties to the trial . While PERSON was being questioned , an expert commissioned by the defence sat next to the applicants\u2019 lawyers and advised them but was not allowed to question GPE on his own . There is no indication that ORG took part in any other hearing or put questions to witnesses or the accused .", "CARDINAL . After the questioning of ORG , the applicants and their co - accused reiterated their request to appoint another official expert . In their view , the answers given by ORG had shown that his expert report was deficient . They further argued that the appointment of another expert was necessary because ORG had to be considered as a witness for the prosecution and not as an impartial expert assisting the court .", "CARDINAL . The court dismissed those requests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG reached a verdict . It convicted the accused as charged and sentenced the first applicant to DATE , the second applicant to DATE , the third applicant to DATE and PERSON to DATE of imprisonment . In addition , they were ordered to repay ORG CARDINAL plus interest to ORG for compensation . ORG found that the services provided by PERSON in the negotiation process only corresponded to fees in the amount of ORG CARDINAL and that the second applicant and the third applicant had been aware of that fact but had breached their obligation of diligence by authorising the payment of ORG CARDINAL to PERSON As the first applicant had asked them to authorise the payment , he was guilty of abetting them .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged pleas of nullity and appeals against the sentence . PERSON also lodged an appeal against the sentence . The public prosecutor appealed against the sentences imposed on the second applicant , the third applicant . and PERSON", "CARDINAL . In their pleas of nullity the applicants , relying on Article CARDINAL subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung , hereinafter referred to as ORG ) , stated that ORG should have appointed another official expert . The proceedings had made it clear that ORG \u2019s expert report had been deficient . ORG had been appointed by the public prosecutor and had delivered the basis for a bill of indictment , which showed that he was biased . ORG had to be considered as a witness for the prosecution and not as an impartial expert assisting the court . Moreover , under LAW ORG a challenge for bias against an official expert could not be made on the grounds that he had previously been appointed as official expert in the preliminary investigations . They argued that this provision was not in line with the right to a fair trial under LAW , as they did not have a real chance to counter ORG \u2019s expert report . This was aggravated by the fact that the expert reports commissioned by the applicants and their co - accused and submitted to the trial court had not been admitted to the file and the experts had not been summoned as requested . They therefore asked ORG to request a review of the constitutionality of LAW ORG by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 pleas of nullity and the appeals of the second applicant and of the public prosecutor , but partly granted the appeals of the first applicant , the third applicant and PERSON The sentence imposed on the third applicant was added to a sentence previously imposed on him on of DATE ( ORG ) , and the sentences imposed on the first applicant and PERSON were reduced to DATE and DATE of imprisonment respectively .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the alleged violation of LAW , ORG found that LAW ORG should in general ensure that CARDINAL different official experts were not appointed in the preliminary proceedings and the trial , as this would result in delays in the proceedings . LAW CARDINAL of the ORG did not exclude a challenge for bias , except when it was merely argued with the fact that the expert had been appointed previously in the preliminary proceedings . The requests to appoint another expert had been dismissed by the court not on the grounds of LAW ORG but for other reasons . In fact , it had dismissed the requests because the applicants had not given valid reasons for their bias challenge . It had not been shown that the expert had a close relationship with the public prosecutor that would cast doubts on his objectivity .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the neutrality of the expert was ensured as he or she was obliged by law to act in an objective manner . His or her findings had to be based on facts established using scientific methods and principles . Criminal law ( perjury ) as well as the provisions on challenge for bias would ensure that his or her findings and conclusions were in accordance with the law . The expert was not part of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , and the results of the proceedings had no effect on his or her payment . In the event of a dispute between the public prosecutor and the accused about the amount of the expert \u2019s fees , it was up to the court to fix the amount and to pay the expert .", "DATE . ORG also reasoned that in preliminary proceedings as well as in a trial , an accused could address written questions to the official expert and question him or her in court and , in so doing , the accused could be assisted by a privately appointed expert . ORG noted that the applicants had made use of this opportunity . In that way , the accused had an opportunity to show that the official expert \u2019s report contained errors or shortcomings . If those errors or shortcomings could not be corrected by the official expert , the court had to dismiss him or her and appoint another expert to draw up a report . Furthermore , the findings and conclusions of the official expert could be challenged even before the trial stage by lodging an objection ( PERSON ) against the bill of indictment , but this had not been done in the case at hand ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected as inadmissible the first applicant \u2019s complaint that contacts between the public prosecutor and ORG had influenced the latter and rendered him biased vis - \u00e0 - vis the accused as this complaint had not been submitted following the proper proceedings . It added , however that such a complaint was in any event ill - founded , since the initial contact between the public prosecutor and ORG merely had the purpose of clarifying under which conditions ORG would accept the task of drawing up an expert report and subsequent contacts consisted in supplementing the case file which had been transmitted to ORG for drawing up the report . Thus , it could not be seen how this kind of contact could give rise to doubts as to the neutrality of the expert .", "CARDINAL . ORG held further that the applicants in the present case had not used their opportunity to question the competence of GPE or to object to his appointment in the preliminary proceedings . Moreover , ORG had based its findings and decision primarily not on the expert report , but on PERSON \u2019s confession . Citing the ORG \u2019s case - law ( Brandstetter v. GPE , CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; PERSON GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG found that the applicants had had sufficient opportunities to question ORG during the hearing of CARDINAL DATE . Consequently , ORG had no doubt that the right to equality of arms in the trial had been maintained .", "CARDINAL .
