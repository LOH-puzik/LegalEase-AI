This was not necessarily the case as far as other veterinary surgeons were concerned ( praktische Tier\u00e4rzte - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "From DATE onwards , the applicant - who was one of the authors of the above - mentioned Regulations and who had insisted on the provision of a round - the - clock service by clinics - advocated within the ORG that a regular night service involving the participation , by rota , of all veterinary surgeons should be organised . However , the majority of his colleagues voted on CARDINAL occasions , on DATE and DATE , against such a proposal ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

This state of affairs ought now to improve . There are plans to bring in a new Act on veterinary surgeons , along the lines of the GPE legislation governing doctors . According to Dr. PERSON , veterinary surgeon and Chairman of ORG which is part of ORG ( Bundesverband praktischer ORG . ORG ) , \u2018 it will also regulate the emergency night service\u2019 . At present , it is true , a few clinics voluntarily provide an emergency service from time to time , and [ other ] veterinary surgeons also help , but this is not on a regular basis and does not give pet - owners security . They only do it voluntarily . \"", "The journalist writing the article began by recounting the efforts made by the owners of the cat \" Shalen \" to find a veterinary surgeon prepared to help them TIME After telephoning in vain to CARDINAL veterinary practices and to the emergency service , apparently they at last struck lucky : \" Dr. PERSON , director of the GPE veterinary clinic , intervened \" . The journalist then quoted the applicant as saying : \" It was high time ; ... [ the cat ] would not have survived TIME . \"", "According to the author , Mrs. B , the particular case disclosed a problem , namely the inadequacy of the emergency service , DATE TIME There followed a passage which read :", "\" \u2018 I think that in a big city such as GPE there ought to be a regular service for attending to animals\u2019 , Dr. PERSON emphasised .", "GPE \u2019s animal lovers \" - added the journalist , summarising her interview with Dr. PERSON - \" would then no longer have to get sore fingers trying to ring up veterinary surgeons , looking for one who is prepared to help . In that case it would not only be the clinics which would voluntarily be on emergency duty round the clock ; each of the CARDINAL practising veterinary surgeons would be on night duty once a month if arrangements were made for CARDINAL of them to be on duty each night .", "The fact that there is a demand for an emergency service at TIME - time is illustrated by Dr. PERSON by reference to the number of calls received by his practice TIME : \u2018 Our telephone rings CARDINAL times each night . Of course these are not all emergency cases . Sometimes advice over the telephone is all that is PERSON \"", "The author concluded the article by presenting under the third sub - head comments of Dr. PERSON , \" Vice - Chairman of ORG and himself director of a clinic in GPE \" . Believing that an emergency service organised on a rota basis \" would not release clinics from dispensing their voluntary service but would lessen the strain on them \" , Dr. PERSON said that he was actively trying to promote such a service . He added that the appropriate GPE authorities envisaged drafting the LAW on veterinary surgeons during DATE . Until it came into force , owners of animals would have to call CARDINAL veterinary surgeon after another - or else the police , who would normally be prepared to help them .", "The article was illustrated by CARDINAL photographs . The larger , centrally placed , showed a cat and had the caption : \" Um das Leben der kleinen \u2018 Shalen\u2019 wurde gek\u00e4mpft - erfolgreich \" ( \" They fought for the life of little \u2018 Shalen\u2019 - and won \" ) . The second one was an identity photograph which appeared alongside the title and introductory paragraph of the article ; it was a photograph of the applicant , though its caption erroneously gave the name of Dr. PERSON .", "Below the photograph of the cat and outside the space occupied by the article , there was a short text under the heading \" GPE - Stadt der Tiere \" ( \" GPE - city of animals \" ) , giving the number of domestic pets , veterinary surgeons and veterinary clinics in GPE and the telephone number of the emergency service available at DATE and on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the Hamburger PERSON once again published the applicant \u2019s photograph under the heading \" Unter dem Foto ein falscher Name \" ( \" Wrong name under photo \" ) , together with the following explanation : \" An error crept into our report DATE on the emergency veterinary service . Unfortunately , the wrong name appeared under the photograph . The person in question is in fact Dr. PERSON , director of the NORP veterinary clinic . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG A number of Dr. PERSON \u2019s fellow practitioners , who regarded the article in question as publicity conflicting with LAW , referred the matter to the association \" ORG f\u00fcr PERSON i m Gesch\u00e4ftsleben e . ORG \" ( \" ORG for fairness and trustworthiness in business \" - \" Pro Honore \" ) . This association was founded in DATE by the businessmen of GPE and exists in order to \" ensure honesty and good faith in all spheres of business life \" and \" in particular to combat unfair competition , fraud in connection with moneylending and corruption \" ( article CARDINAL of the Charter of DATE ) .", "DATE , PERSON was operating simultaneously as a branch organisation of the FAC zur FAC unlauteren GPE . PERSON - am - Main ( the GPE - am - ORG for Combatting Unfair Competition - \" ORG \" ) .

ORG On DATE , PERSON wrote to the applicant to say that it had been informed by certain veterinary surgeons that he had \" instigated or tolerated , in the Hamburger PERSON of DATE , publicity on [ his ] own behalf \" . The letter went on to quote extracts from the article in question . The applicant was said to have thereby infringed section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act in conjunction with Rule CARDINAL of LAW .", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act stipulates that : \" Any person who in the course of business commits , for purposes of competition , acts contrary to honest practices ( gute PERSON ) may be enjoined from further engaging in those acts ( Unterlassung ) and held liable in damages . \"", "Rule CARDINAL of LAW deals with advertising and publicity ( ORG ) and reads as follows :", "\" It is contrary to the ethics of the profession ( standeswidrig ) :", "( a ) to advertise publicly one \u2019s veterinary practice ,", "( b ) to instigate or tolerate publicity or public acknowledgements on television , radio or in the press or other publications ,", "( c ) to disclose case histories or methods of operation or of treatment elsewhere than in specialised journals ( ORG ) ,", "( d ) to co - operate with non - veterinarians for the purpose of publicising one \u2019s own practice . \"", "PERSON asserted its right to bring proceedings against the applicant for unfair competition ( section CARDINAL sub - section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) and called on him , for the purposes of a friendly settlement of the matter , to sign an enclosed declaration . Under the terms of this declaration , he would undertake not to make publicity on his own behalf by instigating or tolerating press articles such as that which had appeared in the Hamburger Abendblatt , to pay ORG CARDINAL DM for each infringement and to pay ORG CARDINAL DM by way of costs incurred in asserting its right ( Rechtsverfolgung ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG A lawyer replied DATE on behalf of the applicant . The request made to Dr. PERSON was , he wrote , very close to blackmail . It was presumptuous ( GPE ) to speak of unlawful publicity . The reproaches directed against his client , who had not instigated the article complained of , had done considerable damage to his personal and professional reputation .", "The applicant \u2019s lawyer asked PERSON to confirm in writing that it would be dropping its claim against his client , withdrawing its accusations and expressing regret . He also asked for reimbursement of his costs and announced that he would sue PERSON if it failed to meet his demands within DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG then applied to ORG ( Landgericht ) for an interim injunction ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) .", "An interim injunction was issued on DATE by the presiding judge of the CARDINALth ORG . This decision forbade the applicant", "\" to report in the press ( except in professional journals ) , giving his full name , a photograph of himself and an indication of his occupation as director of the Fuhlsb\u00fcttel veterinary clinic , that at least on DATE TIME , animal lovers in GPE would get sore fingers from trying to telephone veterinary surgeons ready to help them , in conjunction with ( in GPE )", "( a ) the statement that only veterinary clinics were on voluntary emergency duty round the clock , and/or", "( b ) the statement that in his practice the telephone rang CARDINAL times TIME and TIME , though not all these calls were emergency cases and advice over the telephone would sometimes be sufficient , and/or", "( c ) the description of a case in which the owner of an animal had tried in vain CARDINAL ordinary weekday TIME and TIME to find a veterinary surgeon to treat his cat , until finally he was lucky enough to contact Dr. PERSON , who acted when it was more than \u2018 high time\u2019 ,", "and/or to contribute to such reports by giving journalists information \" .", "For each and every breach of the injunction , he was liable to a maximum fine ( NORP ) of CARDINAL ORG or non - criminal imprisonment ( NORP ) of DATE , the precise penalty to be fixed by the court .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant lodged an objection ( Widerspruch ) against this injunction ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) . The competent ORG upheld the injunction , however , on DATE . He thereupon entered an appeal which was dismissed on DATE by ORG ( ORG ) of ORG ( ORG ) . Finally , on DATE , ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , decided not to entertain the constitutional application he had brought against the latter judgment and the interim injunction of DATE , on the ground that the application did not offer sufficient prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . ORG Before completion of the proceedings relating to the interim injunction , Dr. PERSON had asked ORG to set a time - limit within which ORG should commence the action as to the main issue ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) ; whereupon the ORG instituted the necessary proceedings on DATE . Its statement of claim was couched in the same terms as the prohibitory injunction issued by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the CARDINALth ORG of ORG found in favour of the defendant .", "ORG rejected certain objections raised by him as to the ORG \u2019s right of action . Nor did it accept his argument that the plaintiff , in complaining of an infringement of LAW , could not rely upon Rule CARDINAL , paragraph ( a ) , of LAW .", "On the other hand , ORG was satisfied that the evidence adduced did not support the charge of infringing the rules governing competition ( PERSON ) . It had not been established that the applicant had influenced to an appreciable extent or tolerated the publication complained of . In fact , there were important indications pointing in the opposite direction . The author of the article had declared that Dr. PERSON \u2019s name had been mentioned without his knowledge . It could be inferred from her testimony that the applicant had not asked for his identity to be divulged and must have expected not to find mention of it in the newspaper . He might thus have believed - as indeed he asserted - that the Hamburger PERSON would do no more than discuss the deplorable situation brought about by the absence of a night service . In addition , it was quite possible that the article in question , instigated by the journalist , was not based solely on the interview with Dr. PERSON and that the newspaper or the journalist had included the name of Dr. PERSON and of his clinic so as to emphasise the difference between the latter - praiseworthy - clinic and other less helpful veterinary surgeons . The question whether the applicant had taken care , or at least endeavoured , to prevent his name and clinic being given prominence over his fellow practitioners had been impossible to elucidate - and this should not operate to Dr. PERSON \u2019s detriment - as the journalist had refused to give any further evidence , on the justified ground that she was not obliged to disclose her sources .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG , after declaring admissible the appeal brought by ORG , upheld the ORG \u2019s grounds of appeal , which reiterated the terms of the injunction granted on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "ORG held in the first place that the applicant had infringed Rule CARDINAL , paragraph ( a ) , of ORG , a legally valid ( formell rechtm\u00e4ssig ) provision that was in conformity with LAW as well as other superior rules of law . That Rule did not unreasonably limit Dr. PERSON \u2019s right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by LAW , for there was nothing to prevent him from freely stating his opinion and in particular from criticising deplorable situations , even if this had the inevitable effect of producing publicity favourable to himself . The ORG was not seeking to restrain Dr. PERSON from making public pronouncements about veterinary assistance . Its application was concerned solely with a given form of conduct comprising - \" cumulatively ! \" - several aspects : the giving of Dr. PERSON \u2019s full name , the reproduction of his photograph , the mention of his being director of the NORP veterinary clinic and the statement that , CARDINAL TIME and TIME on working days , animal lovers in GPE would get sore fingers trying to telephone a veterinary surgeon willing to help them , plus CARDINAL of the CARDINAL assertions set out in the ORG \u2019s grounds of appeal ( and , previously , in the interim injunction of DATE - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "Objectively , the article complained of entailed publicity for Dr. PERSON : compared to other veterinary surgeons , it presented him as an exemplary practitioner , thereby being particularly likely to incite the owners of sick animals to turn to his clinic . Such publicity exceeded the bounds of objective comment on matters of justified concern for the applicant . If in the future he were to supply the press with information necessary for the writing of an article , he should , in order to avoid any infringement of Rule CARDINAL , paragraph ( a ) , of LAW , ensure beforehand that the text to be published did not involve any unlawful publicity or advertising , by reserving a right of correction or by agreeing on the form of the article with the journalist .", "In the view of ORG , the respondent had at the same time contravened section CARDINAL of LAW . His intention of enhancing his own competitivity to the detriment of his competitors was to be presumed in the case of this type of publication , and that presumption was not rebutted in the circumstances . It mattered little ( unerheblich ) that he may additionally or even primarily have been pursuing other objectives , as there was an act done for the purposes of commercial competition as long as the intent to stimulate such competition had not been entirely overriden by other motives ( \" nicht v\u00f6llig hinter sonstigen GPE verschwindet \" ) .", "As for the risk of repetition , also presumed in this matter , there were no grounds for concluding that this was non - existent . Contrary to what ORG had found , the applicant had knowingly and substantially contributed to the publication which highlighted his person and his clinic . It was true that the press had itself taken up the case of \" Shalen \" and had invited Dr. PERSON to comment only after being informed of the incident by the animal \u2019s owner . However , the applicant had , by his interview , greatly influenced the content of the article and , what was more , had authorised a photograph to be taken of himself . He had thereby provided the opportunity for producing the article in question , with its character of publicity .", "He could not have been unaware of this risk and LAW required him to ensure that the text to be published did not involve illegal publicity favourable to himself , by reserving a right of correction or by agreeing on the form of publication with the journalist . He could also have made an arrangement with Mrs. B to remain anonymous , although he was in no way obliged to express his views without disclosing his identity .", "In fact , the respondent had acknowledged in his written pleadings of CARDINAL DATE and DATE that he had authorised the inclusion of his name and photograph . Although he retracted those statements on DATE and DATE , he had not shown that he had insisted on publication without inclusion of such details . The testimony of the journalist was not conclusive on this point . It was not necessary to take evidence from Dr. PERSON , because Dr. PERSON had unquestionably allowed photographs to be taken . That being so , he ought not to have contented himself with obtaining a verbal promise - as he claimed to have done - that he would not himself appear in CARDINAL of the photographs . Whilst he claimed to have told the journalist that ORG prohibited advertising and publicity , he was wrong to have passed on to her the responsibility of writing an article which complied with those Rules .", "The danger of repetition persisted notwithstanding the time that had elapsed . The \" Shalen \" affair was no longer topical , but the press was likely to come back to the issues it had raised , by making reference to this incident along with others , after another interview with Dr. PERSON .", "ORG decided finally not to give leave to appeal on points of law against its judgment : the latter did not depart from the established case - law of ORG ( ORG ) , and the case did not raise questions of principle .", "CARDINAL . ORG Dr. PERSON challenged the judgment of DATE before ORG . He repeated various arguments on which he had based his constitutional application in the interim proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , namely non - observance of equality before the law , of freedom of expression and of freedom to practise a profession , as safeguarded by Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , and incompatibility of the obligation to belong to ORG with freedom of association , as guaranteed by LAW . In addition , he alleged violation of his right to be heard , in particular by a legally competent court ( gesetzlicher Richter ) . On this latter point , he claimed that it was not within the province of the civil courts to apply LAW .", "ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , dismissed the constitutional application on DATE , on the ground that it lacked sufficient prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . ORG In GPE , veterinary medicine is governed partly by federal law and partly by the law of the L\u00e4nder .
