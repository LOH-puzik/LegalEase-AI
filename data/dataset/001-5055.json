MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the present case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "A.", "At the material time the applicant was working in GPE as an international doctor for ORG ( \u201c the company \u201d ) , a NORP construction company .", "The applicant , together with his CARDINAL colleagues , PERSON ( CARDINAL of the company engineers ) and PERSON ( the company accountant ) decided to pay a DATE visit to GPE in DATE . They took the ferry boat ( \u201c the GPE ) from GPE and arrived in GPE at TIME on DATE .", "When they reached the passport control point the police questioned them about their visit to GPE . The applicant replied that he would be staying for DATE and that he had MONEY on him . Despite the fact that the applicant had a valid visa for entering and leaving GPE , issued in GPE , the police claimed that there appeared to be a problem in respect of his return visa to GPE and that he had to wait .", "Although what the police said was unclear , the applicant did what he was told . His CARDINAL colleagues were also faced with the same difficulties .", "While they were waiting one of the police officers , referred to as \u201c Mario \u201d , approached them and started to insult the applicant and his colleagues for being NORP and NORP . The applicant tried to explain that religion was a matter of belief and that people should respect rather than judge or discuss religion . The police officer became agitated , raised the tone of his voice and stated that the barbarian NORP had tried in the past to conquer the whole of LOC , that they had attacked GPE in DATE and that the brave , heroic NORP people had resisted and beaten them back , that LOC had been saved by the NORP and that the NORP knew these matters to be true as they had been taught them at school .", "The Government maintain that this conversation never took place and stress that the \u201c Mario \u201d referred to by the applicant was not on duty at that part of the port at the time in question .", "The applicant again attempted to explain that he and his colleagues could not be held responsible for events which had occurred DATE and that they could not be used to justify a decision to deny them entry into GPE . The police refused to listen . At TIME the police took the applicant and his colleagues to another building . The police acted violently towards them and placed them in a cell .", "The Government maintain that the applicants were at no stage assaulted by the police .", "When the applicant and his colleagues enquired about the crime they were supposed to have committed to warrant being locked up , the officer in charge replied that no mistake had been made and since they did not have a return visa for GPE they were going to be sent back to GPE on the same ferry . The applicant and his colleagues protested that their visas were valid and stated that even if they did not have a return visa for GPE , it was pointless to send them back there . They pointed out that if they were not allowed to enter GPE , they had enough money to buy plane tickets to fly to GPE and indeed could have gone to GPE for their holiday under those conditions . The officer in charge laughed at them , saying that they should have considered this before coming to GPE and that they would not be allowed out for any reason . The officer also forcibly seized their camera , removed the film and burned it .", "At TIME the officers ' shift changed . New officers took over . Although they explained their situation to the new officers , there was no change in the outcome . They told the police that they could not keep them in cells even if they did not grant them leave to enter GPE . The applicants were threatened that \" worse \" might happen if they did not shut up .", "At TIME LOC began embarking passengers for the journey to GPE . The applicant and his colleagues asked the police to let them get on it . The police said they would let them go to the ferry just before it departed .", "The Government state that it is the practice of the ferry master not to allow \u201c inadmissible passengers \u201d such as the applicant on board until TIME before sailing .", "The applicant and his colleagues were given nothing to eat or drink for TIME . Those who needed to use the toilet facilities had to call the warder who took them CARDINAL by CARDINAL . If it was not convenient for him , he simply said \" later \" . The Government dispute these allegations and assert that the detention only lasted a maximum of TIME .", "The applicant and his colleagues were taken out TIME and brought to the ferry . Their passports were given to the NORP officer in charge of the ferry .", "When the NORP officer asked why they had not been granted leave to enter GPE , they explained that the NORP officials had claimed that they did not have return visas for GPE . The NORP officer , after having examined their passports and after having seen that everything was in order , went to the NORP sergeant and asked why they had not been granted entry . The NORP sergeant said that the applicant and his CARDINAL colleagues did not have return tickets for GPE . The applicant insisted that they did have return tickets . The answer of the NORP sergeant was \" they came with this ship and they are going to go back with this ship \" .", "Following their return to GPE , the applicant complained to ORG in GPE . The ORG replied on DATE stating that they would investigate the matter , but the outcome of this investigation is unknown . In a letter dated DATE ORG to GPE raised the applicant \u2019s complaints with ORG to GPE . On DATE the latter ORG replied that :", "\u201c ( ... ) the CARDINAL passengers did not completely satisfy the requirements of ORG and on CARDINAL account , there were reasons to believe that the NORP passengers could not possibly be considered as bona fide travellers and were thus inadmissible under the immigration and national security regime ( ... ) \u201d", "The Embassy \u2019s letter of reply also affirmed that the applicant and his colleagues had been treated with dignity and respect .", "B.
