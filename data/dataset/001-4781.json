AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP citizen , born in DATE and living in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "The applicant previously filed an application with ORG ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning his detention on remand . On DATE the Commission declared that application inadmissible .", "The facts of the present case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG ) filed a bill of indictment against the applicant charging him with various counts of fraud committed DATE and DATE ( \u201c indictment no . CARDINAL \u201d ) . Subsequently the applicant was arrested and taken into detention on remand on suspicion of having committed further fraud offences DATE and DATE .", "On DATE a trial was held by ORG ( PERSON ) with Judge PERSON sitting as a single judge on the charges contained in the indictment of CARDINAL DATE . Upon request by the public prosecutor , the trial was adjourned since additional charges were not ready for adjudication .", "On DATE the investigating judge , upon request by the public prosecutor , decided to separate the additional charges - concerning the offences the applicant had allegedly committed after DATE - from those contained in indictment no . CARDINAL and to conduct these latter proceedings independently . On the basis of these offences a further bill of indictment was drawn up on DATE ( \u201c indictment no . CARDINAL \u201d ) .", "Meanwhile , on DATE ORG , being Judge PERSON sitting as a single judge , convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of fraud set out in indictment no . CARDINAL and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "On DATE the president of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s motion of CARDINAL DATE challenging Judge PERSON for bias . The president noted that the applicant had accused this judge of suppression of evidence , manipulation of proceedings , defamation and intimidation . The president found that the applicant \u2019s submissions were polemical and unsubstantiated . As regards the applicant \u2019s reference to procedural measures , such as the obtaining of files from parallel proceedings , or making enquiries with certain banks and insurance companies whether persons employed there and named as witnesses had information on the subject of the criminal proceedings , such preparatory measures did not indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of a judge .", "On DATE the trial concerning indictment no . CARDINAL commenced before a Chamber of the Graz Regional Court , presided by Judge PERSON The applicant , assisted by an ex - officio defence counsel , filed numerous requests for the taking of further evidence . The ORG granted this request and , in view of the complexity of the investigations , decided to remit the case to the investigating judge .", "On DATE ORG filed a third bill of indictment against the applicant charging him with a further count of fraud and CARDINAL counts of fraudulent conversion ( \u201c indictment no . CARDINAL \u201d ) .", "On DATE the applicant challenged all judges of ORG for bias . This motion was dismissed by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) on DATE . ORG noted the applicant \u2019s allegations that the investigating judge had manipulated evidence , that the psychiatric court expert had drawn up an erroneous report , that witnesses heard had given false testimony and that the public prosecutor \u2019s office had refused to institute criminal proceedings against the investigating judge , the court expert and the witnesses . ORG found that the applicant \u2019s allegations concerned single members of the court and were not sufficient to cast doubt on the impartiality of all members of the court . Whether or not single members of ORG were biased was a matter which the president of that court had to decide , should the applicant file such motions with him .", "On DATE the trial against the applicant before ORG resumed . At the beginning the public prosecutor again read out indictment no . CARDINAL , extending the charges to indictment no . CARDINAL . The applicant , assisted by defence counsel , did not oppose this extension . However , he challenged the psychiatric court expert for bias and stated that he had in the meantime laid a criminal information against the expert for defamation . He also challenged the presiding judge for bias . The court rejected both motions . Subsequently the applicant was questioned on the charges against him and several witnesses were heard . As regards the charges contained in the indictment of DATE , CARDINAL employees of the C. bank were heard as witnesses . The applicant asked the witnesses several questions and explained his version of the events .", "At the end of the trial the applicant made numerous further requests for the taking of evidence , which were rejected by the court . ORG found , inter alia , that the applicant himself had admitted receiving CARDINAL ORG from the PERSON bank and that it was therefore unnecessary to obtain the report of an expert in graphology as to whether the signature on the receipt was the applicant \u2019s . As regards a further charge of fraud , ORG found that the witness , PERSON , whom the applicant had requested to be heard , was not available as he had meanwhile emigrated to GPE .", "On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL counts of fraud , fraudulent conversion and deceit , and acquitted him of further charges of fraud and defamation . It sentenced him to CARDINAL a GPE imprisonment . ORG found that the applicant was an impostor who usually pretended to be a business consultant or a pilot having substantial income and considerable private means . In reality , however , he had no income and no means and , since his release from prison in DATE , earned his living from fraudulent acts and transactions .", "As to a count of deceit , the ORG found that the applicant had approached a NORP airline and had pretended to be the managing director of a company and a member of the ORG of GPE wishing to establish , in co - operation with them , a regular flight connection between GPE and GPE . However , the company named by the applicant did not exist . In order to reassure his NORP business partners , the applicant had shown a falsified paper , allegedly established by an NORP bank , according to which he had paid CARDINAL ORG for the foundation of a joint venture between his company and the NORP one . Expecting future co - operation , the NORP company had incurred expenses and thus suffered prejudice .", "As to the assessment of evidence , the court noted that in the first hearing on DATE the applicant had requested the taking of further evidence which had been so extensive that the case had to be remitted to the investigating judge . The result of the taking of evidence had not been in the applicant \u2019s favour . Witnesses named by the applicant did not know him ; others confirmed the accusations against him . As regards the count of fraud to the detriment of the PERSON bank , the applicant \u2019s defence that the amount paid to him by the PERSON bank had been commission for services rendered , and not a loan granted to him , was implausible as he could not name any service for which he could have charged such commission .", "On DATE the applicant filed a plea of nullity and an appeal against sentence with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) . He complained , inter alia , that the indictment of DATE had not been served on him prior to the trial on DATE , and that his right to prepare his defence had therefore been infringed . He further complained that ORG had failed to take the evidence requested by him , and that his motion challenging the presiding judge for bias had been rejected .", "On DATE ORG examined the plea of nullity . It quashed the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence regarding one of the counts of fraud which involved car rentals , as it found that ORG should have made further efforts to obtain the evidence sought by the applicant . It confirmed the other convictions . As a result of quashing one of the convictions the whole sentence had to be re - examined .", "As to the complaint of a failure to serve indictment no . CARDINAL prior to the trial on DATE , ORG acknowledged its veracity . However , the public prosecutor had read out the contents of this indictment at the beginning of the trial and had thereby brought the charges mentioned therein to the notice of the applicant . The applicant had been questioned in detail by the investigating judge on these charges and had therefore been familiar with them beforehand . Moreover , the applicant had failed to show in what way the inclusion of these offences concerning facts he had known for a considerable time would have hindered his defence .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG had failed to take certain evidence requested by him , ORG found that ORG had in general acted correctly in rejecting these requests , giving detailed explanations . However it did not accept ORG decision regarding witness A. In ORG view , ORG should have tried to obtain this ORG new address in GPE , and summoned or heard him on letters rogatory , before concluding that he was unavailable .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s submissions that the NORP courts lacked jurisdiction concerning the count of deceit to the detriment of the NORP airline , ORG found that the NORP courts were competent since the applicant had also acted in GPE .", "On DATE ORG , upon a request by the public prosecutor \u2019s office , discontinued the criminal proceedings concerning the charge quashed by ORG .", "On DATE ORG , after an oral hearing , sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further plea of nullity .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
