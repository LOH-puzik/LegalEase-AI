The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . The status of Churches and religious societies is governed mainly by Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ( known as the \u201c ORG \u201d DATE ) of the Weimar Constitution of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG ) , as incorporated into LAW . CARDINAL Churches and religious societies , including ORG ( CARDINAL members ) and ORG of Germany ( CARDINAL members ) , commonly known as the CARDINAL \u201c big Churches \u201d ( PERSON ) , have the status of publiclaw entities . Other religious denominations have legal capacity under civil law .", "CARDINAL . As regards their financing , churches and religious societies with the status of public - law entities are entitled to levy a church tax , which accounts for a significant portion of their total budget . The churches decide independently whether to levy a tax and what its rate should be . The rate of church tax has been over DATE either PERCENT or PERCENT of the tax on an individual \u2019s income and , in most NORP L\u00e4nder , is collected by the ORG tax authorities on behalf of churches and religious societies , which in return pay PERCENT of their tax revenue to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The church tax is guaranteed by LAW read in conjunction with LAW of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . Only members of a particular religious denomination authorised to levy the tax are obliged to pay it . Any church member who does not want to pay church tax can leave that church by declaration towards the authorities .", "CARDINAL . If spouses are members of different churches entitled to levy taxes ( konfessionsverschiedene PERSON ) and if they have opted for a joint income tax assessment ( gemeinsame steuerliche PERSON ) , both churches levy the tax on the spouses in the form of an additional levy on the income tax of both spouses . The amount of each spouse \u2019s church tax is calculated on the basis of CARDINAL of the declared income tax .", "CARDINAL . NORP In marriages where CARDINAL spouse belongs to a church entitled to levy taxes ( glaubensverschiedene PERSON ) , the church entitled to the tax levies it in accordance with that person \u2019s tax assessment . Churches calculate the tax on the basis of the income tax attributable to the spouse liable to pay tax rather than on the basis of that spouse \u2019s share of the total income . According to ORG settled case - law , if the spouse belonging to a church has no income in terms of the regulations of LAW , the church tax can not be levied ( see CARDINAL paragraph below ) . In that case , in some NORP L\u00e4nder ( inter alia , ORG , GPE and GPE ) , the church entitled to levy taxes charges its members a special \u201c church fee \u201d ( besonderes PERSON ) . Although called a fee , the levy is , however , treated legally as a tax . The church fee amounts to CARDINAL of the relevant church tax .", "CARDINAL . Churches only levy the special church fee if spouses decide on a joint income tax assessment . The special church fee is not levied if spouses make separate tax declarations ( getrennte PERSON ) . It is important to note that in case of a joint income tax assessment the spouses benefit from a special calculation method for the income tax ( the so - called \u201c incomesplitting \u201d , \u201c Splitting - Verfahren \u201d ) and furthermore from the progressive effect ( PERSON ) of the NORP tax system , which generally leads to a lower tax burden .", "CARDINAL . NORP If spouses decide on a joint income tax assessment , they submit a tax declaration ( Steuererkl\u00e4rung ) . In most of ORG ( except of ORG ) , in their tax calculation procedure ( ORG ) the tax authorities set the special church fee according to the calculation regulations of each church . The basis for calculating the special church fee is the church member \u2019s living expenses ( Lebensf\u00fchrungsaufwand ) , which are calculated on the basis of the spouses\u2019 joint income . The special church fee is only levied on the spouse who is a church member . The remaining tax liability is applied to both spouses .", "CARDINAL . If a tax authority \u2019s calculation on income tax leads to a tax reimbursement for the spouse not being a member of a church and who is liable to pay income tax , only that spouse will be credited with it . At the same time , the special church fee levied on CARDINAL spouse can be offset against any tax reimbursement due to the other spouse . If the calculation of the income tax leads to a demand to pay more tax , offsetting can not take place .", "CARDINAL . Either spouse can file an objection ( PERSON ) against that part of the tax bill which applies to them . If the special church fee has been offset against a tax reimbursement due to the spouse who is not a member of a church that spouse can apply for a settlement notice ( LOC ) in accordance with LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and thus have the possibility to be repaid the offset amount .", "CARDINAL .
