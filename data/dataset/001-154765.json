De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Background", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE the applicant has resided in a flat located in a building in GPE in GPE : first due to his employment at the property and , as from DATE , on the basis of a rental agreement with GPE ( the owner of the property and the building ) . The GPE area is considered to be cultural heritage of national interest and has been recognised as such by ORG ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant appealed against a detailed development plan ( detaljplan ) adopted by ORG ( kommunfullm\u00e4ktige ) of GPE which would allow for the construction of a tunnel under GPE as part of a motorway project called \u201c PERSON \u201d . The appeal was rejected by the Government , for which reason the applicant applied for judicial review before ORG ( H\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) . He claimed , inter alia , that he , and others living within or close to the area , would be negatively affected by the construction of the tunnel as it would cause various disturbances , particularly during the construction . Moreover , he contended that the nature and landscape of the park would be affected in violation of the Law on Natural Resources ( lag om hush\u00e5llning med naturresurser m.m . , CARDINAL:CARDINAL , which was subsequently replaced by LAW [ ORG , CARDINAL ] ) . On DATE ORG repealed the ORG \u2019s decision , finding that the planned construction would constitute a breach of the law invoked in that the construction would encroach upon an area classified as a National City Park ( nationalstadspark ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the Government annulled the detailed development plan in question and , later , ORG adopted a new detailed development plan which gained legal force in DATE . Subsequently , ORG adopted an amendment to this detailed development plan . However , the amendment required changes to LAW and , in DATE , such changes were adopted .", "CARDINAL . NORP The proceedings relating to the amendment of the detailed development plan", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG adopted the amendment to the detailed development plan concerning PERSON . The amendment allowed for the construction from above ground of a tunnel through FAC . ORG noted that the amendments were focused on the method of constructing the tunnel . It further stressed that the effects on the environment would be essentially temporary as the park would be completely restored after construction had finished . Thus , there would be no considerable impact on the environment , nature , cultural heritage or people \u2019s health and , hence , a formal environmental evaluation would not be necessary .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) , claiming essentially that the amendment was not in accordance with LAW and that a formal environmental evaluation should have been carried out . In his opinion , the negative effects on the environment and nature outweighed the benefits of the construction of the tunnel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It agreed with ORG that there was no need for a formal environmental evaluation . Moreover , having weighed the applicant \u2019s individual interests against the general interests that the amendment sought to protect , ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s submissions did not suffice to repeal the decision of ORG . Lastly , it found that no other circumstances had been presented which could lead it to repeal the decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision to the Government . He noted that he had not claimed that his individual interests were of any significance . However , he stressed the general interest in preserving the park and in particular a number of trees in the park . In his view , these general interests had not been considered properly and ORG had completely ignored his claim that the decision breached certain provisions in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the appeal . It first observed that the purpose of the amendment to the detailed development plan was to render possible the construction of the tunnel from above ground and , at the same time , to ensure that the intrusion would be temporary and limited to the period of the actual construction . The landscape was to be restored immediately afterwards according to an adopted quality programme which was based on an historical park plan from DATE . The Government then observed that , although the area affected by the amendment was part of ORG , the amendments to LAW of DATE allowed for certain measures that would cause only temporary encroachment or damage to the park . Having regard to all , the ORG found no reason to depart from the ORG \u2019s assessment that the plan complied with the provisions of LAW . As concerned the applicant \u2019s other submissions , the Government considered that they did not give reason to alter or repeal the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then requested a review of the ORG \u2019s decision by ORG under LAW ( lagen om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa regeringsbeslut , CARDINAL ; hereafter \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) . He submitted that the ORG \u2019s decision violated LAW as well as LAW . He particularly stressed that the construction of the tunnel meant that several old trees in the park would be cut down , causing irreparable harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for judicial review . The court noted that , according to LAW , an individual may apply for judicial review of such decisions by the Government that concern the individual \u2019s civil rights or obligations within the meaning of LAW . It then observed that the property where the applicant resided was located outside the area covered by the detailed development plan . He also did not own property within or adjacent to the area covered by the plan . The court concluded that the ORG \u2019s decision did not concern the applicant \u2019s civil rights or obligations within the meaning of LAW and , therefore , he did not have locus standi before the court .", "The judicial review procedure", "CARDINAL . On DATE , LAW replaced LAW ( lagen om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut , GPE , hereafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the preparatory work to LAW , the purpose of judicial review was to provide access to court as regards decisions which should be subject to judicial review under the Convention , but where NORP national law did not provide such a right beyond the possibility to apply for the extraordinary remedy of relief for substantive defects ( Government PERSON p. CARDINAL ) . The preparatory works further noted that the scope of application of LAW had been too narrow in some cases , while in other cases its application went further than required by the LAW in relation to \u201c civil rights and obligations \u201d ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL ) . Thus , the provision on right of action was formulated differently in LAW compared to LAW .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , under LAW , an individual can only apply for judicial review of decisions by the Government when they involve a determination of the individual \u2019s civil rights or obligations within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act states that ORG shall annul the ORG \u2019s decision if the decision contravenes a legislative provision either in the way alleged by the complainant or in a way that is clearly apparent from the circumstances . However , this does not apply if the error obviously lacks significance for the decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
