LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s dog , a pit - bull terrier , attacked an DATE child , severely biting and injuring him . The prosecution instituted criminal proceedings under LAW ( causing medium bodily harm by negligence ) , which were subsequently discontinued , as no evidence of a crime was disclosed .", "Nevertheless , in its decision of DATE , the police found the applicant guilty of an administrative offence . The decision stated that the applicant \u2019s dog had bitten the child , and thus the applicant was liable under LAW ( a breach of the pet - keeping rules , causing an injury ) . She was fined LTL CARDINAL ( about LAW ) . The applicant did not dispute that decision , and paid the fine .", "On DATE the prosecution re - opened the criminal proceedings against the applicant .", "On DATE a fresh medical expert examination confirmed the seriousness of the injuries caused to the boy , finding that he would need plastic surgery .", "On DATE the applicant was charged with causing medium bodily harm by negligence ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) and remanded on bail , with a written obligation not to leave her place of residence . The applicant did not appeal against this restriction .", "On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant . It was established that the applicant was not guilty of a criminal offence but rather of an administrative violation for which she had already been punished .", "On DATE ORG reversed this judgment , finding the applicant guilty . The appellate court noted the gravity of the injuries sustained by the boy ( bite wounds on his nose , forehead , cheeks , arm and leg ) . The court also found that the applicant \u2019s behaviour had been negligent , in that she had walked her dog without a muzzle , although the animal was of a dangerous breed . In view of these factors , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s acts must attract criminal rather than administrative responsibility . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , but the sentence was rescinded by virtue of an amnesty act . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal .", "On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction . It established that the applicant had been criminally liable for having caused medium bodily harm by negligence .", "ORG noted that in cases where the same acts attracted both criminal and administrative liability , the nature of the offence was a criterion determining which procedure ought to be applied . In particular , if the nature of the act made it punishable under the criminal law , the person should be held liable under criminal law . If the nature of the offence was not such as to attract criminal liability , a person would be held liable under the administrative law . ORG went on to say :", "\u201c It was established that the applicant had caused medium bodily harm by negligence , therefore , she has been rightly convicted under LAW .", "The fact that [ the applicant ] has been punished for the same acts by way of an administrative procedure is not a valid ground to discontinue the criminal proceedings , since such a ground is not foreseen by LAW . However , a person can not be punished twice for the same offence , because it is contrary to LAW . Since [ the applicant ] has been reasonably convicted under LAW , the issue of the lawfulness of the administrative decision to fine [ the applicant ] can be reconsidered in accordance with LAW ] . \u201d", "LAW states as follows :", "\u201c ... Punishment may be imposed or applied on the grounds established by law . No one may be punished for the same criminal offence twice . ... \u201d", "ORG Article CARDINAL of LAW ( as then in force ) stipulated :", "\u201c A person shall be held liable only when the act committed is forbidden by a criminal statute which came into force before the commission of the offence ...", "No one shall be punished for the same criminal act twice ... \u201d", "The then LAW provided for criminal liability for causing serious or medium bodily harm by negligence .", "LAW ( as then in force ) provided :", "\u201c Any person who breaches pet - keeping rules - approved by ORG - shall be punished by a warning or fine of CARDINAL litai . The same act , committed repeatedly or when causing damage to the health or property of others - shall be punished by a fine CARDINAL litai . \u201d", "The then LAW provided for a right of appeal against a decision to impose an administrative penalty .", "The then LAW stipulated :", "", "\u201c Where a decision finding a person liable for an administrative offence has been quashed , the [ fine ] paid shall be reimbursed ... and other restrictions relating to the [ administrative penalty ] shall be repealed . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
