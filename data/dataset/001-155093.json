The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant nominated himself to stand as an independent candidate in the parliamentary elections of CARDINAL DATE and applied for registration as a candidate in the single - mandate ORG No . DATE .", "CARDINAL . As LAW required that each nomination as a candidate for parliamentary elections be supported by a minimum of CARDINAL voters , on DATE the applicant submitted to ORG ( \u201c the ConEC \u201d ) CARDINAL signature sheets containing CARDINAL voter signatures collected in support of his candidacy .", "CARDINAL . Before the DATE \u2019s decision on the question of the applicant \u2019s registration as a candidate , the accuracy of the signature sheets and other registration documents submitted by the applicant were to be first examined by a special working group ( i\u015f\u00e7i qrupu ) established by the ConEC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was invited to the ConEC . He was informed that the validity of supporting signatures submitted by him had already been examined by the ConEC working group and that , based on the results of that examination , the ConEC had held a hearing on whether to register him as a candidate . According to the applicant , he orally protested to the fact that he had not been informed of the time of the examination by the working group of his signature sheets and that the ConEC had taken a decision without his participation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that by a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ConEC had refused the applicant \u2019s request for registration as a candidate . The ConEC found that , according to the opinion of the working group , a number of submitted supporting signatures were invalid , and that the number of the remaining valid signatures was below CARDINAL . According to the ConEC decision , the working group had relied on opinions of CARDINAL of its experts . In particular , expert PERSON found that CARDINAL signatures were not authentic , because they had been executed repeatedly by the same persons who had already signed the signature sheets . Expert GPE found that a total of CARDINAL signatures were invalid . No more detail was given in the ConEC decision as for the reasons for the invalidation of those signatures .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was provided with a copy of the ConEC decision on DATE . However , the relevant expert opinions were not made available to him until a further written request by the applicant to this effect .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the expert opinion by ORG was undated , while the expert opinion by GPE was dated DATE . No copies of those expert opinions were submitted to the ORG either by the applicant or the Government . However , it can be discerned from other documents in the case file that , according to those expert opinions , the following grounds were given for invalidation of some of the signatures : ( a ) CARDINAL groups of signatures , consisting of a total of CARDINAL signatures , had been \u201c probably ( ehtimal ki ) executed by the same person in each group \u201d ; for these reasons , CARDINAL of those signatures were deemed valid , while the remaining CARDINAL were considered invalid ; ( b ) CARDINAL signatures were found to be invalid because the information on voters\u2019 addresses was incomplete ( only the city of residence was mentioned ) ; and ( c ) CARDINAL signatures were considered invalid because the information on the relevant voters\u2019 addresses omitted the city of residence ( all those voters lived in PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) against the PERSON decision to refuse registration . He complained , inter alia , of the following :", "( a ) NORP contrary to the requirements of LAW , the applicant had not been invited to participate in the process of examination of the signature sheets by the ConEC working group and , thus , deprived of the right to give necessary explanations to the experts ;", "( b ) NORP contrary to the requirements of LAW , he had not been provided with a copy of the record on the results of the examination of the signature sheets CARDINAL prior to the PERSON meeting on the applicant \u2019s registration ;", "( c ) the applicant \u2019s presence at the PERSON meeting of DATE had not been ensured ; and", "( d ) the findings of the ConEC working group that such a large number of signatures were invalid were factually wrong , arbitrary and unjustifiably formalistic . In particular , the finding that CARDINAL signatures were \u201c executed by the same person \u201d was accepted as an established fact merely on the basis of an indication of such probability by the expert , in the absence of any further factual verification . Furthermore , invalidation of the remaining signatures owing to incomplete information on the voters\u2019 addresses had been wrong , because such information was not \u201c incorrect \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( on which the ConEC had relied ) , but simply incomplete and could , therefore , be rectified if the applicant had been given an opportunity to do so as required by LAW . In the applicant \u2019s view , taking into account the territorial location of the constituency , it should have been clear to the ConEC that the relevant voters resided in PERSON , even though they had not mentioned the city of residence on the signature sheets .", "CARDINAL . Enclosed with his complaint to the ORG , the applicant submitted written statements by CARDINAL voters , whose signatures had been declared invalid , affirming the authenticity of their signatures . He also submitted photocopies of ID cards of several voters in order to clarify the situation with their residence addresses . However , according to the applicant , those documents were not taken into consideration by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG conducted another examination of the signature sheets by members of its own working group . The applicant was not invited to participate in this process . According to the working group \u2019s DATE and CARDINAL expert opinions , a total of CARDINAL signatures were considered to be invalid . In particular , expert PERSON found that CARDINAL signatures were invalid because they belonged to persons with no right to vote ( minors DATE ) and that CARDINAL other signatures had been executed by persons whose identification document number was stated incorrectly . Expert U.A. found that \u201c CARDINAL groups of signatures , consisting of a total of CARDINAL signatures , had been probably executed by the same person in each group \u201d ( \u201c CARDINAL \u0259d\u0259d imza CARDINAL qrup olmaqla \u00f6z aralar\u0131nda ehtimal ki , eyni \u015f\u0259xs t\u0259r\u0259find\u0259n icra olunmu\u015fdur \u201d ) . This meant that CARDINAL signature in each such group should be considered valid ( a total of CARDINAL ) , while the remainder should be considered invalid ( a total of CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not invited to the ORG meeting dealing with his complaint against the PERSON decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint and upheld the ConEC decision of DATE . It found that , based on the findings of the ORG \u2019s own working group , CARDINAL out of CARDINAL signatures submitted by the applicant were invalid and that the remaining number of CARDINAL valid signatures was below the minimum required by law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was given copies of the ORG decision and the relevant working group documents on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the ORG decision with ORG . He reiterated his complaints made before the ORG concerning the PERSON decision and procedures . Moreover , he raised , inter alia , the following complaints :", "( a ) NORP contrary to the requirements of the electoral law , the ORG failed to notify him of its meetings and to ensure his presence during the examination of the signature sheets and the examination of his complaint ;", "( b ) the relevant ORG documents had been made available to him in a belated manner , which was contrary to the requirements of the electoral law and had deprived him of the opportunity to challenge the decisions of the ORG and its working group more effectively ;", "( c ) NORP both electoral PERSON decisions were based on expert opinions that contained nothing more than conjecture and speculation ( that the signatures were \u201c probably \u201d ( \u201c ehtimal ki \u201d ) falsified ) , instead of properly established facts ;", "( d ) the ORG had ignored the written statements by CARDINAL voters confirming the authenticity of their invalidated signatures and had failed to take them into account ; and", "( e ) the ORG had failed to provide any reasoning and had not addressed any of the applicant \u2019s arguments in its decision .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . In its judgment , the court took note of the ConEC and ORG decisions , proceeded to cite a number of provisions of LAW and LAW without explaining their relevance to the facts of the case at hand , did not address any of the applicant \u2019s arguments , and dismissed his appeal as \u201c unsubstantiated \u201d without providing reasons for reaching such a conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further appeal with ORG , reiterating his previous complaints and arguing that ORG had not carried out a fair examination of the case and had delivered an unreasoned judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as unsubstantiated , without examining his arguments in detail and finding no grounds for doubting the findings of the electoral commissions and ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
