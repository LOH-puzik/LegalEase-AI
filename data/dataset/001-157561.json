NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . She was represented before the ORG by her mother , PERSON , who on DATE was granted leave by the President of the Section under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of ORG to act on her daughter \u2019s behalf in the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and established by the ORG , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who suffered from a schizoaffective disorder , attacked her mother with a knife in their home . The police , who had been called by the applicant \u2019s mother , arrested the applicant and took her to a centre for psychiatric health in GPE . She remained there until DATE , when ORG ordered her to be transferred to PERSON State Psychiatric Hospital in ORG for CARDINAL months\u2019 compulsory treatment . The applicant appealed against that order , challenging in particular the court \u2019s ruling as to the precise facility in which she was to be treated . Her mother , who was heard as a witness in the course of the appeal proceedings , also stated that she would prefer the applicant to be treated elsewhere , preferably as an outpatient . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON State Psychiatric Hospital , which is ORG - owned and operated , is situated at the outskirts of the town of ORG , at QUANTITY from the nearest neighbourhood , QUANTITY from the centre of GPE , and QUANTITY from GPE \u2019s ring road . It was created in DATE , using some of the premises of a nearby monastery , and consists of several buildings .", "CARDINAL . During DATE of her stay in that hospital , the applicant was placed under a \u201c heightened security regime \u201d , which meant she was not allowed to leave her ward unaccompanied .

After DATE the applicant \u2019s regime was relaxed and she was allowed to move around the hospital grounds and take part in art therapy sessions . As her mental health improved \u2013 according to the Government as a result of the medication that she was given \u2013 her regime was relaxed even further , and CARDINAL DATE she was granted home leave . On DATE her treatment continued on an outpatient basis , which meant that after that date she was only required to be present at the hospital during DATE for medication and art therapy , but did not have to stay TIME .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s compulsory treatment came to an end on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that during DATE of her stay in PERSON State Psychiatric Hospital she had been assaulted by another patient . In the course of the hearing of the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG order for her compulsory treatment , the applicant \u2019s mother gave evidence that the applicant had told her that on DATE a newly arrived patient had assaulted her in the shower , pushing her in the chest . She had however not sustained any injuries as a result , and had not called for help , apparently because she had felt scared . When her mother had visited her DATE , DATE , the CARDINAL had brought the incident to the attention of CARDINAL members of the nursing staff , who had advised the applicant to call for help if such an incident were to occur again . On the basis of that evidence , the appellate court accepted that an incident with another patient had taken place .

In the course of the same hearing the applicant said that the temperature in the hospital was too low for her to feel comfortable and that as a result she had a sore throat .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , conditions in the hospital were quite poor , characterised by insufficient funding and staffing levels , inter - patient violence , low temperatures in DATE and frequent flooding .

NORP In support of her allegations , the applicant referred to a report by ORG drawn up after members of his staff had inspected the hospital on DATE in their capacity as designated national preventive mechanism under LAW to LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( CARDINAL United Nations Treaty Series CARDINAL ) , which entered into force in respect of GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report began by noting that one of the hospital \u2019s chief problems was its remoteness , which rendered access for patients\u2019 relatives difficult , especially in DATE . The other big problem was that the LOC and the hygienic and material conditions did not live up to the applicable medical standards . The buildings were old and in a \u201c deplorable \u201d state of repair , despite partial renovation works carried out DATE before the inspection . The equipment was outdated and inadequate . As a result of a damaged dyke on the nearby LOC , the LOC were flooded DATE . The room in which food was being served to patients had leaks , mould on the ceiling and rusty equipment .", "CARDINAL . Patients were accommodated in rooms with CARDINAL beds each . Each of the hospital \u2019s wards housed CARDINAL patients and had CARDINAL bathrooms and CARDINAL toilets , found by the report to be \u201c utterly insufficient \u201d . Patients were allowed out of their rooms for CARDINAL to CARDINAL - and - a - half hours per day . Visits were permitted twice a week and had to take place in the yard , weather permitting . At the time of the inspection the hospital had CARDINAL patients . CARDINAL of them were in the female ward , which was staffed by CARDINAL medical doctors , CARDINAL psychologist , CARDINAL nurses and CARDINAL orderlies . The hospital lacked almost all of the medical equipment required under the applicable regulations . It had never been audited , and did not properly record medical conditions other than the mental illnesses in connection with which the patients had been admitted . Patients who died in the hospital were not subjected to an autopsy , and patients who had to be restrained were not kept separate from other patients , as required under the applicable regulations .", "CARDINAL . In view of those findings , the report recommended that the hospital gradually be closed and transferred to new LOC in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

Minor repair works such as repainting and a partial renovation of the roof had been carried out in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The nurses had kept records of room temperatures , taking the following readings at the time of the applicant \u2019s stay : CARDINAL degrees Celsius during TIME DATE , and QUANTITY during DATE of DATE and DATE . The report also noted that in the applicant \u2019s ward , patients were free to leave their rooms and move around . Those of them who , like the applicant initially , were placed under the \u201c heightened security regime \u201d were not allowed to leave the ward unaccompanied , in order to avoid acts of aggression , suicides or escapes , and were kept under constant supervision .", "CARDINAL .
