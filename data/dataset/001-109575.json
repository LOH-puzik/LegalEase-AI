SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the mother of CARDINAL children , NORP born in DATE , S. born in DATE and NORP born in DATE . In DATE , the applicant separated from the children \u2019s father , PERSON , and she was eventually granted sole custody of the children , while PERSON was granted contact rights . The applicant married PERSON in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her children have been known to the social services since DATE when a first investigation into their home environment was carried out . During DATE and DATE , the personnel at the children DATE care centre felt that the applicant was distracted and stressed and the children were hungry and dirty when they arrived at day care in the TIME and were behaving in a wild and hyperactive manner . In view of this , they reported the situation to the social services in PERSON . In DATE the applicant herself contacted the ORG ( Barn- och ungdomspsykiatrin ; hereafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) for help , as she considered the situation to be chaotic and she needed help for her son , PERSON , who she claimed destroyed everything at home . ORG reported the family \u2019s situation to the social services .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant contacted ORG in a state of despair and , in response , a social emergency unit ( social beredskap ) went to the applicant \u2019s home , accompanied by police and a chief physician from the adult psychiatric clinic . The authorities found the interior of the home completely destitute ; there was hardly any furniture and there was no electricity or running water . The applicant was in a confused state and blamed the mess in the house on S. The social emergency unit decided immediately to place the children , together with the applicant , in a temporary family home ( jourfamiljehem ) . On DATE , the applicant was committed to compulsory psychiatric care in accordance with LAW ( Lagen om psykiatrisk tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd , DATE ) . The applicant claimed that she was not ill but agreed to the placement of the children in the temporary family home . DATE , she was released from psychiatric care and returned to her home .", "CARDINAL . During DATE the applicant had frequent contact with the social services . However , she felt misunderstood and harassed by the authorities and wanted to bring her CARDINAL daughters , T. and NORP , home . As the social services insisted that the situation was not stable enough for the girls to return to the applicant , she withdrew her consent to their voluntary placement . Hence , ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) in PERSON decided to take ORG and NORP into public care immediately on a provisional basis , pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Act with Special Provisions on ORG ( ORG med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga , TIME ; hereafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The council considered that the measure was necessary in order to protect the children . It also noted that there had been chaos every time the applicant had met with the children during DATE or when she had appeared , often unannounced , at DATE care centre , leaving them upset and sad .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who was represented by legal counsel , opposed the measure but , on DATE , ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of ORG confirmed the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied to ORG for a permanent care order in respect of all CARDINAL children , in accordance with section QUANTITY of LAW . The council maintained that the applicant had shown a serious lack of ability to care for her children . It submitted a comprehensive investigation report into the family \u2019s situation in support of its request according to which all CARDINAL children had worn nappies when they arrived at the temporary family home , although ORG only at TIME , and they had been dirty and had an endless appetite . Moreover , T. had no limits towards adults and wanted to control everything and everyone around her . S. had nightmares and had been afraid of sudden movements . He acted in a very stressed and anxious manner when his mother was present . NORP had been late in her speech and motor development . The applicant had not been able to set limits for her children and the situation when they met had always become out of control .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disputed the measure and claimed that she was capable of caring for her children , who suffered from being separated from her .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG granted a permanent care order in respect of each of the CARDINAL children . It found that , on the basis of all the material in the case , it had been shown that the applicant lacked the ability to care for her children , which had already somewhat impaired their health and development , and that there was a serious risk of further damage unless they were given proper care . Since the applicant did not agree to voluntary care , it was necessary to take the children into public care on a permanent basis .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE . She had realised that it was not PERSON , but her husband PERSON , who had been responsible for all the destruction in their home . J. had admitted this and they had divorced . However , she did not consider that the children had suffered from this error , although she felt sorry for PERSON and would have liked to talk to him about it .", "CARDINAL . ORG contested the appeal . In its view , the children \u2019s behaviour showed that their development had already been harmed and , moreover , the applicant had no insight into her problems and had difficulties in interacting with her children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full . In its opinion it was evident that the children had not received proper care at home . Moreover , the applicant had shown signs of mental ill - health and had behaved in an unbalanced manner . Thus there had been a real risk of damage to the children \u2019s health and development . Furthermore , although the court acknowledged that the situation had improved in that the house had been renovated and the applicant had divorced J. , it found that the situation was far from being stable , having regard to the serious flaws which had existed , the uncertainty as to whether they still existed and the children \u2019s need for care .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Following the granting of the public care order in DATE , the applicant had contact rights to visit T. for TIME , once DATE , and spoke with her on the telephone once DATE . She met PERSON once DATE in the presence of the social services and she had contact rights to visit NORP for TIME DATE . In DATE the applicant moved to live with her sister in GPE , located QUANTITY from PERSON , and as a result she travelled to PERSON to see her children roughly once a month .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the children were placed in CARDINAL different family homes , all within QUANTITY of PERSON , as one family was not able to provide the care and support that each child needed . However , it was arranged for the children to meet each other approximately once a month to ensure continued good contact between them .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , through her legal counsel , requested ORG to allow her more time with her children as she felt that the children were being deprived of contact with her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to restrict the applicant \u2019s contact rights to all CARDINAL children . It first noted that the children \u2019s father , PERSON , had also requested contact rights to the children and that his contact rights had to be taken into account when deciding on the frequency of the applicant \u2019s contact rights , balanced against the best interests of the children . Thus , according to the decision , each parent should meet with the children once DATE in a neutral environment where the family home parents and the social worker responsible for the file should be present . This meant that the applicant would meet her children DATE .", "CARDINAL . The decision was based on an investigation carried out by ORG , in consultation with ORG , into the children \u2019s situation . It was finalised on DATE and concluded , inter alia , the following . All CARDINAL children had suffered severe harm to their health and development because of the deficiencies in the applicant \u2019s ability to care for them . They were vulnerable and sensitive to change . However , since the permanent care order , T. had slowly become more calm and balanced and had started to learn how to play . She and the applicant had been alone during their meetings and had done various things such as going to the playground , the swimming pool or a restaurant . T. had been very tired after the meetings and she had slept badly and wet her bed . After telephone conversations with the applicant , ORG had also been anxious and sad . As regards PERSON , he had become calmer and more relaxed since placed in the family home . He still had difficulties sleeping and suffered from stomach pains and vomiting before and after contact with the applicant , despite the meetings having been very structured and held in the presence of the family home father . S. showed clear signs of fear of his mother and he had expressed a fear that she would come and fetch him . Turning to NORP , it was observed that she had met with the applicant and that they had usually been alone , playing together . After contact with the applicant , NORP used to be worried about things the applicant had told her and she regressed somewhat in her development for DATE after each meeting , wetting her bed and having difficulty sleeping . ORG concluded in its investigation report that the children had a right to contact with their mother but that their best interests required that the contact be limited in order to ensure their secure and positive development .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG and requested that she be granted contact rights to her children much more often than only twice a year . She could see no reason for such restricted contact and found it to be contrary to the best interests of the children as they would forget their mother . They had lived with her until DATE and they had had a close and warm relationship . She agreed that the children should also see and get to know their father but considered that this should not limit her contact with them . Moreover , she referred to a custody report , dated DATE , which had been carried out in connection with the custody proceedings following the divorce from B. In the summary of the report it was stated , inter alia , that nothing had appeared to call into question the applicant \u2019s ability as a parent to care for her CARDINAL children and that personnel at the children DATE care centre had stated that the children seemed to receive the care they needed from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG contested the appeal . It submitted that the children were currently in the process of developing and learning things that they had not had the opportunity to learn before and it was important that this process should not be interrupted , which was the effect of their contact with the applicant . Consultation had taken place with ORG , which agreed with ORG that contact restrictions were necessary in order to ensure a positive development for the children . Moreover , it noted that the last meeting between the applicant and her children , on DATE , had passed without incident , partly because CARDINAL adults had been present to ensure the children \u2019s well - being .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It noted that a supplementary custody report , dated DATE , stated that it was clear that there were major flaws in the applicant \u2019s ability to care for her children . Thus , having regard to the fact that the children had been feeling ill and anxious in connection with and after their contacts with the applicant , and that they needed time to develop in peace in their family homes , ORG had been justified in restricting the applicant \u2019s contact rights to her children to twice DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , maintaining her claims and adding that she wished to see her children at least once DATE in order to ensure that they would not forget her . She felt that the family home parents had a negative attitude towards her and that this influenced the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full . It noted that ORG had been consulted by ORG before its decision .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal by the applicant , ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , ORG reconsidered the contact restrictions and decided to maintain the restrictions in place . It would appear that the applicant did not appeal against these until the council \u2019s decision of DATE which she appealed against to ORG , requesting that her contact rights to her children be increased to CARDINAL visit per month to begin with and , after DATE , to spend DATE a month with them alone . She stated , inter alia , that she had moved to GPE , found a job and was in a steady relationship with a new man , and thus , felt very well .", "CARDINAL . In its decision , ORG had observed that despite the applicant \u2019s visits having been planned and very structured , the children had still had negative reactions before and after each meeting in the form of anxiety , stomach aches , bedwetting , becoming insecure and regressing in their development . It further noted that during the visit in DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother had also been present which had been a positive addition . She had expressed a wish to see her grandchildren once DATE , to which the council agreed . It also noted that the applicant had sent postcards and letters to the children which they appreciated . As concerned the visits , the council observed that they were always very well planned and structured with the support of the family homes and that the applicant and the children played together , ate and talked . The family homes also showed photos and films from the children \u2019s meetings and their activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court , after having held an oral hearing , decided to increase the applicant \u2019s contact with her children to CARDINAL times per year , for TIME each time . It noted that the limited contact had been in place for DATE and had contributed to the children developing positively during this time . Although it agreed with ORG that continued limitations on the applicant \u2019s contact with her children were necessary due to the children \u2019s needs , it noted that the applicant had not interfered in an inappropriate manner in the care of her children . Moreover , the last CARDINAL times they had met had generally gone well . Therefore , the court found that with the support of ORG and the family homes during the meetings , these could be increased to CARDINAL times per year for the applicant . In its view , this would provide the children with a good contact with their mother while not jeopardising their continued development .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , maintaining that she wanted contact rights with her children during DATE , without the presence of others , in order to ensure that she and the children would establish a good contact .", "CARDINAL . ORG contested the appeal and maintained the reasons set forth in its decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG requested ORG to obtain the children \u2019s point of view on increased contact with their mother . Consequently , the council met with the children individually but in the presence of their family home parents where they spoke about various things , including how they felt about seeing their mother more often . T. said that she did not want to meet her mother more than twice a year and that she did not want to be alone with her or stay with her . According to ORG , the meetings were very tiresome , demanding , she had a headache and could not concentrate in school before and after the meetings . She started crying and had a stomach ache during the conversation for which reason they had to cut it short . Following the conversation , she wet her bed at night , cried a lot and said that she was afraid . As for PERSON , he did not want to talk about his mother . He reacted in a negative , frightened manner and almost started crying . He later said that he only wanted to see her once a year and that he did not want to be alone with her . It was noted that he was very anxious and afraid to meet his mother and had strong physical reactions both before and after the meetings , including stuttering , becoming aggressive and being afraid of physical contact . Turning to NORP she said that she became tired when meeting her mother and siblings but that it was nice to dress up and eat good food . It was noted that NORP was the most positive about the meetings with the applicant but that she did not want to meet with her alone . Moreover , the negative reactions that she had had during earlier meetings had improved somewhat .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant voluntarily underwent a neuropsychological examination during DATE at ORG , upon request by ORG . The council wanted to know if the applicant suffered from a disorder or mental illness and , if so , what support she would need . The examination concluded that the applicant fulfilled the criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) that was mainly inattentive in nature . It recommended supplementary examinations and made a number of proposals for supportive measures , including establishing fixed structures and routines in her daily life . It was also stressed that this specific impairment of her capabilities could hardly be sufficient to \u201c disqualify her as a parent \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment in full . It concluded that it would not be in the best interest of the children to increase the applicant \u2019s contact rights further than decided by the lower court , in particular due to the negative reactions of GPE , during and after the meetings .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , compulsory public care is to be provided if there is a clear risk of impairment of the health and development of a person DATE due to ill - treatment , exploitation , lack of care or any other condition in the home and if the necessary care can not be provided with the consent of the child \u2019s guardian . The decision to place a child in public care is made by ORG following an application from ORG ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of GPE ( Socialtj\u00e4nstlagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereafter the \u201c LAW \u201d ) provides that particular attention must be given to the best interests of the child when measures within the social services affect him or her . Likewise , LAW of the DATE LAW states that the best interests of the young person shall be decisive when decisions are made under LAW . Moreover , LAW of LAW prescribes that the young person \u2019s point of view shall , as far as possible , be clarified and that the young person \u2019s will shall be taken into account , with due consideration to his or her age and maturity .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW of LAW , ORG decides on the details of the care , in particular , how the care is to be arranged and where the young person is to live . Moreover , under section DATE , the council shall ensure that the young person \u2019s need for contact with his or her parents or other guardians is met to the utmost possible extent . If necessary , the council may decide how this contact is to be arranged . In the preparatory works to LAW PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , it is noted that the provisions on contact restrictions are to be applied restrictively . ORG must have strong reasons to decide on contact restrictions between a young person and his or her parents . However , it can happen that the parents intervene in the care in an inappropriate manner . Their personal situation , for instance serious abuse or a grave mental illness , may be such that they should not see their child for a limited period of time .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , care outside a young person \u2019s home shall be provided either in a family home or in a home for care and residence . Moreover , the care should be designed to promote the affinity between the young person and his or her relatives and others closely connected to him or her , as well as contact with his or her home surroundings .", "CARDINAL . Contact restrictions shall be reviewed DATE by the ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . Appeal against the council \u2019s decision in this respect lies to the administrative courts ( section CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
