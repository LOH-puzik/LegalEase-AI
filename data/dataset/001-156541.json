The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and several other ethnic NORP on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation and planning an assassination attempt on PERSON , the president of GPE , in the course of his visit to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant left GPE and entered GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG placed the applicant on the international wanted list .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , following the applicant \u2019s arrest in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG of GPE requested that its NORP counterpart extradite the applicant to GPE on several charges including participation in an illegal armed group and planning an assassination attempt on a public figure . The request contained assurances that the applicant \u2019s defence rights would be respected , that he would not be subjected to treatment contrary to LAW , and would not be sentenced to the death penalty .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s arrest in GPE , the NORP human rights organisation \u201c ORG with Political Prisoners \u201d issued a statement recalling that it had previously declared the applicant to be a person persecuted for political reasons because it believed that the criminal case against him for the planning of an assassination attempt on PERSON was fabricated and politically motivated .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG of Ukraine ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) decided to extradite the applicant to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the extradition decision . He noted , in particular , that if extradited he would be deprived of the right to be tried in GPE and compensation for the damage caused to NORP victims of his crimes in GPE would be hindered , and that he was being persecuted by NORP authorities for political reasons . He also noted that proceedings concerning his asylum request in GPE were pending ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that he faced the risk of ill - treatment contrary to LAW , unfair trial and the death penalty in GPE . He referred to PERSON letter and the statement of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the Odessa ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) examined the applicant \u2019s appeal in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer and upheld the decision . It found , in particular , that in the light of the assurances provided by the NORP authorities and the nature of the accusations against him , the applicant \u2019s allegations concerning the risk of the death penalty , ill - treatment and politically motivated prosecution were unsubstantiated . The court also held that the publications about the occurrence of torture in GPE in general did not prove that the applicant personally would be ill - treated . The court stated that the decision of DATE to dismiss the applicant \u2019s request for asylum ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) proved that the applicant was not a permanent resident of GPE , which would prevent his extradition under domestic law . The court took no decision concerning the applicant \u2019s detention pending extradition .", "CARDINAL .

NORP In DATE a number of media outlets reported that the applicant was serving as leader of a battalion fighting on the side of ORG forces in the eastern regions of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for political asylum with ORG of GPE ( \u201c the Migration Service \u201d ) , maintaining that he had never been involved in any terrorist activities and that his criminal prosecution in GPE was political repression in disguise . In particular , he was a member of a prominent family which used to have considerable influence in GPE before PERSON came to power ; his father used to chair an oil company in GPE and his uncle used to be the Speaker of ORG . Following Ramzan Kadyrov \u2019s rise to power , the family had been driven out of GPE . The applicant had publicly shared his dissatisfaction with the policies of PERSON and the NORP authorities in respect of GPE . His political views , in particular his support for a free and independent GPE , and his being a personal enemy of PERSON , were the real reasons for his persecution by the NORP authorities .

In a report prepared following the examination of the applicant \u2019s asylum application , a head of section of ORG of ORG recommended that the application be refused . He found that the applicant \u2019s submissions concerning threats allegedly made against him in GPE in connection with negative statements about PERSON were not credible since he had been an ordinary citizen and had not been a member of any political group and that the applicant had been misleading the NORP authorities in order to delay his extradition to GPE . There were also indications of his being involved in terrorist activity , in particular because : he had shown interest in literature associated with the PERSON version of NORP ; his life partner PERSON had also displayed PERSON tendencies ; he had acknowledged that he had had links with persons prosecuted for terrorist activities .

On DATE the NORP Regional Department of Refugee Affairs refused to initiate asylum proceedings in respect of the applicant , having found that his application was manifestly inadmissible . The ORG noted , in particular , that owing to the applicant \u2019s arrival in GPE in DATE , the DATE application lodged after his arrest was time - barred and that in any event his allegations of being a victim of political repression were ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the decision of DATE before ORG .
