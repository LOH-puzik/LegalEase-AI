He is the general manager and a shareholder of a building company . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE ( GPE ) .", "In DATE the applicant arrived in GPE . In DATE and DATE he travelled for short periods to GPE . In DATE he married PERSON , a NORP citizen . He is the father of CARDINAL children , born in DATE and DATE .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and subsequently taken into detention with a view to extradition ( Auslieferungshaft ) . The applicant \u2019s arrest was based on an international arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE issued by a court in GPE , GPE ( GPE ) . The applicant was suspected of having raped a woman in DATE in GPE .", "On DATE ORG in GPE submitted to the NORP judicial authorities a request for the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) ordered the applicant \u2019s continued detention with a view to extradition . Subsequently , the court ordered the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE and found that there were no obstacles to it . The prosecution of the applicant had not yet become time - barred and concerned an extraditable offence . Furthermore , the applicant was not a NORP citizen . The applicant had denied having committed the offence he was charged with . However , whether or not the accusation was well - founded was not an issue to be addressed in the extradition proceedings , and there was no indication that the request for extradition had been made arbitrarily . Regarding the necessity of the applicant \u2019s detention with a view to extradition , the court noted that the risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding existed . In case of a conviction he risked a severe sentence . Furthermore , when he had been arrested in GPE in the context of the criminal proceedings against him in DATE , he had been released on bail and had absconded .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for having his extradition declared unlawful and rejected the request for release from detention with a view to extradition . ORG found that since its decision of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s situation had not changed . Neither the fact that the applicant had been recognised as refugee by the NORP authorities nor the fact that he was married to a NORP citizen made him a NORP citizen within the meaning of LAW ) . Therefore he could not rely on the prohibition to extradite NORP citizens provided for in LAW .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) . He submitted that the prohibition to extradite NORP citizens should also apply to him because , although not being a NORP citizen , he had close personal and family links to GPE", "On DATE ORG declined to accept the appeal for adjudication on the ground that it did not have a sufficient prospect of success ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
