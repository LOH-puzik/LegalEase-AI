SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Mrs PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE a social welfare district committee ( sociala distriktsn\u00e4mnden ) in GPE applied for a compulsory care order regarding the applicant pursuant to the provisions of ORG ( lagen om v\u00e5rd av missbrukare i vissa fall , CARDINAL , hereinafter called LAW ) . The committee produced and submitted an investigation report of DATE from which it appeared inter alia that the applicant had been sober for DATE but that during DATE he had often relapsed into serious periodic abuse of alcohol , drinking CARDINAL or three bottles of strong spirits a day . The last period of abuse commenced in DATE with intervals of DATE . During DATE and the first part of DATE the applicant had terminated ongoing treatment for his abuse on several occasions and he had been detoxified CARDINAL times .", "The committee invoked CARDINAL medical certificates dated CARDINAL , DATE and DATE DATE respectively , stating , amongst other things , that the applicant declined treatment for his abuse , that there was a risk of psychosis , that his blood pressure had substantially increased due to the abuse causing a risk of acute cerebral bleeding , and that he was in great need of compulsory care under LAW .", "In the medical report of CARDINAL DATE it was inter alia stated :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] had been known at the clinic since DATE . He had been admitted to the clinic CARDINAL times since DATE . In addition , he had come to the emergency ward several times but had refused to stay . [ The applicant ] was in contact with Dr. PERSON at the psychiatric ward of ORG due to his misuse . [ The applicant ] refused treatment and help . He suffered from high blood pressure , which was substantially increased due to the misuse and caused a risk of acute cerebral bleeding . A test showed signs of liver damage . [ The applicant ] was in a very destructive phase of misuse , he was very aggressive and there was a risk of psychosis . He was in great need of compulsory care under LAW . \u201d", "The applicant submitted a medical certificate of DATE stating notably that compulsory care had had no positive effect on him and that it could rather result in a deterioration of his situation .", "On DATE ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE held an oral hearing in the presence of the applicant , who opposed the application . He stated that substantial personal setbacks had caused him to resume his abuse . However , his personal situation was stable at the time of the application and he had been sober for DATE at the time of the hearing . He wanted to go to a recreation home in order to eat and do physical exercises .", "On DATE ORG ordered his compulsory care for the following reasons :", "\u201c Even considering [ the applicant \u2019s ] statement that there has been a break in his abuse prior to the oral hearing , the [ court ] finds that it has been shown that he continuously abuses alcohol and that he is in need of care in order to give up the abuse . It has been ascertained that as a result of the abuse [ the applicant ] exposes his physical and mental health to serious danger . [ The court ] also finds that by the abuse [ the applicant ] imperils his living conditions in other respects ; there is particularly a risk that he will be forced out of the labour market . Consequently , he obviously risks having his life destroyed .", "As regards the question whether the need for care can be met according to the [ DATE ORG ] or in any other way , the following is noted . [ The court ] finds that the measure proposed by [ the applicant ] himself , a stay at the recreation home [ GPE ] , obviously can not be considered as the care needed in his circumstances . The facts of the case show that attempted voluntary care has failed because [ the applicant ] has lacked the capacity , and periodically the determination , to undergo care . In view of the history of [ the applicant \u2019s ] abuse and the very serious abuse he has been addicted to since DATE , a shorter period of sobriety can not be considered as having altered the prospects for voluntary care . Nor does [ the court ] find any other reason to believe there are such prospects . In conclusion , [ the court ] finds that even if [ the applicant ] now wants to give up his abuse , the necessary care can not be ensured voluntarily .", "For these reasons [ the court ] finds that there are grounds for providing [ the applicant ] with care pursuant to [ LAW ] . The application is therefore granted . The care order shall be immediately enforceable . \u201d", "On DATE at CARDINAL the applicant was taken from his home by CARDINAL police officers . It is in dispute whether he was notified that this would occur beforehand . According to the police records it took TIME to bring him to a police custody centre in GPE . Shortly thereafter ORG ( PERSON ) brought him to a so - called ORG institution . On arrival at the ORG institution he was placed in a closed ward for DATE as this was deemed necessary in order for the treatment to commence .", "On DATE the social welfare committee proposed in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW that the applicant be transferred to a care programme at another institution . However , the applicant chose to stay at the ORG institution to begin a programme of the LOC model . He lost interest in the programme after DATE . Thereafter he agreed to a treatment at a care facility centre for alcoholics in the GPE area and he was granted leave for DATE in order to visit the centre . Subsequently , on DATE he absconded .", "Having relapsed into drinking , on DATE he returned voluntarily to the ORG institution where he was placed in a closed ward until DATE . He re - absconded DATE latter .", "In the meantime the applicant had appealed against the care order . He argued that he would be forced out of the labour market if he was not released from the ORG institution . He further maintained that it was unreasonable that , being a socially stable person , he should undergo expensive and unnecessary care . He was not motivated by the intended care and he considered it degrading . He was shocked to be transferred , allegedly handcuffed , by the police on DATE to ORG .", "On DATE ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE held an oral hearing in the absence of the applicant , who at that time twice had failed to attend as summoned . By judgment of DATE the appellate court upheld the care order , making the same assessment as the lower court .", "Subsequently , the applicant several times returned to and was discharged from the ORG institution in order to participate in treatment , which allowed him to stay in his own home at TIME . Thus , he was subject to compulsory care during the periods DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE , and finally between CARDINAL and DATE . Thereafter , he was formally and permanently discharged from the ORG institution .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . He invoked the medical certificate dated DATE . On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused leave to appeal .", "The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c All care intended to help individual persons to discontinue their abuse of alcohol , narcotics or volatile solvents must be guided by the goals of the public services as defined in LAW ORG , CARDINAL ) .
