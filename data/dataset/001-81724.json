GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The application was lodged with the ORG by Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON and in the name of Mr PERSON . Mr PERSON and PERSON , born in DATE and DATE respectively , are NORP nationals and reside in GPE . Mr PERSON , who was born in DATE and died on CARDINAL DATE , was a GPE national . PERSON is a NORP national and resides in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by Ms S. Reppenhagen , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The respondent Government are represented by their agent , PERSON ORG , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "During the Second World War Mr Poznanski , PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON late husband PERSON , then NORP nationals , were subjected to forced labour in the ORG concentration camp which was operated by ORG ( ORG ) . The forced labourers had to carry out physically hard work for TIME a week without receiving adequate nutrition . Once they were no longer physically capable of working , the forced labourers were sent to the FAC - Birkenau extermination camp to be killed .", "PERSON , PERSON and PERSON PERSON , who are of NORP faith , and PERSON late husband had been arrested by the NORP army following the occupation of GPE . Having been detained in several concentration camps , they were finally transferred to the ORG - Monowitz concentration camp , where they remained until their liberation by ORG in DATE .", "Following the end of the Second World War , the allied forces split up ORG inter alia into the companies ORG , ORG and ORG . Legal successor to the corporation was ORG in liquidation ( ORG in GPE , \u201c FAC \u201d ) .", "GPE , after its foundation on CARDINAL DATE , did not establish any compensation schemes for forced labourers .", "Under LAW on GPE \u2019s ORG ) of DATE , the regulation of compensation claims was deferred until the final settlement of reparation .", "Subsequently many actions brought by former forced labourers against NORP companies were rejected with reference to LAW . Nevertheless , GPE paid compensation to victims of the NORP regime , mostly to those who were living in GPE , GPE and other GPE , in particular pursuant to the provisions of LAW ( Bundesentsch\u00e4digungs - gesetz ) , which entered into force on DATE . It provides inter alia compensation for the detention in a concentration camp and the resulting damage to the health of the former detainees . Forced labour as such was not covered by the existing legislation .", "PERSON received payments of CARDINAL ORG in DATE and CARDINAL ORG in DATE , as well as a DATE pension of CARDINAL ORG as of CARDINAL DATE . In DATE he received additional payments of CARDINAL and CARDINAL ORG and his DATE pension was increased from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DEM . As of DATE the applicant has been in receipt of a DATE pension of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "PERSON received a payment of CARDINAL DEM in DATE .", "On DATE PERSON and the Conference on NORP Material Claims against GPE ( \u201c NORP Claims Conference \u201d ) entered into a friendly settlement during the course of a lawsuit brought by a former forced labourer ( the so - called PERSON case ) . Pursuant to that settlement PERSON undertook to pay CARDINAL million DEM to its former forced labourers . PERSON and Mr Silberstein received CARDINAL ORG each under that settlement . Although the settlement stipulated that the recipients were to waive all further claims against PERSON , it is not clear whether the applicants signed such a waiver .", "After DATE GPE paid lump sums to several ORG , which then created funds for victims of the NORP regime . GPE paid CARDINAL ORG to a NORP foundation , which then granted compensation to former detainees of concentration camps .", "That NORP foundation granted PERSON late husband benefits amounting to CARDINAL new Polish zlotys ( ORG ) on DATE and CARDINAL ORG on DATE .", "However , individual compensation for forced labour as such was still not provided by GPE . Many of those former forced labourers brought actions against NORP companies , in particular class action suits in GPE . Against that background the Government of GPE and ORG of GPE concluded a treaty that envisaged the creation of the foundation \u201c PERSON , Responsibility and Future \u201d ( Stiftung \u201c GPE , Verantwortung und FAC \u201d - hereinafter called \u201c Foundation \u201d ) which would provide individual compensation for former forced labourers .", "GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , ORG , legal representatives of former forced labourers and representatives of NORP industry had participated in those negotiations .", "In DATE PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON late husband brought actions for compensation for non - pecuniary damages and actions for restitution of the unjustified enrichment ( ORG der ungerechtfertigten GPE ) against the PERSON requesting between CARDINAL ORG ( CARDINAL ORG ) and CARDINAL DEM ( CARDINAL ORG ) each .", "On DATE the \u201c Law on the Creation of the ORG \u201c Remembrance , Responsibility and Future \u201d ( Gesetz PERSON \u201c GPE , PERSON DATE hereinafter called \u201c LAW \u201d ) entered into force ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . The ORG was subsequently set up and both the Government of GPE and the NORP companies provided for the ORG \u2019s funding . PERSON did not make any contributions .", "ORG rejected the actions stating that claims against PERSON were excluded by LAW .", "Rejecting the PERSON appeal the court held that their claims were excluded by LAW . Nevertheless , the court came to the conclusion that some of their claims had not been time - barred when LAW entered into force . At the outset the court recalled that the statute of limitations ( Verj\u00e4hrung ) for claims relating to forced labour during the Second World War had been suspended ( gehemmt ) by LAW . That suspension had been lifted with the conclusion of LAW on the Final Settlement with respect to GPE of CARDINAL DATE ( the socalled TwoPlusFour Treaty ) .", "As regards the claims for compensation for non - pecuniary damages the court applied a prescription period of DATE , holding that the claims had become time - barred in DATE . In respect of their claims of restitution of the unjustified enrichment ( ORG der ungerechtfertigten GPE ) the court found that , contrary to the case - law of ORG ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , those claims were not time - barred . Instead of applying a prescription period of DATE as ORG had done , ORG applied a prescription period of DATE .", "In its reasoning the court stressed that before LAW had entered into force the question whether claims for forced labour were time - barred had not been finally settled . Leave to appeal on points of law was refused .", "ORG rejected the complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law . The court stated that ORG holding that claims of restitution of the unjustified enrichment were not time - barred deviated from the existing case - law of ORG . However , the court found it unnecessary to rule on that issue because the claims were excluded by LAW in any event .", "During the proceedings before ORG Mr PERSON died and his widow pursued the proceedings . ORG refused to admit the constitutional complaint against the aforementioned decisions and LAW of LAW , holding that they did not violate the ORG rights under LAW ( right of property ) . The court found that LAW was applicable , because the complainants had had claims for restitution of the unjustified enrichment prior to ORG entry into force , as held by ORG ; the findings of which were binding as a starting point for the constitutional review insofar the question of prescription was concerned . ORG went on to say that although there had been an interference with the ORG right of property , it did not constitute an expropriation . It found that the exclusion of claims under LAW was not undertaken for public purposes ( ORG \u00f6ffentlicher ORG ) . On the contrary , the exclusion of claims was meant to balance the purely private interests of the former forced labourers on the one hand and NORP industry on the other hand . Therefore , section CARDINAL of the Foundation Law determined the extent of the right of property and its limitations ( Inhalts- PERSON ) . The court concluded that LAW was an overall settlement ( Gesamtregelung ) which had struck a fair balance between those competing interests . The court held that both the creation of a compensation scheme on the one hand and the achievement of legal certainty for NORP companies and the ORG on the other hand pursued legitimate interests . The court acknowledged that the amount of compensation under the ORG \u2019s scheme was in some cases inferior to the claims the former forced labourers had had under NORP civil law . However , the court pointed out that the overall settlement as set up by LAW had several advantages that balanced its shortcomings . First , the court noted that the Foundation PERSON created legal certainty for former forced labourers by replacing their claims against companies which were bankrupt or no longer existed with claims against a foundation endowed with sufficient funds . Moreover , ORG highlighted that , before LAW had entered into force , it had been open whether ORG would change its case - law regarding the prescription of claims for forced labour . Hence the former forced labourers did not have to bring proceedings before the NORP courts , which would have entailed considerable financial risks and would have been time - consuming . In this respect the court stressed that all former forced labourers were well advanced in DATE and that only the ORG \u2019s compensation scheme guaranteed that they would receive compensation within their lifetime .", "The decision was served on DATE .", "On an unknown date PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON , as her late husband \u2019s heir , were granted payments under LAW amounting to the equivalent of CARDINAL ORG each .", "On DATE Mr PERSON died .", "According to the preliminary sixth report of ORG on the activities of the ORG , which covers its activities until DATE , CARDINAL applications for compensation had been lodged with the ORG \u2019s partner organisations . In CARDINAL cases the partner organisations rendered positive decisions , while CARDINAL requests were denied . CARDINAL cases were still pending before the partner ORG appeals boards . All partner organisations combined had awarded payments amounting to MONEY ORG . In CARDINAL cases the partner organisations were still in the process of making the payments .", "According to the judgment of ORG of DATE , claims against a company for the restitution of the unjustified enrichment or claims for compensation for non - pecuniary damages for forced labour carried out during the Second World War were time - barred . The court found that tort claims were prescribed after DATE , while claims for restitution of the unjustified enrichment became time - barred after either DATE ( no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Decisions of ORG in ORG ( BGHZ ) vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "In decisions rendered after DATE several ORG held that the statute of limitations for claims relating to forced labour during the Second World War had been suspended ( gehemmt ) by LAW . That suspension had been lifted with the conclusion of LAW on the Final Settlement with respect to GPE of DATE ( the socalled TwoPlusFour Treaty ) because that treaty was considered a final settlement of reparation . However , applying the prescription periods ( PERSON ) as determined by ORG in its aforementioned judgment , the courts concluded that the claims against the respondent companies had become time - barred before the actions were brought ( see the judgment of ORG of DATE , no . CARDINAL U CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; the decision of ORG of ORG of DATE , no . CARDINAL W CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; the decision of ORG of DATE , no . CARDINAL W CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; decision of ORG of DATE , no . QUANTITY ) .", "There has never been a final judgment confirming the existence of claims arising from forced labour carried out during the Second World War .", "The Foundation Law stipulates that the ORG should be endowed with MONEY DEM ( MONEY ORG ) , to be provided equally by the Government of GPE and NORP companies . The sum of CARDINAL ORG was intended for the compensation of forced labour . The remaining funds inter alia aimed at compensating the loss of property or were granted as humanitarian aid to ORG and ORG on ORG which finance social programmes for Holocaust survivors .", "All NORP companies which exploited forced labourers during the Second World War are protected by LAW , regardless of whether they actually contributed to the ORG .", "Requests for compensation are not processed by the ORG itself , but by its regional partner organisations in several NORP countries . The highest amount of compensation - for forced labour in a concentration camp - is CARDINAL DEM ( CARDINAL ORG ) . That amount can be reduced if the funds do not suffice to fully compensate all individuals entitled under LAW . The compensation is made in CARDINAL instalments . First , CARDINAL % or PERCENT of the total sum is paid out , while the second instalment is made after all requests have been processed , provided that the funds suffice . As a matter of principle , only the forced labourers themselves are entitled to compensation . Heirs are only eligible if the forced labourer died after DATE .", "According to section CARDINAL of the Foundation Law all further claims against the NORP ORG or NORP companies are excluded . That provision reads as follows :", "\u201c Exclusions from Claims", "( CARDINAL ) Payments from public funds , including social security , and from NORP business enterprises for injustice suffered under ORG as defined in LAW may be claimed only under the terms of this PERSON . Any further claims in connection with ORG injustices are excluded . This applies also to cases in which claims have been transferred to third persons by operation of law , transition , or a legal transaction .", "( CARDINAL ) On receipt of a payment under this PERSON , each claimant shall provide a statement ... irrevocably renouncing , without prejudice to Sentences DATE , after receipt of a payment under this PERSON any further claim against the authorities for forced labour and property damage , all claims against NORP enterprises in connection with ORG injustice , and forced - labour claims against GPE or NORP enterprises . The renunciation becomes effective upon receipt of a payment under this PERSON . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
