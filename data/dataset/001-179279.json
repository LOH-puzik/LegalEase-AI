The applicant arrived in GPE in DATE . In DATE , and again in DATE , his asylum requests were refused by the competent domestic authorities . In DATE the applicant was granted a residence permit , which was subsequently prolonged until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr GPE ) investigated the applicant owing to his alleged ties to the \u201c radical NORP scene \u201d . In DATE the applicant was ordered not to leave GPE , as it was suspected that he was going to travel to GPE to join the so - called \u201c NORP State \u201d . A request to lift this order was denied in DATE as the security agencies possessed information indicating that the applicant was still in contact with the \u201c radical NORP scene \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the police obtained intelligence about the applicant , including records of online chats in which the applicant stated that he would be willing to participate in an \u201c operation \u201d in GPE . Subsequently the public prosecutor \u2019s office launched an official investigation on the grounds of \u201c encouraging the commission of a serious violent offence endangering the state \u201d and the applicant \u2019s flat was searched . During the search several smartphones , tablets and other devices were seized . On the devices CARDINAL pictures and CARDINAL videos were found which showed violent acts in an NORP context and also included a manual for building explosive devices .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s deportation to GPE , as he constituted a threat to national security . He was suspected of being willing to participate in or carry out a terrorist attack in GPE . The decision was based on intelligence gathered by the security agencies ( see paragraphs PERSON and CARDINAL above ) . Although the authorities concluded that he had not yet reached the planning stage , he nonetheless constituted an abstract danger for society . This abstract risk was sufficient to overrule the applicant \u2019s right to respect for private and family life , given the fact that he had grown up and lived in GPE for DATE . Moreover , there was no risk for the applicant under LAW as the NORP authorities would not be informed about the intelligence that had been gathered and it was up to him not to join the \u201c radical NORP scene \u201d in GPE after his deportation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the decision before ORG and applied for an interim measure suspending his deportation for the duration of the main proceedings . During the interim proceedings ORG requested further information from ORG concerning the expected treatment of the applicant after deportation to GPE . Based on conversations with employees of the NORP ORG Committee Against Torture \u201d ORG responded that it could be expected that the applicant would be questioned and monitored by security agencies , but that it would be highly unlikely that he would be pre - emptively tortured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a detailed decision of CARDINAL pages , ORG refused to grant the interim measure . It concluded that the assessment of the security risk for the applicant was in essence correct . However , unlike ORG , the court considered that the NORP authorities would be acquainted with the reasons for the applicant \u2019s deportation . Therefore , due to the risk of torture and ill - treatment the applicant could not be deported to his home region of ORG . However , he could be deported to another part of GPE . After considering several current reports on the situation , the court held that there were no specific indications that the applicant would be detained or tortured elsewhere in GPE or be forcibly brought to PERSON on the basis of his previous conduct in GPE . It found that the publicly available reports were not applicable to the present case as they concerned persons who were in CARDINAL way or another connected to the conflicts in GPE and GPE , which the applicant was not . The most relevant information stemmed from ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which had provided information specific to the present case to ORG . According to this information the applicant would probably be questioned and monitored by security agencies in GPE , but it was highly unlikely that he would be tortured . Consequently , the court concluded that even though it could be expected that the applicant would be closely monitored , any further action by the NORP authorities would depend on the applicant \u2019s future conduct in GPE . As regards DATE , the court held that even though the applicant would face certain problems due to not having family in other parts of GPE and everyday discrimination based on his NORP ethnicity , he should still be able to settle in the suburbs of GPE and find a job , since he had a basic knowledge of the NORP language .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG \u2013 in a reasoned decision \u2013 refused to grant an interim measure or to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication . While criticising that ORG had not assessed in sufficient depth whether the applicant could live and find work outside of LOC without facing the risk of inhuman or degrading treatment at the hands of the NORP authorities , it pointed out that ORG had nonetheless correctly based its decision on current reports concerning the situation of persons of NORP ethnicity returning to GPE and information requested from ORG and ORG . It therefore concluded that ORG had considered all possible risks the applicant would face and had also correctly found that the applicant could be deported to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The main proceedings before ORG are still pending .", "CARDINAL . The deportation of a so - called \u201c PERSON \u201d ( a potential offender , who poses a threat to national security ) is regulated in section CARDINALa of the Residence Act ( Aufenthaltsgesetz ) , which reads :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The supreme Land authority may , based on an assessment of the facts and without a prior expulsion order , issue a deportation order for a foreigner in order to avert a special danger to the security of GPE or a terrorist threat . The deportation order shall be immediately enforceable ; no notice of intention to deport shall be necessary .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Human Rights Watch report \u201c \u2018 Invisible War\u2019 \u2012 GPE \u2019s ORG to the Dagestan Insurgency \u201d of DATE outlines several human rights violations during counter - insurgency operations in ORG , including arbitrary detention , torture and forced disappearances . It also states that the authorities have cast an excessively wide net by essentially treating Salafis as criminal suspects without charging them with any specific offence .", "CARDINAL . A report drawn up by ORG in DATE ( \u201c PERSON : PERSON dagestanischer Terrorverd\u00e4chtiger au\u00dferhalb NORP \u201d , DATE ) describes the situation of family members of alleged terrorists involved in the conflict in ORG . According to it , family members were increasingly the targets of persecution by the NORP authorities even outside of LOC . The methods employed by the NORP authorities included arbitrary arrests and criminal prosecution , and disappearances .", "CARDINAL . An updated report by ORG regarding the human rights situation in GPE ( \u201c GPE \u2013 Tch\u00e9tch\u00e9nie \u2013 Mise \u00e0 jour : situation des droits humains \u201d , CARDINAL DATE ) illustrates several examples of NORP , with a prior connection to the conflict in GPE , having been detained , tortured and killed after returning to GPE . The ORG also reports that the NORP and NORP authorities cooperate closely and that several persons had been forcibly returned to GPE from other parts of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG in its report \u201c ORG and GPE : An Exported Jihad ? \u201d of DATE describes grave human rights violations , including enforced disappearances , summary executions and the widespread occurrence of torture in GPE and GPE . It also describes the preventive registration of those suspected of adherence to fundamentalist strands of ORG as one of the key control methods across LOC . After incidents such as clashes between security forces and insurgents , or terrorist acts , the individuals on these lists were faced with the risk of detention and interrogation , which often involved violent or degrading methods ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
