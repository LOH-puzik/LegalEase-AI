The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a solicitor in GPE was arrested and charged with a number of offences , including inciting paramilitaries to murder and perverting the course of justice . The case arose out of the covert recording of his consultations with clients at GPE police station . As a direct consequence of the criminal proceedings , solicitors in GPE became aware that their private consultations with detainees in police stations and prisons could be the subject of covert surveillance . Thereafter , solicitors attending detainees in police stations and prisons began to seek assurances from the police that their consultations would not be the subject of such surveillance .", "CARDINAL . When the police refused to give assurances , judicial review proceedings were initiated on the basis that there had been a breach of the common law right to legal and professional privilege , the statutory right to a private consultation with a lawyer , and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In the case of ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINALA the Divisional Court of ORG in GPE found that , despite the express statutory right to private consultations , the covert surveillance of lawyer - client consultations was permitted by ORG ( \u201c RIPA \u201d ) . However , ORG provided for CARDINAL principal surveillance schemes : intrusive surveillance and directed surveillance . At the time of the hearing , covert surveillance of legal consultations was being treated as directed surveillance , which was the least restrictive of the CARDINAL schemes . ORG held that the fundamental right of a detained person to consult a legal adviser privately necessitated an enhanced authorisation scheme and that protections afforded by the directed as opposed to the intrusive surveillance scheme offered insufficient protection . If the surveillance of consultations between legal advisers and clients in police custody was to be lawful for the purposes of LAW , the safeguards for the carrying out of intrusive surveillance had to apply .", "CARDINAL . The applicants in these judicial review proceedings appealed against the court \u2019s ruling that the surveillance was permitted by the domestic legislation . The appeal went to ORG , where it was referred to as Re McE ( GPE ) [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL . ORG agreed with ORG that although the provisions of ORG could override , inter alia , legal professional privilege , the higher level of authority necessary for an intrusive surveillance warrant was required rather than the directed surveillance warrants that had , until then , been issued .", "CARDINAL . As ORG ( \u201c PSNI \u201d ) had not appealed against ORG ruling that the use of the directed surveillance scheme had breached LAW , ORG criticised the Secretary of ORG for not having taken any steps to ensure that covert surveillance of legal consultations was not treated as directed surveillance .", "CARDINAL . Following the decision of ORG in Re McE the Regulation of Investigatory Powers ( Extension of Authorisation Provisions : Legal Consultations ) Order DATE ( \u201c the DATE Order \u201d ) was adopted and on DATE a revised LAW ( \u201c the Revised Code \u201d ) came into effect . Pursuant to the DATE Order , directed surveillance of consultations between a detainee and his or her professional legal adviser , representative or medical practitioner in connection with legal proceedings was to be treated , for the purposes of RIPA , as intrusive surveillance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in connection with the murder of a Police Constable believed to have been killed by dissident NORP .", "CARDINAL . When first arrested the applicant was assessed by ORG as a \u201c vulnerable person \u201d within the meaning of LAW . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of that Code of Practice , he could not be interviewed , save in exceptional circumstances , in the absence of an \u201c appropriate adult \u201d . In the case of a person who was mentally vulnerable , an appropriate adult could be a relative or guardian , or a person experienced in dealing with mentally disordered or mentally vulnerable people . However , prior to being seen by either a solicitor or an appropriate adult , the applicant asked to speak to the officers in charge of the investigation \u201c off the record \u201d . He was interviewed by police officers in the absence of a solicitor or an appropriate adult and during the course of that interview he gave information which led to the recovery of the gun used in the Constable \u2019s murder .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained in custody for DATE . During this time he was twice seen by a Consultant Psychiatrist and on each occasion he was assessed as being vulnerable and requiring the presence of an appropriate adult . Also during this time his solicitor obtained an assurance from the ORG that his consultations with the applicant would not be subject to covert surveillance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with withholding information about the ORG \u2019s murder .", "CARDINAL . Following the charge the applicant was detained in custody on the ground that if released he would be at risk of harm from dissident NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on bail on DATE . He was arrested and questioned on a further occasion in DATE but was subsequently released without charge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested for a third time in connection with the Constable \u2019s murder . Following his arrest his solicitor again sought an assurance from the ORG that his consultations would not be subjected to covert surveillance . The ORG informed him that", "\u201c [ they could ] neither confirm nor deny whether any form of covert surveillance has been conducted in any instance . Covert surveillance is regulated by ORG , related statutory instruments and the Revised [ Covert Surveillance ] Code of Practice \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review of the ORG \u2019s refusal to give an undertaking that his consultations with his solicitor would not be subjected to covert surveillance . In particular , he alleged that the grounds upon which the authorisation of such surveillance would be appropriate were not sufficiently clearly defined and that the guidance concerning the securing and destruction of legally privileged confidential information was not sufficiently clear or precise .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was granted permission to apply for judicial review . In granting permission , the court directed that any subsequent consultations with his solicitor and his medical adviser should not be subject to covert surveillance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had his first consultation with a Consultant Psychiatrist .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released without charge on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The charge of withholding evidence appears to have concluded without trial .", "CARDINAL . The hearing of the judicial review application took place before a ORG of ORG in GPE on DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . In dismissing the claim , the court relied on PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE , which found that the regime under Part I of RIPA was compatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . Although it noted that PERSON was concerned only with Part I of RIPA , the court considered that the reasoning expressed was \u201c very relevant in view of the parallels between Part I and Part II of the surveillance legal regimes \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court found , in particular , that reading ORG , the DATE Order and LAW together it was clear that a surveillance operation could only properly be justified if it was a truly proportionate response to a real risk posed by the individual who was the subject of the surveillance , and if the potential usefulness of the surveillance was demonstrably shown . As ORG had indicated in PERSON , the requirement of foreseeability did not require an exhaustive definition of all conduct that might justify a decision on , for example , national security grounds , and similar reasoning applied in the present case . Consequently , the court held that the wording in LAW was sufficiently clear .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s second allegation , the court accepted that the statutory provisions under Part I of RIPA , which had been considered by ORG in PERSON , were more detailed , prescriptive and precise than those in Part II . However , taking together the DATE Order , LAW and ORG , the arrangements in place for the use , retention and destruction of retained material in the context of legal consultations was compliant with the LAW persons in custody . Moreover , as LAW made it clear that material subject to legal professional privilege was not admissible in court and should be safeguarded by the taking of steps to ensure that it did not prejudice any criminal or civil proceedings , a breach of LAW would not occur . While there was a risk of a potential \u201c chill factor \u201d ( insofar as clients might be less than frank with their solicitors if they were concerned that they were under covert surveillance ) , the court considered that the revised LAW was sufficiently detailed and precise to reassure those in custody that , save in exceptional circumstances , their consultations with lawyers would be in private .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court observed that the special considerations which applied to consultations with lawyers or doctors did not apply in the case of meetings with an appropriate adult . It therefore followed that surveillance of such meetings could be authorised as directed surveillance rather than intrusive surveillance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard an application for leave to appeal to ORG . Leave to appeal was refused although the court certified CARDINAL questions of law of general public importance . These were as follows :", "\u201c a. Do the current arrangements for authorisation of covert surveillance of consultations between a detained person and ( i ) his / her solicitor ( ii ) his / her medical practitioner and/or ( iii ) an appropriate adult violate LAW in as much as they permit the covert surveillance of legally privileged consultations and the retention of material deriving from legally privileged consultations ?", "b. Do the current arrangements for authorisation of covert surveillance of consultations between a detained person and ( i ) his / her solicitor ( ii ) his / her medical practitioner and/or ( iii ) an appropriate adult violate LAW as a result of:-", "( i ) a lack of precision and clarity in the guidance governing the authorisation of such surveillance ; and/or", "( ii ) inadequate guidance as to how and when legally privileged material obtained from such surveillance should be handled , stored , used and destroyed .", "c. Is ORG Service Procedure \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d within the meaning of LAW ?", "d. Do the current arrangements for authorisation of covert surveillance of consultations between a detained person and an appropriate adult violate LAW because such surveillance can be authorised as directed rather than intrusive surveillance ? \u201d", "CARDINAL .
