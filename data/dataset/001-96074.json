SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression -{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression)", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants live in GPE . They were employed as delivery men by the company P. , against which they brought several sets of proceedings in employment tribunals . In DATE they set up the trade union N.A.A. to defend their interests and those of the other delivery staff , and sat on its executive committee .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trade union published a DATE news bulletin . On the cover of the bulletin for DATE a cartoon with speech bubbles showed a caricature of the human resources manager , PERSON , sitting behind a desk under which a person on all fours could be seen from behind , together with , to CARDINAL side , GPE and PERSON , also employees of the company P. , who were watching the scene while waiting to take their turn to satisfy the manager like their colleague . Inside the bulletin were CARDINAL articles which denounced , in crude and vulgar terms , the fact that those CARDINAL individuals had testified in favour of the company P. in proceedings that the applicants had brought against their employer . The bulletin was distributed among the workers and displayed on the notice board of the trade union N.A.A. that was located on the company \u2019s LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the company notified the applicants of their dismissal on grounds of serious misconduct .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged that decision before ORG no . CARDINAL of GPE , which , in a judgment of DATE , dismissed their claims and found that the dismissals were justified , in accordance with LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL et CARDINAL ( c ) of ORG . The tribunal took the view that the company \u2019s decision to dismiss the applicants had been based on a genuine and serious cause , namely the publication and display on a notice board inside the company of a cartoon with speech bubbles and CARDINAL articles which were offensive and impugned the dignity of the persons concerned . The first article entitled \u201c Whose witnesses ? Theirs , of course \u201d , contained caricatures of A. and PERSON , showing them gagged , and the text underneath read as follows :", "\u201c We knew who they were and how they behaved , but we did n\u2019t know how far they were prepared to go in order to hold onto their seats and cushy jobs without doing anything .", "As employees of P. we earn our living by selling goods in the street . A. and PERSON earn theirs by selling the workers in the courts . Not content with doing this simply by signing agreements that go against the collective interest , they \u2019ve now gone a step further \u2013 they rob and steal with total impunity , in broad daylight , with the confidence of men who feel totally untouchable . They play at being gods .", "... but they , the chairman and secretary of the staff representatives , agreed , just like guard - dogs , to roll over and frolic in return for a pat on the back by their master . ... \u201d .", "The tribunal noted that the text was a response to what had happened during proceedings brought by the applicants before ORG no . CARDINAL of GPE , in which NORP and PERSON had appeared as witnesses against the applicants\u2019 interests .", "The second article , entitled \u201c When you \u2019ve rented out your arse you ca n\u2019t shit when you please \u201d , read as follows :", "\u201c If you belong to a works council and you have to sign agreements with your employers that will never be honoured , just to keep you quiet , and agree to changes that only benefit their cronies , and to pay - cuts and other sell - outs , then you \u2019ve swapped your dignity for an armchair , [ and ] you have the dubious merit of achieving the same level of infamy as politicians and policemen . You see , you shut up and you shrewdly agree to all sorts of shenanigans . When you \u2019ve rented out your arse , you ca n\u2019t shit when you please .", "If you \u2019re a despicable \u2018 professional trade - unionist\u2019 and you \u2019ve thus sold your soul to the union , you \u2019ll never have a surge of sincerity , because your status would be threatened . You say what the union tells you to say , and as the unions are \u2018 condoms\u2019 on freedom , your lips are sealed just like your anal sphincter , because you \u2019ve rented out your arse and you ca n\u2019t shit when you please .", "You can see the injustices meted out on your colleagues , the totally irrational way of dealing with their problems and the constant persecution to which they are subjected , but say nothing , for fear of drawing attention to yourself . Once upon a time , in DATE , you were a rebel who criticised the system \u2013 you would curse conventionalism and rant against the rules and regulations . You were caustic , dynamic , cutting , impulsive , jovial . But a couple of favours received have gradually cooled your fiery temperament , stoked your self - esteem and put the dampers on your feelings . From time to time you have a pang of nostalgia and you would like to fart , but your sphincter is sealed , because you \u2019ve rented out your arse and ca n\u2019t shit when you please .", "You \u2019re fed up with your work , pissed off , anxious , stressed and in despair , because of the longer working TIME and the responsibilities , products , promotions and pressures . You could work anywhere , do anything without having to get up at the time others go to bed . You could break everything up , tear it to pieces , crush and demolish it all ... but your hands are tied by credits , IOUs and debts . You are crushed by your new SUV , your children \u2019s after - school activities , and DATE mortgage on your semi - detached house . And you let yourself be humiliated , you swallow your pride , you shut up and you accept , because when you \u2019ve rented out your arse , you ca n\u2019t shit when you please \u201d .", "The news bulletin was distributed to staff and displayed on the trade union \u2019s notice board on the company \u2019s LOC .", "The tribunal observed at the outset that the cause of the dismissal was the content of the bulletin and not the applicants\u2019 trade - union membership . As to the bulletin \u2019s content , it took the view that the cartoon and speech bubbles on the cover , together with the articles inside , were offensive and exceeded the limits of freedom of expression and information , impugning the honour and dignity of the human resources manager , of CARDINAL employees , and of the company itself . Lastly , it noted that the dismissal could not be declared null and void , since it was based on serious misconduct provided for by law , and found that the applicants\u2019 fundamental rights had not been breached .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal against the decision . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG partly upheld the appeal in respect of CARDINAL of the applicants , namely PERSON PERSON and PERSON . It noted that those CARDINAL employees had been on temporary sick leave at the time of the incident on which the dismissal was based . Given that they had been absent from the company and that their direct participation in the distribution and publication of the bulletin could not be established , ORG found that their dismissal had been unfair and ordered the employer either to reinstate them to their posts in the company under the same employment conditions as before , or to pay them appropriate compensation . It upheld the remainder of the judgment under appeal in respect of the other applicants .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants lodged an appeal on points of law , seeking harmonisation of the relevant case - law . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed their appeal on the ground that the decision produced for purposes of comparison was not pertinent .", "CARDINAL . Relying on DATE ( right to a fair hearing ) of the LAW , and on LAW and CARDINAL taken together ( freedom of expression and association ) , the applicants lodged an amparo appeal with ORG . In a decision of DATE , notified on DATE , that court found the appeal inadmissible for lack of constitutional content . As regards the complaint concerning the right to freedom of association , it took the view that there was not enough evidence to show that the ORG dismissal had been an act of reprisal on the part of the company because of the proceedings they had brought against it . Similarly , it found that the applicants had not provided sufficient evidence to show that the company \u2019s action was intended to restrict , hamper or prevent the exercise of their right to freedom of association . The applicants had simply expressed their disagreement with the decisions rendered by the courts below , which had found in reasoned decisions devoid of arbitrariness that they had committed the acts of which the company had accused them in their letters of dismissal .", "CARDINAL . As regards the alleged violation of their right to freedom of association , combined with their right to freedom of expression , ORG first noted that the latter did not encompass any right to insult others . It pointed out in this connection that the LAW did not prohibit the use of hurtful , embarrassing or scathing expressions in any circumstances . However , freedom of expression did not protect vexatious expressions which , regardless of their veracity , were offensive or ignominious and were not pertinent for the purpose of conveying the opinions or information in question . ORG took the view that the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression had not been breached , since the cartoons and expressions used by the applicants had been offensive and humiliating for the persons concerned and had impugned their honour and reputation . Moreover , those cartoons and expressions had not been a necessary contribution to the forming of an opinion on the facts that the applicants wished to denounce , and had not therefore been necessary for the exercise of freedom of expression in a trade - union context .", "CARDINAL .
