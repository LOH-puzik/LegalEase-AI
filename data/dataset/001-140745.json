She is represented before the ORG by PERSON of Liberty , a ORG organisation based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in GPE in DATE . She was the eldest of CARDINAL children : CARDINAL sisters ( ORG and ORG ) and CARDINAL brother ( LV ) . The applicant 's parents separated in DATE and in DATE her mother ( ORG ) began a relationship with a NORP citizen ( ORG ) . In DATE the applicant 's mother travelled to GPE to set up home with ORG and she was later joined by her CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleges that following the move to GPE she was emotionally , physically and sexually abused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant moved to GPE , where she lived with her grandparents . During this time she had no conscious recollection of the sexual abuse ; however , due to her erratic behaviour she was sent twice DATE to a psychiatrist .", "CARDINAL . The applicant returned to GPE in DATE to live with her mother , ORG , and her CARDINAL younger siblings . She claims that on her return PERSON once again began to abuse her both physically and sexually . The abuse continued until she moved out of the family home in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Initially the applicant did not tell anyone of the abuse . However , in DATE her younger sister , ORG , told a family friend that she had been sexually abused by ORG . This information was eventually related to ORG , who confronted the applicant about it . The applicant confirmed that she too had been sexually abused by ORG . ORG did not immediately report the allegations to the police .", "CARDINAL . Instead , in DATE ORG left ORG and returned to GPE with ORG . ORG had already returned to GPE and was living with her grandparents while the applicant had gone to live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By DATE ORG , ORG and ORG had returned to GPE . It was at this time that ORG reported the allegations of sexual abuse by ORG to ORG . During the subsequent investigation witness statements were taken from the applicant , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG 's ex - wife ( ORG ) , and his CARDINAL children from that marriage ( GON and ORG ) . The applicant 's brother , LV , was not interviewed at this time .", "CARDINAL . In her interview ORG revealed that ORG had abused her in a number of ways from DATE , predominantly by rubbing himself against her with his penis . She also described being fondled in a jacuzzi , horsewhipped , bitten on her bottom and karate - chopped between her legs . ORG also described being made to have a shower with ORG and being punished by him with a whip . She also stated that she was aware VV had been touched inappropriately by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant returned from GPE to give a statement . In that statement she described what had taken place in DATE when ORG had gone away for DATE , leaving the children in the care of ORG . The applicant was DATE at the time . She stated :", "\u201c [ ORG ] asked me if I would sleep with him . I was CARDINAL so I thought nothing of it . I went to sleep in his bed ... I remember [ he ] had wrapped his leg over me and pulled me close . I was scared . I was lying on my stomach and [ he ] was lying on my right . I remember him breathing . I was not sure what [ he ] was doing but I felt he was trying to make me take my PERSON 's place while she was away ... PERSON was away for a week . I can not remember how many times this happened but I think it happened more than once . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant also described a time when she was DATE when ORG had returned to GPE for DATE :", "\u201c [ ORG ] told me that he had a heart condition and asked me to sleep with him as he was scared to sleep alone . I said I would . When it came time to go to bed I went into my brother 's room , got the sofa bed and put that next to his bed and slept there . He made me hold his hand but nothing else . DATE he was angry and said I was no company and that he would ask [ VV ] to take my place . \u201d", "CARDINAL . She also stated that :", "\u201c I also remember when I was DATE he would give me driving lessons . He would sit me on his lap and get me to move the steering wheel . I think this was strange now because he never offered to do this when I was DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Social services ' records also indicated that ORG had informed a social worker on DATE that the applicant had told a friend that ORG had fondled her breasts when she was CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In her interviews with police and social services KON at times claimed that she had not been abused , while on other occasions she implied that she had . She said that T , another child of ORG who was living in GPE , had told her that he had put his hands down her jeans and fondled her .", "CARDINAL . PON was arrested and questioned in DATE . Although the tapes of the interview have since been destroyed the entry in the crime report stated that he denied all of the allegations . He was released on bail and told to return to the police station on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On or about CARDINAL DATE the police decided , without any reference to ORG , that no further action would be taken against ORG . The relevant entry in the crime report , which was written by PC G , read as follows :", "\u201c Nothing has been heard directly from GPE about T [ another child of ORG ] being abused . This matter will have to be reinvestigated should T ever come to GPE and make an allegation . In discussion with Detective Sergeant [ B ] we have formed the opinion that there is insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution in this case . A lot of pressure would be put on GPE in respect of her evidence . It is not clear that she would attend court , leaving MV and VV unsupported in their account of what happened . In view of the above I shall classify this as no crime . Should any further evidence come to light this will of course be reclassified and investigated accordingly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PC G informed ORG 's solicitor by telephone that he would not face prosecution . PC G and Detective Sergeant B also informed the applicant and her family that no prosecution would take place and that this decision had been made ' in order to protect the children ' .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a child protection case conference was held concerning VV and ORG . Detective Sergeant B was in attendance . At that meeting ORG produced a tape recording of a telephone conversation she had with ORG . In the course of the conversation ORG belittled the abuse and sought to blame ORG for what had happened . It appears that ORG had further tape recordings but the police did not ask to see them at this time .", "CARDINAL . The conference concluded that :", "\u201c We believe that [ VV ] has been sexually abused and we will place her name on ORG in the category of ORG and likely significant harm of emotional abuse .", "Appropriate boundaries have been breached by [ ORG ] entering the room whilst [ ORG ] was in the shower . We believe he has abused other children and that [ ORG ] is at risk of being abused by him . We will therefore place her name on the register in the category of likely significant harm from sexual abuse . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It was therefore decided that social services would seek to accommodate ORG and treatment would be offered to her . ORG was to remain with ORG under the condition that she have no contact with ORG . Treatment was also to be offered to her .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG went to live with her biological father in GPE . However , she returned to GPE in DATE and thereafter lived with ORG and ORG , who were again co - habiting . Her name was again placed on ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG married ORG . The relationship was on and off for DATE before finally coming to an end in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE all interview records , case notebooks and the custody record were destroyed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant 's brother , LV , committed suicide . DATE , the police re - opened the investigation into the allegations of abuse . It was agreed , however , that the re - investigation would only consider new evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave a further statement . In that statement she explained :", "\u201c I made a witness statement to Police on the CARDINALth DATE , regarding [ ORG ] . I was DATE and at the time could n't bring myself to give the full details of what took place . I wish to add the following ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . She proceeded to set out in greater detail the allegations made in DATE . In particular , she stated that during the \u201c driving lessons \u201d ORG had had an erection and moved under her . Moreover , she claimed that after inviting her to sleep in his bed he had also had an erection and was rubbing himself against her in a sexual motion . Afterwards , her nightdress was wet . In addition , she alleged that the sexual abuse had been accompanied by serious cruelty , physical abuse and the humiliation of all the children .", "CARDINAL . PON was arrested on DATE and subsequently charged with CARDINAL counts of indecency and child cruelty , CARDINAL counts of indecency and CARDINAL count of cruelty related to offences committed against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police were given ORG 's tape recordings of conversations she had had with ORG concerning the abuse . CARDINAL of the tapes contained the following statements by ORG :", "\u201c I want you to understand something . These things that happened with [ VV ] happened DATE , OK . And they got out of hand between us but not too much , [ ORG ] , but it does n't make it right ... I want to sort this out with you and [ VV ] ... at DATE ... I was the adult and I should have fucking stopped it . But I never took her knickers down or tried to screw her or anything like that , for fuck 's sake ... what happened with [ VV ] was the situation , not the way I am . OK . You can trust me ... Things happened with [ VV ] , but not what you think happened , not what you think happened ... I'll tell you what happened and I 'm not proud of it . I 'm ashamed . It got too close with [ VV ] , but it was n't CARDINAL way , and I was the adult and should have stopped it . But she never touched me or done anything ... I 've never done anything that bad to [ VV ] Bad enough , but not that bad . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the prosecution against ORG be stayed because of abuse of process . The court gave CARDINAL reasons for its decision : first , in DATE ORG had been told unequivocally that no further police action would be taken ; secondly , little evidence had been discovered in addition to that which was available in DATE ; thirdly , there was material which was no longer available , particularly in relation to contemporaneous notes of interview , as a result of which it would be impossible for ORG to have a fair trial . The applicant did not challenge this decision .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing , police officers gave slightly divergent evidence concerning the DATE investigation . Detective Sergeant B indicated that there had been a prima facie case against ORG but it was not considered to be in the best interests of the applicant and her siblings to put the case before a court . Sergeant G ( formerly PC G ) agreed that the reason not to proceed was mainly to do with the children 's welfare but stated that in any case there had been insufficient evidence to prosecute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a civil claim in which she claimed damages from the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis for personal injury and loss arising from the alleged negligent manner in which the police had pursued the allegations of child cruelty and indecent assault against ORG and from the decision not to prosecute . The Commissioner applied to have the application struck out on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable grounds .", "CARDINAL . In a decision dated DATE , the District Judge considered the decision not to prosecute to be separate and apart from the police investigation . Insofar as the claim concerned the conduct of the police investigation , the judge held that the allegations had to be struck out as the law did not impose a duty of care on the police in respect of the conduct of a criminal investigation . Such a duty could only arise if it could be shown that the police had assumed responsibility towards a particular claimant in such a manner as to give rise to a duty . However , that was not the position in the present case . The judge accepted that exceptionally , in a child cruelty and sexual abuse case , if an investigation had been carried out so negligently that a child was not protected from future harm , it was at least arguable that the police might exceptionally be held liable . However , he held that the above exception did not apply to the applicant as she was no longer a child in DATE and had therefore been in no different a position to any ordinary witness or victim .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the failure to prosecute , the District Judge considered it arguable that a limited duty of care might arise in the context of the facts of the case . In particular , the judge found it disturbing that the ORG was not apparently even consulted with regard to the failure to prosecute ORG , particularly in view of the severity and magnitude of the alleged offences . Indeed , he noted that it would have been expected that the file was at least sent to the ORG for its consideration as to whether or not to prosecute . However , instead of sending the file to the ORG the police had taken the decision not to prosecute themselves on the ground that it would not be in the best interests of the applicant or her sisters .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner of Police appealed to ORG against the District Judge 's decision , maintaining that he should have struck out the claim regarding the decision not to prosecute . The applicant cross - appealed on the ground that the judge had been wrong to strike out the claim in relation to the investigation . Following a lengthy consideration of the District Judge 's decision , on DATE the court dismissed the appeal and the cross - appeal , leaving the decision of the District Judge as it was . In doing so , the judge noted that it was possible , even if the possibility was not a very strong one , that further examination of the facts , reasoning and information behind the DATE decision not to prosecute might lead to the conclusion that the taking of that decision gave rise to a limited duty of care .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner appealed to ORG . At the hearing , counsel for the applicant conceded that there could be no claim for negligent failure to investigate the complaints properly in DATE and the lower courts had been right to strike out those aspects of the claim . He argued , however , that the decision not to prosecute was different because in coming to that decision the police had taken into account the interests of the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal and struck out the applicant 's claim altogether . It found that following PERSON v. Chief Constable of GPE Police [ DATE ] ORG ( see below ) , the existence of a duty of care in a case such as the present would not be in the public interest as it would lead to the police carrying out their duties in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind . In any case , ORG noted that even if there had been a duty of care , the applicant 's Particulars of Claim did not disclose a cause of action because she would have had to have pleaded \u2013 and could not possibly have pleaded \u2013 that no reasonable prosecutor would have failed to prosecute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant permission to appeal on the basis that the petition did not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr. N , a Consultant Psychiatrist , prepared a report on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In that report he noted that she was suffering from clinical depression which was moderate in its severity . Although he noted evidence of propensity to mental disorder within the family , he concluded that her experience of abuse while she was a child was the original cause of the mental disorder now afflicting her . However , he considered that the applicant 's experience of uneven and unsettled parenting by ORG was also a contributory factor .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the question of whether the failure of the original prosecution of ORG was a significant contributing factor , Dr. PERSON acknowledged that the answer was \u201c a difficult and complicated determination resting as it does upon the implication of the narrative biography , the complex family dynamics , subconscious psychological themes and a broader consideration of [ the applicant 's ] personality , psychological constitution and prospects \u201d . Nevertheless , although the argument was \u201c both subtle and complex \u201d , he concluded that \u201c a significant proportion of [ the applicant 's ] ongoing psychological difficulties can be traced to the failure of the original prosecution of [ ORG ] in DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Physical and sexual abuse of a child are criminal offences in GPE and GPE . Prior to CARDINAL May CARDINAL , the relevant sexual offences were set out in LAW DATE , LAW , the Sexual Offences ( Amendment ) Act CARDINAL and the Sexual Offences ( Amendment ) Act DATE ( \u201c LAW DATE \u201d ) . Cruelty to a person DATE and was at the material time DATE a criminal offence by reason of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Children and Young Persons Act DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under domestic law the police owe no general duty of care in tort to victims of crime to investigate their allegations ( PERSON v. Chief Constable of GPE Police [ DATE ] ORG ) . However , this position is not tantamount to a \u201c blanket immunity \u201d and in certain cases the police could be found to owe a duty of care to a victim ( see , for example , PERSON Chief Constable of ORG [ DATE ] QB CARDINAL , in which the police appeared to have assumed responsibility for the victim 's safety ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a LAW right .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that a person who claims that a public authority has acted or proposes to act in a way which is unlawful pursuant to section DATE ) may bring proceedings against the authority under LAW in the appropriate court or tribunal or may rely on the Convention rights concerned in any legal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL , the court may grant such relief or remedy , or make any such order within its powers as it considers just and reasonable in relation to any act of a public authority which it finds is unlawful ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
