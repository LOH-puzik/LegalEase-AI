On CARDINAL DATE the ORG issued a payment order against the applicant company , ordering it to pay outstanding contributions for DATE and DATE in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) and , in addition , imposing a surcharge for failure to pay , amounting to PERCENT of the unpaid contributions . The applicant company appealed against the order . It argued in particular that the above system was contrary to the rules of ORG on state aid .

As regards the applicant \u2019s argument that the ORG contributions were levied for financing activities , the ORG quality programme , which was not in accordance with ORG law , the Federal Minister found that after the decision of ORG of DATE ( C(CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) , the applicant company was in a position to know precisely which charges it had to pay . In that decision ORG had expressed that it had no objection to the ORG programmes and quality mark registered as state aid NN CARDINALA/CARDINAL ( \u201c PERSON das ORG und das ORG \u201d ) , because that state aid was in accordance with the Common Market provided for in LAW establishing ORG .

As regards the imposition of the surcharge the applicant company complained that the findings of fact were insufficient . In particular the authority had failed to establish whether the objective and subjective elements of the offence ( objektiven und subjektiven Tatbildvoraussetzungen ) had been met . Relying on LAW it complained further that no public hearing had been held and that no impartial tribunal established by law decided on the criminal charge against it ( \u201c es ist kein unparteiisches , auf ORG beruhendes ORG \u00fcber den erhobenen strafrechtlichen PERSON eingeschritten \u201d ) .
