{"ITEMID": "001-78661", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "WALSH v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP citizen born in DATE and currently serving a prison sentence in LOC , GPE , GPE . He is represented by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The applicant has an extensive criminal record , commencing in DATE . This record includes some CARDINAL road traffic offences , CARDINAL offence of conspiracy to rob , CARDINAL of burglary , CARDINAL of theft and CARDINAL of going equipped for theft , together with other miscellaneous convictions .", "On DATE , the applicant , with other co - defendants , was acquitted of offences of obtaining services and property by deception . The restraint order imposed on the applicant \u2019s property pending any eventual confiscation order on conviction was discharged .", "On DATE , ORG served a summons on the applicant for the purposes of recovery proceedings . The ORG sought recovery of the sum of GBP CARDINAL allegedly paid to his solicitor in DATE for buying a house and the sum of GBP CARDINAL held in a bank account , alleging that these were the proceeds of unlawful conduct within the meaning of the Proceeds of Crime Act CARDINAL ( \u201c POCA \u201d ) .", "At an interlocutory hearing , it was contended on behalf of the applicant , that the proceedings for recovery of his assets were not \u201c civil \u201d but criminal in nature and that the guarantees of Articles QUANTITY and CARDINAL applied , in particular as regarded the standard of proof .", "On DATE , the High Court judge rejected the applicant \u2019s claims on this interlocutory matter , considering , on examination of domestic and GPE authority , that there was no criminal charge being determined in the recovery proceedings .", "On DATE , ORG in GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found , applying the PERSON criteria , that in domestic law the proceedings were classified as civil , not involving the preferring of a criminal charge in a criminal setting , or giving rise to any criminal record ; that the purpose of the proceedings was not to make him amenable to punishment for a specific crime by way of imprisonment or a fine but that they were restitutionary in nature seeking the recovery of assets acquired through criminal conduct .. As to the nature of any penalty , while the recovery of assets could readily be described as a preventative measure , it considered that even if the proceedings did impose a penalty that this was not sufficient to classify the proceedings as criminal for the purposes of LAW .", "It concluded , rejecting arguments that cumulatively the proceedings were criminal :", "\u201c The essence of article CARDINAL in the criminal dimension is the charging of a person with a criminal offence for the purpose of securing a conviction with a view to exposing that person to criminal sanction . These proceedings are obviously and significantly different from that type of application . They are not directed towards him in the sense that they seek to inflict punishment beyond the recovery of assets that do not lawfully belong to him . As such , while they will obviously have an impact on the appellant , these are predominantly proceedings in rem . They are designed to recover the proceeds of crime , rather than to establish , in the context of criminal proceedings , guilt of specific offences . The cumulative effect of the application of the tests in PERSON is to identify these clearly as civil proceedings . \u201d", "On DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal .", "On DATE , in determining the application for a civil recovery order against the applicant for the sums , principally , of GBP CARDINAL alleged to have been paid by the applicant in DATE for the purpose of purchasing property and of GBP CARDINAL currently held in a bank account , ORG judge took into account the applicant \u2019s criminal convictions up until DATE as showing a clear indication of his propensity to indulge in serious criminal conduct . He did not take into account the offences for which the applicant was acquitted as he had not had the opportunity of assessing the quality of the evidence of the one identifying witness , and while he noted that no prosecution was brought following the arrest of the applicant and PERSON on suspicion of robbery , he did take into account that the applicant had been found , on DATE of the robbery , in company with PERSON who was carrying marked bank notes as confirming his criminal associations , as did evidence from police officers as concerns his associations with other persons with criminal records . The judge went on to to find that the applicant had not accounted for his assets . There had been no evidence to support his alleged car dealing and no record with ORG that he had been in employment . Only small sums , from alleged employment with a cleaning business ( which earnings dubiously overlapped with a period in prison ) and from state benefits were accounted for . He concluded that he was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the applicant had for some time pursued a criminal lifestyle involving dishonest and acquisitive criminal conduct with a willingness to resort to violence if necessary . His criminal record and in particular his conviction for conspiracy to rob , his association with criminals with a similar background of offences together with the circumstances in which he had most recently been arrested served to convince him that crime had been his primary means of acquiring funds for DATE . In the circumstances he was satisfied that the sums that the ORG sought to recover represented property obtained through unlawful conduct and he accordingly made a recovery order for the sums set out in the application .", "According to LAW , application may be made to ORG for the civil recovery of property representing the proceeds of \u201c unlawful conduct \u201d", "By virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) unlawful conduct is defined as :", "\u201c Conduct occurring in any part of GPE is unlawful conduct if it is unlawful under the criminal law of that part . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL ) provides that the standard of proof of unlawful conduct is that of the balance of probabilities ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
