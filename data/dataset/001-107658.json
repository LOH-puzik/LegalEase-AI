He further stated that upon registration of his asylum application he did not know what a surname was . He presented no passport or other recognised travel document which could confirm his identity .", "According to the applicant he was of NORP origin because his mother was NORP . In GPE he had been registered as NORP because of his father \u2019s NORP origin . The applicant affirmed that he came from GPE . As a ground for applying for asylum , he referred to the generally unsatisfactory situation in GPE and to his health problems related to a kidney disease .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s asylum request for the following reasons :", "\u201c ORG considers that in his home country [ the applicant ] has not been subject to reactions by the authorities , individuals or groups that can be characterised as persecution within the meaning of the LAW and LAW .", "General conditions in GPE do not indicate that [ the applicant ] fulfils the requirements for asylum .", "...", "The upheavals resulting from the war , occupation and transition to NORP sovereignty have led to unrest in various parts of the country .", "In spite of the general unrest , the ORG considers that the situation is not so geographically widespread that NORP asylum seekers are in general need of protection .", "[ The applicant ] comes from a village in the disputed area in GPE . The ORG is aware that there is considerable tension in this area between NORP on the one hand and NORP and PERSON on the other . The ORG is closely following the security situation in the area . Although the security situation is difficult , the ORG does not consider that the current situation is of such a nature that all the inhabitants of the area are in considerable danger of losing their lives or being made to suffer inhuman treatment . \u201d", "Represented by the same lawyer as before ORG , the applicant appealed to ORG . It rejected his appeal on DATE , stating inter alia :", "\u201c Furthermore , [ the applicant ] may not be sent back to an area where , for reasons similar to those given in the definition of a refugee , he is in considerable danger of losing his life or of suffering inhuman treatment , cf . section CARDINAL ) , second sentence , of LAW . The provision must be interpreted in accordance with GPE \u2019s international commitments under LAW ... , cf . section CARDINAL of LAW . Under this provision the requirements as to the nature of the danger and the probability that it will occur are somewhat stricter than those under LAW .", "In ORG of NORP outside GPE dated DATE and ORG of NORP Asylum - Seekers of DATE , cf . DATE , ORG advises against all return to ORG , and states that NORP asylum - seekers from these regions should be recognised as refugees . ORG recommends furthermore that protection should be afforded to asylum - seekers who are not recognised as refugees . ORG refers to the general violence , the large numbers of internal refugees , the inability and unwillingness of the authorities to provide protection , high unemployment , inadequate supplies of fuel , electricity and water , and the inadequacy of health care , education and other services .", "ORG considers that the ORG recommendations are relevant and should be given weight since they provide important information about the situation in GPE and make a valuable contribution to decisions on which persons have a right to protection under LAW . However , the case can not be decided on the basis of the recommendations alone . ORG also must take other information into account and arrive at a decision in keeping with the provisions of LAW and other existing legislation .", "[ The applicant ] has stated that he comes from GPE . ORG is aware that the situation in this area is characterised by violence and unrest , and that the security situation is unstable and difficult . GPE is in the disputed area , the area surrounding the border between GPE and the rest of GPE . Most of the inhabitants of the region are NORP , and the largest minority groups are PERSON , NORP and NORP . GPE is mainly under NORP political and military control , but the minority groups are also represented in government bodies .", "The level of violence has at times been high over DATE , partly because of the presence of a number of militant groups . The violence in GPE has mainly taken the form of shooting attacks , road bombs , suicide bombs and car bombs , which are primarily directed at the security forces and the police , but local politicians and their families and the civilian population have also been attacked .", "However , ORG considers that in spite of this , the current situation is not of such a nature that all the inhabitants of the region are in considerable danger of losing their lives or being made to suffer inhuman treatment . The latest reports from the region , including those compiled by ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG , indicate that the security situation is improving . The violence is currently more limited in scope and seems to be targeted more often at particular groups than is the case in other central and southern parts of GPE . The ORG \u2019s established practice also indicates that in GPE the general security situation alone does not justify protection of NORP . In this connection the ORG comments that since [ the applicant ] \u2019s father is a NORP and since [ the applicant ] is registered in GPE as a NORP , he must be considered to be a NORP .", "...", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , a work or residence permit may be granted on grounds of strong humanitarian considerations or when a foreign national has a particular connection with GPE . The provision is not intended to cover circumstances that are common to most appellants . Examples of factors that may be taken into account in an overall assessment are that return to the home country is inadvisable for [ the applicant ] or that the decision would involve immigration policy considerations .", "As regards the available information concerning [ the applicant ] \u2019s state of health , the ORG comments that health - related circumstances do not as a rule constitute grounds for a stay in GPE . The claim that treatment in GPE is in general better than in [ the applicant ] \u2019s home country is not being given weight since it is noted that [ the applicant ] is able to receive necessary and adequate treatment in his home country . [ The applicant ] has himself stated that treatment for kidney stones is available in GPE .", "If the claim based on [ the applicant ] \u2019s state of health is to be given weight in the overall assessment , this must in principle be documented in writing in the form of an up - to - date medical certificate issued in GPE . Normally less weight is given to certificates that are not in accordance with chapter CARDINAL of Circular IS-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u201c Certificates / medical certificates etc . for use in cases relating to foreign nationals \u201d , published by ORG . Importance is not normally attached to undocumented or insufficiently documented information concerning health . It is noted that ORG has not received any information concerning [ the applicant ] \u2019s state of health .", "If a permit is to be granted on the basis of physical health problems alone , the problem must be sufficiently serious for [ the applicant ] \u2019s return to his home country to be considered unjustifiable . In practice , this means that the illness must be acute and life - threatening . In exceptional cases , a permit may be granted in the event of a serious chronic illness that would threaten the patient \u2019s life if left untreated .", "ORG considers that [ the applicant ] \u2019s health problems are not serious enough to constitute the sole basis for a permit . Kidney stones can not be considered a serious chronic life - threatening illness . There are therefore no strong humanitarian considerations that would constitute grounds for granting a permit under section CARDINAL , second paragraph , of LAW .", "According to the information provided by [ the applicant ] , he lived in GPE until DATE , while he has only lived in GPE for DATE . Furthermore , his family is in GPE . His connection with his home country is strong , and he has no particular connection with GPE . His stay in connection with his application for asylum can not be given weight .", "ORG considers that [ the applicant ] does not have a sufficiently strong connection with GPE to justify the granting of a work or residence permit .", "On the basis of an overall assessment , ORG considers that the conditions set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW have not been fulfilled . Thus , there are no grounds for granting a work permit under this provision . \u201d", "On DATE ORG gave the applicant until DATE to contact the police regarding his departure from GPE .", "On DATE the applicant filed a request to the ORG to stop his deportation to GPE .", "On DATE the President of ORG decided in the interest of the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG to indicate to ORG , under LAW , that the applicant should not be expelled to GPE until further notice . On DATE ORG accordingly decided to suspend the enforcement of its decision .", "On DATE the President decided to give notice of the application , inviting the parties to address the following CARDINAL questions :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Has the applicant exhausted domestic remedies with regard to his submissions to the effect that his expulsion to GPE would be contrary to the Convention ?", "CARDINAL . Bearing in mind , amongst other considerations , the position of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees\u2019 with regard to forcible return to LOC and their assessment of the general situation in that part of the country , including in GPE ( the applicant \u2019s former place of residence ) , would his expulsion to GPE be compatible with Articles QUANTITY or CARDINAL of the Convention ? \u201d", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant provided certain documents , including medical statements according to which he had suffered from a kidney stone disease at a young age and had undergone an operation . Whilst CARDINAL kidney had a defect , the other functioned normally . He also suffered from chronic muscular- and bone infection , resulting in reduced functional ability and affecting him DATE . Arrangements had been made for him to receive physiotherapy .", "ORG interpreted this new information as a request for reconsideration of its rejection of DATE and rejected the request on DATE , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c There is no basis for altering the ORG \u2019s previous decision . The case is essentially in the same position as that previously determined and reference is made to the reasoning in that decision .", "What is of central importance for an application for asylum is the alleged need for protection according to LAW and/or section CARDINAL of LAW . By its earlier decision ORG rejected the application for asylum . No new information has emerged suggesting that [ the applicant ] nonetheless has a need for protection . In the ORG \u2019s assessment , there were no such circumstances as mentioned in section CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "If justified by strong humanitarian considerations and if the foreign national has particular links to GPE , a residence permit may be granted under section CARDINAL ) of LAW . Making a concrete assessment of the request for reconsideration and other information in the case , the ORG does not find that this condition has been fulfilled .", "The request for reconsideration is in the main based on the [ the applicant \u2019s ] state of health . The ORG observes that a consideration of a claim to stay in GPE on grounds of a claimant \u2019s health condition must be based on the causes of the health problems , their level of seriousness , the need for treatment and the availability of treatment in the person \u2019s country of origin . It is not decisive whether the treatment offered in GPE is in general better than in the person \u2019s home country , or whether the quality of life is generally better in GPE . It is more a question of whether it is inadvisable to return to the home country . According to the ORG \u2019s practice , in cases of physical illnesses there ought , as a starting point , to be an acute and life - threatening suffering . Exceptionally , a permit to stay may be granted if the appellant suffers from a serious and chronic illness that by its nature may be life - threatening if it is not treated .", "The ORG can not see that the submitted information concerning [ the applicant ] \u2019s state of health is of such a seriousness , has been caused by such factors , or that there is a future need for medical treatment , as to warrant a residence permit on this ground . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant , with the assistance of a lawyer , applied to the County Governor of GPE and Akershus for a grant of free legal aid ( fri sakf\u00f8rsel ) under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , in order to have his case reviewed by the courts . He referred to LAW CARDINAL indication of CARDINAL DATE mentioned above and to its decision to give notice of the application to ORG . The applicant pointed out that he held no residence- or work permit , but his stay in GPE was lawful because the authorities had suspended the enforcement of his expulsion following the ORG \u2019s Rule CARDINAL indication . In this situation he had no right to pursue gainful employment or to receive social security benefits and therefore had no means of obtaining an income . The condition of indigence applying to grants of legal aid had therefore been fulfilled .", "The applicant further emphasised that the case affected him particularly . He feared being killed or exposed to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment upon return to his home country . He stressed that it was only in a small proportion of cases that the ORG applied Rule DATE and gave notice of the application to the respondent ORG .", "As a starting point the national remedies ought to be exhausted before lodging an application with the ORG . The applicant did not have the necessary financial means for obtaining judicial review . The case raised so many complex issues of fact and of law that the applicant could not be expected to represent himself . He did not master NORP . Without free legal aid it would not be possible for him to have his case reviewed by the national courts .", "In this case , where the ORG had applied Rule CARDINAL and given notice of the application to the respondent ORG , it was obvious that the case had reasonable prospects of success . In cases involving allegations of violations of the LAW that were not manifestly ill - founded and were made by litigants who did not have any lawful means of receiving an income , legal aid should be granted liberally . In any event , in this case legal aid should be granted in view of the real and immediate risk the applicant was facing of treatment contrary to LAW upon return .", "On DATE , the County Governor , making a global assessment on the basis of Circular G-CARDINAL/CARDINAL and observing that an exemption from the duty to pay court fees was to be dealt with under the same rules as free legal aid ( section CARDINAL of ORG ) refused the request on the ground that he did not consider the conditions in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of Act to have been fulfilled :", "\" GPE does not find that there are special reasons to depart from the restrictive practice that applies in respect of a grant of legal aid before the courts in non - prioritized areas such as that of the present case . The [ applicant ] \u2019s fundamental legal guarantees must be deemed to have been safeguarded through the administrative proceedings in this case .", "Furthermore , the County Governor has taken into account the argument that ORG has taken the measure to invite ORG to submit observations in the case and further that this is done in a very small proportion of the cases , but can not see that this is a sufficient reason for departing from the very strict practice applied in immigration cases not falling under LAW ( CARDINAL ) no . CARDINAL , cf . Circular G-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL . \u201d", "The applicant appealed but on DATE ORG upheld the County Governor \u2019s decision . Albeit satisfied that the applicant fulfilled the financial conditions for free legal aid , it dismissed his appeal notably with reference to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , giving inter alia the following reasons :", "section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) no . CARDINAL of ORG , cf . ORG Circular G-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , section CARDINAL . In immigration cases that are not prioritised , free legal representation is granted only exceptionally , if there are entirely special reasons , for example where the case raises questions of particular interest that have not previously been examined by the courts .", "ORG finds against the background of the documents presented that the case does not have sufficient common traits with the subject matters mentioned in LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) . Nor do we find it shown that the case raises questions of principle of particular interest that have not been previously examined by the courts .", "In practice it is considered that , as a main rule , the public authorities should not grant legal aid in cases concerning judicial review in respect of decisions by ORG . The reason for this is that the claimant already has had his or her case reviewed administratively by both ORG and by ORG . These instances possess special competence within immigration law . The present case has been examined by the immigration authorities CARDINAL times , without success . ... In this connection it is noted that the [ applicant ] has been assisted by a lawyer both in connection with his administrative appeal and his request for reconsideration . Therefore , his fundamental need for legal security must be considered to have been safeguarded through the administrative examination of the case .", "In the assessment regard has also been had to [ the applicant \u2019s ] allegation that NORP authorities by their practice with regard to work - permits and free legal aid put an effective barrier against foreigners to have their cases reviewed by the courts . In this connection ORG point to that fact that ORG is a social support arrangement aimed at ensuring legal assistance to persons who do not themselves have the financial conditions for taking care of needs for legal assistance of great importance from an individual point of view and with a view to their personal welfare , cf . section CARDINAL of the Act . The principal aim of ORG is to provide assistance to those who do not have financial capacity to cover expenses for legal assistance . Even if the financial conditions for free legal aid are fulfilled free legal aid is not always granted in all types of cases . The LAW distinguishes between priority cases without means testing , priority case with means testing and non - prioritised cases . In the present case the [ applicant ] fulfils the financial criteria , but the case is by nature non - prioritised according to LAW . In such cases a restrictive practise is generally applied .", "Regard is further had to the argument that ORG by a letter of CARDINAL DATE indicated to the NORP authorities not to deport the applicant . ORG does not consider that this indication has been based on a thorough examination of the validity of ORG decision . It is observed that it does not appear from the case documents on what ground the ORG has based its decision .", "... \u201d", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG stated that the NORP office of ORG ) had informed NORP immigration authorities that the applicant had on DATE applied , via ORG , for voluntary return to his country of origin .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer informed the ORG that the application to ORG would be withdrawn DATE .", "Under LAW ( tvisteloven ) , a decision by ORG could form the subject of an appeal to the competent city court or district court ( tingrett ) ( ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , from there to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) ( ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and ultimately to ORG ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .
