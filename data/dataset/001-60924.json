ORG remains concerned that GPE has failed to implement its treaty obligations fully despite numerous , wide - ranging and officially endorsed national initiatives in the fields of human rights education and democratization and judicial and legislative reforms aimed at bringing national legislation into line with international standards .", "Since DATE , when several murders of law enforcement officials in the GPE region sparked a wave of mass detentions and arrests , the organization has received a growing number of reports of ill - treatment and torture by law enforcement officials of people perceived to be members of independent NORP congregations or followers of independent imams ( NORP leaders ) . CARDINAL of these so - called ' Wahhabists ' were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment in trials that fell far short of international fair trial standards . The organization 's concern was heightened in DATE when CARDINAL of people , men and women , were detained following a reported CARDINAL bomb explosions in the capital GPE . This time the list of those reported to have been arrested , ill - treated and tortured included suspected supporters of the banned political opposition parties and movements PERSON and GPE , including family members and independent human rights monitors , as well as alleged supporters of banned NORP opposition parties and movements , such as ORG - ut - GPE . In the majority of these cases , if not all , that have come to the attention of ORG , those detained were denied prompt access to a lawyer of their choice , to their families and to medical assistance . The responsible authorities , from procurators to courts at all levels and the parliamentary ombudsman , persistently failed to launch timely , full and independent investigations into widespread allegations of torture and ill - treatment . According to independent and credible sources , self - incriminating evidence reportedly extracted by torture was routinely included in trial proceedings and served in many of the cases reviewed by ORG as the basis for a guilty verdict . ORG was disturbed by public statements by NORP officials , including the President of GPE , in the wake of both the ORG murders and the GPE bombings , which , if not directly sanctioning the use of violence by state agents against certain sections of the population , could be perceived at the very least to condone the use of unlawful methods such as torture and ill - treatment . In DATE , for example , President PERSON , portrayed as the guarantor of democracy and human rights , stated publicly that he was prepared to tear off the heads of CARDINAL people in order to protect GPE 's freedom and stability ... ORG is concerned that such statements together with the authorities ' persistent failure to initiate impartial and thorough investigations into allegations of torture and ill - treatment , may create an impression that torture and ill - treatment by law enforcement officials is acceptable , and even necessary conduct , and that they can engage in such conduct with impunity .", "This briefing does not attempt to be a comprehensive study of torture and ill - treatment in GPE .

LAW guarantees under point CARDINAL that no one may be subject to torture , force , or other treatment which is cruel or demeaning to the dignity of the person .", "Article CARDINAL of the criminal code criminalizes obtaining a confession by coercion . Although explicit in its description of prohibited methods of coercion ( beatings , inflicting grievous or less grievous bodily harm , torture ) and specific in naming the perpetrators ( investigating and interrogating officers , procurators ) the article is still far more narrow in its definition of torture than LAW . The maximum penalty prescribed under this article is DATE imprisonment .", "Other articles , including LAW , punish various assaults but do not relate specifically to agents of the state ... The NORP press has reported that law enforcement officers have been prosecuted for using unlawful methods in detaining and interrogating suspects . However , to ORG knowledge , in the period under review , none of the law enforcement officials identified as perpetrators of acts of torture by victims of human rights violations whose cases the organization has taken up has been charged under the above articles of the criminal code ...", "ORG and again ORG has received credible reports that suspects were denied access to a lawyer of their choice . Often the lawyers are only given access by law enforcement officials after the suspect has been held in custody for DATE , which is when the risk of torture or ill - treatment is the greatest . In many cases law enforcement officials will only grant access to the lawyer after the suspect has signed a confession . Meetings between lawyers and clients , when they are granted , are generally infrequent , because unlimited access to a client as prescribed by the law is difficult for lawyers to obtain . Defence lawyers are rarely allowed to be present at all stages of the investigation ...", "LAW explicitly prohibits the use of torture and obliges judges , procurators , investigators and interrogators to respect a person 's honour and dignity at every stage of legal proceedings .
