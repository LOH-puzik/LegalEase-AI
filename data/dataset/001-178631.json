The GPE events of DATE", "CARDINAL . On DATE rioting broke out in the town of GPE , located to the northwest of GPE .

It was claimed that after being involved in a car accident , V.A. had insulted and physically assaulted passengers of the other car , who were local residents .

The entire post read as follows :", "\u2018 DATE TIME I spent a little longer than TIME in GPE , together with [ another member ] of our GPE [ REAL ] and our media coordinator ... First , here is [ the summary of ] what I wrote on ORG during TIME using my phone :", "- We have entered the town .", "- There is a lot of police and their number is growing . The protesters gather TIME or CARDINAL and make speeches . We are in front of the building of the [ Ismayilli District ] Executive Authority . There are around QUANTITY police officers in this area .", "- The cause of the events is the general tension arising from corruption and insolence [ of public officials ] . In short , people have had enough . We are having conversations with local residents .", "- The [ ethnic ] NORP of the village of GPE are also fed up ; they tried to come to [ GPE ] to support the protest , but the road was blocked and they were sent back .", "- Everybody is preparing for the night .", "- We are leaving ORG , returning to GPE . The matter is clear to us . PERSON was the first call . PERSON is the second . After the third call , the show will begin .", "We came back after having fully investigated the situation in GPE . I wrote that clashes would again take place in the evening , by posting \u2018 everybody is preparing for the ORG [ on ORG ] . People there had been saying \u2018 We \u2019ll give them hell in TIME ; we have procured supplies\u2019 ( meaning the fuel for Molotov cocktails had been bought ) . People are angry . There are also those who do not care and who are afraid , but those who are not afraid are very exasperated and will continue the protest at TIME . This is no longer a political situation where we could stay there and try to change something ; this is already a situation of disorderly crisis which requires conciliatory steps by the ORG to be resolved .", "No one should fool oneself or others . The events in GPE were not and are not a calm peaceful protest , it is an extremely violent but just protest and the responsibility for it lies with PERSON .", "As it is with all revolutionary processes , in the beginning the political initiative is still in the hands of the President , but by not taking action he is gradually losing this initiative . When [ such leaders ] begin to react to the situation , it is usually too late and their actions have no effect . PERSON , PERSON , and all others have gone this way\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE before posting the above in his blog , on his way back by car from GPE to GPE on DATE , CARDINAL TIME the applicant gave a live interview to ORG by phone , stating in particular as follows ( as quoted in the domestic courts\u2019 judgments ) :", "\u201c Our impressions are such that , after the PERSON events , this is the most serious warning to the NORP leadership that the ORG can no longer be governed in this manner . So , we saw a lot of police . And so , we saw CARDINAL members of various forces , the police and internal troops in front of [ the IDEA building ] . And people held discussions in small groups and from time to time small groups united and , for example , shouted slogans . Their main demand was for [ the Head of the IDEA ] to apologise for these events . Because it is claimed that his relative had caused the initial incident [ that sparked the riot ] . However , the government representatives consider that the ORG is not responsible [ for these events ] . Thereafter we spoke to many people from the local population . All of them were discontent , and the main reason was , of course , TIME event , that is apparently the car accident [ that sparked the riot ] . But in reality there are deep social and economic problems at the root of this incident . A few families , a few small groups control the entire economy of the whole region , all of them are one another \u2019s relatives , there can be no talk of any competitive , just economy , social infrastructure is undeveloped , people live from pension to pension . Then , there are many complaints . Ordinary people say , for example , that when cash for pensions is brought [ to the region ] by a bank car , the cash is put into ATMs and is available for withdrawal DATE . The people suspect that that money is invested for interest during DATE and those responsible for this make profit from the interest gained on the social funding of the entire region . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequent circumstances are described as follows in ORG ( cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant posted more information on his blog concerning the events , citing the official websites of ORG and ORG and publishing screenshots of those sites . In particular , he noted that , according to those sources and to information posted on GPE \u2019s ORG account , ORG was actually owned by V.A. This directly contradicted the earlier denial by the Head of IDEA . The information cited by the applicant was removed from the aforementioned Government websites and GPE \u2019s ORG page within TIME of the applicant publishing his blog entry . However , the blog entry itself was extensively quoted in the media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and ORG issued a new joint press statement concerning the events in GPE . It noted that QUANTITY people had been charged with criminal offences in connection with the events of DATE , and had been detained pending trial . In addition , CARDINAL people had been arrested in connection with their participation in \u2018 actions causing a serious breach of public ORG ; some of them had been convicted of \u2018 administrative offences\u2019 and sentenced to a few days\u2019 \u2018 administrative detention\u2019 or a fine , while others had been released . The statement further noted that \u2018 lately , biased and partial information has been deliberately disseminated , distorting the true nature of the mentioned events resulting from ORG , including information about large numbers of injured people and the disappearance of CARDINAL individual . The statement refuted that information , noting that CARDINAL people had been admitted to the regional hospital with injuries and that no one had disappeared . It further stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u2018 Following the carrying out of inquiries , it has been established that on DATE the Deputy Chairman of ORG , PERSON , and the Cochairman of ORG , PERSON , went to ORG and made appeals to local residents aimed at social and political destabilisation , such as calls to resist the police , not to obey officials and to block roads . Their illegal actions , which were calculated to inflame the situation in the country , will be fully and thoroughly investigated and receive legal assessment.\u2019", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant commented on that statement on his blog . He noted that the Government had taken a decision to \u2018 punish and frighten\u2019 him , and that there were several reasons for that : firstly , the applicant \u2019s blog posting of CARDINAL DATE , which had revealed facts embarrassing the Government ; secondly , the fact that REAL had raised a public debate on the DATE legislative amendments aimed at keeping secret information concerning shareholders in companies , creating \u2018 a more clandestine environment for stealing the oil ORG ; thirdly , the applicant \u2019s earlier criticism of ORG , in which he compared it to \u2018 a zoo\u2019 , following enactment of the legislation placing \u2018 severe limitations on the freedom of ORG by \u2018 introducing unjustifiably high monetary penalties for attending unauthorised ORG ; and lastly , ORG \u2018 quickly accumulating ORG prior to the presidential election , becoming a \u2018 serious barrier in the eyes of the traditional [ political ] ORG and threatening \u2018 to spoil the repeat of the election farce performed DATE after PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The other police ORG statements at the trial hearings appeared to confirm their pre - trial statements .", "CARDINAL . According to the first - instance court \u2019s judgment , CARDINAL residents of GPE , ORG and GPE , stated that DATE TIME on DATE they had seen a crowd of people near the administrative building of ORG . They had also seen the applicant and Tofiq Yaqublu inciting them to riot , after which the crowd moved in the direction of the LAW building committing acts of mass disorder . Both ORG and GPE specified that the crowd moved in the direction of the building of ORG , and from there in the direction of the LAW building , along the \u201c hospital road \u201d ( FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , during cross - examination by the defence , which was not reflected in the first - instance court \u2019s judgment , both of those witnesses , especially ORG , had given answers contradicting their earlier statements . In particular , the applicant claimed in his appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that , in his witness statement , ORG had said that from TIME on DATE he had been at his relative \u2019s home for lunch . After lunch , sometime before TIME , he had gone to the area next to ORG , where he had seen the applicant and Tofiq Yaqublu inciting a large crowd of people to riot and that thereafter the crowd had attacked the police with stones . During cross - examination at the trial hearings , in response to a question by the defence , he had stated that , in connection with this criminal case , he had participated as a witness in the questioning by the prosecution authorities DATE after the ORG events , and that he had not been a participant in any other investigative steps and had not signed any other procedural documents relating to this case . Following that response , the defence produced a copy of the record of the inspection of the damage to ORG house , which had been conducted from TIME to CARDINAL p.m. on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . According to the record , ORG had been present during the inspection as an attesting witness and had signed the inspection record . Despite the fact that this had revealed a clear inconsistency between the record and ORG testimony and his responses to the defence \u2019s questions , raising a number of questions as to the witness \u2019s integrity and the truthfulness of his statements , the presiding judge had hastily dismissed the witness without giving the defence an opportunity to ask any more questions .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , according to the applicant , witness GPE \u2019s statement contained contradictory details and he had been unable to respond to the defence \u2019s questions seeking clarification . Moreover , the defence had found out that that witness \u2019s son was an employee of the burned hotel owned by V.A.", "CARDINAL . The Government remained silent in respect of the above - mentioned allegations by the applicant in respect of ORG and GPE \u2019s self - contradictory statements and did not submit any relevant documentary evidence refuting them . Neither did the Government submit full copies of these witnesses\u2019 pre - trial statements or relevant excerpts of the trial transcripts reflecting their statements at the trial hearings .", "CARDINAL . One resident of a nearby village , PERSON , who had been in the town on DATE , stated , briefly , that there had been disorder in the centre of the town QUANTITY that he had seen the applicant and PERSON in the crowd . PERSON specified that the protesters moved towards the town centre along the \u201c hospital road \u201d ( FAC ) . According to the applicant , PERSON also stated that he had not heard exactly what the applicant and Tofiq Yagublu had been saying to people around them ( see paragraph CARDINAL below for more detail ) .", "CARDINAL . GPE , a journalist , stated that he had arrived in GPE CARDINAL p.m. and TIME together with GPE He had seen several other journalists in the town centre . There had been no rioting or clashes with the police at that time . The applicant did not make any inflammatory statements to local residents . After a while , the witness had gone to a teahouse together with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . GPE , the applicant \u2019s colleague from REAL who had travelled together with the applicant and GPE to GPE , stated that they had arrived in the town at TIME There had been no rioting or clashes with the police at that time . After staying in the square near the IDEA building for CARDINAL to thirty minutes , they had gone to a teahouse . At TIME they had left the town .", "CARDINAL . I.A. , a journalist , stated that there had been some disturbances in the town TIME and that the police had used water cannons and rubber bullets against the protesters . At TIME other journalists had arrived from GPE . The applicant and PERSON had arrived with them . At that time , there had been no unrest and no clashes with the police . The applicant had invited him for a tea , but he had refused . At TIME the applicant had left the town together with GPE and GPE After they had left , in TIME , there had been clashes between protesters and the police , which had continued until TIME", "CARDINAL . M.R. , a journalist , stated that she had contacted the applicant by phone from LOC while he was in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . M.K. , a journalist , stated that he had travelled to ORG together with PERSON . They had arrived TIME Very shortly after their arrival , PERSON had been taken by plain - clothed individuals to the police station . TIME , he himself had gone to the same police station , where both of them had been told that the situation in the town was now calm and had been asked to go back to GPE . No inflammatory statements were made by PERSON while they were in GPE .", "CARDINAL . R.C. , a journalist , stated that TIME and DATE . he had seen PERSON in GPE . A little while later , sometime between CARDINAL p.m. and CARDINAL p.m. , he had seen the applicant and GPE and had spoken to them for TIME . At around that time , plain - clothed individuals had taken Tofiq Yaqublu to the police station . After the applicant and PERSON had left the town , between about TIME and TIME there had been a new round of clashes between the protesters and the police .", "CARDINAL .

Q.M. , a journalist , stated that he had arrived in GPE at TIME , together with ORG . The latter had been taken to the police station TIME . There had been no rioting or clashes with the police at that time . He had not seen the applicant at all while he had been in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court also examined various material evidence , including video recordings and photographs of the events ; inspection reports of damage to ORG , a house owned by the head of IDEA , several burned cars and scooters , public light fixtures , and other public and private property ; and property documents showing , inter alia , that V.A. had property rights to the hotel . It appears that one of the formal inspections of the damaged property was conducted from CARDINAL a.m. to TIME on DATE , in the presence of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as an attesting witness .", "CARDINAL . As for the injuries to police officers during the events of CARDINAL and DATE , the court took note of CARDINAL forensic reports dated DATE documenting various injuries sustained by QUANTITY police officers on either CARDINAL or DATE , and a record of CARDINAL DATE showing that CARDINAL more injured police officer had been admitted to hospital on DATE . None of these CARDINAL injured police officers were the same as the six who had allegedly been hit by stones on TIME DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The court ordered forensic examinations in respect of allegations of ill - treatment by a number of the accused , including ORG and PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE above ) . According to the forensic reports issued on DATE ( a year after the events in question ) , no injuries had been found on them . The court questioned QUANTITY police officers named by the accused in connection with the alleged ill - treatment , all of whom denied that the accused had been ill - treated . The court noted that the majority of the accused , except CARDINAL , had not complained of ill - treatment before being heard at the trial hearings . A criminal complaint by CARDINAL of the accused had been examined by ORG and dismissed . In such circumstances , the court concluded that the GPE allegations of ill - treatment were ill - founded .", "DATE . In so far as directly relevant to the specific charges against the applicant , the court examined the following evidence .", "CARDINAL . According to the description given in the court \u2019s judgment , a video recording of DATE showed the applicant and Tofiq Yaqublu \u201c standing in the centre of the town of GPE , opposite to the administrative building of ORG , at a place where acts of mass disorder had been committed \u201d . The description did not specify the time of day when that scene had been shot .", "CARDINAL . Another set of video recordings of the events of DATE showed a group of local residents in the centre of the town , in GPE NORP Street and GPE FAC , blocking the roads , shouting slogans and disobeying repeated orders by the police to disperse . The same video contained scenes showing ORG and GPE throwing stones at the police and encouraging others in the crowd to do the same and to disobey the police . There was also a scene showing a police officer ( who was not CARDINAL of the officers who claimed to have been injured on TIME DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) ) getting injured by a stone and leaving the area limping . Lastly , the video showed the police using a water cannon against the crowd and the protesters dispersing in various directions . The description of the above recordings did not specify the time of day when those scenes had been shot .", "CARDINAL . The court also examined the applicant \u2019s mobile phone geolocalisation records for DATE . They indicated that at CARDINAL p.m. he had been within the zone of the antenna in the town of GPE ; at TIME the antenna in the village of ORG in the GPE region ; at TIME , TIME , TIME , TIME and TIME \u2013 the antenna on FAC in the town of GPE ; at TIME the antenna in the village of PERSON in the GPE region ; at TIME the antenna in LOC ; and at TIME an antenna in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court further examined the content of the applicant \u2019s blog post ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the content of the telephone interview he had given to ORG between TIME and TIME on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The court also examined information given by ORG RPD and the MNS , described in the judgment as follows :", "\u201c According to letter no . CARDINAL of ORG dated DATE , on DATE , at places where people were densely gathered in front of ORG in GPE , [ Tofiq Yaqublu ] , together with [ the applicant ] , incited people to make assertions against the ORG and government bodies and their activities .", "According to letter of CARDINAL of ORG dated DATE , on DATE [ Tofiq Yaqublu and the applicant ] were in GPE and called on residents to resist the police , to block roads ... and to commit other similar acts aimed at disturbing social and political stability . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers applied to the trial court with a number of requests , in particular :", "( a ) that the applicant be released from pre - trial detention , with reference to LAW and various provisions of domestic law ( this request was similar to the one lodged at the preliminary hearing ) ;", "( b ) that various pieces of evidence against the applicant obtained at the pre - trial stage be declared inadmissible , including statements by a number of prosecution witnesses ( including those mentioned in DATE and CARDINAL above ) on the grounds that they had been unlawfully obtained , and the letters from the ORG RPD and the MNS ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on the grounds that they contained information that had not been verified independently by the prosecution authorities ( this request was also similar to the one lodged at the preliminary hearing ) ;", "( c ) that additional witnesses for the defence be heard ( including GPE , GPE , and ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) ) and other additional evidence ( inter alia , contemporaneous media reports concerning the events of DATE ) be examined ; and", "( d ) that the hearings be held in a larger courtroom which could accommodate media representatives .", "CARDINAL . The court examined those requests at the hearing held on CARDINAL DATE and decided : ( a ) NORP to reject the request for release on the grounds that the applicant \u2019s circumstances had not changed ; ( b ) to reject the request concerning the inadmissibility of the evidence produced by the prosecution , on the grounds that it was ill - founded ; ( c ) to postpone the examination of the request for admission of additional evidence , because it was not sufficiently substantiated ; and ( d ) to reject the request to change the hearing venue , because media representatives were able to attend the hearings in the current venue .", "DATE . It appears from the transcript of the hearing of CARDINAL DATE that there was a verbal altercation between the applicant and PERSON on one side , and some prosecution witnesses on the other , and that the presiding judge called the accused to order on several occasions . The judge also issued a warning to one of the applicant \u2019s lawyers , PERSON , for loudly objecting to the court \u2019s decisions to reject the defence \u2019s requests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having consulted the transcript of the preliminary hearing , the applicant \u2019s lawyers applied to the court to amend some of the wording used in the transcript to describe the applicant \u2019s statement during the preliminary hearing to the effect that he considered the trial to be a sham and did not accept the trial court as a fair tribunal . On CARDINAL DATE the court held that the transcript had been correct and that the amendments proposed had the purpose of justifying the applicant \u2019s and his lawyers\u2019 disrespectful attitude towards the court during the preliminary hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for access to the transcripts of the trial hearings , arguing that under LAW , the transcript of each hearing had to be drafted within DATE of the hearing and made available to the parties within DATE . The court rejected the request , ruling that the transcripts should be made available to the parties not after each trial hearing , but after the completion of the trial . On DATE the court reiterated its position on that matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE one of the applicant \u2019s lawyers applied to the court to terminate the participation in the trial as \u201c victims of crime \u201d of CARDINAL police officers who had allegedly been hit by stones during TIME CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He claimed that the decision granting them victim status had been unsubstantiated . In support of the request , the lawyer argued that all of those police officers had first been questioned DATE after the events by the same investigator . He further argued that it had not been shown that the police officers had sustained any injuries , and that there were no forensic reports in this respect . Moreover , having been given victim status , unlike regular witnesses , those persons had been present in the courtroom throughout the entire trial , giving them an ability to coordinate their statements , not only with each other but with other prosecution witnesses .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the above - mentioned application was dismissed by the court .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s lawyers , Mr F. Agayev , lodged a second objection to the composition of the court , arguing , inter alia , that the court was biased : it had rejected all of the defence \u2019s requests and created obstacles to the proper questioning of \u201c fake witnesses \u201d by the defence . The court dismissed the objection , finding , inter alia , that it was ill - founded , that the reasons for the objection were artificial and unsubstantiated , and that it appeared to have been lodged with the purpose of delaying the trial . The court also imposed a fine on the lawyer in the amount of CARDINAL NORP manats ( NORP ) , under LAW ORG , for disrupting the court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers applied to the court to admit and examine as evidence contemporaneous reports by various news agencies , including ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and Trend , showing that no clashes had been reported to be happening in GPE at the time the applicant was there . It appears that this request was rejected .", "CARDINAL . After ORG had delivered its judgment ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) , on DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers and on DATE the applicant himself applied for access to the transcripts of the court hearings . On CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE the applicant was given access to the transcripts for a total of TIME . It appears that CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s lawyers , Mr PERSON , was not given access to the transcripts because he had refused the demand by a court clerk to hand over all of the technical devices he had been carrying ( his mobile phone , tablet , and so on ) which could have been used to photograph pages of the transcripts . He had refused that demand on the grounds that there were CARDINAL volumes of transcripts ( a total of CARDINAL pages ) and that there was not enough time to properly consult them without the use of technical devices . It appears from the documents in the case file that the applicant \u2019s other lawyer , PERSON , was given access to the transcripts for an unspecified period of time . However , he was not allowed to make copies of the transcripts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG his remarks concerning the transcripts of the trial hearings , of which he had time to read CARDINAL pages . He alleged that in a number of instances various statements by witnesses had been distorted or misrepresented in the transcripts in a manner unfavourable to him . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the court refused to accept the applicant \u2019s remarks , holding that the transcripts were accurate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG for Serious Crimes delivered its judgment , deciding as follows .", "CARDINAL . As to the accused whose allegations of ill - treatment were considered to be ill - founded ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court decided to take into account their pre - trial statements , in which they had admitted the factual accusations against them , as more truthful than their statements at the trial hearings , in which they had pleaded not guilty and claimed to have been illtreated at the pre - trial stage .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the other accused and witnesses who had given differing statements at the pre - trial stage and during the trial hearings , including the police officer who had retracted his pre - trial statement ( see paragraph DATE above ) and the accused ORG and GPE , the court decided to take into account the pre - trial statements as being more \u201c truthful and objective \u201d , reasoning that the statements they had made later at the trial hearings , which had been more favourable to the accused , had been inconsistent with other evidence and had been designed to help the accused \u201c avoid criminal liability \u201d .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the accusations against the applicant in particular , the court found as follows .", "CARDINAL . The statements of prosecution witnesses , video recordings and other evidence proved that there had been mass disorder in GPE DATE TIME on DATE , that the applicant had been in GPE at that time , and that , together with PERSON , he had incited local residents , including ORG and GPE , to commit those violent acts of mass disorder , threatening the lives and health of CARDINAL police officers .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that the statements made by the applicant on his blog ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and in his interview to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) also proved that , even before traveling to GPE , he had had an \u201c intention to organise mass disorder \u201d and that , when in GPE , he was guilty of inciting people to commit acts of disorder and to disobey the police .", "CARDINAL . As to the statements of witnesses GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , who had said that there had been no clashes between protesters and the police in the town at that time and that neither the applicant nor Tofiq Yaqublu had incited anyone to violence or disobedience , the court found that there were inconsistencies in their statements . In particular , the court found as follows :", "\u201c However , [ Q.M. ] stated that , after he had greeted [ the applicant ] , he had gone to sleep in the car . In fact , he had not known the whereabouts of [ the applicant and Tofiq Yaqublu ] during that period of time . [ M.K. ] stated that , after getting out of the car , Tofiq Yaqublu had gone on foot towards the building of the IDEA , whereas during the pre - trial investigation [ M.K. ] had stated that [ GPE ] had left them , that he himself had frequently changed his location in order to record the people moving around in the square , that he had separated from PERSON , that Tofiq Yaqublu had been at another place , that [ another journalist ] had been taking photos , that [ ORG , the Head of the IDEA ] had started to give an interview at that time , and that , when he had been going for the interview , PERSON ... had been arrested and taken away by plain - clothed individuals . [ ORG ] stated that Tofiq Yaqublu had been arrested before the interview given by [ the Head of the IDEA ] , while [ PERSON ] stated that the interview ... had lasted TIME at most and that , during that period of time , he had not been aware of the whereabouts of [ the applicant ] and PERSON . As it can be seen from the above , the witnesses who stated that they had been next to [ the applicant ] and PERSON at all times concealed the essence of the matter by giving contradictory statements . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The court found that the statements by those witnesses were favourable to the applicant and PERSON because those witnesses knew the defendants personally and wanted to \u201c help them avoid criminal liability \u201d . Their statements were not accepted as \u201c objective , sincere and truthful \u201d because they were \u201c incompatible with the facts of the case and contradicted the irrefutable evidence \u201d of the applicant \u2019s guilt .", "CARDINAL . The court further found that , likewise , the applicant \u2019s and Tofiq ORG \u2019s statements at the trial hearings claiming that there had been no mass disorder while they had been in GPE did not reflect the actual circumstances , and had been made in order to \u201c avoid criminal liability \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG for Serious Crimes convicted the applicant under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The other defendants were also found guilty as charged and given sentences ranging from DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , with some sentences being conditional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s lawyers , Mr F. Agayev , lodged an appeal against the judgment of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The lawyer pointed out at the outset that at the time of lodging the appeal , neither a full copy of the text of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE nor the transcripts of the trial hearings had yet been made available to him .", "CARDINAL . The lawyer argued that the applicant had been convicted following a sham trial by a court which had tried him from a position of \u201c presumption of guilt \u201d throughout the entire proceedings . The applicant \u2019s visit to ORG , as an opposition politician , to find out the reasons for the events of DATE had been used by the Government as an excuse to punish him for his legitimate political criticism , a decision which had been taken long before the ORG events .", "CARDINAL . The rights of the defence had been seriously restricted in that the majority of their well - founded requests and objections had been routinely dismissed ; the defence had not been given adequate access to trial transcripts and some of the evidence ( including some video material ) ; the defence lawyers had not been allowed to use various technical devices , such as laptop and tablet computers , during the trial hearings , and so on .", "CARDINAL . The formal accusations against the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) had been written in a manner which did not comply with the norms of the NORP language , making it difficult to understand exactly what the applicant was accused of . The factual allegations against him were unclear and did not fit the elements of the criminal offences proscribed under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . Given that the applicant had been in GPE for TIME and had no prior personal acquaintance with anyone implicated in the riots of the previous night , it was highly improbable DATE and even physically impossible \u2013 for him to have \u201c organised \u201d mass disorder within such a short time frame , as described in the formal accusations .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant had been accused and convicted of organising an outbreak of mass disorder which had never happened . All the reliable and meaningful evidence produced at the trial had clearly shown that there had been no acts of mass disorder during TIME DATE while the applicant was in the town .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , all video recordings and other relevant material evidence showed that there had been no clashes with the police in TIME CARDINAL DATE and that the applicant had not incited anyone to violence or disobedience .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , a video recording originally taken from the website of ORG , operated by an NGO named ORG ( \u201c the LOC \u201d ) , had been edited before its examination by the court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . As to the parts of the video showing clashes between protesters and the police ( it appears that , here , the lawyer referred to the scenes described in paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it was clear from the size and direction of the shadows cast by buildings , people and other objects that the video had been shot during TIME . That fact had been additionally confirmed by the chairman of the LOC in a letter dated DATE . The full , unedited version of the video attached to the letter contained scenes shot during TIME DATE showing numerous police vehicles on FAC advancing in the direction of the IDEA building with no protesters present . Then it showed the applicant , GPE and GPE standing near ORG and calmly talking to each other , with no one else in the vicinity . Afterwards , Tofiq Yaqublu could be seen talking to GPE and CARDINAL others ( it appears that the above scenes correspond to the scenes described in paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Then , it showed PERSON being taken by the police to a car and driven away . Later , an interview with the head of the LAW was shown . Throughout the entire video , the situation in the town during TIME DATE was calm and under the control of the police .", "ORG . A video made available by the ORG newspaper showed the absence of any clashes between protesters and the police during TIME CARDINAL DATE . According to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , the firstinstance court added that video to the case file but , for unexplained reasons , decided not to use it as evidence .", "CARDINAL . A third video that was examined during the trial had been recorded by a camera installed on the GPE building , directed at the area of GPE FAC near the building of ORG . From that angle , if any crowd had passed in the vicinity of ORG and headed towards the IDEA building , it would certainly have been reflected in the recording . However , the parts of the video corresponding to the period TIME on DATE did not show any crowd or even a small group of protesters in that area .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s mobile phone geo - localisation records showed that he had left the town of ORG by TIME Similarly , Tofiq ORG \u2019s mobile phone geo - localisation records showed that he had left the town by TIME", "CARDINAL . On several occasions the defence had requested the trial court to examine a number of contemporaneous news reports by various information agencies , television and radio stations , and other mass - media sources which had closely followed the ORG events . None of them had reported any unrest happening in GPE in TIME CARDINAL DATE and had only reported clashes happening in TIME , starting at TIME However , the court had rejected the defence \u2019s requests to examine that material .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the applicant \u2019s version of the events was strongly corroborated by the statements of Tofiq GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , ORG and others . They had all stated that there had been no clashes during TIME DATE and that the applicant had not incited anyone to commit any acts of disorder . Those statements were mutually consistent and were also corroborated by all the material evidence , as described above .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the accused , ORG and GPE , had both stated that there had been unrest in GPE during TIME of DATE , but that they had both been out of town during the afternoon . Neither the investigating authorities nor the court had bothered to check their alibis . Their statements also indirectly corroborated the applicant \u2019s version of the events , namely that there had been no unrest during TIME CARDINAL DATE . Also , both of them had alleged before the court that they had been ill - treated by the investigating authorities with the aim of obtaining statements incriminating the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Three police officers had mentioned in their statements that there had been no unrest during TIME DATE . CARDINAL police officer had testified that he had been injured by a stone during the morning . Their statements also corroborated the applicant \u2019s version of the events .", "CARDINAL . As to the witnesses who had testified against the applicant , the majority of them were police officers . Their statements were contradictory , false , inconsistent in various details ( such as , for example , the time and exact locations where they had seen the applicant and PERSON ) and conflicted with all the video recordings and other material evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the assertion that CARDINAL police officers had been hit by stones on TIME DATE was false . None of those police officers had reported being injured or hit by stones immediately or soon after the alleged incident . All of them had been recognised as \u201c victims of crime \u201d and questioned by the prosecution for the first time CARDINAL and DATE , DATE after the events . There had been no medical evidence of their injuries . By contrast , the injuries sustained by CARDINAL police officers on DATE and during TIME of DATE had been promptly documented either on DATE or DATE . In such circumstances , it was clear that the above - mentioned QUANTITY police officers had given false testimony against the applicant . The applicant had formally applied to the court to exclude them from the trial as \u201c victims of crime \u201d , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . When cross - examined by the defence at a trial hearing , CARDINAL of the above - mentioned QUANTITY police officers had been unable to name the personnel of the police unit to which he had been deployed and , until assisted by a prosecutor , could not pinpoint his own exact location in GPE at the time when he had allegedly seen the applicant . When the defence lawyer had tried to get him to show , on an official map of GPE , exactly where he had seen the applicant and Tofiq Yaqublu standing and inciting the crowd , the presiding judge had forbidden the use of the map . When the defence lawyer had then asked the police officer to describe his location with reference to various landmarks next to ORG , the presiding judge had dismissed the question . The defence lawyer had then lodged a second objection to the composition of the trial court . In response , the presiding judge had decided , firstly , to leave the objection unexamined and , secondly , to fine the lawyer in the amount of AZN CARDINAL for having lodged an allegedly unsubstantiated objection designed to delay the hearing . Thereafter , the defence lawyers for all of the accused had been dissuaded from lodging any further objections , having been clearly shown that doing so would be meaningless .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , other police officers had been unable to answer the defence \u2019s questions seeking clarification , or had given statements that differed significantly from their pre - trial statements , only to radically revert back to their pre - trial statements immediately after a break in the hearing announced by the court . On some occasions , the court had dismissed police officers from the witness stand before the defence could complete the crossexamination .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , at the trial one of the police officers ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had retracted the written statement he had signed at the pre - trial stage , stating that everything in it had been a product of an investigator \u2019s imagination .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s lawyer argued that , at the trial hearings , witness PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had stated that he had seen only about CARDINAL people in the town centre between about CARDINAL p.m. and TIME on DATE , and that , although he had seen the applicant and PERSON among them , he had not heard what they had been talking about with the people around them .", "CARDINAL . The lawyer further argued that ORG was a \u201d fake witness \u201d engaged by the police and claimed that both witnesses ORG and GPE had given knowingly false and contradictory statements as described in DATE above .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the applicant \u2019s lawyer argued that a proper assessment of the available evidence clearly showed that , contrary to the prosecution \u2019s version of the facts , there had been no acts of mass disorder at the time when the applicant had been in the town ( DATE ) and that some clashes between protesters and the police had taken place TIME before he had arrived in the town ( CARDINAL a.m. and TIME ) and TIME after he had left the town ( after TIME ) . Statements given by the prosecution witnesses , to the contrary , had been shown to be contradictory , unreliable or false , and uncorroborated by the available material evidence . Accordingly , there was no corpus delicti in respect of the criminal offences for which the applicant had been convicted .", "CARDINAL . Before the examination of the appeal , on DATE the applicant applied to ORG for access to the remaining part of the transcripts of the trial hearings for consultation . His request was granted and the date for his consultation of the transcripts was scheduled for DATE . However , on CARDINAL and DATE he lodged CARDINAL applications withdrawing his previous request and , instead , asking for a speedy examination of his appeal .", "CARDINAL .

The crowd around the area where the government bodies are located has been growing and tension remains.\u2019 At TIME he reported that \u2018 ... despite the engagement of additional forces , the crowd is growing on the streets where the government bodies are located and around them . According to local rumours , the protest , which started in the town centre DATE , would continue TIME after ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also referred to , as evidence , the letters from the ORG RPD and the MNS , as described in the first - instance judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The judgment continued as follows :", "\u201c The court does not accept as evidence the statements of witnesses [ GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ] that there were no riots DATE on DATE and the statements of [ the applicant and PERSON ] that they did not incite the public to riot or resist the police , that there were no riots between CARDINAL p.m. and TIME on DATE , and that they spent TIME in GPE .", "In particular , [ GPE ] stated that , after he had greeted [ the applicant ] , he had gone to sleep in the car and , in fact , had not known the whereabouts of [ the applicant and PERSON ] during that period of time . [ PERSON ] stated that , after getting out of the car , Tofiq Yaqublu had gone on foot towards the building of the IDEA , while during the pre - trial investigation [ M.K. ] had stated that [ GPE ] had left them , that he himself had frequently changed his location in order to record the people moving around in the square , that he had separated from PERSON , that Tofiq Yaqublu had been at another place , that [ another journalist ] had been taking photos , that [ the head of the LAW ] had started to give an interview at that time , and that , when he had been going for the interview , PERSON ... had been arrested and taken away by plain - clothed individuals . [ ORG ] stated that Tofiq Yaqublu had been arrested before the interview given by [ the head of the IDEA ] , while [ PERSON ] stated that the interview ... had lasted TIME at most and that , during that period of time , he had not been aware of the whereabouts of [ the applicant ] and PERSON . As it can be seen from the above , the witnesses who stated that they had been next to [ the applicant ] and PERSON at all times , concealed the essence of the matter by giving conflicting statements . Moreover , in his interview to ... PERSON given from CARDINAL to CARDINAL.CARDINAL p.m. on DATE , Tofiq PERSON stated that \u2018 [ he had been ] detained at the police station for TIME ... [ He had been ] taken to [ PERSON \u2019s ] office at the police station [ who alleged that Tofiq Yaqublu ] had come here to organise sabotage and to prepare people for more protests . [ The police were then reassured that Tofiq PERSON was indeed a columnist for a newspaper ] . For that reason , [ he ] was released.\u2019 This interview proves that PERSON was not taken to the police station without a reason , but that he was detained ... because of his actions aimed at disruption and sabotage . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court then noted that the statements of QUANTITY police officers , including QUANTITY of the CARDINAL alleged victims of crime ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and witnesses ORG , GPE and PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) indicated that TIME on DATE there was mass disorder in front of the building of ORG and that the applicant and PERSON had incited people to riot and resist the police .", "CARDINAL .

In respect of the witness statements favouring the applicant , the court concluded as follows :", "\u201c Having come to the same conclusion as the first - instance court , the court considers that ... the witnesses [ GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , and GPE ] wanted to help [ the applicant and Tofiq Yaqublu ] , whom they knew and had relations with , avoid criminal liability . The specific circumstances mentioned in their statements can not be accepted as objective , sincere and genuine because they do not fit the fconflict with other , irrefutable evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the video recording by the camera installed on the GPE building , the court assessed it as follows :", "\u201c The court holds that the statements of [ the applicant and Tofiq Yaqublu ] ... do not fit[Their ] statements ... are of a self - defence nature and designed to avoid criminal liability . As the main evidence proving their statements , they rely on the recording dated DATE of the video surveillance camera installed at the ATM of GPE , directed at PERSON FAC leading towards the administrative buildings of the IDEA and ORG . Although the recording shows that TIME the situation was relatively calm on that street , it is not the only street leading to the centre ( the IDEA [ building ] ) ; moreover , it can not be ruled out that individuals could have gone along that street towards the building of the [ IDEA ] CARDINAL - by - one and gathered there [ afterwards ] , or could have arrived in the centre from other directions . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the video evidence originally examined by the first - instance court , ORG mentioned the video recording showing the applicant and PERSON standing in the centre of the town of GPE , opposite to the administrative building of ORG , at a place where acts of mass disorder had been committed \u201d , without specifying the time of day when that scene had been shot ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . However , ORG did not mention any of the other video recordings of CARDINAL DATE relied on by the first - instance court , showing clashes between protesters and the police ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that , according to the information obtained from the first - instance court , throughout DATE on DATE fortyfour people had been arrested under LAW , including CARDINAL people arrested TIME The court concluded that this was an indication that the situation in the town had not been calm while the applicant was there .", "CARDINAL . The judgment continued as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant and Tofiq Yaqublu ] claimed that the evidence gathered by the prosecution against them had been false . As an example , they referred to the testimony of [ ORG ] who had participated , as an attesting witness , in the inspection of the scene of the events [ of the previous night ] from TIME on DATE , and had later testified that at TIME on DATE he had seen [ the applicant and PERSON inciting people to commit acts of disorder ] . [ They ] argue that [ R.N. ] is a person who cooperates with the police and that the police had instructed him to testify against them . However , the court holds that [ ORG \u2019s ] presence during the inspection of the scene of the events as an attesting witness does not make it impossible for him to have observed and witnessed an event occurring TIME . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The appellate court \u2019s judgment continued as follows :", "\u201c Being far from an intention to give an assessment of ORG position in its above - mentioned judgment , the court holds that , first of all , [ the applicant \u2019s and PERSON ] unlawful actions should be evaluated through the prism of the events that took place in GPE on DATE and DATE . That is so because those events constituted the reason and grounds for instituting criminal proceedings and the criminal prosecution of [ the applicant , PERSON ] and others .", "As described above , on CARDINAL and DATE in GPE , under the organisation and with the active participation of the accused persons , a crowd formed by a large number of residents spontaneously joined together and destroyed , by burning , and partly looted the building of ORG , destroying equipment and items found inside the building , as well as personal belongings of the hotel guests and staff ; [ they also destroyed , by burning , ] CARDINAL cars in the grounds of the hotel , damaged houses and cars on the streets with stones , [ and also destroyed , by burning , ] private property of people who had no connection to the events , and inflicted bodily injuries on individuals , including many police officers who were performing their official duty to restore public order .", "In connection with these events , on DATE criminal proceedings were instituted under ORG DATE , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of GPE and CARDINAL individuals were charged [ in the framework of those proceedings ] , over QUANTITY individuals were found administratively liable , and CARDINAL individuals were recognised as victims .", "The criminal events that occurred in GPE were the most widely covered news for DATE by both local and reputable foreign mass media . In other words , they were not ordinary events that happened in GPE .", "In connection with the participation of [ the applicant ] in those events and the criminal offences committed by him , as well as the evidence concerning those offences , the court finds it necessary to reiterate once more the following .", "Although [ the applicant ] states that he arrived in GPE at TIME and left before TIME on DATE , examination of the detailed invoice of his incoming and outgoing mobile calls , and his blog post of CARDINAL DATE , where he shared his impressions from his trip by writing \u2018 DATE I was in GPE for a little more than TIME together with another member of our movement ( REAL ) and a media PERSON , proves that on DATE [ the applicant ] was in GPE from TIME to TIME", "[ The applicant ] insists that , when he was in GPE , there was no mass disorder there .
