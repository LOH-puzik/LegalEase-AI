Immediately upon his arrival we started to get to know each other and to talk and I told him right away for which criminal offence I was detained , but at the beginning he did not want to tell me what he was accused of . In our discussions we had an argument about a defence lawyer in the present case , since the same counsel was defending us both , and I did not like the fact that the accused had criticised her .", "Sometime in DATE , I do not remember the exact date , PERSON was also transferred to the same room from FAC . I immediately noticed that the accused and PERSON greeted each other as if they had known each other for a long time . The bed occupied by PERSON was in the middle , that is to say , between the one that I occupied and the one occupied by the accused . There were CARDINAL inmates in the room , and they often changed .", "Since the bed occupied by the accused was next to the one occupied by PERSON and the distance between the beds was TIME QUANTITY , they often talked to each other . They firstly talked about the occupation of PERSON in GPE . I mostly heard these conversations when lying on my bed reading the newspapers and doing crossword puzzles . I remember clearly that the accused and PERSON started to discuss the criminal offence PERSON was accused of and I remember that PERSON had bought a car somewhere near ORG , which had been stolen , and PERSON and his wife and another person had been arrested on that account . PERSON had stayed in detention while his wife had been released .

Also , ORG said that he had been dealing in smuggled cars , licence plates and car insurance documents and that he had bought a machine in GPE for identifying the codes of expensive cars .", "From their conversations I heard that the accused had family in PERSON and that they knew each other from PERSON . I also remember that PERSON said that the man from whom he had bought the car had died . He said that it was lucky that he had died because otherwise it would have been discovered how he had committed a criminal offence . Another inmate , PERSON , reacted to that story since he knew the man who had died .", "After that the CARDINAL of them started to talk about the mobile telephone . PERSON said that he had gone to PERSON with PERSON I do not know that person DATE and that they had waited for a long time for a woman to return to the house , a woman who had left the house with CARDINAL child or more children \u2013 I did not understand this very well . I also heard them saying that they had no knowledge about the third person in that house . I remember that they said that they had waited to enter the house , and that the wife of the accused had also been there and that it [ sic ] concerned a money exchange office where a childhood friend of the accused had worked . From what PERSON was saying , I understood that he was worried and I remember the accused telling him that a woman , who was the key prosecution witness in the proceedings , had changed her statement in their favour . They also discussed the money and I remember PERSON saying that he would pay for the defence of the accused and they also mentioned that the first lawyer who had defended the accused in these proceedings had later on engaged the services of lawyer PERSON", "After I left the [ ORG Hospital , I contacted FAC and they asked if I wished to be a witness in the proceedings against the accused and I told them that I firstly wished to consult lawyer PERSON , who was both my defence counsel and the defence counsel of the accused . I consulted her and she came to visit me to prison and asked me if I knew anything about the event at issue . I told her that the accused had said that he had been found out as a result of what his wife had been telling [ other people ] in the town and the lawyer asked me for whom I was working . I told her that I did not work for anyone and that I had decided to testify because of the children who had been left behind . The lawyer told me to be careful what I was saying and that I might be \u2018 swallowed by the ORG . She said that when I mentioned the name S.", "I would also like to add that I heard the accused and PERSON saying that later on it had been a problem for them to reach PERSON and that PERSON and the wife of the accused had crossed the state border at PERSON because the wife of the accused had to return the mobile telephone of the accused back to GPE , while PERSON crossed the state border in PERSON . PERSON and the wife of the accused had taken the money and CARDINAL mobile telephones , while the accused had returned to ORG . They took mobile telephones to GPE because they wanted to send signals to ORG .

It was a DATE , visiting time and both the accused and PERSON had visitors . PERSON returned TIME before the accused . The door of the room was open and I saw PERSON waving to someone from the open window in the hall . I approached the window to see who he was waving at and I also asked him about it and he said that he was waving at his wife . I saw the car in which his wife had arrived , it was a LOC , and I asked him how come his wife was driving such a car , since he had been bragging that he dealt in expensive cars , and he told me that the car belonged to someone in GPE who had driven his wife there for the visit and that that man was carrying money to finance the accused \u2019s defence .

Witness PERSON gave his evidence on CARDINAL occasions ; his statements were all identical in their essential part and could not have been invented , because he described small details relating to both the time before as well as after the events which correspond to the established facts .", "Neither has this court found any reason why witness ORG would testify against the first and the second accused , whom he did not know from before and had met for the first time in FAC . It has not been established that he benefited in any manner [ from giving his evidence ] . The psychiatric report on ORG does not show that he suffers from a mental illness . [ It shows that ] his intellectual level is normal and therefore the veracity of his evidence has not been called into question in any manner . The accountability of witness ORG as an accused in other criminal proceedings was diminished , but not to a significant extent . It was diminished on account of him being drunk at the time of the crime . Against this background , this court entirely accepts the evidence of witness ORG as reliable .", "Although there is no material evidence of the participation of the second accused in the criminal offence at issue , and since his participation became known only at DATE , there is the evidence given by witness ORG , who stated that the second accused had been a perpetrator of the criminal offence at issue and who described the participation of the second accused in detail . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his appeal the applicant argued that the evidence given by ORG had been unreliable owing to his personality disorder and that his statements given before the investigating judge and at the trial were contradictory and illogical . Thus , he said that the applicant and ORG had had secret conversations and had spoken in lowered voices . If the conversations had been secret , then they would not have been conducted within the hearing of a third person . As regards the placement of their respective beds , in his statement before the investigating judge ORG said that the bed occupied by ORG had been in the middle , between the bed occupied by the applicant and the witness , while at the trial he said that the bed occupied by the applicant had been in the middle . As regards the time of the alleged secret conversations between the applicant and GPE , ORG firstly claimed that they mostly took place in TIME and at the hearing held on DATE he said that they took place in the evening , after dinner . It was improbable and unconvincing that CARDINAL perpetrators of such grave criminal offences would discuss the details of these offences in front of a third person . ORG also mentioned that a woman , the key prosecution witness in the proceedings , had altered her previous statement in favour of the accused . However , there had been no such witness in the proceedings . He also repeatedly stated that a person with the surname PERSON had also been implicated in the murder of the CARDINAL people in question . However , the person of that name was actually one of the murder victims . ORG had no personal direct knowledge of the murders at issue . When giving his evidence at the trial he constantly repeated the phrase \u2018 I ORG which could not be the basis for the applicant \u2019s conviction . The witness enclosed his so called \u201c notes \u201d , allegedly made during the conversations between him and PERSON However , these notes were a list of meaningless words . His statement was in contradiction to those given by inmates from the same room , PERSON and ORG Furthermore , there was no logic to the whole story and he ( the applicant ) had not even been to GPE in DATE , but had been living in GPE , GPE , where he had run his own business since DATE . He claimed that he had never met PERSON before . Finally , no material evidence found in the house where the murders had been committed had any connection with him . The applicant argued that the findings of the trial court had been completely arbitrary to the point that they ran contrary to common sense and the basic requirements of a fair trial .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . The relevant part of the judgment reads :", "\u201c The accused ORG in their respective appeals unsuccessfully try to challenge the evidence given by witness ORG However , contrary to their assertions , the first - instance court gave valid reasons for accepting the statement given by that witness and these reasons have not been called into question by the allegations in the appeals .", "It is firstly to be stated that the statement of witness ORG is not in contradiction with other evidence as the appellants wrongly claim . Witnesses PERSON and ORG , who gave more details about the circumstances in their room in ORG than witness PERSON , said that the accused ORG spent more time together than with other inmates , by which they disputed the defence put forward by the accused , in particular the allegation by ORG that he spoke to PERSON less than to the other inmates . The fact that the other inmates did not hear the conversations described by ORG does not cast doubt on that part of his statement , because witness PERSON said that he had regularly watched television , that ORG had mostly stayed in the room with PERSON and that PERSON , who had sometimes watched television , would soon return to the room . Thus , witness ORG , as it is indirectly shown from the statement of witness PERSON , often had the opportunity to be alone in the room with the accused while the other inmates were watching television and was able to hear the confidential conversations which they had obviously then held .", "The accused ORG claims in his appeal that it is improbable that the perpetrators of such crimes would meet after DATE in the same room in FAC and that it is excluded that , even if they met in such circumstances , they would discuss the crimes at issue in the presence of a third person . Such behaviour would be contradictory to the profiles of persons who conspired and planned to commit QUANTITY murders in a professional manner . He also argued that he had been at large for DATE and that in that period he would have had every chance to discuss the crimes at issue with the other perpetrator .", "However , [ this court finds ] that the accidental placement in the same room of persons who committed a criminal offence together can not be regarded as impossible . The accused PERSON was detained in connection with a criminal offence unrelated to the CARDINAL examined in these proceedings and was placed in FAC , which only has a couple of rooms in each ward . At that time he was not yet a suspect in respect of the criminal offences which were the subject of the proceedings conducted against ORG and therefore no formal obstacle existed for placing them in the same room .", "On the other hand , although the accused ORG had indeed been at large DATE ( when his detention was lifted ) and DATE ( when he was again detained ) it is certain that , since an appeal had been lodged against the first - instance judgment acquitting him ( that is to say that the criminal proceedings against him were still pending ) , he had a reason to avoid public and frequent contact with the accomplice , the accused Ajdari\u0107 . Finally , if the accused saw each other in that period and discussed the criminal offences they had committed , it is certain that after the judgment acquitting [ M.G. ] had been quashed and he had been detained , in view of these new circumstances and the development of the proceedings , they had something to discuss during their stay in ORG .", "The description of the conversations between the accused given by ORG is neither unconvincing nor illogical : the accused PERSON and PERSON , as described by ORG , conducted these conversations when all or at least most of the other inmates were absent , that is to say that they talked in secret as far as it was possible . It is obvious that because the accused talked in lowered voices about the criminal offences in question the witness S.\u0160 did not hear all the details of their conversations . This is precisely why the parts of the statement given by witness ORG in which he reconstructs the content of these conversations on the basis of the parts of these conversations that he had heard do not fit with the facts established on the basis of the other evidence . Thus , witness S.\u0160 obviously wrongly understood the role of PERSON , whom the accused had mentioned . However , if the evidence given by ORG had been false , as suggested by the accused ORG in his appeal , and had relied on facts from the newspapers , he surely would not have mentioned PERSON in the same context , since this is not shown in the previous proceedings .", "Contrary to the allegations in the appeal by accused ORG , on all CARDINAL occasions when he gave his statement witness ORG reproduced the words and sentences from the conversations of the accused in relative detail , and certain illogical details in his statements , stressed in the appeal by the accused PERSON , actually contradict the argument in that appeal that his statement had been fabricated , that the witness had been following instructions and had been told what to say . The accused did not specify who had [ supposedly ] instructed the witness and in whose interest that would be . Lastly , had the statement of that witness been fabricated and had he memorised it according to someone \u2019s instructions , it would be expected that the memorised statement would be entirely in accordance with all the other evidence . It is precisely the contradictions about certain events ( allegations of witness ORG about the telephone call on a mobile telephone from GPE , participation of S. and similar ) that show that his statement was not fabricated and [ that he was not ] following instructions .", "The accused also point to the character of witness ORG and stress the part of the psychiatric opinion drawn up in the proceedings against him which states that he has a histrionic personality disorder , on the basis of which [ the accused ] concluded that he is inclined to fabricating stories . However , the accused ignore other conclusions of that report according to which the intellectual capacity of ORG is within normal limits and there are no indications of mental illness .", "Against the above background , there was no need for a further psychiatric examination of witness ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Witness PERSON , contrary to the other inmates , was often alone in the room with the accused and was thus able to hear their confidential conversations , which is in accordance with the statements given by witnesses PERSON and ORG , who also gave evidence about the events in FAC , and on whose statements both accused rely in their appeals . They said , inter alia , that the accused had spent more time together than with the other inmates , by which they rebutted the defence argument of the accused , in particular that of PERSON , who said that he had talked to the accused PERSON Witness PERSON also confirmed that the accused and witness ORG had not watched television regularly because the accused ORG had mostly stayed in the room , while the accused PERSON and witness ORG had watched television only occasionally . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
