A General Practitioner ( \u201c GP \u201d , who treated her from DATE ) later certified to the Inquest that it was not clear whether she was a chaotic individual with a long history of substance abuse or whether there was evidence of psychotic illness . A psychiatric nurse certified to the Inquest that she was unsettled and agitated expressing paranoid ideation and suspicious thoughts and that most of her problems appeared to be caused by long - standing substance abuse .", "CARDINAL . Because no recall notice had issued as regards CARDINAL of the CARDINAL warrants from ORG , in DATE ORG officers circulated , in error , PERSON details on ORG ( \u201c LAW ) citing a failure to surrender to the warrant . In short , that warrant was , erroneously , now recorded as \u201c outstanding \u201d whereas it had been dealt with by the GPE court in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was arrested in GPE for being drunk and disorderly . She was found guilty by a GPE court on DATE and a small fine was imposed .", "CARDINAL . During that process , a ORG search revealed the warrant erroneously described as outstanding . She was re - arrested on DATE and , on DATE , transferred to GPE ( GPE station ) , arriving at CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c PCO \u201d ) obtained a copy of the \u201c outstanding \u201d warrant and approved her custody at CARDINAL . He asked her a number of standard questions including those to determine her state of health and well - being . She replied in the negative when asked if she needed any assistance and whether she was suffering from any medical condition , illness or injury . Although she was acting appropriately and calmly , she had medication in her possession and the ORG referred her to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The ORG examined PERSON at CARDINAL , took her history ( she was open about her history of drugs and alcohol abuse ) and noted her medication ( valium and an anti - psychotic medication ) . The ORG advised her and the ORG how the medication should be taken . She was assessed as calm and fit to be detained . The ORG also advised her of her right to consult a solicitor free of charge and to inform someone of her arrest . She spoke with a solicitor by telephone and later ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) he consulted with her at the police station . She was detained TIME .", "CARDINAL . She was transported TIME ( CARDINAL November ) to the GPE court . At CARDINAL it was discovered that the warrant was not valid and she was released from custody , although she stayed in the building . ORG informed the on - duty probation officer , who happened to know PERSON and her background , and who , in turn , informed PERSON . A solicitor ( from the law firm which represented her but who did not know her ) also consulted with her and , having been informed by a \u201c prison custody officer \u201d that there was no valid warrant , the solicitor also confirmed this to her . The solicitor saw her around CARDINAL.CARDINAL and at TIME and informed her that arrangements would be made by the probation officer for a travel warrant to be issued for her to return home to GPE . Since she was not under formal probation supervision , her travel could not be funded by the probation service and the probation officer set about obtaining it from court funds . PERSON insisted on going to a friend \u2019s house in GPE rather than home : her solicitor and the probation officer agreed . The travel warrant to GPE from court funds was approved at CARDINAL by a Stipendiary Magistrate . PERSON collected the travel warrant and , indicating that she knew the way to the bus station , left the court building . The probation officer and her solicitor considered her angry , frustrated and , at times , aggressive . While both believed that she might have been drinking , taking drugs or medication ( she had left the court building during DATE ) , neither considered that she needed medical assistance . According to his evidence at the Inquest , the probation officer did not consider her suicidal and he would have brought her to the bus station had he had cause for concern . PERSON called the applicant in a distressed state at CARDINAL : she expressed no suicidal intent .", "CARDINAL . PERSON did not go to GPE but remained in GPE TIME . TIME ( TIME ) she attended PERSON ( a registered charity ) where the manager knew her and she spent some time with a mental health project worker . She was not communicative . She telephoned her mother from FAC . The project worker also spoke to her mother and her mother explained her daughter \u2019s history and provided the number of her ORG in GPE . On the advice of the manager of ORG was referred to a drop - in ORG ( which PERSON knew ) that afternoon and her GPE in GPE was informed . The project worker gave PERSON the bus fare to ORG left in an improved mood .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL she attended ORG ( a ORG clinic ) . She saw a ORG who was also familiar with her history and who had consulted with her GPE in GPE before he saw her . She refused to take the medication prescription given to her . She was agitated , aggressive and expressing paranoid ideas , but not suicidal . She left ORG at CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL the police were called to attend when PERSON had collapsed in the street . Identification , but not medication , was found on her . She was unconscious with a weak pulse . An ambulance arrived and she was transported to hospital where she was pronounced dead at CARDINAL . The post - mortem examination confirmed that she died of a methadone overdose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an Inquest was opened and adjourned by the Coroner . It was resumed on DATE , after the coming into force of LAW DATE ( \u201c HRA \u201d ) . The Inquest lasted DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who was present and legally represented , argued that the Inquest should examine : who or what factor(s ) was responsible for the original execution of the warrant not being registered with the proper authorities ; who or what was responsible for incorrect details being entered on the ORG ; what , if any , safeguards existed to prevent the errors ; why there was no reference on LAW that came from the GPE police station to medication , drug abuse or self - harm ; what happened to her medication prior to her being discharged from custody ; who was responsible for securing basic financial , logistical and therapeutic support to a vulnerable woman who had been falsely imprisoned and unlawfully transported QUANTITY from her home , family and probation officer ; why was she left to die involuntarily , homeless , penniless and without sufficient medication ; and why were the CARDINAL treating doctors not able to take more effective action in dealing with her mental health difficulties on DATE of her death .", "CARDINAL . The Coroner did not allow the Inquest to cover such matters , the Inquest being limited to matters directly causative of death . Since PERSON had died before the entry into force of the ORG , the question \u201c how ... she came by her death \u201d ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b)(ii ) of the Coroner \u2019s Act DATE , \u201c the DATE LAW ) was considered by reference to the pre - ORG test ( NORP v. GPE , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] QB CARDINAL ) rather than by reference to the post - ORG \u201c ORG \u201d test ( ORG ) v. GPE [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL and PERSON ) v. GPE [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) . In CARDINAL exchange between Counsel for the applicant and the Coroner , the latter stated that it was within his remit to determine matters that were directly causative of death but not to enquire into every underlying circumstance which , however remotely , might be considered responsible for death . Accordingly , while the error in relation to the warrant was accepted , it was not the role of the Inquest to enquire into why or how that error had occurred .", "CARDINAL . The Coroner obtained a considerable amount of evidence about PERSON background and the events of DATE of her life . The ORG described his contact with the applicant on DATE . The applicant gave evidence mainly about her difficulty in obtaining information from the probation officer and the solicitor on TIME CARDINAL DATE . The solicitor and probation officer described their contacts with PERSON at the GPE court on TIME . The relevant medical personnel also described their contacts with her : the FAC at FAC as well as the mental health project worker at FAC and the doctor at ORG . The Coroner also read into the record reports detailing her symptoms and treatment from her GPE , community psychiatric nurse and the consultant psychiatrist , all of whom had treated her in GPE , . The police officer called to attend when she collapsed in the street and the pathologist who conducted the post - mortem examination also gave evidence .", "CARDINAL . The Coroner summed up the evidence . He then advised on matters of law , explaining , inter alia , that it was no part of the Inquest \u2019s role to apportion blame given section CARDINAL of the Coroner \u2019s Rules DATE ( \u201c the DATE Rules \u201d ) . He explained the CARDINAL standard questions in the Inquisition Form to which the jury had to respond . Items CARDINAL and CARDINAL concerned certain personal identifying details of the deceased . Item CARDINAL concerned the \u201c injury or disease causing death \u201d : the Coroner considered this to be \u201c crystal clear \u201d and that there was absolutely no dispute given the pathologist \u2019s conclusions ( \u201c Methadone , ORG and alcohol poisoning \u201d ) . Item CARDINAL concerned \u201c the time , place and circumstances at or in which injury was sustained \u201d : the Coroner explained that there was nothing to fill in since the deceased did not suffer any injuries . Item CARDINAL constituted the \u201c verdict \u201d and allowed CARDINAL possible conclusions : \u201c death by misadventure \u201d and \u201c an open verdict \u201d . The former was described as a situation where \u2018 an unlooked for or unintended fatal outcome arose from some voluntary act or actions of the deceased\u2019 . The latter ( open verdict ) was explained as the verdict which could be returned if the jury formed the view that the evidence \u201c did not fully disclose the means whereby the cause of death arose \u201d or if there was insufficient evidence to return a verdict of death by misadventure .", "CARDINAL . The jury found that the cause of death was \u201c methadone , diazepam and alcohol poisoning \u201d ( Item CARDINAL ) and it returned a verdict of death by misadventure ( Item CARDINAL ) . The Coroner then closed the Inquest as follows :", "\u201c From the evidence we heard , [ PERSON ] certainly needed help but there is no evidence to suggest that all the professionals , or indeed the health care professionals , had done anything other than acted in good faith , professionally and tried to help her within quite difficult circumstances . [ PERSON ] died as a result of a drug overdose , by her own volition , which is very sad and tragic indeed . Clearly , no one who had any knowledge of this tragic death could not but have the deepest sympathy for [ PERSON ] mother who clearly was at the end of her tether trying to do the best for her . Her frustration was compounded by the unfortunate \u2018 cock up\u2019 of the inappropriate warrant which then brought [ PERSON ] to GPE where she died . [ PERSON ] mother \u2019s distress and , indeed , palpable anger , was entirely understandable , and ORG at the very least , owe her a big apology indeed . No doubt there will be an inquiry into this matter , which is entirely outside of the remit of my court and I shall comment no more and ..... I wish them luck in their quest in seeking answers to address her concern . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to ORG ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) and a report was sent to her solicitors in DATE ( not submitted ) . ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) investigated and reported on the complaint in so far as it concerned the GPE area . Following a meeting with , among others , the applicant and her solicitors on DATE and other inquiries , the ORG issued a report dated DATE . It found that , while the probation officer was not required to supervise PERSON on DATE , he did all that was necessary to ensure a travel warrant was issued ; that the erroneous warrant for arrest was not a matter for the probation service but it would be raised by the ORG before ORG ; and that the ORG and the GPE court staff did as much as they could for PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG and GPE who conducted an investigation into the applicant \u2019s claims about the ORG and the PERSON . In the ORG \u2019s report of DATE he supported the conclusions of the ORG , finding that the probation staff had behaved professionally at the GPE court and had assisted PERSON as far as it was within their means to do so . On DATE the ORG \u2019s report found that the PERSON had fulfilled all of their obligations in respect of the conditions of the deferred sentence , noting that the relevant probation officer in GPE had gone above and beyond what was required of her .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also claimed to have made various complaints to the police which were \u201c unrecorded \u201d . She submitted that her appeal to ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) was \u201c upheld \u201d in DATE and that the ORG noted that the complaint might not be investigated because of the lapse of time since the incident . She referred to a letter of DATE wherein ORG declined to \u201c further investigate the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s complaints \u201d . The applicant also believed that she had unsuccessfully pursued complaints to ORG . No substantiating documents were submitted .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant ( who had legal aid ) applied to challenge the Inquest under LAW of LAW , arguing mainly that the Inquest failed to comply with LAW . Leave was granted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the case was dismissed by judgment of ORG . That court defined the key question as : where a Coroner conducted an Inquest into a pre - HRA death , was the approach to the question of \u201c how ... the deceased came by his death \u201d ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b)(ii ) of LAW ) to be considered by reference to the pre - HRA test ( a Jamieson Inquest ) or by reference to the post - HRA test ( a ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The High Court found that an Inquest into a pre - HRA death did not have to be LAW given the ORG judgment of ORG ( In re ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) . ORG concluded :", "\u201c ... I therefore conclude that the [ ORG ] does not require a Coroner now investigating a death which occurred before the coming into force of the [ ORG ] to conduct an inquest in an LAW compliant manner . It may be that his failure to do so may be actionable in international proceedings in GPE , just as the failure of the Secretary of ORG resulted in a successful application to GPE in ORG . However , that does not assist the claimant in the domestic context . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , the Coroner had retained and properly applied the correct PERSON requirements . Having noted the considerable amount of evidence obtained by the Coroner , ORG considered that the Coroner was \u201c undoubtedly entitled to conclude that , under the pre - HRA law , it was unnecessary for there to be a detailed investigation into how the warrant came to be executed erroneously . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In commenting on the final passage of the Coroner \u2019s speech closing the Inquest and , in concluding itself , ORG noted :", "\u201c ... I wish to associate myself with the deep sympathy expressed by the Coroner . I well appreciate that the claimant , as a loving parent , will continue to feel aggrieved by the scope of the inquest . It will be no consolation to her that if [ PERSON ] had died after DATE , different considerations would have applied to the parameters of the inquest . Sadly , however , the less generous law which applies to the inquest in the present case fails to provide her with all the answers to which she , understandably , feels entitled . I am sorry to say that her appeal must be dismissed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal to ORG was granted , the single judge noting that an intervening judgment of ORG was in the applicant \u2019s favour ( R.(Hurst ) v GPE LOC Coroner [ DATE ] EWCA CARDINAL ) . The applicant was legally aided and represented .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was therefore stayed pending the ORG of Lords\u2019 judgment in the PERSON case . On DATE that judgment was delivered ( R.(Hurst ) v GPE LOC [ DATE ] UKHL CARDINAL ) , ORG reversing ORG judgment and confirming that there was no duty on a Coroner to hold an Inquest complying with LAW in relation to a death that pre - dated the entry into force of the ORG even if the Inquest took place thereafter . Lord PERSON approved the judgment of ORG in the present applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , on DATE Counsel advised he applicant that her appeal had no prospects of success and should be withdrawn . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on a consent basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued civil proceedings for damages against a number of respondents , including the Greater London ORG , alleging negligence and false imprisonment as regards the arrest and detention of PERSON on the basis of an unlawful warrant . The case was stayed pending the above - described judicial review proceedings . Legal aid was discharged in DATE and the applicant acted in person when the case was re - activated thereafter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Greater London ORG agreed to compensate the applicant in the sum of MONEY ( \u201c GBP \u201d ) and for previously incurred legal costs in the sum of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The ORG came into force in GPE , GPE and GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the ORG provides that so far as it is possible primary and secondary legislation must be read and given effect in a Convention compatible manner . Section CARDINAL of the ORG makes it unlawful for a public authority to act incompatibly with Convention rights , unless it is not possible to act differently by virtue of primary legislation . A successful claim under LAW would render the relevant public authority liable to the plaintiff under LAW ORG and a judge has power to award damages under section CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW to hold an Inquest in circumstances where there are grounds to suspect that the person ( a ) has died a violent or an unnatural death or ( b ) has died a sudden death of which the cause is unknown .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the DATE Act outlines the content of the Inquisition Form ( the document completed by ORG jury at the end of the evidence ) as follows :", "\u201c ( i ) who the deceased was ; and", "( ii ) how , when and where the deceased came by his death ; ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Rule CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the DATE Rules \u201d ) requires that proceedings be directed solely to ascertaining : ( a ) who the deceased was ; ( b ) how , when and where he came by his death ; and ( c ) the particulars required by LAW to be registered concerning the death . Rule DATE provides that no verdict shall appear to determine any question of criminal or civil liability on the part of a named person .", "CARDINAL . In GPE v Her Majesty \u2019s Coroner for LOC of GPE ex parte PERSON , PERSON and Manners ( unreported DATE ) , Lord Justice PERSON said :", "\u201c In short the inquiry must focus on matters directly causative of death and must , indeed , be confined to these matters alone ... . The recent , eleventh edition of GPE on Coroners puts it thus :", "\u2018 The question of how the deceased came by his death is of course wider than merely finding the medical cause of death , and it is therefore right and proper that the coroner should enquire into acts or omissions which are directly responsible for the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This latter case informed the findings of ORG in the principal case concerning the role and function of an Inquest as a fact - finding inquiry concerning a death pre - dating the ORG ( NORP v. PERSON for GPE and GPE ex p. PERSON [ DATE ] Q.B. CARDINAL ) . Sir PERSON held that the words \u201c How ... the deceased came by his death \u201d in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW DATE and Rule CARDINAL were to be understood as meaning \u201c by what means \u201d :", "\u201c ... the task is not to ascertain how the deceased died , which might raise general and far - reaching issues , but \u2018 how ... the deceased came by his ORG , a more limited question directed to the means by which the deceased came by his death . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A ORG provides therefore for narrow circumstances in which a lack of vigilance on the part of the third party could feature in the Inquest verdict . Having emphasised that the Inquest could not be concerned with matters of ordinary negligence ( a failure to take reasonable care ) , the judgment defined the verdict of neglect ( or lack of care ) as a term of art :", "\u201c Much of the difficulty to which verdicts of lack of care have given rise appear to be due to an almost inevitable confusion between this expression and the lack of care which is the foundation for a successful claim in common law negligence .", "Since many of those seeking that verdict do so as a stepping - stone towards such a claim the boundary is bound to become blurred . But lack of care in the context of an inquest has been correctly described as the obverse of self - neglect . It is to be hoped that in future the expression \u2018 lack of care\u2019 may for practical purposes be deleted from the lexicon of inquests and replaced by \u201c neglect . \u201d", "Neglect in this context means a gross failure to provide adequate nourishment or liquid , or provide or procure basic medical attention or shelter or warmth for someone in a dependent position ( because of youth , age , illness or incarceration ) who can not provide it for himself . Failure to provide medical attention for a dependent person whose physical condition is such as to show that he obviously needs it may amount to neglect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE House of Lords decided ( NORP ( PERSON ) \u03bd GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ; and NORP ( PERSON ) v. GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL W.L.R. CARDINAL ) that the limited scope of ORG , being insufficient to provide a meaningful conclusion as to whether the conduct of ORG agents might reasonably have prevented a death , was incompatible with the procedural requirement of LAW . In so deciding and using the interpretation mechanism of section CARDINAL of the ORG an Inquest , in deciding \u201c how \u201d the deceased came by his death , was to consider both \u201c by what means \u201d and \u201c in what circumstances \u201d the deceased came by his death . This would be applicable to cases where it was plausibly alleged that unjustified lethal force had been used by agents of the ORG as well as in cases where it was alleged that the ORG had breached its positive duty to take reasonable steps to safeguard the lives of individuals . In this latter respect , ORG noted that :", "\u201c The decision in [ PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIII ] shows that it does apply to a broader category of cases , since although in that case no breach of the state \u2019s investigative obligation was alleged or found , the court based its conclusion that LAW had been violated in part on its opinion ... that the inquest , which did not permit any determination of liability , did not furnish the applicant with the possibility of establishing the responsibility of the prison authorities nor did it ... constitute an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the deprivation of life . A statement of the inquest jury \u2019s conclusions on the main facts leading to the suicide of PERSON would have precluded that comment .", "CARDINAL . Lord GPE therefore made the following observation as to how those Rules would henceforth be applied :", "\u201c The prohibition in rule PERSON ) of the expression of opinion on matters not comprised within sub - rule ( CARDINAL ) must continue to be respected . But it must be read with reference to the broader interpretation of \u201c how \u201d in section CARDINAL ) and rule CARDINAL ) and does not preclude conclusions of fact as opposed to expressions of opinion . However the jury \u2019s factual conclusion is conveyed , rule CARDINAL should not be infringed . Thus there must be no finding of criminal liability on the part of a named person . Nor must the verdict appear to determine any question of civil liability . Acts or omissions may be recorded , but expressions suggestive of civil liability , in particular \u201c neglect \u201d or \u201c carelessness \u201d and related expressions , should be avoided . Self - neglect and neglect should continue to be treated as terms of article \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( DATE ) ORG gave judgment in In re PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) . Following a finding of a breach of the procedural obligation under LAW by ORG ( ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIII ) , that case determined that an obligation to conduct an LAW inquiry into a fatal shooting did not apply to a death which pre - dated the entry into force of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Further to the delivery of this ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG accepted that an Inquest compliant with LAW should be held into the use of lethal force which took place prior to the entry into force of the ORG ( PERSON and Another , Re Application for Judicial Review [ DATE ] ORG ) .

E.R.CARDINAL ) and is also described in the judgment of this Court in its above - cited PERSON judgment .", "CARDINAL . The public policy constraints on recognising a duty of care by public authorities were further considered in PERSON v. Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL W.L.R. CARDINAL ) . The claimant was the friend of PERSON . Both men had been subjected to a racist attack by CARDINAL white youths , which resulted in the death of PERSON . A subsequent public inquiry held that the investigation , and in particular the treatment of PERSON , was open to criticism on a number of fronts , as well as indicating unwitting racism on the part of several officers and a generalised problem of institutional racism on the part of ORG . ORG allowed the appeal of the Commissioner of Police against the decision of ORG refusing to strike out the claimant \u2019s action in damages for negligence . Lord PERSON gave the main judgment and considered the continuing status of PERSON \u2019s case under LANGUAGE law . He conceded that it was no longer appropriate to articulate the public policy issue in terms of an entitlement of public institutions to blanket immunities from civil proceedings . However , the underlying refusal in PERSON \u2019s case to recognise a duty of care when the police merely exercise their public functions was upheld . The judgments of Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON recognised , however , that a duty of care would be held to exist in exceptional cases .", "CARDINAL . Since the PERSON case , a number of cases have exhibited a sufficient degree of special relationship to displace the public policy consideration preventing the recognition of a duty of care . They include circumstances where a person acts as an informant of the police ( Swinney v. Chief Constable of GPE [ DATE ] Q.B. CARDINAL ) ; or has their property targeted in the course of police operations ( PERSON v. Chief Constable of GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL All . ORG ) ; or is employed within their service ( Waters v.

There is a parallel common law line of authority concerning the duty of care of local authorities . It is authoritatively expressed in the case of X and Others v. ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL and described in the above - cited Z and Others v. the GPE judgment ) , where ORG held that local authorities could not be sued for negligence or for breach of statutory duty in respect of the discharge of their functions concerning the welfare of children .

The applicant \u2019s claim under LAW ORG , for a breach of LAW , was upheld .", "CARDINAL . In so doing , ORG analysed the differences between that action under section CARDINAL of the ORG and common law negligence , ORG observing that the claimant would not have succeeded if the claim had been brought in negligence :", "\u201c [ Counsel for the claimant ] stressed the fact that the claimants did not frame their claim in negligence before the judge and they have not done so before us . That was because of the difficulty of persuading the court that the police owed them a duty of care in the light of the decisions of ORG in [ PERSON and PERSON ] . Although there was a suggestion in the course of the argument that a duty of care might be owed on the particular facts of this case and , indeed , the judge \u2019s judgment gives the claimants some encouragement , the claimants have never advanced their case on that basis and it seems to us to be fraught with difficulty . We shall proceed on the footing that on the authorities as they stand at present no duty of care was owed by the police to the claimants . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In analysing the differences between the common law action and an action under section CARDINAL of the ORG ( of a breach of LAW , ORG noted that the public policy concerns about finite police resources were acknowledged in the LAW case - law , by setting the threshold for a breach of LAW at a relatively high point , although not so high as to require gross negligence . Having cited the relevant paragraph QUANTITY of the above - cited PERSON judgment of this ORG , ORG observed :", "\u201c .. in [ PERSON v. the GPE ] the [ ORG ] stressed that not every claimed risk to life gives rise to a positive obligation under LAW . That is because of policy considerations which are very similar to those which led ORG in [ the LOC ] case to conclude that no duty of care is owed by the police to those in the position of PERSON . However , unlike the solution so far adopted by the common law , the solution adopted by the court under the Convention was not to hold that there was no positive obligation actionable at the suit of a victim to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual , but to hold that such an obligation must be interpreted so as not to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG DATE allowed the appeal of the Chief Constable in the PERSON case , finding that the claimants had not satisfied the \u201c PERSON threshold \u201d so that there had been no violation of the substantive requirements of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The parallel appeal before ORG decided at the same time ( ORG ) v. Chief Constable of Sussex Police [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) concerned a claim under the common law of negligence only .
