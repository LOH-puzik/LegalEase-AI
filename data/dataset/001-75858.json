The applicant has been a member of ORG since DATE . He stood in the parliamentary elections of DATE in the first constituency of GPE as a candidate on ORG party \u2019s list . He obtained CARDINAL votes and was elected as a member of parliament for a DATE term by decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , a voter in that constituency , lodged a complaint against the applicant with ORG , the judicial body which , under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW , had jurisdiction , inter alia , to remove a member of parliament from office in the event of disqualification . PERSON referred , in particular , to the incompatibility between the office of a member of parliament and the fact that the applicant was practising as a lawyer . This incompatibility had been enshrined in LAW for the first time on the occasion of a constitutional revision in DATE . The new LAW now states that the duties of a member of parliament are incompatible with all professional activity , although it does provide for the introduction of exceptions through legislation . However , the implementing legislation was never enacted , since , according to information submitted by the applicant , ORG voted against the draft law in DATE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the revised LAW indicated that the rule on disqualification in question would come into force once the implementing legislation provided for in LAW had been enacted and , at the latest , on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The hearing before ORG was held on DATE . Before that court , the applicant alleged , inter alia , that there had been a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL and argued that , until such time as the implementing legislation provided for in LAW had been enacted , the disqualification could not be applied . He also claimed that the disqualification could not be applied to members of parliament who had been elected prior to the revision of LAW . Submitting several documents in evidence , he added that he had ceased receiving fees as of DATE and that he was carrying out his activities free of charge , with the result that he could not be deemed to be practising a profession within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by judgment no . CARDINAL , ORG allowed PERSON complaint and ruled that the applicant had forfeited his seat . In particular , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that he could not be deemed to be practising his profession because he had not received fees for his services since the rule on disqualification had come into force . However , CARDINAL members of the court considered that \u201c the concept of practising a profession is very closely linked to receipt of an income , particularly through a systematic and long - term activity carried out for the purpose of ensuring [ the individual \u2019s ] livelihood \u201d . With regard to the other arguments raised by the applicant , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c ... [ ORG is clear from ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW , the constituent body , in adopting the rule whereby the duties of a member of parliament are incompatible with the exercise of any profession , did so not only with a view to ensuring the independence of members of parliament , but also to ensure that the latter are able to carry out their duties in the best possible conditions and without distraction ... At the same time , LAW delegated to ORG the power to introduce exceptions to the [ general ] rule of professional disqualification , in other words , the power to list those professional activities which would be compatible with the duties of a member of parliament ... In addition , [ the same provisions state that ] the rule establishing the incompatibility between the duties of a member of parliament and the practising of any profession was to come into force , at the latest , on DATE ... , even if the law indicating the professional activities that are compatible with the duties of a member of parliament had not been enacted by that date ... The only consequence of the failure to enact this legislation ... is that the rule on disqualification for members of parliament is applicable , without exception , from DATE ... Further , the argument put forward by the applicant in his submissions to the effect that the disqualification is not applicable to members of the current ORG , since this would be contrary to the constitutional principle of legitimate expectation , must be dismissed as unfounded , especially since a constitutional provision can not be set aside on the ground that it is contrary to another provision or principle of LAW . This follows from the formal equality of all provisions of the LAW and the principles arising from them , which requires that each constitutional provision be applied in a binding manner with regard to the specific area which it governs ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was replaced as a member of ORG by the first substitute on his party \u2019s list for the first constituency of GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the parliamentary elections of DATE in which the applicant was a candidate , LAW was worded as follows :", "\u201c The duties of a member of parliament are incompatible with the functions or position of a member of a board of directors , chairperson or director general or their deputies , or of an employee of a commercial firm or enterprise enjoying special privileges or public service concessions or receiving a regular ORG subsidy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The new LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ paragraph CARDINAL ] The duties of a member of parliament are also incompatible with the exercise of any profession . Activities compatible with parliamentary office , as well as matters relating to insurance and pension issues and to the manner in which members of parliament return to their profession at the end of their parliamentary term , shall be specified by law . ...", "[ paragraph CARDINAL ] Violation of the provisions of the present paragraph shall result in forfeiture of parliamentary office and shall render related contracts or other acts null and void , as specified by law .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The transitional provision of LAW provides :", "\u201c The incompatibility of parliamentary office with the exercise of any profession , provided for by the penultimate paragraph of LAW , shall come into force upon promulgation of the law provided for in the same provision and on DATE at the latest . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the present government announced its intention to carry out a further revision of the LAW . On DATE Mr ORG , the current Prime Minister , presented the broad outlines of the proposed revision to his party \u2019s parliamentary group . He stated , inter alia : \u201c recent experience shows that it is necessary to amend the constitutional provision on the professional disqualification of members of parliament ; we propose lifting the absolute prohibition and replacing it with a partial prohibition . \u201d", "CARDINAL . During the sittings of CARDINAL and DATE of the parliamentary committee responsible for preparing the revision of the LAW , members of the opposition expressed their views as follows ( extracts ) :", "PERSON :", "\u201c I suggest adding a provision to LAW which would read as follows : the duties of a member of parliament are incompatible with the exercise of any professional activity . \u201d", "Mr PERSON :", "\u201c Constitutional provision : a member of parliament may not exercise any other profession . \u201d", "Mr Varvitsiotis :", "\u201c I believe that a member of parliament should not exercise any other professional activity during his or her term of office . \u201d", "In its final report of CARDINAL DATE , the above - mentioned parliamentary committee proposed that LAW be amended , and expressed its opinion as follows :", "\u201c It is proposed , by a large majority , to revise LAW in order to redefine the work , powers and activities which are incompatible with the duties of a member of parliament in order to take account of current information about the ORG \u2019s role in the economy . Forfeiture of CARDINAL \u2019s parliamentary seat is also foreseen as a sanction for exceeding the limit set on election expenditure . \u201d", "In its report of DATE , the parliamentary committee responsible for preparing the revision of the LAW after the elections of DATE made no mention of the introduction of an absolute professional disqualification .", "CARDINAL . At the sitting of DATE , PERSON , a member of the majority parliamentary party and a former Minister of ORG , spoke as follows ( extract ) :", "\u201c What type of ORG do you want ? Do you want to exclude scientists and well - known figures ? ... This prohibition exists in no other country ... You will find yourselves in the dock at ORG , since a legislative prohibition on being elected to ORG on the ground of one \u2019s profession amounts to a breach of every citizen \u2019s personality rights ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the sitting of DATE , Mr PERSON , a member of parliament , then spokesperson for the opposition and currently Minister of the Interior , stated ( extract ) :", "\u201c ... The initial philosophy underlying the revision of this Article was that members of parliament could exercise professional activities with the exception of those prohibited by LAW ; this is the logic of the decision [ that we adopted within the revision committee ] . Yet now , before a plenary sitting of the ORG , you are putting forward a position that is the exact opposite of that ... All of a sudden , in the middle of the procedure , you are introducing an amendment which , in reality , completely overturns the content of the revision of LAW ... This is not a simple amendment , but a total reversal of the logic underlying the revision of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Several legislative systems make it incompatible to hold a seat in ORG and simultaneously to hold senior office in the executive branch ( Head of ORG , Prime Minister , Minister or Minister of ORG ) or high office within the judiciary ( president or member of a constitutional or supreme court , of an administrative court , of the ORG d\u2019Etat or of another specialised senior court , such as ORG ) . This is the case , for example , in GPE ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) , GPE ( LAW ) , GPE ( LAW and section CARDINAL of the DATE implementing PERSON on the general electoral system ) , GPE ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) , GPE ( LAW ) , GPE ( LAW of LAW ) , GPE ( LAW ) , \u201c the former GPE \u201d ( section CARDINAL of the Status of Members of Parliament Act DATE ) , the GPE ( LAW ) and GPE ( section CARDINAL of ORG and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Status of Members of Parliament Act ) . In some countries , however , government ministers take part in parliamentary work ( GPE , GPE , GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . Certain disqualifications from holding a parliamentary seat concern positions which could jeopardise ORG independence as a result of hierarchical relations within the government .", "CARDINAL . In the majority of countries , disqualifications of this type concern judges and prosecutors , police officers and members of the armed forces , and all diplomatic and consular staff . This is the case , for instance , in GPE ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) , GPE ( LAW ) , GPE ( LAW of LAW ) , GPE ( section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ) , GPE ( sections CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ) , GPE ( LAW ) , GPE ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG House of Commons Disqualifications Act ) and GPE ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In general , such disqualifications concern civil servants or contract workers employed in the ORG administration or in regional bodies , autonomous ORG entities or institutions such as the social security service , or in public companies . This is the case , for example , in GPE ( section CARDINAL of the Members of GPE ) , GPE ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Electoral LAW ) , GPE ( Disqualifications Act of DATE ) , GPE ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW ) , GPE ( section CARDINAL of the DATE implementing PERSON ) , GPE ( LAW ) , GPE ( LAW DATE ) , GPE ( LAW ) , GPE ( section CARDINAL(a ) of ORG ) and GPE ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the majority of countries , individuals affected by those disqualifications must resign if they wish to stand for election ( as in GPE and herzegovina ) . In other countries ( such as GPE or GPE ) they may merely request to be suspended from their professional duties during their term of office .", "CARDINAL . As a general rule , the disqualifications in this category concern managers or heads of companies , corporations or public or private institutions which have interests in ORG activities or which receive ORG aid or grants . They may also concern the chairpersons , general managers or members of the boards of directors of private companies involved in public construction or in property or credit operations ( among many other countries , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE have such rules ) .", "CARDINAL . In some countries , members of parliament may not practise any professional or commercial activity or paid employment during their terms of office , except in the educational sphere , and then only in very exceptional circumstances ( GPE , GPE , GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The majority of countries do not lay down , in their constitutional or ordinary legislation , an incompatibility with freely practising the profession of lawyer ( for example , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , restrictions or conditions may be imposed on a member of parliament who practises as a lawyer , based on the requirements of independence , professional ethics and availability . Thus , despite the absence of a legislative prohibition in this regard , the NORP ORG stated in a judgment of DATE that the timetable of GPE sittings enabled a member of parliament to practise as a lawyer , subject to the prohibitions concerning conflicts of interest set out in LAW and the legal profession \u2019s ORG .", "CARDINAL . This specific concept of conflict of interest exists in several NORP legislative provisions . Thus , in GPE , LAW prohibits any lawyer registered with the Bar who is a member of parliament from carrying out , directly or indirectly through an associate or colleague ( except before the ORG justice or ORG ) , any professional act in criminal cases concerning certain crimes or offences against the ORG or the areas of finance or the press , or to plead in civil proceedings for companies which receive ORG grants , financial companies or companies which use savings , companies engaged in civil engineering , construction or property development , or against the ORG , ORG - owned companies , local authorities or public establishments .", "CARDINAL . Similar provisions exist in the legislation of other civil - law countries , such as GPE ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) , GPE ( section CARDINAL of the Statute of Members of ORG ) , GPE ( section CARDINAL of ORG Act ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , Title PERSON on members of parliament , as amended by ORG ) and GPE ( section QUANTITY of the Disqualifications of members of ORG CARDINAL ( Law no . CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . In the common - law countries , the codes of ethics of members of parliament guarantee ORG independence vis - \u00e0 - vis possible conflicts of interest by means of administrative and procedural measures . In GPE , members of parliament must declare any work or paid employment and have this declaration entered in the register of PERSON interests . Failure to register an interest may result in sanctions ( Code of Conduct for Members of ORG to the Rules relating to the ORG of Members of ORG ) . Similar provisions exist in GPE ( sections CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of ORG and in GPE ( LAW of Members of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Those procedures for declaring and registering the assets and financial interests of members of parliament have also been adopted in some countries of continental LOC . Thus , the Rules of ORG provide for a similar system to determine cases of incompatibility : within DATE of the ORG \u2019s first sitting , each member must submit a declaration to the speaker concerning the functions occupied by him or her at the time of standing for election , and those commercial or professional activities which he or she continues to carry out . In GPE , members of parliament are also obliged to notify their financial interests and any other professional activity carried out by them when they take up their duties ( section QUANTITY of the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Other more practical limitations and restrictions have been added to those cited above , which are based on the concept of independence and conflict of interest . Various regulations on the status of members of parliament require that they give their parliamentary activities priority over any other private work , whether remunerated or not . In GPE , ORG may , by CARDINAL majority , require that a member of parliament forfeit his or her seat , permanently or for a specific period , if the individual concerned neglects his or her duties in a significant and repeated manner . In practice , this obligation is reflected in a significant reduction in the time spent working in other professions , or withdrawal from them ( as in GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , the requirement to carry out parliamentary duties on a full - time basis results in very restrictive rules on disqualification ( section CARDINAL of the DATE implementing PERSON on the general electoral system ) ; holding a parliamentary seat is incompatible with the direct or indirect exercise of any private or public profession or activity , remunerated by way of wages , salaries , dues , fees or other means ( an exception is made for university lecturers ) . However , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE implementing PERSON permits interested parties to apply to the relevant chamber \u2019s disqualification committee for leave to conduct private activities which do not concern public bodies or services , public companies , companies which are financed from public funds or credit or insurance companies .", "CARDINAL . Parliamentary committees exist in several countries . They may authorise professional activity , including in the public sector , which would otherwise be considered incompatible with the holding of a parliamentary seat ( see section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . In certain cases , those activities must be carried out without remuneration .", "CARDINAL . A blanket prohibition on exercising any profession , trade or remunerated form of employment , similar to that laid down in the NORP or NORP legislation , also exists in a more or less rigid form in other countries , especially those of central and eastern LOC , such as GPE ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW ) , \u201c the former GPE \u201d ( section CARDINAL of the Status of Members of Parliament Act ) , GPE ( LAW ) and GPE ( LAW ) .
