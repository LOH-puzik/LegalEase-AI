SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national with a degree in technical sciences from ORG . He is retired and lives in GPE in the GPE of GPE . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant carried out research , together with a technical adviser , at ORG , on the effects on human beings of the consumption of food prepared in microwave ovens . In a research paper dated DATE , entitled \u201c Comparative study of the effects on human beings of food prepared by conventional means and in microwave ovens \u201d , it was concluded :", "\u201c The measurable effects on human beings of food treated with microwaves , as opposed to food not so treated , include changes in the blood which appear to indicate the initial stage of a pathological process such as occurs at the start of a cancerous condition . \u201d", "Subsequently , in issue no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) of the DATE ORG PERSON , in which the applicant was mentioned as a member of the editorial staff , there appeared an article by PERSON d\u2019Ombresson entitled \u201c Microwave ovens : a health hazard . Irrefutable scientific evidence \u201d . The cover page depicted a ORG ) holding out one hand towards a microwave oven . The introductory paragraphs to the article stated , inter alia :", "\u201c Off to the scrap heap and the rubbish dumps with microwave ovens ! The treatment to which they subject food is so pernicious that it causes a change in the blood of whoever eats it and this leads to anaemia and a precancerous condition . These are the findings of a rigorous study carried out by a professor of the ORG [ ORG ] and an independent researcher , who were determined to answer once and for all the crucial question : are microwave ovens harmful or not ? Here is a simplified summary of the study , followed by the study itself for those who are not put off by figures and scientific demonstrations . We were anxious to publish both these , albeit at the risk of repetition , so that the findings should be available to the widest possible public . \u201d", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) applied to ORG ( ORG ) of the GPE of GPE for an injunction under LAW ( ORG ; PERSON \u00fcber den unlauteren GPE ) , seeking to have Mr GPE prohibited , on pain of penalties , from stating that food prepared in microwave ovens is a danger to health and leads to changes in the blood of those who consume it , that it causes a pathological disorder and that it presents a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of carcinogenic process . In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the application . The injunction was confirmed by ORG ( Bundesgericht ) in a judgment dated DATE which concluded :", "\u201c There can be no question of the ORG having been applied in breach of LAW or LAW Statutes must , in particular , define fundamental rights and other , conflicting duties of the ORG so that these CARDINAL concerns of constitutional law may be taken into consideration to the greatest possible extent ... The smooth operation of competition and economic freedom , freedom of expression , scientific freedom and freedom of the press must be guaranteed as well as possible , but at the same time limited so that the various constitutional objectives may be reconciled in practice . ... Anyone claiming scientific freedom is therefore wholly free to expound his knowledge in the academic sphere but , where competition is concerned , he may not claim to have the truth on his side where the opinion he is putting forward is disputed . An opinion which has not been confirmed scientifically must in particular not be misused as a disguised form of positive or negative advertising of one \u2019s own work or the work of others . In the present case , that is all the more true as ORG expressly left the applicant free to base his proposition on new scientific findings . The appeal must therefore be dismissed ... \u201d", "On DATE the applicant lodged with ORG application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL in which he complained that the ban imposed on him by the NORP courts under the ORG had infringed LAW . He also raised complaints under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention . On DATE , the Commission declared the case admissible . In its report of DATE it found that there had been a breach of LAW and that no separate issue arose under LAW .", "The case was referred to the ORG which , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , considered that the measure was \u201c prescribed by law \u201d and pursued a legitimate aim as required by LAW . In respect of the question whether the measure was \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d within the meaning of this provision , the ORG held , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the applicant did no more than send a copy of his research paper to the ORG PERSON . He had nothing to do with the editing of issue no . CARDINAL of that periodical or in the choice of its illustration , of which he became aware only after its publication . That is clear from Mr PERSON \u2019s statement of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and was not called into question by either ORG of the GPE of GPE or by ORG . Both courts held that the applicant \u2019s liability derived from the fact that in sending his paper to the ORG PERSON he had accepted its being used in a simplified and exaggerated manner \u2013 as , given the periodical concerned , it had been foreseeable that it would be \u2013 and that , consequently , he had identified himself with the article in issue ...", "As regards the content of issue no . CARDINAL relating to microwave ovens , the applicant was thus neither author nor co - author of the title on the cover page ... , the editorial column ( attributed to PERSON ... ) or of pages CARDINAL ( attributed to PERSON ... ) . The only parts that can be attributed to him are , with the exception of the titles and sub - titles appearing on them , pages CARDINAL , which contain an extract of the research paper ... ORG notes that nowhere it is expressly proposed that microwave ovens be destroyed or boycotted or their use banned and that the applicant did not repeat the statements he made in DATE and which had been published in issue no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) of the ORG PERSON . In addition and above all , the applicant \u2019s views on the harmful effects on human health of the consumption of food prepared in microwave ovens are expressed in far less categorical terms than the Government intimated ; that is to be seen in particular from the repeated use of the conditional mood and the choice of non - affirmative expressions . In that regard , the last lines from the extract , in which the applicant \u2019s conclusions from his experiments are summarised , are particularly striking . Thus , although it is stated that the results obtained \u201c show changes which bear witness to pathogenic disorders \u201d , as regards any cancerous effects it is explained that the results present a pattern which \u201c might \u201d correspond to the beginning of a cancerous development and which \u201c deserves attention \u201d ; likewise , there is no assertion that the consumption of irradiated food is harmful for man as a result of the induction of indirect radiation through food , but merely a suggestion that it \u201c might \u201d be ...", "...", "CARDINAL . It will be seen from the foregoing that Mr GPE played no part in the choice of the illustration for issue no . CARDINAL of the ORG PERSON , that those statements that were definitely attributable to him were on the whole qualified and that there is nothing to suggest that they had any substantial impact on the interests of the members of the ORG . In spite of all that , the NORP courts prohibited the applicant from stating that food prepared in microwave ovens was a danger to health and led to changes in the blood of those consuming it that indicated a pathological disorder and presented a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of a carcinogenic process , and from using the image of death in association with microwave ovens .", "The ORG can not help but note a disparity between that measure and the behaviour it was intended to rectify . That disparity creates an impression of imbalance that is materialised by the scope of the injunction in question . In that regard , although it is true that the injunction applies only to specific statements , it nonetheless remains the case that those statements related to the very substance of the applicant \u2019s views . The effect of the injunction was thus partly to censor the applicant \u2019s work and substantially to reduce his ability to put forward in public views which have their place in a public debate whose existence can not be denied . It matters little that his opinion is a minority one and may appear to be devoid of merit since , in a sphere in which it is unlikely that any certainty exists , it would be particularly unreasonable to restrict freedom of expression only to generally accepted ideas .", "The fact that the NORP courts expressly reserved Mr GPE \u2019s freedom to pursue his research does not in any way alter that finding . As to presenting the results outside the \u201c economic sphere \u201d , it is not transparently obvious from the courts\u2019 decisions that he was given such a possibility ; it may be that the wide scope of the ORG would prevent those reservations being seen as providing a significant reduction in the extent of the interference in question .", "Furthermore , if the applicant fails to comply with the injunction he runs the risk of a penalty , which could include imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the foregoing , the measure in issue can not be considered as \u201c necessary \u201d \u201c in a democratic society \u201d . Consequently , there has been a violation of LAW ( see Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-VI , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG considered that it was unnecessary to examine the complaints under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention . It also held that ORG was to pay to the applicant CHF CARDINAL,CARDINAL for costs and expenses .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for the reopening and annulment of its judgment of DATE and the reimbursement by the ORG of his court and legal costs . In its judgment of DATE ( served on DATE ) ORG held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The appellant relied on DATE ( ORG ; GPE \u00fcber die Organisation der PERSON ) . According to this provision , review of a judgment of ORG or a lower court is admissible if ORG has found a breach of LAW and redress is possible only through such review . The first requirement has clearly been met . The second remains to be considered . It may be regarded as satisfied if and insofar as the judgment of ORG and the compensation awarded are not sufficient to make good the situation in relation to LAW ORG [ FAC ] CARDINAL I CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL p. CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "CARDINAL . In pursuance of LAW , ORG awarded the appellant compensation of CHF MONEY for the costs incurred in proceedings before ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG . No scope remains for further compensation claims by the applicant in relation to the same proceedings ( cf FAC I CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINALb / bb p. CARDINAL et seq . ) . On the contrary , the ORG \u2019s award constitutes sufficient compensation . Accordingly , the grounds provided for in Article CARDINALa clearly do not apply . The applicant \u2019s claims for reimbursement of court costs , lawyer \u2019s fees and counsel \u2019s costs in previous proceedings must be rejected .", "CARDINAL . However , the applicant primarily seeks the lifting of the restrictions imposed on him . The question here , too , is whether and to what extent , with regard to compensation for the breach of the ORG , a modification of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE is necessary .", "a ) According to LAW , everyone is entitled to freedom of expression . This right may be restricted only to the extent that it is prescribed by law , serves a legitimate purpose and is necessary in a NORP society ( LAW ) . ORG regards the ORG ( ... ) as a sufficient statutory basis for the restriction imposed on the applicant . It finds also that there is no doubt that the restriction is intended to protect the rights of others and so serves a legitimate purpose . But it concludes that the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression has been restricted to a greater extent than is necessary in a NORP society . In this connection , the ORG deals thoroughly with the content of ORG PERSON No . CARDINAL . It finds that the applicant is responsible , as author or co - author , neither for the title on the front page , nor for PERSON editorial column , nor PERSON d\u2019Ombresson \u2019s article on pages CARDINAL . Nor did the applicant participate in the choice of illustrations . Only the extract from the research paper on pages CARDINAL could be attributed to him , not including the title and sub - titles . Nowhere in this extract was it expressly suggested that microwave ovens should be banned , destroyed or boycotted . In particular , the applicant \u2019s view that the consumption of food prepared in microwave ovens is harmful to human health was much more moderately expressed than the NORP authorities assumed . This impression was conveyed by the repeated use of the subjunctive and the choice of non - affirmative language . In this respect , the last lines of the extract , drawing conclusions , were particularly enlightening : the tests showed \u201c changes which bore witness to pathogenic disorders \u201d ; but they showed a pattern which \u201c might \u201d reflect the beginning of a carcinogenic process and \u201c deserved attention \u201d . Similarly , it was not stated that the consumption of irradiated food was harmful to human beings by subjecting them to indirect radiation , but merely surmised that this \u201c might \u201d be the case . Nor did ORG find any evidence that the applicant \u2019s statements in ORG PERSON No . DATE had substantially impaired the interests of the respondent \u2019s members .", "Having regard to these circumstances , ORG concludes that the extent of the restrictions imposed by the NORP courts is disproportionate to the behaviour they were intended to rectify . The restrictions had the effect of partially censoring the applicant \u2019s work and severely limiting his opportunity for publicly defending a point of view which had its place in the current debate . The fact that it was a minority view and apparently lacking in any rational foundation mattered little . In an area where there was no certain proof , it was particularly exceptionable to restrict freedom of expression to the reproduction of generally accepted ideas .", "b ) The judgment of ORG may afford the applicant satisfaction and , through the award of CHF CARDINAL , financial compensation for the cost of the proceedings . But it does not remove the restrictions imposed on the applicant by ORG and confirmed by ORG in its judgment of DATE . These restrictions may be upheld only within the bounds of necessity as defined by ORG . Since those restrictions may be lifted or limited only by means of an appeal to ORG , the requirement of Article CARDINAL FJA is met .", "However , it remains to be determined in what respect and to what extent the restrictions are to be limited in order to comply with LAW . In this connection , it must first be noted that ORG found the restrictions disproportionate only insofar as they were intended as a response to the research paper published in ORG PERSON No . DATE , which paper the ORG found sufficiently moderate and whose impact on the respondent \u2019s members it found insufficiently proved . In its appraisal of the actual circumstances , ORG also took the view that only the text of the research paper could be attributed to the applicant and that he could not be held responsible for the titles , sub - titles and other texts by other authors which the periodical contained , nor for the illustrations . It follows that to prohibit the applicant from publishing texts of comparable moderation to the aforementioned research paper , even on competition - related grounds , would violate LAW .", "On the other hand , according to ORG view of the law , it may be assumed that prohibiting the applicant from making competition - oriented statements alleging scientifically proven health - impairing effects of food prepared in microwave ovens , without any mention of current differences of opinion , can only be reconciled with LAW if there are tangible signs that such statements will be made and are of a nature substantially to impair the competitive position of the respondent \u2019s members ( cf . FAC , \u00a7 CARDINAL p. CARDINAL , with references ) . However , these requirements are satisfied : In its judgment of DATE , ORG found as to the facts that the applicant had never disavowed the publication in ORG PERSON No . CARDINAL but had simply stated in court that he did not agree PERCENT with PERSON introduction and conclusions ; he had said that he liked the image of the Reaper ; he stood by his conclusions and intended to continue seeking to have them debated in the mass media ; behind his scientific attitude was an ideological one ; at the trial he had maintained his earlier statements and declared : \u201c These microwave products cause cancer , there is now no longer any doubt about that \u201d and \u201c I will continue to go my scientific way \u201d . These are concrete indications that there is reason to fear that the applicant will make statements contrary to fair competition , disseminating alleged scientifically proven findings of health impairment by microwave ovens ; in view of the applicant \u2019s professed liking for the image of the Reaper , there is also a danger of this or some other death symbol being used to illustrate such statements . It is self - evident that such statements , if aimed at wider sections of the population , are of a nature to substantially impair the competitive position of the respondent \u2019s members . This is all the more true if the statements are further illustrated by death symbols . Under LAW CARDINAL.a ORG , the respondent is entitled to be protected by appropriate restrictions against unlawful impairment of competition .", "c ) A complete lifting of the restrictions imposed on the applicant is therefore neither necessary nor appropriate . It must be made clear that the applicant is prohibited only from making statements directed at the general public in which health - impairing effects of microwaved food are presented , without mention of current differences of opinion , as scientifically proven . The prohibition of the use in publications or public lectures of the Reaper or any similar death symbol must be maintained on the basis of the detailed grounds stated in the judgment of DATE . Lastly , the basis for the respondent \u2019s claim lies not in an actual violation but in the threat of violations ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL.a ORG ) . That such a threat exists , having regard to the applicant \u2019s behaviour and statements , is beyond doubt .", "The applicant shall not otherwise be prevented from taking part in the current debate on the health effects of food prepared in microwave ovens . He is free to express his views , provided that he does not do so in statements addressed to the general public in such a way as to convey the false impression that they reflect scientifically proven findings . It is not a question of censoring the applicant \u2019s work , but of preventing inaccurate , misleading or unnecessarily damaging and therefore unfair statements of a nature to influence competition and to impair the competitive position of the respondent \u2019s members ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( a ) ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal is only partially successful . He achieves clarification of the scope of the restrictions imposed by ORG and confirmed by ORG in its judgment of DATE , but is unsuccessful both in his application for rejection of the complaint and in his claim for reimbursement of court and lawyer \u2019s fees from the previous proceedings . This outcome justifies a proportional apportionment of court fees and parties\u2019 costs arising from the appeal proceedings ... Of the court fee of CHF MONEY , CHF CARDINAL is charged to the applicant and CHF CARDINAL to the respondent ; the applicant shall also be required to pay the respondent party compensation of CHF CARDINAL .", "The material amendment of the judgment on the facts of DATE , constituting partial acceptance of the appeal , is confined to clarification of the scope of the restrictions imposed on the applicant . The respondent \u2019s entitlement to protection is unaffected . That being so , there is no justification for re - apportioning court fees and party costs from the ORG proceedings and the appeal proceedings before ORG , especially as ORG has already awarded the applicant compensation under LAW for costs incurred in those proceedings ( cf para . CARDINAL above ) .", "ORG therefore finds as follows :", "CARDINAL . The application for review is partially accepted , \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG judgment of DATE is annulled and replaced as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The appeal is partially allowed , insofar as it is admissible , and \u00a7 CARDINAL of the judgment of DATE of ORG is amended as follows :", "CARDINAL . The defendant is prohibited , subject to the penalties provided for in Art CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Art CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( imprisonment or fine MONEY CARDINAL,CARDINAL ; detention or , in serious cases , imprisonment of DATE ) , from making statements addressed to the general public alleging that it is scientifically proven that food prepared in microwave ovens , without reference to current differences of opinion ( verboten , in ORG , die an weitere Bev\u00f6lkerungskreise gerichtet sind , ohne PERSON auf den herrschenden GPE als wissenschaftlich gesichert darzustellen , dass i m GPE zubereitete Speisen \u2026 ) , is harmful to health and causes changes in the blood of persons who consume it , indicating a pathological disorder and showing a pattern that could be seen as the beginning of a carcinogenic process .", "The remainder of ORG judgment is confirmed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The further applications for review are rejected .", "CARDINAL . The court fee of CHF MONEY is apportioned in the amounts of CHF MONEY to the applicant and CHF CARDINAL to the respondent .", "CARDINAL . The applicant shall pay the respondent CHF CARDINAL in costs .", "CARDINAL .
