ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) convicted the applicant of various offences under LAW and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It found him guilty of having commissioned various persons DATE to import cocaine to GPE and to have sold QUANTITY of cocaine to various individuals in GPE . In fixing the sentence , the court had regard to the fact that the applicant had CARDINAL previous convictions CARDINAL of which also concerned offences under LAW . It also revoked the suspension of a term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment resulting from a previous conviction . The applicant \u2019s imprisonment was due to be terminated on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained at FAC when he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in DATE . Subsequently , he was regularly taken to the public hospital in GPE , which has an out - patient department specialised in the treatment of multiple sclerosis . Examinations took place on DATE , DATE and DATE and on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE ORG , noting that the applicant required more intensive medical treatment and care , ordered his transfer to FAC for the further execution of his sentence , as that prison centre was equipped with a hospital of its own . However , ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for a suspension of the execution of his sentence pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL taken together with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Strafvollzugsgesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . It noted on the basis of a medical expert opinion that the applicant , suffering from multiple sclerosis , was unfit for detention . However , he was to be considered dangerous within the meaning of section QUANTITY of LAW . He had been convicted CARDINAL times . His last conviction for importing and selling QUANTITY of cocaine concerned a particularly serious crime . Although the applicant \u2019s mobility was reduced by his illness , he could use his contacts within the criminal scene to commit or instigate further crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to PERSON prison . From that date he was detained in the hospital of PERSON prison . The Government submitted a statement of the head doctor of the PERSON prison : The hospital has its own medical and nursing staff . Doctors carry out daily visits and medical and nursing assistance is available TIME per day . All sanitary facilities in the prison hospital are suitable for persons with disabilities .

While staying in these rooms the applicant could use the hospital \u2019s common shower room with the assistance of prison staff .", "CARDINAL . The applicant continued to receive treatment at the multiple sclerosis department at the GPE P\u00f6lten public hospital . An examination scheduled for DATE was refused by the applicant . Further examinations took place on CARDINAL May and DATE and on DATE and DATE . The applicant \u2019s therapy was fixed and continuously adapted by the specialists of the multiple sclerosis department and was carried out at the prison hospital . Moreover , the applicant was treated by the prison hospital \u2019s pain specialist several times .", "CARDINAL . In addition to medication , the applicant received physiotherapy from DATE . This was available in the prison hospital . A first set of CARDINAL therapy units was prescribed . The applicant underwent CARDINAL units DATE but renounced to make use of the remaining units . Subsequently , physiotherapy was resumed and the applicant received TIME therapy units DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , requested anew that the execution of his sentence be suspended due to his illness pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL taken together with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW and that he be released .", "CARDINAL . He joined an opinion by an expert on neurology and psychiatry , Dr. ORG According to the expert \u2019s opinion dated DATE the applicant was unfit for detention . Since he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in DATE his state of health had deteriorated considerably . In particular , the mobility of his arms and hands was restricted and he could no longer perform simple gestures necessary for everyday life , such as handling cutlery for instance . His general mobility on the ORG scale was CARDINAL ( CARDINAL being full mobility , CARDINAL meaning dependency on a wheel - chair ) . He received medication , however this was not sufficient as according to medical opinion a multidisciplinary approach , encompassing neurology , physiotherapy and psychology , was necessary for treating multiple sclerosis . The support by close relatives was also crucial .", "CARDINAL . As to the question whether there was still a danger that he would commit further offences , the applicant submitted that all his energy was devoted to combating his illness . Should the court have doubts in respect of his dangerousness , he requested that the opinion of an expert be taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . It noted that according to the prison administration , the applicant \u2019s conduct was good . According to the prison doctor , the applicant \u2019s condition was stable for the time being but could deteriorate at any time . Referring to the expert opinion , the court acknowledged that the applicant was unfit for detention due to his illness . However , he was to be considered particularly dangerous . In that respect , the court referred to the decision by ORG DATE , which had found that even if his mobility was reduced there was a danger that the applicant might use his contacts to organise further drug trafficking . Therefore the conditions for suspending the execution of his prison term as laid down in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL taken in conjunction with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW were not met .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , claiming in particular that his illness had weakened him substantially and all remaining energy was required to cope with the illness . Consequently , it could no longer be assumed that he would commit further offences . In that connection he complained that ORG had assumed that his dangerousness persisted without having taken a further expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It noted that the applicant suffered from multiple sclerosis and was unfit for detention . However , it confirmed ORG view regarding the applicant \u2019s dangerousness . It observed that he had been convicted CARDINAL times . The prison term he was serving related to the trafficking of a substantial amount of drugs , namely QUANTITY of cocaine which he had imported though third persons and sold in GPE . Pursuant to section QUANTITY of LAW , the sentence had to be executed even where the detainee was unfit for detention if he presented a danger to the security of others having regard to the nature of his offences or the motive for which they were committed or in view of his prior conduct . The court referred to the applicant \u2019s recidivism and the large amount of drugs which he had sold , and found that his dangerousness was not offset by the effects of his illness .", "CARDINAL . In sum , ORG found that despite the fact that the applicant was unfit for detention , his substitute confinement ( Ersatzhaft ) DATE if need be in a public hospital \u2013 was required for the protection of others .", "CARDINAL . By application of DATE the applicant again requested that the execution of his sentence be suspended pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL taken together with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW and that he be released .", "CARDINAL . He submitted a private expert opinion by Dr. PERSON , a neurologist , psychiatrist and physiotherapist . The opinion , dated DATE , stated that the danger that the applicant would commit further offences had considerably decreased . While his prior convictions indicated a certain risk , all other relevant factors rather allowed a positive prognosis . His severe and progressive illness required all his energy and had led to a profound change . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s age , his reduced mobility , the need of constant medical treatment and his dependency on help from others made it unlikely that he would commit further offences .", "CARDINAL . ORG appointed a psychiatric expert Dr. PERSON In his opinion , dated DATE , Dr. PERSON noted that the applicant was detained in the prison hospital and that according to the prison doctor his state of health had deteriorated over DATE . By now he was able to walk only with great difficulty . The expert confirmed that the applicant was unfit for detention due to his illness . Regarding his dangerousness , the expert found that the applicant still made an astonishingly energetic impression . Although his progressive illness and his age could be considered as a factor reducing the probability of a relapse into crime , his personality did not necessarily indicate that he would refrain from committing further offences . In sum , the remaining danger had to be compensated by stabilising factors such as assistance by a probation officer ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release . It noted that the applicant was detained in the prison hospital . The hospital \u2019s head doctor had submitted comments in favour of release . Furthermore , expert Dr. PERSON had found that the applicant \u2019s inclination to commit further offences had decreased but not totally disappeared and had recommended that a probation officer be appointed in case of release .", "CARDINAL . Referring to its previous decision , ORG noted that the applicant suffered from multiple sclerosis and was unfit for detention . While that decision had refused the applicant \u2019s release on account of his dangerousness , the applicant \u2019s good conduct in the meantime and Dr. B. \u2019s expert opinion led to the conclusion that the applicant \u2019s dangerousness had decreased . On the condition that he would reside with his mother and be assisted by a probation officer it could be assumed that he would not commit further offences . The execution of his sentence was therefore suspended pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In order to allow for the necessary preparations , the court ordered that the applicant be released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW provides that the execution of a prison term is to be suspended if the convict is unfit for detention due to invalidity or a physical or mental illness . Pursuant to section QUANTITY of the said LAW a convict who is unfit for detention may nevertheless be deprived of his liberty if he presents a danger to the security of the ORG or to the security of third persons , having regard to the nature or the motive of the offence committed by him , or in view of his prior conduct . If need be , confinement is to be carried out at a public hospital .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL the execution of a sentence has to be suspended if a prisoner becomes unfit for detention while serving his prison term .
