NORP The applicant company was established in DATE and has its registered office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company concluded a contract with ORG ) , GPE \u2019s national public - service radio broadcaster , a publicly funded institution with its own legal personality , the status of which is regulated by law ( at that time PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended , presently PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the contract , in return for a fee , the applicant company agreed to act as exclusive agent for ORG as the principal ( \u201c the principal \u201d ) for the sale of broadcasting time for the purposes of advertising .", "CARDINAL . The venture worked well and the contract was amended several times . The amended contract was valid until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in DATE the relationship between the applicant company and the principal began to sour because the principal was not content with the amount of business acquired by the applicant company in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The principal had accordingly issued the applicant company with a bill for the difference between the estimated profit and the real profit from such business .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant company did not pay the bill , the principal served the applicant company with a notice of termination of the contract , considering the applicant company \u2019s failure to pay the bill to be a fundamental breach of the contract .", "CARDINAL . NORP The notice period expired on DATE , following which the principal arranged for the sale of its broadcasting time by other means .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company challenged the validity of the principal \u2019s notice of termination of the contract in court , but later withdrew the action .", "CARDINAL . NORP The principal , for its part , sued the applicant company for payment of the difference between the estimated profit and the real profit . No information has been made available about the current state and outcome of those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company demanded that the principal pay it the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) , according to the exchange rate applicable at that time , by way of indemnity for termination of the contract .", "With reference to the contract , the amount of the indemnity had been calculated as the applicant company \u2019s average DATE commission for DATE , taking into account both financial and non - financial transactions between the principal and third parties , the latter being referred to as barter transactions .", "CARDINAL . As the principal did not satisfy the applicant company \u2019s claim , on DATE the applicant company sued it for the above - mentioned amount and late - payment interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a copy of the action was served on the principal for observations . Hearings were scheduled for CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL DATE , in the course of which ORG s\u00fad ) examined complex documentary evidence and heard the statutory representative of the applicant company and CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . However , the principal submitted no written observations and appeared at none of the hearings . The circumstances of its absence were disputed ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bratislava I ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) granted the action in full . It observed that despite having been represented by a lawyer , the principal had failed to submit any observations or to present a good excuse for its failure to appear at any of the hearings . It therefore proceeded to examine the case under LAW of LAW ( Law no . PERSON . , as amended \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , which in the event of a party \u2019s unjustified failure to cooperate , allows for the examination of the case on the basis of the elements available .", "As a preliminary issue , ORG examined the question of validity of the notice of termination of the contract issued by the principal . It observed that the notice had not been contested and concluded that it was valid . There were no reasons disqualifying the applicant company from being eligible for the indemnity , and the barter transactions had rightly been taken into account in its calculation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The principal appealed ( odvolanie ) to ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) .", "In terms of form , it contested the first - instance judgment in its entirety . Nevertheless , in terms of substance , it acknowledged the existence of the legal basis of the applicant company \u2019s entitlement to indemnity , disputing solely its scope , in so far as the barter transactions were concerned . Without those transactions , the acknowledged amount of the indemnity was equivalent to some ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , according to the exchange rate applicable at that time .", "In support of its challenge to the claim exceeding that amount , the principal pointed out that , in the proceedings in its action for payment of the difference between the estimated profit and the real profit ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant company had lodged a counter - claim for compensation for the barter transactions .", "The principal also contended that the decision to determine the action in its absence had been arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the appeal , ORG upheld the firstinstance judgment on DATE .", "It considered that , except for the part related to the barter transactions , the applicant company \u2019s claim had been acknowledged by the principal .", "As to those transactions , it observed that the applicant company had offset a claim for compensation for them against the claims asserted by the principal in its above - mentioned action . The claim for compensation for those transactions was however a different matter from a claim for indemnity for the termination of the contract , which was asserted in the present proceedings , and which ORG found to be wellfounded .", "Lastly , as regards the principal \u2019s absence from the first - instance proceedings , ORG observed ( i ) that the principal had requested the adjournment of the hearing of DATE ; ( ii ) that the summons for the hearing of DATE had not been deliverable to the principal \u2019s lawyer prior to that hearing ; and ( iii ) that on CARDINAL DATE the principal \u2019s new lawyer had requested that the hearing of CARDINAL DATE be adjourned so as to allow him to study the case file , although the summons for that hearing had already been served on the principal on CARDINAL DATE at the latest . In those circumstances , ORG assessment that the principal had been \u201c absolutely passive \u201d in the proceedings was right and the examination of the case in the principal \u2019s absence had been justified .", "CARDINAL . As no ordinary appeal lay against ORG judgment , following its service on the parties , the matter was resolved with the force of a final and binding decision ( pr\u00e1voplatnos\u0165 ) on DATE .", "On the expiry of a period of grace for voluntary payment , the judgment became enforceable ( vykonate\u013enos\u0165 ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the principal challenged ORG judgment by way of a complaint under LAW no . PERSON . , as amended ) . Asserting its rights of access to a court and to a fair hearing , it contended that the impugned judgment was grossly arbitrary and contrary to ORG law . In the latter respect , ORG had arbitrarily refused to ask ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) declared the complaint inadmissible . It held that an unjustified refusal to ask for a preliminary ruling may in certain circumstances give rise to a ground for appealing on points of law ( dovolanie ) under LAW ( g ) of the ORG . As that remedy had not been exhausted , ORG lacked jurisdiction to deal with the complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the principal filed a petition with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) requesting the latter to exercise his discretionary power to challenge the above - mentioned judgments by way of an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( mimoriadne dovolanie DATE \u201c extraordinary appeal \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG decided to accede to the request and on DATE challenged the contested judgments in ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) .", "He argued primarily that the courts had erred in finding the notice of termination of the contract valid because it had not been disputed by the parties . This was a point of law and it could not have been resolved simply with reference to the lack of disagreement of the parties over it . The courts therefore should have examined that question independently and properly . As for the substance , in his view , had the notice been invalid , there would have been no reason for an indemnity . On the other hand , had the notice been valid , the indemnity could have been refused , because it had been based on a breach of contract by the applicant company .", "Moreover , the ORG pointed out that the contract had neither provided for nor excluded compensation for barter transactions . In such circumstances , the contract should have been interpreted in terms of the parties\u2019 subsequent practice , which had not involved the payment of compensation for such transactions . They should accordingly not have been taken into account for the purpose of calculation of the indemnity .", "CARDINAL . Simultaneously , the ORG applied for a ruling to suspend the enforceability of the impugned judgments pending the outcome of the extraordinary appeal . ORG acceded to that request on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant company had submitted observations in reply ; it submitted further observations on DATE and DATE .", "The latter observations were not submitted until after ORG had determined the extraordinary appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as the applicant company did not know of its decision at the time .", "CARDINAL . In its observations , the applicant company raised numerous arguments , including the following .", "There was no justification for protecting the principal \u2019s rights by way of an extraordinary appeal because it had failed to protect its own rights with due diligence in the lower courts and because , even at the cassation level , it had left the protection of its rights to the public authorities .", "In that regard , it had been open to the principal to assert its rights before ORG directly by way of an appeal on points of law . It had not done so simply in order to avoid incurring court fees for such an appeal .", "Moreover , under LAW ORG , the availability of an indirect remedy , an extraordinary appeal ( on points of law ) , was excluded by the availability of a direct remedy , an ( ordinary ) appeal on points of law .", "At the appellate level , the only point in dispute had been the part of the applicant company \u2019s claim concerning the barter transactions .", "The ORG \u2019s challenge to the ordinary courts\u2019 findings as regards the validity of the notice to terminate the contract therefore exceeded the grounds of the principal \u2019s petition for an extraordinary appeal . Indeed , it was contrary to it because the principal had not challenged the notice but rather had relied on it . In any event , the ORG \u2019s challenge was ill - founded because there was no correlation between the validity of the notice and the fact that it had been based on the applicant company \u2019s refusal to pay the bill submitted by the principal .", "Lastly , with reference to Convention case - law , the applicant company submitted that the extraordinary appeal as a remedy against a final and binding judgment in its favour was incompatible with the principles of the rule of law and legal certainty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , sitting in chambers , ORG allowed the extraordinary appeal . It quashed the judgments of both ORG and ORG and remitted the matter to the former for a new examination .", "It concluded that the courts had erred in that , firstly , they had omitted to examine the validity of the contract itself and secondly , depending on the outcome of that examination , they had failed properly to examine the validity of the notice . In view of those errors it had not been possible to deal in concreto with the questions of the basis and scope of the applicant company \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was served on the applicant company \u2019s lawyer on DATE . As a result , the case was remitted to the first instance , where it has been pending ever since .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a complaint with ORG , contesting ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . It relied on its rights to access to a court , equality of arms , adversarial proceedings , legal certainty and a fair hearing .", "The applicant company argued that the admissibility requirements for the extraordinary appeal had not been met , and that the extraordinary appeal had not only been belated but had exceeded the scope of the principal \u2019s petition . In addition , by the mere fact of admitting the extraordinary appeal , ORG had set at naught the entire preceding judicial process , in violation of the principle of legal certainty .", "The applicant company further argued that in view of ORG decision , a brand new hearing of the case had been called for , even though no procedural irregularities of the previous hearing had been established . In addition , the contested decision was biased in favour of the principal and was not amenable to review on account of lack of reasoning .", "The applicant company also contended that ORG had completely ignored its observations in reply to the extraordinary appeal .", "Lastly , the applicant company complained that it had been denied access to ORG case file in the extraordinary appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant company \u2019s complaint inadmissible as being manifestly illfounded .", "In so far as the applicant company had sought to contest the extraordinary appeal in principle , ORG observed that the statutory framework for examination of individual complaints did not allow it to examine the compliance of statutes with the LAW and international instruments as such .", "To the extent that the applicant company might be understood as wishing to object to any action on the part of the ORG , no such objection could be considered because the applicant company had only identified ORG as the defendant of its complaint .", "As for the remainder of the complaint , which concerned ORG , ORG found that the applicant company had failed to show any constitutionally relevant arbitrariness in the interpretation and application of the relevant rules .", "As regards the applicant company \u2019s argument that the extraordinary appeal had been lodged belatedly , it was based on the premise that the principal had appealed against the first - instance judgment only in so far as it concerned the barter transactions . That premise was however mistaken because the principal had defined the target of its appeal as the firstinstance judgment as a whole ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "As to ORG failure to give a specific answer to the applicant company \u2019s arguments , ORG considered that the right to an answer to submitted arguments was related not to a person but to substance . ORG had thus been under a duty not to reply to the arguments submitted by the applicant company as such , but rather to address the relevant aspects of the case . On the latter point , the applicant company had failed to show that any of the relevant aspects of the case had gone unanswered .", "Lastly , ORG accepted that it had been a mistake to deny the applicant company access to ORG case file . However , it held that that had no constitutional significance because , in view of the character of the extraordinary appeal proceedings , access to the case file or the lack of it would have had no impact on the outcome of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL .
