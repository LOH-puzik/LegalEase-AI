GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , has the citizenship of GPE and GPE . She was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG . ORG , having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings ( LAW ) , did not indicate that they wished to exercise that rights .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant sold her car to PERSON At that time , she lived at her father \u2019s place of residence in GPE .", "On DATE PERSON lodged a motion against the applicant with ORG ( Amtsgericht ) , claiming DEM CARDINAL as damages for the car \u2019s alleged defects . The motion and all further correspondence were served to the place of residence of the applicant \u2019s father .", "On DATE ORG decided to apply a summary procedure ( PERSON billigem PERSON ) pursuant to section CARDINALa of ORG ( Zivilprozessordnung , see relevant domestic law below ) .", "On DATE PERSON extended her action and claimed further ORG .", "By partial judgment ( ORG ) of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant , who had not participated in the proceedings , to pay DEM CARDINAL plus interests to PERSON", "By final judgment ( PERSON ) of DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay further ORG plus interests to PERSON Both judgments were delivered to the place of residence of the applicant \u2019s father .", "On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged an action for declaration of nullity ( Nichtigkeitsklage ) pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , requesting ORG to set aside its judgments of CARDINAL October and DATE . She alleged that she had left GPE on DATE with the aim to live permanently in GPE . She had neither informed her father about her departure nor left her new address . She had not learned about the civil proceedings until her return to GPE on DATE , when her father gave her the mail which had accumulated during her absence . In support of her allegations , she submitted her own affidavit ( eidesstattliche ORG ) . She further nominated CARDINAL witnesses , including her father , her mother , CARDINAL former friends of hers and the postman who had delivered the final judgment of DATE to her father \u2019s place of residence .", "The defendant , PERSON , contested these submissions . She pointed out that she had received a demand for payment from the applicant , which was dated DATE and had been posted in GPE . The applicant replied that this letter had been posted by a friend of hers , whom she named as a witness .", "On DATE , following a hearing , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s action inadmissible . While leaving the question undecided whether the action for declaration of nullity was applicable in the present case , it found that the applicant had failed to establish to the satisfaction of the court ( glaubhaft machen ) that she had lodged her action within the statutory time - limit of DATE after having learned about the CARDINAL judgments . Taking into account both parties\u2019 submissions , ORG did not attach credence to the applicant \u2019s own affidavit . It considered , firstly , that the applicant had not submitted admissible evidence in support of her allegation that the demand for payment had been posted not by the applicant herself , but by a friend of hers . Furthermore , according to the acknowledgment of service ( GPE ) of CARDINAL DATE , the final judgment had been served on the applicant herself . The applicant had not disproved that fact . ORG further noted that the applicant had alleged that she had received the partial judgment of DATE on her return to GPE . This allegation was contradicted by the fact that the copy of the partial judgment which was to be served on the applicant was located in the case - file of the first set of proceedings , because it had not been picked up by the addressee .", "ORG further pointed out that the applicant could have submitted further evidence , such as her air tickets or affidavits given by other persons .

Referring to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , ORG decided not to hear any witnesses , as these had not been presented by the applicant during the hearing .", "The applicant subsequently lodged an appeal with ORG ( Landgericht ) . She argued , inter alia , that ORG should have heard the witnesses , as section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW did not apply in the instant case . She alleged that it would have been up to ORG to summon the witnesses . She further maintained that ORG , during the hearing , had not mentioned that any witnesses had been missing .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG noted , firstly , that ORG , in the first set of proceedings , had violated the rules of civil procedure by applying the summary procedure even though the value of the issue exceeded the sum of ORG CARDINAL . However , this procedural error did not justify an annulment of the judgments .", "Secondly , ORG confirmed that the applicant had not established that she had lodged her action within the statutory time - limit . ORG shared ORG doubts as to the credibility of the applicant \u2019s own affidavit . It further considered that the applicant had failed to explain why she had kept her NORP bank account and why she had not deregistered with the NORP authorities . Contrary to the applicant \u2019s point of view , ORG had not been obliged to summon any witnesses . According to LAW of LAW it was only admissible to take evidence by means which were immediately available to the court . It followed that only those means of evidence had to be considered which had been presented by the respective party . According to ORG , the opinion that the court was obliged to summon witnesses was consistent neither with the wording of the legislation nor with the case - law of ORG . In this respect , ORG referred to a judgment of ORG of DATE ( published in that court \u2019s official collection [ ORG ] volume CARDINAL , p.
