Pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of the amended Act , existing leases with a term of DATE would be terminated automatically ex lege DATE after the entry into force of the amendment , unless they were approved by ORG . Under section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , if a lease was terminated as described above , the tenant was to vacate the property on pain of a financial penalty equal to CARDINAL times the DATE rent for DATE of default . The ORG was to compensate the tenant for improvements and repairs on the leased property , provided that the ORG had approved them and had undertaken to reimburse their cost .", "According to the explanatory note ( d\u00f4vodov\u00e1 spr\u00e1va ) on the amendment , the aim of the amendment was to lay down basic rules and minimum standards for effective management of the ORG \u2019s property in furtherance of the aims pursued by the Act . It was noted that the core of the ORG \u2019s economic activities consisted in leasing out the property it managed . However , the leases had frequently been concluded on inadequate terms and for an excessive period , aspects which had to be regularised .", "On DATE a group of members of parliament challenged the amendment in ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) . They were later joined in their challenge by ORG .", "On DATE ORG accepted the challenge for further examination .", "On DATE ORG declared the whole of section CARDINALa and certain other sections of the LAW , as amended in DATE , contrary to several provisions of LAW . It held , inter alia , that these provisions infringed the principles of the division of ORG power , the prohibition of retroactivity , legality and access to a court .

By operation of LAW , the unconstitutional provisions of the LAW thus lost their legal effect . As ORG took no steps to rectify them , DATE these provisions became void .", "On DATE ORG passed a special law repealing the whole of the LAW and winding up the ORG . This law ( PERSON no .

On DATE the ORG declined to approve the lease . Consequently , the lease expired on DATE .", "The applicant company then made several requests for the ORG to take over the LOC . The ORG did so , but no earlier than DATE . The applicant company claims that until then it had to maintain the premises in order to prevent their deterioration and that it consequently incurred added expense and sustained material damage .", "The applicant company also submits that , at that time , it did not know that the amendment had been challenged in ORG and that the challenge had been accepted for further examination .", "The applicant company subsequently ceased its commercial operations .", "Another company , E .- M. , leased commercial LOC from the ORG . The lease was for a fixed term of DATE .", "On DATE , at the company \u2019s request , the Bratislava I ORG ( ORG s\u00fad ) indicated an interim measure ordering the ORG to allow the company to enjoy the LOC peacefully . At the same time , the company was invited to bring , within DATE , an action for a declaratory ruling that the lease agreement existed . The interim measure would stay in place until the final settlement of that action . In its rulings ORG observed that the DATE amendment to the LAW had been challenged in ORG and that the proceedings were still pending .", "The E .- M. company brought the action as it had been invited to do and the proceedings are still pending .", "Another company , ORG , leased commercial LOC from the ORG .

It declined to leave them , and in DATE the ORG brought an action for its eviction .", "The action was dismissed by ORG on DATE and , on appeal , by ORG on DATE . The courts observed that the relevant provisions of the DATE amendment were unconstitutional and legally void . They could therefore not be used as a basis for a finding that the lease had expired and , consequently , for an order to vacate the LOC . With reference to section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG . \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , the courts found that even if an eviction order had been made in the circumstances of the case , it would not have been enforceable .", "LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
