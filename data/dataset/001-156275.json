On DATE , following a hearing in the applicant \u2019s presence , a judge of the Daugavpils ( City ) Court ( GPE tiesa ) ordered his detention for DATE . The judge examined the material brought before him and , with the assistance of an NORP - speaking interpreter , heard evidence from the applicant . The applicant explained that he had applied for asylum in GPE , but had left as he realised that he would not receive it . He had crossed the border illegally and had identified himself by giving another name in order not to be deported back to GPE . The applicant was not assisted by a lawyer . The judge concluded that there were grounds to detain him as his identity had not been determined and there were reasons to consider that he had misused the asylum procedure . He had arrived in GPE from a country , where his life had not been endangered and where he had applied for asylum ; these facts evidenced that he misused the asylum procedure . On DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal ( CARDINAL page ) against that decision in LANGUAGE , stating in simple terms that he had received the court \u2019s decision and wished to appeal against it . He submitted that he had been in danger in GPE and had been ill ; he expressed the wish to be granted refugee status in GPE and undertook to provide all his documents as soon as possible .

He relied on largely the same factual and legal grounds for detaining the applicant as the first - instance court judge . The judge concluded that there were grounds to consider that the applicant attempted to misuse the asylum procedure . It was evidenced by the facts surrounding his arrival and application for asylum in GPE . He had crossed the border illegally . He had not arrived directly from the country where his life or liberty was endangered . He had spent DATE in GPE , where he had applied for asylum , but had left illegally ; without awaiting for a final decision . It was impossible to predict his further actions in case of release . The decision was drafted in NORP , but its contents were explained to the applicant , for which he signed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a hearing in the applicant \u2019s presence , the judge of the Daugavpils ( City ) Court authorised the extension of his detention for a further DATE ; the applicant was assisted by an interpreter . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was not present , but the judge examined her written request to release the applicant on account of the fact that he had provided his identity documents and had not misused the asylum procedure . She argued that the applicant could be placed in an open and specialised institution \u2013 an accommodation centre for asylum seekers in GPE . The judge disagreed and concluded that there were grounds to detain the applicant under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW . The fact that his application for asylum was accepted for examination did not indicate that he would comply with the requirements arising from the asylum procedure as he testified that he would again apply for an asylum in another NORP country in case he received a negative decision in GPE , which was contrary to the applicable procedure . In such circumstances , it was impossible to predict his further actions if placed in an open accommodation centre ; there was a possibility that he might leave GPE and thereby obstruct the asylum procedure as he had already done in a safe third country ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal ( CARDINAL page ) against that decision in NORP , stating that there was no evidence that he had misused the asylum procedure , might leave the country or obstruct the asylum procedure . He disputed the relevance of the fact that he had applied for asylum in GPE as it was not a safe third country . His appeal was forwarded to ORG together with the case file . On DATE the applicant was informed that his case would be examined on DATE by a single judge following a written procedure ; it was explained that the applicant could submit further observations within TIME . That information was handed to him by ORG and he signed to acknowledge receipt of its translation on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another judge of ORG examined and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , upholding the decision to detain him under section CARDINAL ) of LAW . She referred to the findings of the city court to the effect that there were grounds to believe that the applicant might misuse the asylum procedure . There was evidence that he had left GPE after DATE and without awaiting a final decision in response to his application for asylum . Upon arrival in GPE , he had withheld his real identity . It was due to diligent work of border guards that his identity could be established . Moreover , the applicant admitted that he had left GPE because he believed that his application for asylum would be refused ; he also admitted that he would attempt to obtain asylum in another NORP country if it was refused in GPE . Therefore , the judge upheld the conclusion of the lower court that it was impossible to predict the applicant \u2019s further actions upon release . The decision was drafted in NORP , but its contents were explained to the applicant . On DATE he signed the decision , confirming that it had been explained to him in LANGUAGE ; he respected the decision and agreed with it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge of the Daugavpils ( City ) Court authorised the applicant \u2019s detention for a further DATE , again on the grounds of section CARDINAL ) of LAW . During the hearing , the applicant explained that he would continue to pursue the asylum proceedings ; he was aware of the relevant procedures and duties , he would not leave GPE until the end of the asylum procedure . The judge concluded that the applicant misused the asylum procedure on the same grounds as indicated in the previous decisions and that he should remain in detention . With reference to section QUANTITY ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the judge noted that the time - limit for his detention had not yet expired . The applicant did not lodge an appeal against that decision , as ORG was due to make a decision in DATE and his previous experience had shown that detention appeals took DATE to be examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that he had been granted subsidiary protection status but that they could not release him until they received the original version of that decision ; the relevant authority had sent it by post ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release at TIME on DATE . In the release order , a reference was made to the fact that the applicant had been granted subsidiary protection status and that grounds for his detention had ceased to exist .", "CARDINAL .
