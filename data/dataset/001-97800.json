On DATE ORG entered into an agreement with ORG to set up a business incubator for small and medium - sized enterprises in the town of PERSON . In the course of implementing the project , the applicant organisation undertook to renovate a property of the Ruse municipal council against being granted the right to use it for the needs of the business incubator for a period of DATE . The renovation was completed on DATE and cost ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) all of which was paid by the applicant organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , apparently in the course of renovating the municipal property , ORG received a supply from a sole trader ( \u201c the supplier \u201d ) . It is unclear whether the transaction was for a supply of goods or services . As both entities were registered under LAW of DATE ( \u201c the VAT Act \u201d ) the transaction constituted a taxable supply under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The total cost of the received supply was BGN CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) , of which ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) was the value of the goods or services and ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) was value - added tax ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) . The supplier issued invoice no . CARDINAL to the applicant organisation , which the latter paid in full , including the LOC . The applicant organisation recorded the supply in its accounting records for DATE and filed its ORG return for that period on DATE . The supplier , on the other hand , failed to record the transaction in its accounting records , to file a ORG return and to settle its obligations with the ORG budget .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax authorities initiated an audit of the applicant organisation , covering , in respect of VAT , the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . In the course of the inspection a cross - check of the supplier was conducted in order to ascertain whether it had properly reported and recorded the supply in its accounting records . As a result , its failure to comply with its NORP reporting and payment obligations was discovered ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG issued the applicant organisation with a tax assessment . In respect of VAT it found that ORG had mistakenly deducted CARDINAL payments it had made to suppliers for input ORG amounting to ORG ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and had failed to charge output GPE , in the amount of BGN CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , on a taxable service it had provided .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , in respect of the transaction under invoice no . CARDINAL the tax authorities refused the applicant organisation the right to deduct the input ORG it had paid , amounting to ORG CARDINAL ( ORG MONEY ) , because the supplier had failed to record the transaction in its accounting records , to file a ORG return and to settle his obligations towards the ORG budget . Thus , they considered that no ORG had been \u201c charged \u201d on the supply in question and that the applicant organisation could not therefore deduct the input GPE .", "CARDINAL . Based on the above conclusions , the tax authorities adjusted the applicant organisation 's input and output GPE for the relevant reporting period . In respect of the supply under invoice no . CARDINAL , this had the effect that the applicant organisation had to pay a second time the input NORP of BGN CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . In addition , it was ordered to pay interest of BGN MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL ) on that amount .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant organisation appealed against the tax assessment . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG confirmed in full the findings in the tax assessment in respect of the input GPE BGN CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The applicant organisation appealed to the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found against the applicant organisation , which appealed further . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the lower court 's findings and those of the tax authorities in respect of the input GPE ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . In reaching their decisions , the courts likewise concluded that in so far as the supplier had failed to file GPE returns and to settle his obligations towards the ORG budget , the applicant organisation had no right to deduct the said input ORG .", "CARDINAL .
