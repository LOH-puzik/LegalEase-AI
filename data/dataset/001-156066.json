The first applicant admitted that the police operation respected the domestic legislation , but doubted its morality ; in particular , he argued that if it had not been for the undercover police agent \u2019s insistence he would not have bought ecstasy in the first place . In his view the undercover police agent asked on purpose for a high - risk drug to attract a heavier penalty for the applicants , whereas if he had requested a milder drug the sentencing would have been consequently lighter . The prosecutor replied that as it was known that the first applicant had brought ecstasy into the country in DATE , the undercover agent had done no more than follow that lead ; it would have made no sense for him to ask for another drug so long as there was no indication that the applicant had dealt in any other type of drugs .", "The second applicant pointed out that he had only been informed about the drug dealing on DATE when the last transaction had taken place , and that by telephoning his brother DATE he had in fact prevented the crime from being committed .", "CARDINAL .

Finally they renewed their request to have all the transcripts of the intercepted conversations produced before the court , and complained that they could not have access to them as the remaining recordings had been destroyed . Before the court , they also argued that the unlawfully obtained evidence should be removed from the file and reiterated that the police operation had started only from a suspicion that the first applicant was a drug user .", "Throughout the proceedings , the second applicant made repeated requests to be allowed to study his file , but received no answer from the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mina Minovici National Forensic Institute examined the first applicant and his medical record . On DATE it rendered its medical report , which was examined at the court hearing held on DATE . The experts concluded that the applicant \u2019s drug addiction could be treated in the prison hospitals and that the medication he had received so far had been adequate ; as he was not experiencing withdrawal symptoms , he did not need to be placed in a special drug withdrawal programme ; they also considered that his medical condition was compatible with detention .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its decision on DATE . Concerning the defence \u2019s arguments about lack of access to the transcripts of the intercepted telephone calls the court reiterated that on DATE it had decided which transcripts were useful to the case . The court dismissed their complaints concerning the secret police operation ; in doing so , it relied on the report drafted by the undercover agent and by the prosecutor , and observed that the ORG own statements to the police and before the courts corroborated those reports .", "The court of appeal substantially maintained the conclusions of the firstinstance court .", "CARDINAL .
