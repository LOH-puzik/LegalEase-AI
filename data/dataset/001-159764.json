It pointed out that the trial judge had declared herself impartial , along with the CARDINAL other eligible judges of ORG .

Subsequently , in DATE the case was assigned to another judge at ORG , PERSON , who did not hold any hearing . On DATE he also recused himself following the applicant \u2019s different motions , apparently containing insinuations . The remaining CARDINAL judges of ORG declared themselves biased as well .

The GPE endorsed this decision on DATE , holding that the impending severe punishment substantiated the risk of absconding , due to which the applicant \u2019s presence at the proceedings could not be ensured in any other way . It also observed that the last offence had been committed by the applicant during his conditional release from his DATE imprisonment , thus there was a real risk of reoffending . The court dismissed the arguments put forward by the applicant concerning his health status , unspecified , and concluded that his personal conditions did not militate for a less severe measure .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention reached the statutory time - limit of DATE on DATE . On DATE the GPE ORG placed the applicant under house arrest with continuous police surveillance , to be carried out in the flat of Ms I.T , an acquaintance of the applicant . The applicant was allowed to leave the flat DATE , TIME The court noted that the reasons for the applicant \u2019s detention were still valid , and a less restrictive measure was to be applied only because the statutory fouryear time - limit for pre - trial detention had expired .

On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s house arrest until the adoption of the first - instance judgment . It noted that the applicant was charged with a crime punishable with DATE , or life , imprisonment which in itself demonstrated the risk of absconding .

However , ORG dismissed his application for leave so as to look after his mother on a DATE basis , in particular to assist her with insulin injections . The court reasoned that Ms I.T. , the applicant \u2019s acquaintance and a co - defendant in the criminal proceedings , who lived in the flat of the applicant \u2019s mother , could do so in his stead . The court also stated that lengthy DATE leave would be incompatible with the house arrest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s further motions for leave to accompany his mother to medical examinations were granted on DATE and CARDINAL DATE for DATE ( TIME ) and CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged further requests for leave in DATE to visit his terminally ill father in PERSON twice a DATE , to take his mother home after her hospitalisation and to make certain arrangements with her bank and her previous workplace , since she was under guardianship proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicant leave to visit his father every fourth DATE TIME , and to accompany his mother coming home from hospital on DATE between TIME and TIME His request to visit his mother \u2019s financial institution and workplace was dismissed , since he had not specified their addresses , whereas under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , leave could be granted only for a specific time and destination . As regards the applicant \u2019s more frequent visits to his father , the court noted that regular , long - term leave from the house arrest would jeopardise its purpose of securing the applicant \u2019s presence throughout the proceedings . The applicant appealed , arguing that the time period to assist his mother was too short , that his father \u2019s health was deteriorating fast , requiring more frequent visits , that is , DATE , and that he had already submitted the contact details of his mother \u2019s financial institution and workplace . On DATE ORG , acting as a second - instance court , found that the applicant \u2019s appeal concerning the restricted time to assist his mother was well - founded , nonetheless no longer pertinent , because she had already left the hospital .

On DATE the ORG released the applicant from house arrest with an undertaking not to leave his place of residence . The court observed that there were no grounds to believe that the applicant would pervert the course of justice or reoffend . Nonetheless , in its view , he was charged with a serious offence requiring a coercive measure .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , ORG reversed the first - instance decision and placed the applicant under house arrest on DATE . It noted that given the seriousness of the offence there existed a danger of his absconding and given his previous multiple convictions , a risk of reoffending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion for leave to attend Mass on DATE between TIME and his further request for leave on CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL and DATE . The court observed that the applicant , being a teacher of religion by profession , was not disproportionately restricted in the exercise of his religious conviction . This decision was upheld on appeal on CARDINAL DATE , ORG holding that the applicant \u2019s religious conviction did not justify the granting of permissions of leave from the house arrest ; and that such permissions were normally to reflect an intervening change in the detainee \u2019s personal circumstances . The court noted that such a request could only be granted if it was submitted concerning a specific place and purpose .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant \u2019s host , PERSON complained on a number of occasions to various authorities that the police officers surveying the applicant interfered with her private life . She also submitted that , as she had indicated from the beginning of the house arrest , she did not have the necessary financial means to accommodate the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ms I.T. submitted a motion to the Budapest High Court stating that the applicant was to leave her flat since she could not further provide for him . On DATE , the applicant requested the court to establish the place of his house arrest at a camping site in GPE . He was informed by the court that , according to information received by the relevant authorities , the camping site was not suitable for residence during DATE . Notwithstanding this information , the applicant maintained his request .", "CARDINAL . A new decision was issued by the investigating judge on CARDINAL DATE establishing the place of the applicant \u2019s house arrest at the ORG camping site . On DATE ORG issued a report on the applicant \u2019s presence at the camping site , stating that the \u201c weather conditions , the lack of food supply and the poor hygienic conditions \u201d endangered the applicant \u2019s health . On DATE the ORG Chief Police Department lodged a request with ORG to amend its decision of DATE since the camp site was unsuitable for long - term residence .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the local general practitioner arranged for the applicant to be admitted to ORG . The examinations carried out at the hospital did not result in the finding of any such disease as warranting the applicant \u2019s further treatment , so he was released on DATE and placed in a social care institution in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended its decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the applicant \u2019s house arrest to be carried out in the flat of Ms NORP again . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was to no avail . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG reiterated that the applicant was a multiple reoffender charged with serious crimes , thus the risk of absconding and reoffending existed . The court also noted that had the statutory maximum of detention on remand not expired , the most restrictive measure should have been applied . It further argued that the measure was not disproportionate , since the protraction of the proceedings had been compensated for by the statutory discontinuation of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand . The court also dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that some co - defendants were released from house arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Budapest High Court carried out the statutory review of the applicant \u2019s house arrest and , at the same time , decided on the applicant \u2019s request for release . During the court hearing the judge presented to the applicant and the prosecutor a letter allegedly originating from CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s previous cellmates . The writer of the letter informed the court that the applicant intended to obstruct the criminal proceedings by physically threatening the investigating judge and subsequently requesting his exclusion for bias , initiating criminal proceedings against the trial judge for judicial errors and absconding and inciting the co - accused to do so . The applicant sought direct access to the document , arguing that without receiving information on the author \u2019s identity he was unable to challenge this latter \u2019s motivation and the credibility of the content of the letter . Relying on the protection of the author \u2019s personal data as provided in section CARDINAL ) of LAW , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . The court upheld the applicant \u2019s house arrest because of the risk of reoffending and absconding as provided in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) and ( d ) of LAW . In its decision the court relied on the seriousness of the crimes and the gravity of the impending punishment in holding that there was a likelihood that the applicant would abscond . It also held that given the fact that the applicant was a recidivist , there was a risk of reoffending . In its decision the court mentioned the letter as CARDINAL of the factual elements to consider .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG authorised the applicant to leave house arrest to undergo physiotherapy DATE in the period DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant \u2019s request for leave to take up a job and to look after his ill mother on a DATE basis was dismissed by ORG , which found that such a DATE leave would defeat the purpose of house arrest .", "CARDINAL .
