FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON Bompard , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Director of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a member of the NORP electorate . On CARDINAL and DATE parliamentary elections were held in GPE .", "The applicant , together with a number of others , lodged an application with ORG to have the elections declared null and void . She relied on LAW of LAW , under which electoral boundaries must be reviewed according to population changes after the second national population census following the previous boundary review ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . The applicant alleged that the last electoral boundary review dated back to DATE . Since that time there had been CARDINAL national censuses but , contrary to the provisions of electoral law , there had been no review of constituency boundaries according to population changes prior to the parliamentary elections of CARDINAL and DATE . The applicant considered that , in the light of the statistics from the DATE and DATE censuses , it was apparent that the constituencies , whose boundaries had been drawn up in DATE , were unequal and differed significantly in terms of population . She contended in particular that such population differences infringed the principle of equal suffrage .", "In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the application on the ground that the matter raised fell within its power to review the constitutionality of Acts ( LAW ) and did not constitute an electoral dispute ( LAW ) , but that the matter had not been referred to it for such a review . It observed in particular :", "\u201c ... In seeking the annulment of the elections held on DATE and DATE in the above - mentioned constituencies , the applicants contended that the current distribution of parliamentary seats between constituencies did not have \u2018 an essentially demographic basis\u2019 , in breach of the principle of equal suffrage .", "Whilst it was incumbent upon the legislature , under LAW and the Citizen of DATE , taken together with ORG and CARDINAL of the LAW , to change constituency boundaries in order to take into account , whenever necessary , any population changes that may have occurred since the entry into force of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) of CARDINAL DATE , it is not for ORG , when ruling , as in the present case , under LAW rather than LAW , to review the constitutionality of the legislative provisions contained in Table no . CARDINAL annexed to LAW of LAW . Accordingly , the single complaint submitted by the applicants must be dismissed . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c National sovereignty belongs to the people , who shall exercise it through their representatives and by means of referendum .", "No section of the people nor any individual may arrogate to itself , or to himself , the exercise thereof .", "Suffrage may be direct or indirect as provided by LAW . It shall always be universal , equal and secret .", "All NORP citizens of either sex who have reached the age of majority and who enjoy civil and political rights may vote under the conditions to be determined by law . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The Constitutional Council shall rule on the proper conduct of the election of deputies and senators in disputed cases . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c Institutional Acts , before their promulgation , and the rules of procedure of parliamentary chambers , before their entry into force , must be referred to ORG , which shall rule on their conformity with LAW .", "To the same end , Acts of ORG may be referred to ORG , before their promulgation , by the President of the Republic , the Prime Minister , the President of ORG , the President of the ORG , or CARDINAL deputies or CARDINAL senators . \u201d", "Article L. CARDINAL ( Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , section CARDINAL , ORG of DATE )", "\u201c Constituencies shall be determined in accordance with Table no . CARDINAL annexed to this Code .", "Constituency boundaries shall be reviewed , according to population changes , after the second national population census following the previous boundary review . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c Electoral boundaries can not be redrawn within DATE prior to the normal date on which the chambers concerned are to be re - elected . \u201d", "\u201c ... LAW that has been referred to ORG for review provides as follows : \u2018 Within DATE following the publication of this LAW , the government shall be authorised to draw up , by ordinance , Table no . CARDINAL annexed to LAW . The number of constituencies created in each d\u00e9partement shall be set out in the table annexed to LAW . Save in the case of d\u00e9partements whose territory includes islands or enclaves , constituencies shall consist of contiguous areas . In addition , with the exception of constituencies to be created in the cities of GPE , ORG and GPE and in d\u00e9partements which include CARDINAL or more cantons not consisting of a contiguous area , or of which the population , according to the last national population census of DATE , exceeds CARDINAL , the constituency boundary shall follow the cantonal boundary . Population discrepancies between constituencies shall be permitted in order to accommodate public - interest imperatives , but in no event may the population of a constituency differ by PERCENT from the average population of constituencies in the same ORG", "...", "As to the complaint relating to the principle of equal suffrage :", "... The parties making the referral argued that LAW had infringed the principle of equal suffrage as enshrined in LAW . LAW referred , in its second paragraph , to a table annexed to the text of the LAW by which it was established that each d\u00e9partement was required to return CARDINAL deputies to ORG ; this , they contended , had entailed very significant discrepancies in representation . The infringement of the principle of equal suffrage had been aggravated by the fact that within any given d\u00e9partement the population of a constituency could vary , upwards or downwards , by PERCENT of the average constituency population . Such a considerable variation could not be justified by public - interest imperatives , especially as in d\u00e9partements where CARDINAL or more cantons had a population of CARDINAL the electoral boundaries did not even have to follow cantonal boundaries . The discrepancies in representation authorised by the law were , in their submission , excessive in view of the nature of the election .", "... Under the first paragraph of LAW , the Republic \u2018 shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law , without distinction of origin , race or religion\u2019 ; LAW provides , in its first paragraph , that \u2018 national sovereignty belongs to the people , who shall exercise it through their representatives and by means of referendum\u2019 , and , in its third paragraph , that suffrage \u2018 shall always be universal , equal and ORG . The second paragraph of LAW provides : \u2018 The deputies to ORG shall be elected by direct suffrage.\u2019 DATE the Declaration on the Rights of Man and the Citizen proclaims that the law \u2018 must be the same for all , whether it protects or punishes . All citizens , being equal in the eyes of the law , are equally eligible to all dignities and to all public positions and occupations , according to their abilities , and without distinction except that of their virtues and talents.\u2019", "... It transpires from those provisions that ORG , whose members are returned by direct universal suffrage , must be elected on an essentially demographic basis ; whilst the legislature may take account of public - interest imperatives as a result of which that fundamental rule carries less weight , it can do so only to a limited extent .", "... In stipulating that each d\u00e9partement should be represented by CARDINAL deputies , the legislature sought to ensure that a close relationship would be maintained between the elected representative for a constituency and his or her constituents . Having regard , firstly , to the distribution of the population throughout NORP territory as recorded in the most recent national census to date , and , secondly , to the very limited number of d\u00e9partements for which the choice thus made gives the electorate a more favourable degree of representation , the provisions of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW are not , per se , contrary to LAW . They do imply , however , that any resulting inequalities of representation may not be significantly increased by the application of the rules governing the fixing of electoral boundaries within any given d\u00e9partement .", "... As regards the fixing of electoral boundaries within any given d\u00e9partement , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW authorises the government , acting by ordinance , to vary the size of a constituency electorate , upwards or downwards , by PERCENT of the average electorate in the d\u00e9partement , the legislature \u2019s intention being to allow public - interest imperatives to be accommodated . As is apparent from section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the permitted margin reflects the need for constituency boundaries to follow cantonal boundaries . In the course of parliamentary debate the government explained that a further purpose of such discrepancy in representation was , in cases where cantonal boundaries were not followed , to take account of the \u2018 natural realities constituted by certain geographical entities\u2019 and \u2018 the unity between them\u2019 .", "... Whilst per se the derogations from the principle of equal suffrage can not be attributed , in each case , to a manifest error of judgment , they may in the aggregate lead to the creation of situations where that principle is breached . Consequently , the provisions of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Act must be construed as follows : it should be considered , firstly , that the possibility of not following cantonal boundaries in d\u00e9partements where CARDINAL or more cantons do not have contiguous territory or have a population of CARDINAL can only apply to the cantons in question ; secondly , the application of the maximum variance provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) must be reserved for exceptional and duly substantiated cases ; further , that possibility may be used only to a limited extent and must be based , in each individual case , on specific public - interest imperatives ; lastly , the fixing of constituency boundaries must never be carried out arbitrarily . Any other interpretation would be unconstitutional .", "...", "Strictly subject to the interpretation set out above , LAW , authorising the government to fix parliamentary constituency boundaries by ordinance , is not contrary to the LAW . \u201d", "\u201c ... ORG , whose members are returned by direct universal suffrage , must be elected on an essentially demographic basis . Whilst the legislature may take account of public - interest imperatives as a result of which that fundamental rule carries less weight , it can do so only to a limited extent and according to specific imperatives .", "... It transpires from the LAW under review that , save where geographically impossible , constituencies consist of contiguous territories . Cantonal boundaries have generally been followed . The territory of non - contiguous cantons and of cantons with a population of over CARDINAL has been split into more than CARDINAL constituency only in a limited number of cases . The discrepancy between the size of any given constituency electorate and the average electorate in the same d\u00e9partement is not excessively disproportionate .", "... However , the deputies who made the first referral argued that the fixing of boundaries as provided for in the LAW , whilst not fundamentally open to criticism from a demographic point of view , was nevertheless arbitrary .", "... Regardless of the pertinence of certain criticisms by the deputies who made the first referral against the fixing of electoral boundaries as provided for in the LAW , it does not appear , as matters stand , and taking into account the variety and complexity of local situations that may give rise to different solutions whilst abiding by the same demographic rule , that the choices made by the legislature are in manifest breach of constitutional requirements .", "... LAW is not unconstitutional . \u201d", "\u201c Having completed its review of disputes arising from the last parliamentary elections , the ORG has the following observations to make , indicating the changes that it finds desirable in CARDINAL areas .", "( I ) As regards the general conditions in which the elections were held :", "From the experience of the DATE elections it can be concluded that legislative improvements should be enacted .", "The first matter is the fixing of electoral boundaries . The current boundaries are the result of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) of CARDINAL DATE . They were based on the results of the national census of DATE . Since then CARDINAL national censuses , carried out in DATE and DATE , have revealed representation discrepancies that are somewhat at odds with the provisions of LAW taken together with ORG and CARDINAL of the LAW . It is thus incumbent upon the legislature to modify those boundaries , as it is apparently preparing to do for the forthcoming elections to the ORG . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
