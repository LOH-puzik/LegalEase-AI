On DATE ORG decided to issue an operating permit to the company for the GPE gold mine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a case brought before it for the annulment of the permit of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the first - instance judgment and decided that the permit should be annulled . It referred to the ORG \u2019s obligation to protect the right to life and to a healthy environment and assessed the physical , ecological , aesthetic , social and cultural effects of the mining activity in question as described in the environmental impact report and the various expert reports which had been submitted to it . It held that those reports demonstrated the risk posed to the local ecosystem and to human health and safety by sodium cyanide use . It concluded that the operating permit in issue did not serve the public interest and that the safety measures which the company had undertaken to implement did not suffice to eliminate the risks involved in such an activity .

The administrative court decided to set aside the report , which , in its opinion , constituted an enforceable administrative decision giving rise to the issuing of permits . Notwithstanding the measures taken by the company , the court held that judicial decisions which had become final had found that the \u201c risk and threat \u201d in question resulted from the use of sodium cyanide in the gold mine and that it was impossible to conclude that those risks could be avoided by implementing new measures . Equally , it had been established that the risk connected with the accumulation of heavy elements or cyanide could persist for DATE and was likely to infringe the right of the area \u2019s inhabitants to a healthy environment .

In particular , it considered that the risks highlighted in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE were , inter alia , linked to the use of sodium cyanide in the gold mine and to the climatic conditions and features of the region , which was situated in an earthquake zone . It held that those risks and threats could not be eliminated by supplementary measures which continued to be based on the same leaching process . It also concluded that the issuing of the permit in question had been incompatible with the principle of the rule of law as that administrative decision had in reality been intended to amend a judicial decision that had become final .", "CARDINAL .
