The first applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the first and the second applicant were arrested and placed in pre - trial detention on suspicion of having jointly murdered the first applicant \u2019s husband on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the indictment for murder was preferred against the applicants with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened the trial against the applicants , who were represented by counsel throughout the proceedings before the domestic courts , and against another co - defendant ( M. ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicants and their co - defendant , who had all denied the charges , of having jointly murdered the first applicant \u2019s husband , who had stood in the way of the applicants\u2019 plan to marry , and sentenced them to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Having heard CARDINAL witnesses and CARDINAL experts , having inspected the scene of the crime and having analysed the time and duration of numerous telephone calls between the defendants , ORG concluded that the first applicant had given CARDINAL GPE to PERSON and had lured her husband to a remote place , where he had been shot by the second applicant and PERSON acting jointly .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that in view of their considerable involvement in their intimate relationship , in which they had driven each other to commit the offence in question , the applicants\u2019 guilt was not of a particular gravity ( Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants both lodged an appeal on points of law . They complained , inter alia , that ORG had made a procedural error in that it had based its judgment on a document containing a list of telephone calls they had made without that evidence having been produced at the main hearing .", "CARDINAL . ORG likewise lodged an appeal on points of law , which it reasoned on CARDINAL DATE . It contested in particular ORG finding that the applicants\u2019 guilt was not of a particular gravity .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( third senate ) dismissed the ORG appeal on points of law as manifestly ill - founded . It added that it considered the ORG appeal to be inadmissible in so far as they had alleged a procedural error . It argued that the applicants had failed sufficiently to substantiate this complaint . They had not informed the court that in the summons for a witness working for the telephone company who had listed the applicants\u2019 phone calls , the president of ORG had stated that the witness was called to explain the content of the said list of calls .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment delivered on DATE , ORG , having held a hearing , allowed the prosecution \u2019s appeal on points of law . It quashed the judgment of ORG in so far as the latter had not considered the applicants\u2019 guilt to be of a particular gravity and remitted the case to a different chamber of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By submissions dated DATE and DATE respectively the second and the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . They notably contested ORG finding that their appeal had been inadmissible in so far as they had alleged a procedural error .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG communicated the constitutional complaints to ORG and ORG for observations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted his observations to ORG . On DATE the president of ORG filed the observations of all senates of that court .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG invited the applicants to submit written observations in reply by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and on DATE the second applicant lodged observations in reply . Both applicants had previously been informed by ORG , at their request , that the court would not take a decision before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the first applicant , at her request , that a decision would probably be taken in the course of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a senate of CARDINAL judges , quashed the decision of ORG of DATE and remitted the case to that court ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its leading decision ( running to CARDINAL pages ) , ORG examined the constitutionality of the requirements set forth in the case - law of ORG which an appellant has to satisfy in order to lodge an admissible appeal on points of law about a procedural error . ORG found that as a rule , these requirements did not violate the ORG right to effective legal protection . However , in the applicants\u2019 case , having regard to the entirety of their submissions made , ORG had over - stretched the said requirements by requesting information also about a witness \u2019s summons as such , and had therefore breached the applicants\u2019 right to effective legal protection .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was served on the applicants\u2019 counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In their submissions dated DATE to ORG the applicants , contesting ORG view , argued , in particular , that the proceedings had lasted unreasonably long . They requested the court to find a violation of LAW ( the first applicant argued that there had also been a breach of LAW ) and to mitigate the length of their prison term in compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the execution of the arrest warrant against the first applicant was suspended and she remained at liberty until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The hearing fixed for DATE had to be cancelled as the first applicant \u2019s counsel were unavailable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant suffered a heart attack .", "CARDINAL . Having held a hearing on DATE , ORG ( third senate ) dismissed the ORG appeal on points of law by judgment of DATE . It found that the ORG complaint that ORG had made a procedural error in using the telephone lists in evidence was ill - founded because the time and duration of the telephone calls in question had been confirmed by different witnesses who had been confronted at the hearing with the data contained in the telephone list .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , ORG found that the length of the proceedings did not warrant a mitigation of the applicants\u2019 sentence of life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The lapse of time since its decision of CARDINAL DATE was not automatically attributable to the judicial authorities only because ORG had subsequently quashed that decision . It argued that , as a rule , the fact that a decision was quashed and the case remitted to the lower court did not entail a violation of the right to have one \u2019s case heard within a reasonable time , but was a necessary consequence of the possibility to rectify mistakes on appeal . Only delays caused by decisions which disclosed a flagrant breach of the law could therefore be considered as having delayed the proceedings contrary to the rule of law . As in the present case its decision of DATE did not disclose such a flagrant breach of the law , there had not been a delay which was attributable to the judicial authorities since then .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , ORG considered that it could leave open the question whether ORG had failed to treat the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints without undue delay . Even assuming that there had been such a delay , the applicants could not claim redress therefor . Pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) a person acting with criminal responsibility who was found guilty of murder had to be sentenced to life imprisonment . The court further left open whether an exception to this rule had to be made in exceptional cases in which there had been an extreme delay , as this was not the case in the proceedings against the applicants . As their convictions and their sentence had been final according to the provisions of LAW already on DATE , the uncertainty arising from the applicants\u2019 mere hope that ORG would allow their constitutional complaints did not entail a strain which necessitated compensation . In these circumstances , there was no reason for a mere declaration that there had been a violation of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was served on the applicants\u2019 counsels on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against the judgment of ORG of DATE . Invoking their right to liberty and to be heard within a reasonable time , they argued in particular that due to the excessive delays in the proceedings , in particular between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , their sentences of life imprisonment should have been reduced to fixed terms of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , declined to consider the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints ( file no . QUANTITY BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) as these were manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Even though ORG was not convinced that the duration of proceedings before it could be added to the length of criminal proceedings , as it was not part of the ordinary system of legal remedies , it left this question open . It found that it was not necessary to examine whether there had been undue delays contrary to the rule of law in the proceedings before it or before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Even assuming such delays , a reduction of the applicants\u2019 sentences was excluded because in cases of murder , the sentence of life imprisonment was mandatory according to LAW . Therefore , a violation of the right to be heard within a reasonable time could not , as a rule , lead to a mitigation of this sentence . The court reiterated that the unreasonable duration of criminal proceedings could reduce an offender \u2019s guilt and could , in exceptional cases , even warrant compensation by dispensing with punishment or by discontinuing the proceedings . However , LAW did not authorise the courts to consider any aspects reducing a murderer \u2019s guilt such as the excessive duration of the proceedings against him or her . This finding was confirmed by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . By ruling that murder was not subject to the statute of limitations , the legislator showed that even long delays between the commission and the conviction of this offence should not be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that it could be left open whether in cases in which DATE had passed between the commission of the offence and the murderer \u2019s final conviction a mitigation of the sentence of life imprisonment was necessary for reasons of proportionality . Even assuming that there had been unreasonable delays in the present proceedings after ORG decision of DATE , these had not been so long as to justify a mitigation of the mandatory life sentence prescribed by law for murder .", "CARDINAL . The court , disagreeing with the applicants , further found that the rights of a murderer were not less protected than those of other offenders . Unreasonable delays during the proceedings before the criminal courts could , for example , lead to his or her release from detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision was served on the applicants\u2019 counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG resumed the proceedings concerning the question whether the applicants\u2019 guilt was of a particular gravity , which it had suspended at the applicants\u2019 request .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment delivered on DATE ORG found that , having regard to the circumstances in which the murder had been committed , the applicants\u2019 guilt was not of a particular gravity ( Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the intentional killing of a person is to be qualified as murder if certain aggravating elements are present . A murderer is notably a person who kills another out of cupidity or other base motives ( LAW ) . Murder is punishable by life imprisonment ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Murder is not subject to the statute of limitations ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A declaration by the sentencing court which imposed a life sentence that the offender \u2019s guilt was of particular gravity has a bearing on a subsequent decision of the court dealing with the execution of sentences as to whether or not to suspend the remainder of the offender \u2019s prison sentence on probation . Pursuant to Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , that court suspends the remainder of a life sentence on probation if the convicted person has served DATE of his or her sentence , provided that this can be justified in the interests of public safety and provided that the particular gravity of the offender \u2019s guilt does not warrant the continued execution of the sentence .", "CARDINAL . Article DATE and Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code contain rules on the fixing of sentences . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW , the courts are to reduce a life sentence to a term of imprisonment of not DATE if the mitigation of the penalty under this provision is either prescribed or authorised by law . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW prescribes that the time a convicted offender has spent in detention pending trial for the offence at issue in the proceedings shall , as a rule , be deducted from the term of imprisonment imposed on him . If a period of time spent in detention abroad is to be deducted from the sentence , the court shall determine the period to be deducted at its discretion ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the settled case - law of ORG , which is applied by the criminal courts , LAW , read in conjunction with the principle of the rule of law as enshrined in LAW of LAW , guarantees the right to expeditious criminal proceedings ( see , inter alia , that court \u2019s judgment of DATE , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and decision of CARDINAL DATE , nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Moreover , penalties imposed on a defendant have to comply with the constitutional right to liberty guaranteed by LAW of LAW , read in conjunction with the principle of proportionality enshrined in the rule of law ( see , inter alia , ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and decision of CARDINAL DATE , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As the legislator did not lay down any rules on the consequences of a violation of the right to expeditious proceedings , the criminal courts and the prosecution authorities are , as a rule , called upon to draw the necessary conclusions from undue delay in the proceedings . They may discontinue the proceedings pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINALa of the Code of Criminal Procedure , limit criminal prosecution pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINALa of LAW , terminate the proceedings either by dispensing with a penalty or by a warning with sentence reserved ( PERSON ) or take the LOC length into account as a mitigating factor when fixing the penalty ( see ORG , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and decision of CARDINAL DATE , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . If there was a violation of the right to expeditious proceedings , the criminal courts , in their judgments , expressly had to determine the extent of the delays and their cause . If redress was afforded by a mitigation of the penalty , the courts then had to fix the extent of the compensation granted by indicating the penalty which they would have imposed without the delay and by fixing the penalty mitigated because of the delays . Only the latter , mitigated penalty appeared in the operative part of the judgment ( see , inter alia , ORG , decision of DATE , no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG f\u00fcr ORG ( ORG ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ; ORG , decision of DATE , no . CARDINAL StR DATE , ORG DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL with further references ) .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting as ORG , reversed its previous case - law on the way in which compensation should be granted for excessive delays in criminal proceedings ( file no . GSSt CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that in cases in which criminal proceedings had been excessively delayed , the criminal courts should no longer directly reduce the penalty imposed on the convicted person ( so - called mitigation of penalty approach \u2013 Strafabschlagsl\u00f6sung ) , but should instead state in the operative part of the judgment that a specified part of the penalty imposed was to be considered as having been executed ( so - called \u201c execution approach \u201d \u2013 Vollstreckungsl\u00f6sung ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that in certain cases , mitigating the penalty in order to compensate for the excessive length of proceedings , which was called for by LAW , was not compatible with the provisions of LAW and of LAW . Notably in cases in which compensation could be granted only by reducing a minimum penalty prescribed by law , the \u201c mitigation of penalty approach \u201d could not be reconciled with the provisions of LAW . For instance , it was not possible under the provisions of that LAW to dispense with imposing a mandatory life sentence in order to compensate for the undue duration of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By contrast , the \u201c execution approach \u201d , which could be derived from the principle of compensation enshrined in the ORG and from LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and which was compatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , made it possible to afford compensation in all cases of excessive duration of proceedings . It allowed the criminal courts both to impose the minimum sentence prescribed by law and nevertheless to afford compensation by declaring that a fixed part of that penalty had to be considered as already executed . In the case of a life sentence , for instance , the courts could afford compensation by declaring that a part of the minimum sentence to be served ( see Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL above ) had to be considered as having been served . Moreover , by separating the fixing of the penalty in accordance with the defendant \u2019s guilt and the granting of compensation , the penalty maintained its function with respect to other provisions of criminal law ( concerning , for instance , probation or preventive detention ) and provisions concerning civil servants and foreigners .", "CARDINAL . When applying the \u201c execution approach \u201d , the criminal courts first had to determine the extent and causes of undue delays in the proceedings . In fixing the sentence in accordance with the defendant \u2019s guilt , they had to take into consideration as a mitigating factor that a long lapse of time between the offence and the judgment in general reduced the necessity to punish the offender . Moreover , the undue duration of the proceedings could play a role in that the defendant was subjected to a greater burden as a result of lengthy proceedings . In a furtherthen had to determine which part of the penalty was to be considered as having already been executed in order to compensate the defendant for the delay caused by the ORG authorities and courts contrary to the rule of law . Both the penalty and the part of it which had to be considered as executed had to be taken up in the operative part of the judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
