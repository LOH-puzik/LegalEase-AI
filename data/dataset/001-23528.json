The applicant in application no . CARDINAL , PERSON , was one of its members . DATE she chaired the regional section of the ORG in ORG .", "On DATE ORG adopted ORG . The LAW was published in ORG on DATE and entered into force on DATE . It established CARDINAL organisations : the ORG and the ORG , and provided , in paragraph CARDINAL of its transitional and concluding provisions , that the CARDINAL organisations were the respective successors of the ORG of DATE and the UDB of DATE . By virtue of PODDA all practising medical doctors and dentists in the country were obliged to become members of , respectively , the newly established ORG and ORG . Those medical doctors and dentists who were not practising could , but were not obliged to , become members . PODDA introduced amendments to LAW whereby a medical doctor or a dentist working under an employment contract who had not become a member of the respective union was liable to be dismissed from work without notice and became criminally liable if he or she continued to practise .", "In DATE sixty Members of ORG requested ORG to declare PODDA unconstitutional . They argued that compulsory membership in the ORG and the ORG went against LAW , enshrining , inter alia , negative freedom of association . They further submitted that LAW infringed LAW , guaranteeing the right to work , and also the principle that government functions should not be entrusted to public organisations without their express consent . They also maintained that the LAW created undue privileges for the CARDINAL unions to the detriment of other organisations and that it regulated matters which should have been left to the discretion of the ORG governing bodies . Finally , the MPs asserted that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG was vague and could lead to unjustified gathering of irrelevant information about ORG and ORG members .", "The Constitutional Court gave judgment on DATE . In respect of the allegation that ORG infringed the medical ORG and NORP negative freedom of association it held as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Through PODDA the legislature regulated the structure , the organisation and the activities of the professional organisations of the medical doctors and the dentists , the conditions for practising medicine and odontology , and the responsibility for breaches of professional ethics . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW the professional organisation of medical doctors is the ORG , and that of dentists \u2013 the ORG . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that all medical doctors and dentists who practise their profession must be members of the ORG or the ORG , respectively .", "The [ Members of ORG ] who filed the request maintain that the above provisions contravene LAW , LAW and LAW and QUANTITY of the LAW of GPE , as well as international treaties ... which ... are part of the domestic law of the country ... It is submitted that by requiring all practising medical doctors and dentists to be members of the ORG and LAW infringes the constitutionally protected freedom of association ( LAW ) , because it brings about an element of compulsion which is irreconcilable with that freedom .", "In addition , according to the request , the provisions of the challenged Act run counter to LAW , which proclaims on the one hand the ORG right to work and on the other \u2013 the obligation for the ORG to create the conditions for the realisation of that right .", "The Constitutional Court finds that these submissions and the arguments presented in support of the request are illfounded .", "I.CARDINAL . PODDA does not contain a provision which excludes the right of other organisations , including professional and tradeunion type , founded by medical doctors and dentists , to exist alongside the ORG and the ORG . It does not proscribe the establishment of associations by medical doctors and dentists under LAW or another statute . Therefore , the LAW does not run counter to LAW . It does not affect the constitutionally protected freedom of association , because that freedom pertains to privatelaw associations , including trade unions under LAW . This constitutionally recognised freedom includes not only the freedom to take up the initiative and to form an association , respectively to become a member of an existing one , but also the socalled \u201c negative freedom \u201d , i.e. the right to not become a member of an existing association .", "CARDINAL . NORP PODDA does not lie on the plane of LAW . It is an LAW which creates publiclaw corporations with compulsory membership of medical doctors and dentists . These corporations are endowed with certain publiclaw functions : to organise , control and discipline medical doctors and dentists . Accordingly , freedom of association , proclaimed by LAW , does not apply to them : they are created by statute and not through the free will of their members .", "ORG considers that , when deciding on the applicability of ORG DATE of the LAW to publiclaw corporations , it must have regard to the caselaw of ORG and the interpretation of LAW of LAW [ ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) ] . This provision corresponds to LAW . This is so , because [ ORG ] is part of domestic law and , according to its LAW , the judgments of ORG [ and the interpretations of the ORG contained therein ] are binding on all ORG bodies in the country .", "[ In ] a judgment of ORG in GPE of CARDINAL DATE , the issue [ was ] whether the compulsory membership of medical doctors in a publiclaw corporation \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d \u2013 , created by act of the king of GPE , ran counter to LAW ORG ( which corresponds to LAW ) . That corporation \u2019s aim was to protect the ORG health by exercising control over the practice of medicine . This function led to [ the giving ] a number of administrative powers to the \u201c Ordre [ des m\u00e9decins ] \u201d , including the power to discipline the medical doctors registered with it . According to the unanimous judgment of ORG , the corporation of NORP medical doctors \u201c Ordre [ des m\u00e9decins ] \u201d could not be considered as an association within the meaning of LAW ORG and [ compulsory membership in it ] did not run counter to this Article .", "CARDINAL . It should be pointed out that a similar opinion was expressed by ORG and by the prevailing NORP doctrine in respect of the various publiclaw corporations ( the socalled \u201c chambers \u201d ) which exist in GPE , such as : the ORG , notaries\u2019 , medical ORG , dentists\u2019 , pharmacists\u2019 , handicraftsmen \u2019s , etc . chambers . According to this opinion , the compulsory membership of the persons who practise the respective professions in these chambers does not contravene LAW which proclaims freedom of association , because that Article concerns the formation of notforprofit associations and of companies , which are of privatelaw character and thus do not fall in the category of publiclaw corporations . For this reasons these corporations [ were ] not [ considered ] unconstitutional ...", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to better understand the fundamental difference between a publiclaw corporation with compulsory membership of all persons who practise the respective profession and a voluntary privatelaw association , regard must be had to ORG Human Right \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON [ v. GPE , series A no . CARDINAL ] . Its subjectmatter was an agreement for the compulsory membership of employees in a trade union . Since LAW ORG ( corresponding to LAW ) applies to trade unions , ORG in GPE found in favour of the applicants , because it found that the freedom of association in trade unions could not be restricted through compulsory membership in a given trade union under the threat of dismissal from work of an employee who was not a member .", "The abovementioned judgments of ORG draw a sharp distinction between publiclaw corporations , which have compulsory membership , and privatelaw associations , including trade unions . LAW ORG , corresponding to LAW , applies only to privatelaw associations . The conclusion drawn by ORG is that ORG does not contravene LAW .", "CARDINAL . A decisive argument in support of this conclusion is LAW . Article CARDINAL provides that the Bar is selfgoverning and provides for the adoption of a special statute on its organisation and activities . It is common knowledge that in many countries , and in our country even before LAW of CARDINAL , the practising of the legal profession was subject to membership in the respective lawyers\u2019 organisation , i.e. registration of the person wishing to practise as a lawyer in this organisation . It is therefore beyond question that the Bar is a telling example of a publiclaw corporation . These elements abound in our GPE [ of DATE ] . It is true that the LAW does not expressly provide that the medical ORG and dentists\u2019 unions should be corporations with publiclaw elements . But this is by no means necessary . The formation of various corporations with publiclaw elements is a matter of legislative discretion and is not dependent upon an express constitutional command . By its very nature the LAW can not and should not exhaustively enumerate the permissible forms of organisation . But when it regulates the Bar , it clearly indicates that organisations like it are compatible with LAW . Such an organisation is also ORG ( see LAW [ of DATE ] ) . Such is also the LAW challenged before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Through this Act the ORG performs its obligation under LAW to protect the ORG health and to provide them with highquality health care . By entrusting to medical doctors and dentists themselves the supervision of the CARDINAL professions through corporations ran by them , the challenged Act manages to achieve in the most expedient manner the observance of LAW and LAW , as well the regulation of the profession . Otherwise these functions would have to be entrusted to civil servants who would not be as competent and would cost considerable amounts of money to the ORG budget . This explains why the manner of organisation of medical doctors and dentists used by ORG is also used in a number of NORP countries such as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , [ and ] GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP PODDA is necessary also because of the inseverable link between it and FAC [ of DATE ( \u201e \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0438\u0433\u0443\u0440\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u201c \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) ] , because health insurance , guaranteed by LAW , may function only if the organisations of medical doctors and dentists created by PODDA exist . These organisations are parties to ORG concluded for the purpose of carrying out the activities under ORG . By DATE of ORG , the National Framework Agreement regulates the conditions for and the manner of selecting medical service providers , the forms , conditions and manner in which medical services are dispensed , the amount , prices and method of payment for the medical services and drugs , as well as all other matters relating to health security . In other words , not a single health security activity could be carried out without this Agreement , which would deprive the citizens of the possibility to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed ( LAW [ of LAW ] ) right to health security . This convincingly demonstrates that not only does PODDA not contravene LAW , but that it is in fact mandated by LAW , so that the right guaranteed by LAW becomes a social reality .", "... \u201d", "As regards the allegation that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG was vague and allowed the gathering and retention of personal information , ORG held :", "\u201c ... it is true that point CARDINAL [ of section GPE ) ] has a blanket wording . However , it is sufficient to connect this provision with section CARDINAL of [ PODDA ] in order to see that the term \u201c other circumstances \u201d means a number of facts set forth in section PERSON ) , without being expressly referred to in section GPE ) points CARDINAL to CARDINAL , but which should nevertheless be entered in the register ( e.g. length of service , indication that a doctor is a foreign national , [ and ] criminal record ) . If sections DATE and DATE are construed in connection with one another , the conclusion could and should be that \u201c other circumstances \u201d means exactly the facts mentioned in section CARDINAL . Thus , the blanket wording of point CARDINAL of section GPE ) becomes clear and the alleged infringement of the rights set forth by LAW is excluded . \u201d", "CARDINAL judges dissented from ORG judgment , each writing an individual dissenting opinion .", "The dissenting judges were of the opinion , inter alia , that the ORG and the ORG could not be considered as falling outside the scope of LAW . The argument that they had been created by law was not persuasive because ORG had merely branded CARDINAL notforprofit associations \u201c professional organisations \u201d and had endowed them with certain publiclaw functions without declaring their liquidation or transformation or annulling the court \u2019s decisions for their registration ; it was doubtful whether this could be done by an ORG . The unions were essentially privatelaw associations , much like the one at issue in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . Also , the notion of publiclaw functions was not unambiguous and could not serve as a basis for excluding the unions in question from the ambit of LAW . Indeed , by section MONEY ) of ORG , the CARDINAL unions represented their members and protected their professional rights and interests , which were functions of a typical association or trade union .", "\u201c CARDINAL .
