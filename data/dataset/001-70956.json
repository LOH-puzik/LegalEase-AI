GPE was founded on the principle that the ORG should be secular ( laik ) .

The principle of secularism was inspired by developments in NORP society in the period DATE and the proclamation of the Republic . The idea of creating a modern public society in which equality was guaranteed to all citizens without distinction on grounds of religion , denomination or sex had already been mooted in the NORP debates of DATE . Significant advances in women \u2019s rights were made during this period ( equality of treatment in education , the introduction of a ban on polygamy in DATE , the transfer of jurisdiction in matrimonial cases to the secular courts that had been established in DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The defining feature of the NORP ideal was the presence of women in public life and their active participation in society . Consequently , the ideas that women should be freed from religious constraints and that society should be modernised had a common origin . Thus , on DATE LAW was adopted , which provided for equality of the sexes in the enjoyment of civic rights , in particular with regard to divorce and succession . Subsequently , through a constitutional amendment of DATE ( LAW ) , women obtained equal political rights to men .", "CARDINAL . The first legislation to regulate dress was LAW of DATE ( Law no .

The LAW is one of the laws with constitutional status that are protected by LAW .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , wearing the NORP headscarf to school and university is a recent phenomenon which only really began to emerge in DATE . There has been extensive discussion on the issue and it continues to be the subject of lively debate in NORP society . Those in favour of the headscarf see wearing it as a duty and/or a form of expression linked to religious identity . However , the supporters of secularism , who draw a distinction between the ba\u015f\u00f6rt\u00fcs\u00fc ( traditional NORP headscarf , worn loosely ) and the t\u00fcrban ( tight , knotted headscarf hiding the hair and the throat ) , see the NORP headscarf as a symbol of a political ORG . As a result of the accession to power on DATE of a coalition government comprising the NORP PERSON , and the centre - right PERSON , the debate has taken on strong political overtones . The ambivalence displayed by the leaders of FAC , including the then Prime Minister , over their attachment to democratic values , and their advocacy of a plurality of legal systems functioning according to different religious rules for each religious community was perceived in NORP society as a genuine threat to NORP values and civil peace ( see PERSON ( ORG ) and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . ORG , CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-II ) .", "CARDINAL . The first piece of legislation on dress in institutions of higher education was a set of regulations issued by the ORG on DATE requiring staff working for public organisations and institutions and personnel and female students at ORG institutions to wear ordinary , sober , modern dress .

On DATE ORG issued a circular on the wearing of headscarves in institutions of higher education . The NORP headscarf was banned in lecture theatres . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the regulations were lawful , noting :", "\u201c Beyond being a mere innocent practice , wearing the headscarf is in the process of becoming the symbol of a vision that is contrary to the freedoms of women and the fundamental principles of the Republic . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

A veil or headscarf covering the neck and hair may be worn out of religious conviction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE published in ORG of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the aforementioned provision was contrary to ORG ( secularism ) , CARDINAL ( equality before the law ) and CARDINAL ( freedom of religion ) of the LAW . It also found that it could not be reconciled with the principle of sexual equality implicit , inter alia , in NORP and revolutionary values ( see Preamble and LAW ) .", "In their judgment , the Constitutional Court judges explained , firstly , that secularism had acquired constitutional status by reason of the historical experience of the country and the particularities of ORG compared to other religions ; secularism was an essential condition for democracy and acted as a guarantor of freedom of religion and of equality before the law . It also prevented the ORG from showing a preference for a particular religion or belief ; consequently , a secular ORG could not invoke religious conviction when performing its legislative function . They stated , inter alia :", "\u201c Secularism is the civil organiser of political , social and cultural life , based on national sovereignty , democracy , freedom and science . Secularism is the principle which offers the individual the possibility to affirm his or her own personality through freedom of thought and which , by the distinction it makes between politics and religious beliefs , renders freedom of conscience and religion effective . In societies based on religion , which function with religious thought and religious rules , political organisation is religious in character . In a secular regime , religion is shielded from a political role . It is not a tool of the authorities and remains in its respectable place , to be determined by the conscience of each and everyone ... \u201d", "Stressing its inviolable nature , ORG observed that freedom of religion , conscience and worship , which could not be equated with a right to wear any particular religious attire , guaranteed first and foremost the liberty to decide whether or not to follow a religion . It explained that , once outside the private sphere of individual conscience , freedom to manifest one \u2019s religion could be restricted on public - order grounds to defend the principle of secularism .", "Everyone was free to choose how to dress , as the social and religious values and traditions of society also had to be respected . However , when a particular dress code was imposed on individuals by reference to a religion , the religion concerned was perceived and presented as a set of values that were incompatible with those of contemporary society . In addition , in GPE , where the majority of the population were NORP , presenting the wearing of the NORP headscarf as a mandatory religious duty would result in discrimination between practising NORP , non - practising NORP and non - believers on grounds of dress with anyone who refused to wear the headscarf undoubtedly being regarded as opposed to religion or as non - religious .", "ORG also said that students had to be permitted to work and pursue their education together in a calm , tolerant and mutually supportive atmosphere without being deflected from that goal by signs of religious affiliation . It found that , irrespective of whether the NORP headscarf was a precept of ORG , granting legal recognition to a religious symbol of that type in institutions of higher education was not compatible with the principle that ORG education must be neutral , as it would be liable to generate conflicts between students with differing religious convictions or beliefs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE transitional section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL came into force . It provides :", "\u201c Choice of dress shall be free in institutions of higher education , provided that it does not contravene the laws in force . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was published in ORG of DATE , ORG noted that , in the light of the principles it had established in its judgment of DATE , the aforementioned provision did not allow headscarves to be worn in institutions of higher education on religious grounds and so was consistent with the LAW . It stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... the expression \u2018 laws in CARDINAL refers first and foremost to the LAW ... In institutions of higher education , it is contrary to the principles of secularism and equality for the neck and hair to be covered with a veil or headscarf on grounds of religious conviction . In these circumstances , the freedom of dress which the impugned provision permits in institutions of higher education \u2018 does not concern dress of a religious nature or the act of covering one \u2019s neck and hair with a veil and headscarf\u2019 ... The freedom afforded by this provision [ transitional section CARDINAL ] is conditional on its not being contrary to \u2018 the laws in CARDINAL . The judgment [ of DATE ] of ORG establishes that covering one \u2019s neck and hair with the headscarf is first and foremost contrary to LAW . Consequently , the condition set out in the aforementioned section requiring [ choice of ] dress not to contravene the laws in force removes from the scope of freedom of dress the act of \u2018 covering one \u2019s neck and hair with the headscarf\u2019 ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
