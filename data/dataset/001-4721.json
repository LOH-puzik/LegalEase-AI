AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE and living in Hard .", "He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE", "In DATE the applicant concluded with PERSON a contract for the purchase of a plot of land situated in the PERSON region .", "On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , filed a request with ORG ( Grundverkehrs - Landeskommission ) to approve the acquisition of the plot of land by the above sales contract .", "On DATE ORG , referring in particular to sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of the DATE ORG ( Grundverkehrsgesetz ) , as amended in DATE , refused the approval . It found in particular that the plot of land formed part of the \u201c Mais\u00e4ss \u201d ( an alpine pasture at middle elevation up to CARDINAL m ) Zafern no . CARDINAL . The cottage on this plot , which the applicant had meanwhile renovated and transformed into a secondary residence , formed an important part of this pasture , even if it was not used for agricultural purposes . It was not in the interests of efficient peasantry and sound agricultural estates to split up this farming entity .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , following an oral hearing on DATE in the presence of the applicant \u2019s counsel , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . In its decision the ORG noted his appeal submissions , in particular his assertion that he had not known about the necessity of approval under LAW . The ORG considered that it was not credible that the vendor of the plot of land , then mayor of PERSON , had ignored the legal situation when drawing up the written contract in DATE . It rather appeared that the contract had been concluded in DATE in order to circumvent LAW , and that the reconstruction work had been carried out by the applicant in order to obtain approval , the cottage having been changed so as to remove any sign of its previous agricultural use . These measures contravened the general interest in maintaining an efficient peasantry and an economically sound structure for small and middle size farming entities .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ) . He complained about a violation of his right to be heard by a legally competent court ( gesetzlicher Richter ) , claiming that the real transaction authorities lacked competence as LAW did not apply to the plot of land in question . He further complained that the decision of ORG was arbitrary in presuming an intention to circumvent the provisions of LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint . ORG observed at the outset that in accordance with the transitional provisions of the DATE LAW , which had entered into force in DATE , the DATE Act continued to apply to pending proceedings . As regards the competence of the real estate transactions authorities , ORG noted that when the applicant had acquired the plot of land in DATE , it had been an agricultural estate as there had been a \u201c LOC cottage on it . Such cottages served farmers inter alia in DATE and DATE for feeding purposes before and after the periods spent on the high alpine pastures . ORG had convincingly reasoned that the reconstruction of the cottage as a secondary residence had changed the initial purpose of the plot of land , and that such action served to circumvent the legal rules . In this context , the question of intent was irrelevant , it was sufficient that , objectively seen , there was such a circumvention . On the whole , there was no appearance of arbitrariness .", "The decision was served on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
