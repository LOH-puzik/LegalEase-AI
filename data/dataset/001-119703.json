The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . For DATE , the applicant has expressed the wish to end her life . She explained that she is becoming more and more frail as time passes and is unwilling to continue suffering the decline of her physical and mental faculties .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following a failed suicide attempt , the applicant received inpatient treatment for DATE in a psychiatric hospital . This treatment did not , however , alter her wish to die . As the applicant was afraid of the possible consequences of another failed suicide attempt , she decided that she wished to end her life by taking a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital . She contacted an assisted - death association , ORG , for support , which replied that it would be difficult to find a medical practitioner who would be ready to provide her with a medical prescription for the lethal drug .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a psychiatrist , PERSON , having examined the applicant on DATE and DATE , submitted an expert opinion on the applicant \u2019s capacity to form her own judgment ( PERSON ) . He noted that the applicant had never been seriously ill and did not have to undergo major surgery . However , in DATE , the applicant had noted a decline in her physical and , to a certain degree , her mental faculties . Her memory , her capacity to concentrate and her attention span were not what they used to be . She had difficulty undertaking long walks and her range of activities and her circle of friends had diminished . Accordingly , it had been her strong desire for DATE to be allowed to end her life , which she felt was becoming more and more monotonous . She could hardly bear her physical decline . Furthermore , she increasingly suffered from eczema and back aches and every change in her environment terrified her . Her quality of life was constantly decreasing , and she also suffered from the fact that she could not talk openly about her wish to die with her friends .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of his psychiatric examination , PERSON observed that there was no doubt that the applicant was able to form her own judgment . He further noted that her wish to die was reasoned and well - considered , had persisted for DATE and was not based on any psychiatric illness . From a psychiatric / medical point of view , PERSON did not have any objection to the applicant being prescribed a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital . However , he refrained from issuing the necessary prescription himself on the grounds that he did not want to confuse the roles of medical expert and treating physician .", "CARDINAL . By letters of DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s representative submitted the applicant \u2019s request to be given a prescription for sodium pentobarbital to CARDINAL further medical practitioners , who all declined to issue the requested prescription . In a letter dated DATE medical practitioner PERSON explained that she felt prevented by the code of professional medical conduct ( aus standesrechtlichen Gr\u00fcnden ) from issuing the requested prescription , given that the applicant was not suffering from any illness . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE medical practitioner PERSON stated that she considered the applicant \u2019s wish to die to be understandable . She stated that she would be ready to examine the applicant and to consider her request to issue the required prescription , provided that the applicant \u2019s counsel could guarantee that she would not risk any consequences from the point of view of the code of professional medical conduct . When the applicant \u2019s counsel replied that he could not give such a guarantee , PERSON declined the request on the grounds that she did not wish to be drawn into lengthy judicial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request to ORG to be provided with QUANTITY grams of sodium pentobarbital in order for her to commit suicide . She submitted that she could not reasonably be expected to continue her search for a physician who was ready to issue the required medical prescription .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request on the grounds that neither LAW nor LAW obliged the ORG to provide a person who wished to end his or her life with the means of suicide of their choice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of the GPE of GPE . On DATE , ORG rejected the appeal . ORG noted , at the outset , that assisting someone to commit suicide was only subject to criminal liability under LAW if it was carried out for selfish motives . Accordingly , a physician who provided a patient suffering from a terminal illness with the means to commit suicide was not subject to criminal liability ( ORG referred to the case - law of ORG , judgment of DATE , BGE CARDINAL I DATE , summarised in PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) . The prerequisite of a medical prescription for obtaining a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital was in accordance with LAW and with LAW . It ensured that a medical practitioner had examined all pertinent aspects of the matter and thus served the general interest in public health and safety and \u2013 in connection with assisted suicide \u2013 the prevention of crime and combating the risk of abuse . The medical prescription served the aim of preventing premature decisions and guaranteed that the intended action was medically justified . It further ensured that the decision was based on a deliberate exercise of the free will of the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that PERSON , in his expert opinion , had stated that he did not have any objection from a psychiatric / medical point of view to the applicant being prescribed a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital . However , PERSON had merely examined whether the applicant was able to form her own free will and whether her wish to die was well thought out and persistent . He had not , however , considered whether the applicant was suffering from any illness which would justify the assumption that the end of her life was near . Neither had he examined whether the applicant \u2019s wish to die might be the manifestation of a disease which could be medically treated . The wish to die taken on its own , even if it was wellconsidered , was not sufficient to justify the issuing of a medical prescription . Accordingly , the content of the case file did not demonstrate that the necessary prerequisites for issuing a medical prescription had been fulfilled in the instant case . There was therefore a need for further medical examination .", "CARDINAL . Under these circumstances , there was no sufficient reason to dispense the applicant from the necessity of a thorough medical examination and of a medical prescription .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against ORG judgment . She repeated her request to be provided with QUANTITY of sodium pentobarbital , alternatively through a pharmacy . She further asked ORG to establish that the provision of a lethal dose of this substance to a person who was able to form her own judgment and was not suffering from a mental or physical illness did not constitute a violation of a medical practitioner \u2019s professional duties .", "CARDINAL . Relying , explicitly or in substance , on ORG , DATE and DATE of the Convention , she alleged that the impugned decisions had rendered her right to decide by which means and at what point her life would end illusory . She averred that the ORG was under an obligation to provide the necessary means allowing her to exercise this right in a concrete and effective way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . Relying on its own case - law and on the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of Pretty v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIII ) , ORG considered , in particular , that there was no ( positive ) obligation enjoining the ORG to guarantee an individual \u2019s access to a particularly dangerous substance in order to allow him or her to die in a painless way and without the risk of failure . ORG observed that proceedings in the PERSON case were pending before ORG . Accordingly , it was up to that ORG to examine whether ORG had correctly interpreted LAW in this context . Pending these proceedings , ORG did not see any reason to revise its reasoning in the ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG furthermore held that the requirement of a medical prescription pursued the legitimate aims of protecting the individual concerned from making a hasty decision and of preventing abuse . The restriction on access to sodium pentobarbital served the protection of public health and safety . In view of the ethical questions relating to medically assisted suicide , it was primarily up to the democratically elected legislature to decide if and under which circumstances the purchase , transport and storage of sodium pentobarbital should be allowed . ORG observed in this context that a reform of the law on assisted suicide was currently the subject of political debate .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Supreme Court further observed that the applicant undisputedly did not fulfil the prerequisites laid down in the medical ethics guidelines on the care of patients at the end of life adopted by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d , see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , as she was not suffering from a terminal illness , but had expressed her wish to die because of her advanced age and increasing frailty . Even though ORG had considered in its previously cited decision that the issuing of a medical prescription for sodium pentobarbital to a person suffering from an incurable , persistent and serious psychological illness did not necessarily amount to a violation of a doctor \u2019s professional duties , this exception had to be handled with \u201c utmost restraint \u201d and did not enjoin the medical profession or the ORG to provide the applicant with the requested dose of sodium pentobarbital to put an end to her life . ORG further noted that the issuing of the requested substance required a thorough medical examination and , with respect to the persistence of the wish to die , long - term medical supervision by a specialist practitioner who was ready to issue the necessary prescription . This requirement could n", "ot be circumvented by the applicant \u2019s request for an exemption from the necessity of obtaining a medical prescription .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , ORG submitted CARDINAL alternative legal projects aimed at regulating organised assisted suicide . It proposed CARDINAL options that would change NORP criminal law : the determination in LAW of clear duties of care for employees of assisted suicide organisations , or a complete ban on organised assisted suicide per se ( see the press release issued by ORG and Police on DATE ) . The consultation of the cantons , political parties and other interested parties ( GPE ) demonstrated that no consensus on the issue could be reached . While a majority of the consulted parties considered that the federal law should define specific duties of care within the context of assisted suicide , they could not agree on the concrete implementation . On DATE ORG decided to refrain from including specific regulations on organised assisted suicide in criminal law , while expressing its intent on fostering suicide prevention and palliative care in order to reduce the number of suicides ( see the press release issued by ORG on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was called upon to examine a request to be granted a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital lodged by a plaintiff who had been suffering from a serious bipolar affective disorder and considered that as a result , he could no longer live in a dignified manner . Since that substance was only available on prescription , he approached several psychiatrists to obtain it , but was unsuccessful . In its judgment ( published in ORG of ORG , ORG DATE , summarised in ORG , cited above , LAW DATE ) , ORG considered that sodium pentobarbital could not be issued without a medical prescription . It noted , in particular , that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW had to be interpreted narrowly and did not allow for an exemption in the event that no doctor could be found who was ready to issue a prescription . ORG further considered that the following prerequisites had to be met before a doctor could issue a medical prescription for sodium pentobarbital : a thorough and considered examination ; a medical indication ; and , with regard to the genuineness of the wish to die and capacity for discernment in this connection , monitoring over a certain period by a medical specialist . Following that judgment , in DATE the plaintiff wrote to CARDINAL psychiatrists setting out his case and asking each of them whether they would agree to produce a psychiatric report on him with a view to issuing a prescription for sodium pentobarbital . None of the doctors responded positively to his request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the validity of an agreement concluded by ORG of the canton of GPE and the assisted - death organisation EXIT aimed at lying down specific rules to be observed in assisted - death cases . ORG considered that the agreement was invalid as it lacked a legal basis and was not in accordance with the domestic law ( BGE CARDINAL II CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment given on DATE , ORG referred to the medical ethics guidelines on the care of patients at the end of life which were adopted on DATE by ORG ( ORG ) , an association of the CARDINAL medical faculties and the CARDINAL veterinary faculties in GPE . According to the case - law of ORG ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , BGE CARDINAL IV CARDINAL ) , the guidelines issued by ORG do not have the formal quality of law . As they prescribe a number of precautionary measures , they can be classed as a code of conduct \u2014 the value of which is generally accepted by the practitioners bound by it . Furthermore , these guidelines may serve to define the duty of diligence in criminal proceedings or in proceedings concerning civil liability .", "CARDINAL .

However , in the final phase of life , when the situation becomes intolerable for the patient , he or she may ask for help in committing suicide and may persist in this wish .", "In this borderline situation a very difficult conflict of interests can arise for the doctor . On the one hand assisted suicide is not part of a doctor \u2019s task , because this contradicts the aims of medicine .
