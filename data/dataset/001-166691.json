THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible (Article 35-1 - Exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Article 14+P1-1-1 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property;Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Ledi Bianku;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paul Mahoney;Pauliine Koskelo;Robert Spano;Simon Brown", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Nepalese Gurkha soldiers have served the ORG since DATE , initially as soldiers in the ( NORP ) ORG . Following NORP independence in DATE , CARDINAL ORG regiments were transferred to ORG , while CARDINAL regiments became an integral part of ORG . CARDINAL ORG soldiers fought in the CARDINAL world wars , and in DATE they have served in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the LOC , GPE , GPE and GPE . They have served in a variety of roles , mainly in the infantry but also as engineers and in signals and logistics units .", "CARDINAL . DATE , they form ORG ( \u201c the Brigade \u201d ) , in which only NORP nationals are eligible for service . The Brigade is not an operational brigade in the conventional sense ; rather , it is an administrative entity which ensures that ORG units , into which all ORG soldiers are recruited and serve , are able to be integrated into \u2013 and form part of \u2013 other operational brigades in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Brigade was originally based in LOC , in the region formerly known as GPE . In DATE the ORG \u2019s base moved to GPE . On completion of the handover of GPE to GPE in DATE , the home base moved to GPE . Consequently , the majority of NORP are currently stationed in GPE , although since DATE a section of the Brigade has been stationed in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c the Tripartite Agreement \u201d ) , ORG , GPE and GPE agreed that the salary of NORP serving in ORG would be set by reference to rates applied by GPE in respect of NORP soldiers so as to avoid competition between the NORP and NORP armies for ORG recruits . ORG basic pay was therefore set in accordance with the NORP LAW , although cost - of - living allowances were paid for service outside GPE . These allowances used to be calculated by reference to local living expenses ( for example , in GPE or GPE ) , but in DATE , when the Brigade \u2019s home base moved to GPE , a \u201c universal addition \u201d was introduced to ensure that , whenever a ORG soldier was serving outside GPE , his take - home pay would be similar to that of a non - NORP soldier in ORG of comparable rank and experience . However , the \u201c universal addition \u201d was not treated as pensionable pay .", "CARDINAL . Prior to DATE , ORG entitlement ( that is , an entitlement for the soldier to be accompanied by wife and children ) was for one married accompanied tour of DATE in DATE of service and for permanent accompanied service for NORP ranked ORG and above . However , with effect from DATE , those who had served for DATE or more in the Brigade were entitled to ORG ( in other words , they were entitled to be joined in GPE by their wives and children ) .", "CARDINAL . Gurkha soldiers are required to retire after DATE service , subject to the possibility , dependent on rank , of CARDINAL or more yearly extensions .", "CARDINAL . In comparison , other soldiers in ORG are entitled to serve for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Historically , ORG soldiers were discharged to GPE and it was presumed that they would remain there during retirement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG CARDINAL ) were changed to permit NORP soldiers with CARDINAL years\u2019 service who retired on or after DATE ( the date that the ORG \u2019s home base relocated to GPE ) to apply for settlement in GPE . MONEY of the CARDINAL eligible ORG soldiers have since applied successfully to settle in GPE with their qualifying dependants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG announced a new policy under which all former NORP who had served in ORG for DATE would be eligible for settlement in GPE . CARDINAL per cent of those eligible have since applied for resettlement in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Tripartite Agreement provided that the pensions of NORP serving in ORG would also be set by reference to the rates applied by GPE to NORP soldiers .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Gurkha Pension Scheme ( \u201c GPS \u201d ) was established by ORG and applied the former ORG to NORP serving in ORG Pension entitlements under the GPS were index - linked to the cost of living in GPE as it was presumed that the NORP would retire there . Pensions were immediately payable upon retirement and could not be deferred . A ORG who retired without having served DATE would be entitled to no pension whatsoever .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG pensions were reviewed and the rate payable was set at the highest rate applicable under the ORG pension arrangements .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following a ministerial review , the rates applicable to the pensions of NORP in the Brigade were increased by MONEY , taking them over the scales set by ORG . The rationale for the increase was that a ORG who retired from the Brigade to GPE would not receive the benefit of various schemes which soldiers retiring from ORG could access , such as the provision of certain medical facilities . The increase applied to all NORP regardless of the date of discharge .", "CARDINAL . ORG soldiers retiring from ORG are entitled to pensions under either ORG DATE ( \u201c AFPS CARDINAL \u201d ) or ORG ( \u201c AFPS CARDINAL \u201d ) depending on when they commenced service . Neither scheme is indexlinked with the cost of living in the soldier \u2019s country of origin .", "CARDINAL . Under the AFPS , soldiers are eligible for deferred pensions , payable at DATE , provided that they have rendered CARDINAL years\u2019 service before leaving ORG . In order to receive an immediate pension officers are required to serve for DATE and all other ranks are required to serve for DATE ; however , in practice CARDINAL of non - Gurkha soldiers in ORG serve for sufficiently long periods to be eligible for an immediate pension .", "CARDINAL . NORP The annual pension entitlement under the GPS is broadly equivalent \u2013 taking into account the adjustments made in DATE and DATE \u2013 to CARDINAL of that under the AFPS .", "CARDINAL . Following the DATE amendment to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Secretary of ORG announced a review of the Gurkhas\u2019 Terms and ORG . The review noted that the DATE amendment to ORG and the changes to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had changed the traditional assumption that NORP Gurkhas would retire in GPE , and pointed to a future in which they could be expected increasingly to regard GPE , rather than GPE , as their family base . ORG therefore concluded that , the affordability issues notwithstanding , the major differences in NORP terms and conditions of service could no longer be justified on legal or moral grounds and recommended that they be modernised by bringing them largely into line with those available to the wider ORG .", "CARDINAL . With regard to pensions , the review concluded that on balance the GPS was more suitable than the AFPS to support the life - cycle of the great majority of NORP up until DATE . However , moving the ORG \u2019s base to GPE and the subsequent change to ORG had altered the previously valid assumption that NORP would retire in GPE . For a ORG retiring to a second career in GPE , the GPS profile was", "\u201c clearly wrong , paying sums too small to be useful at a time when he does not need them and an inadequate pension at retirement age . As the life profile of the typical ORG approaches that of his GPE / Commonwealth counterpart , there can be little to be said in favour of providing them with such different pension benefit profiles . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The report recommended that serving and retired members of the Brigade should be allowed to transfer from the GPS to either AFPS CARDINAL or DATE , depending on when they enlisted . Those who were already in the GPS and wished to remain in it could do so , but it would be closed with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE formulated the ORG to ORG ( \u201c GOTT \u201d ) and this was given effect in ORG Order DATE ( \u201c the DATE Order \u201d ) . NORP who retired DATE did not qualify for the GOTT . However , the ORG enabled ORG soldiers who retired on or after DATE to transfer from the GPS to either AFPS CARDINAL or AFPS CARDINAL depending on when they first enlisted in ORG . The terms of any transfer were such that the accrued rights to a pension for service after DATE would transfer into the AFPS scheme on a year - for - DATE basis .", "CARDINAL . In respect of service rendered DATE the Explanatory Memorandum to the DATE Order explained that", "\u201c although ORG service from DATE is transferable on a CARDINAL - for - CARDINAL basis , LAW provides that ORG service counts proportionately depending upon the rank of the transferee . This proportion is not arbitrary : it has been arrived at after careful calculation by ORG . It represents broadly the value of the DATE benefits accrued in the GPS . A ORG transferring to either AFPS will be given fair pension value for his GPS service . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under the actuarial calculation adopted by the ORG , a DATE \u2019s service before DATE translated \u2013 in terms of pension entitlement \u2013 to the equivalent of CARDINAL and MONEY of the value of a DATE \u2019s service of a non - Gurkha soldier of equivalent rank .", "CARDINAL . The transition from the GPS to the AFPS for those opting to transfer who were already in receipt of a pension under the GPS did not deprive them of their existing GPS pension , which would continue to be paid . Transfer to the relevant AFPS occurred at DATE , when they received the preserved pension . However , as they had been in receipt of the GPS pension from around the age of CARDINAL , the capital value of the pension pot at retirement age would be reduced by the payments received under the GPS up to that date .", "CARDINAL . Nearly all serving NORP elected to transfer to the PERSON ( only CARDINAL.CARDINAL per cent elected to remain in the GPS ) . Of those who had retired , but remained eligible for transfer , MONEY elected to remain in the GPS .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is a non - governmental unincorporated association that acts on behalf of CARDINAL former members of the Brigade .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant is a former ORG soldier who retired from ORG on DATE after having accumulated CARDINAL years\u2019 service . As he completed his service prior to DATE , he is ineligible to transfer any of his pensionable years to CARDINAL of the AFPSs . His pension continues to be governed by the ORG and , as such , is valued at MONEY of that which a NORP soldier of equivalent rank would receive for the same period and type of service .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant is a former ORG soldier who retired from the Brigade on DATE after having accumulated CARDINAL years\u2019 service . DATE of service were transferred into the PERSON on a year - for - year basis . The preceding DATE of service were transferred under an actuarial calculation pursuant to the DATE Order . Under that calculation the pensionable value of DATE of service was regarded as equivalent to CARDINAL per cent of DATE served by a NORP soldier of equivalent rank engaged in the same type of service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants issued an application for judicial review in the High Court challenging the legality of both ( a ) the decision that NORP who retired prior to DATE were not entitled to transfer their pension rights under the GPS into the AFPS and ( b ) the decision that , for those NORP who retired after DATE , service before that date did not rank on a year - for - DATE basis . The challenge was advanced on CARDINAL grounds : under LAW DATE ( namely , that there had been a breach of a procedural duty to promote equality of opportunity ) ; on grounds of irrationality ; and under LAW No . CARDINAL read together with LAW . In relation to the third ground , the applicants alleged that they were discriminated against in their entitlement to an army pension on the basis of their age and/or nationality . In particular , they argued that they were treated differently both from younger ORG soldiers who had ( more ) years of service after DATE and from regular ORG soldiers .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were granted permission to pursue their judicial review application . A hearing took place in DATE . At the hearing the parties agreed that the DATE change to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was irrelevant for the purpose of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application on all CARDINAL grounds . In respect of the age discrimination challenge ORG relied on its earlier decision in R ( PERSON ) v. ORG [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ( summarised at paragraphs DATE below ) , in which it held that the difference in treatment did not occur due to the difference in age but due to the dates at which service had been rendered . The judge in the present applicants\u2019 case noted that", "\u201c when lines are drawn for any purpose by reference to dates the result may well include some indirect age discrimination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In reaching this conclusion , the court rejected the argument DATE advanced by the applicants \u2013 that age discrimination should be treated as a \u201c suspect \u201d ground .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the discrimination - on - grounds - of - nationality challenge ORG considered that it was bound by R ( GPE and Others ) v. ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ( summarised at paragraphs DATE below ) , in which ORG had ruled that NORP with service before DATE were in a markedly different position from other soldiers serving in ORG before that date . The difference in pension arrangements reflected the different historical position of the NORP . Although ORG accepted that the DATE change in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) undermined some of the assumptions supporting the decision in GPE , it held that the changes did not affect the reasoning of ORG as that reasoning applied to the calculation of pension entitlements which accrued DATE . For all the reasons advanced by the ORG Judge in GPE , ORG considered that the choice of DATE to mark the boundary for different treatment of accrued pension was a rational and reasonable CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were granted permission to appeal to ORG . On appeal , their case was put exclusively by reference to LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal . In respect of the discrimination - on - grounds - of - nationality claim ORG , like ORG , considered itself bound by the decision in GPE ( cited above ) . In respect of the age - discrimination claim the court , relying on ORG judgment in PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE , held that even if a relevant comparison could be drawn between older and younger NORP , ORG could easily justify the difference in treatment .", "CARDINAL .
