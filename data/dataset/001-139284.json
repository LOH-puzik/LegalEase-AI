He is represented before the ORG by ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE with ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant was convicted by a jury of murder . GPE was the principal witness at his trial . The applicant was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) dismissed his appeal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( \u201c CCRC \u201d ) for a review of his conviction . On DATE the ORG referred the applicant \u2019s case back to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It considered in detail a number of alleged failings in the applicant \u2019s defence at trial . It concluded that the failure by the applicant \u2019s defence team to deploy relevant evidence in respect of , inter alia , GPE in his defence resulted in his conviction being unsafe , explaining :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is difficult to conclude that the criticisms and failures which we have found in respect of any CARDINAL of the individual topics were on their own sufficient to render the verdict unsafe but we are quite satisfied that taken together , cumulatively they were sufficient to render the verdict unsafe . Each of these topics was important ...", "CARDINAL . We are not to be taken as finding that if there had been no such failures the appellant would inevitably have been acquitted . We are however satisfied for the reasons given that the verdict is unsafe . The appeal will be allowed and the conviction quashed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the quashing of the conviction , the applicant applied to the Secretary of ORG for compensation for a miscarriage of justice pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors were informed that the Secretary of ORG did not consider that a right to compensation arose in his case , for CARDINAL reasons . First , the applicant \u2019s conviction had not been reversed on the basis of new or newly discovered facts . Second , it could not be said that there had been a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the applicant should never have been convicted . All that could be said , on the basis of the judgment of the ORG , was that the jury might or might not have reached a different conclusion had the defence made proper use of the material in question .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently brought judicial review proceedings challenging the decision to refuse to pay him compensation under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . He contended that he met the criteria for compensation set out in that section .", "CARDINAL . The claim was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The court referred to the comment of the ORG to the effect that the judgment quashing the conviction was not to be taken as finding that if there had been no failures the applicant would inevitably have been acquitted . The court considered the discussion of the meaning of \u201c miscarriage of justice \u201d by ORG of PERSON and PERSON in R ( PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) and held that the applicant did not fall within either interpretation . The court further noted counsel for the applicant \u2019s concession that he could not succeed in showing beyond reasonable doubt that a miscarriage of justice had occurred in light of ORG judgment in R ( PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court concluded that , in any event , the conviction had not been quashed on the basis of new or newly discovered facts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted leave to appeal on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . Lord Justice PERSON , giving judgment for the court , accepted that the applicant \u2019s conviction had been quashed on the basis of new or newly discovered facts . He therefore turned to examine whether there had been a miscarriage of justice .", "CARDINAL . He identified CARDINAL categories of case where the ORG allowed an appeal against conviction on the basis of fresh evidence , and explained each category as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... A category CARDINAL case is where the court is sure that the defendant is innocent of the crime of which he has been convicted . An obvious example is where DNA evidence , not obtainable at the time of trial , shows beyond doubt that the defendant was not guilty of the offence . A category CARDINAL case is where the fresh evidence shows that he was wrongly convicted in the sense that , had the fresh evidence been available at the trial , no reasonable jury could properly have convicted . An example is where the prosecution case rested entirely on the evidence of a witness who was put forward as a witness of truth and fresh evidence undermines the creditworthiness of that witness , so that no fair - minded jury could properly have convicted on the evidence of that witness . It does not follow in a category CARDINAL case that the defendant was innocent . A category CARDINAL case is where the fresh evidence is such that the conviction can not be regarded as safe , but the court can not say that no fair - minded jury could properly convict if there were to be a trial which included the fresh evidence . The court concludes that a fair - minded jury might convict or it might acquit . There is a fourth category of case to which Lord PERSON referred in PERSON . This is where a conviction is quashed because something has gone seriously wrong in the investigation of the offence or the conduct of the trial , resulting in the conviction of someone who should not have been convicted . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
