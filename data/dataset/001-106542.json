NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before ORG by Ms PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s DATE daughter went into labour after a normal pregnancy . At TIME she was admitted to the maternity ward of FAC in GPE and , following an episiotomy , gave birth to a healthy baby boy at TIME", "CARDINAL . Following the delivery , she repeatedly complained to her parents and the hospital staff about intense pain in the perineum . She was unable to care for the baby . It appears that she behaved unusually as she lost interest in the baby and attempted to leave the hospital .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , TIME following the delivery the level of his daughter \u2019s white blood cells considerably decreased and she suffered from low blood pressure , low temperature , intense pain , incoherent speech and temporary loss of consciousness . The applicant submits that the hospital staff did not react to those symptoms and did not administer any treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter was transferred to the intensive care unit . On the following day the hospital contacted her parents to inform them that her condition was very serious . On DATE she died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a criminal complaint with ORG . The prosecutor instituted an investigation into the case of unintentional homicide of the applicant \u2019s daughter ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an autopsy was carried out . It established the presence of streptococcus A bacteria in the body of the applicant \u2019s daughter . No such bacteria had been found at the hospital following the examination of the medical personnel and the hospital premises .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s request , ORG carried out a control of the hospital on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . It established that the bacteria at issue had not been found in any of the patients who had shared the room with the applicant \u2019s daughter , or in any of the hospital staff who assisted at the delivery , nor on the hospital LOC . The inspectors identified a number of shortcomings at the hospital , such as overcrowding of the maternity ward , but concluded that none of these shortcomings could have led to the applicant \u2019s daughter being infected with the bacteria .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that an expert in hospital infections prepare a report for the purposes of the investigation . The report , which took into account the medical notes of the applicant \u2019s daughter , the results of the control carried out by ORG and the records of witnesses\u2019 interviews , was submitted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The expert found that the death had almost certainly resulted from sepsis and the related Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) caused by a streptococcus A. That bacterium , which had been identified in the body of the applicant \u2019s daughter on DATE , created very dangerous toxins which led to sepsis carrying a particular risk of fatality . The infection most likely originated from the perineum and the bacteria had already been present there before the delivery . The probability that the bacteria was transmitted from the hospital environment had been lower that PERCENT . All factors pointed to the probability that the applicant \u2019s daughter had been infected prior to her admission to the hospital . In particular , no other patients had been infected and the bacteria had not been present in the hospital environment . The expert excluded the possibility that the infection had resulted from medical negligence of the hospital staff .", "CARDINAL . As regards the medical treatment , the expert established that the actions of the doctors had been adequate with respect to the condition of the patient and compatible with medical science . They could be reproached for their lack of reaction during the first TIME ; however the sepsis had developed in a particular manner , namely without any accompanying fever . There were no other symptoms suggesting a developing infection and the applicant \u2019s daughter had complained about pain in the perineum , which was typical following a delivery . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s daughter took \u2013 without consulting the doctors \u2013 excessive doses of paracetamol which could have disguised the infection and caused paracetamol toxicity . Following the diagnosis of infection , the medical treatment administered was comprehensive and adequate and the hospital staff had acted with the requisite diligence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the course of the investigation the prosecutor also heard members of the medical personnel , fellow patients and friends who had visited the applicant \u2019s daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Warsaw - Praga P\u00f3\u0142noc District Prosecutor discontinued the investigation , finding that the offence of unintentional homicide had not been committed . Having regard to all the evidence and , in particular , the expert report , the prosecutor found that the death of the applicant \u2019s daughter had not resulted from medical negligence . The hospital staff had administered adequate and appropriate treatment for her condition and had not , in any degree , contributed to her death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed . She pointed out that CARDINAL important witnesses , namely the head of the obstetrics department and the doctor who had supervised the applicant \u2019s daughter , had not been heard . The prosecutor failed to establish whether other women had been infected with the same bacteria in the hospital despite the fact that the applicant had provided him with details of a woman who had been so infected . The applicant \u2019s lawyer also contested the findings of the expert . In particular , she averred that the response of the medical personnel to the deteriorating condition of the applicant \u2019s daughter within TIME had been inadequate and limited to administering pain killers . Furthermore , the expert had not addressed the fact that not all of the doctors , midwives and nurses working at the obstetrics department had been tested for the bacteria . The expert had wrongly assessed the evidence and had erred in concluding that there had been no medical error on the part of the hospital staff . Consequently , the prosecutor \u2019s decision that the death of the applicant \u2019s daughter had not resulted from the actions of the medical personnel had been erroneous and needed to be revisited . The applicant filed his own appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG upheld ORG decision of DATE . It held that the prosecutor had obtained sufficient and relevant evidence and had assessed it correctly . Similarly , there were no grounds to contest the prosecutor \u2019s factual findings or his legal assessment of the case .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the appeals had not put forward any arguments which could have resulted in the quashing of the decision . More specifically , it held that the allegations of the ORG \u2019s decision was based on the ample evidence obtained from the hospital staff ( doctors and nurses ) and the fellow patients , and , in particular , on the results of the autopsy and the expert report . The expert concluded , with the probability nearing on certainty , that the death had resulted from sepsis and the related MODS caused by a streptococcus A bacteria . The infection had not originated from the hospital environment and had not been caused by medical negligence . As regards the treatment administered to the applicant \u2019s daughter both during and following her labour , the expert considered it adequate and appropriate . The court , despite the applicant \u2019s misgivings , found no grounds to contest the reliability of the expert report . Furthermore , it considered that the alleged prosecutor \u2019s failures to obtain additional evidence proposed by the applicant would not in any event change the conclusion of the investigation .", "CARDINAL .
