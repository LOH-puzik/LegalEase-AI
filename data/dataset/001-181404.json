NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .

NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the car registered in the applicant \u2019s name was recorded by a radar speed detector as travelling at a speed of CARDINAL k.p.h . on the ORG , thus exceeding the speed limit of CARDINAL k.p.h .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bezirkshauptmannschaft ) issued a provisional penal order ( Strafverf\u00fcgung ) and fined the applicant CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) with a DATE suspended sentence for speeding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an ( unreasoned ) objection against this decision , whereupon ordinary administrative proceedings were opened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection and issued a penal order ( PERSON ) convicting the applicant of speeding and fining her EUR CARDINAL and EUR CARDINAL in procedural costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat , hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , submitting that the authority had not been in possession of any evidence indicating that she had been driving her car at the relevant time . Relying on LAW , the applicant further complained that she had been convicted solely because she had made use of her right to remain silent and the privilege not to incriminate herself in administrative criminal proceedings . She did not dispute the speeding offence itself . Furthermore she did not request a hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked the applicant , with reference to her general obligation as an accused to cooperate in administrative criminal proceedings , to submit concrete details regarding the driver of the car at the relevant time or to submit any other evidence to prove that she had not been driving the car . On DATE the applicant submitted a statement in which , referring to the case NORP v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , she maintained that she had not been in GPE at the relevant time and that there were several other persons who could have been driving the car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG held an oral hearing of its own motion . Even though the applicant had been summoned properly , she did not attend the hearing . However , she was represented by her lawyer Mr. PERSON , who substituted his mandate to ORG , a law firm practising in GPE . The lawyer who was appointed to attend the hearing merely pointed to the written submissions of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . According to the minutes of the hearing , no apology was made for the applicant \u2019s absence , nor was further evidence presented and , in particular , the applicant \u2019s representative did not request postponement of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , upheld the penal order and imposed a further ORG CARDINAL in procedural costs . In its reasoning , the ORG pinpointed the accused \u2019s general duty to cooperate in administrative criminal proceedings , indicating at the same time that the applicant had not contested the speeding but merely denied that she had been driving the car herself . However , she had not submitted any concrete information with regard to the identity of the real driver . In particular the ORG reasoned as follows :", "\u201c As the relevant fact , namely that the speed limit had been exceeded , remained undisputed during the proceedings , this can be taken as an established fact . The accused alleges that she was not driving at the time the offence was committed , however she failed to comply with the duty to cooperate in these proceedings . In accordance with NORP law and the unanimous jurisprudence of ORG , the accused has the duty to cooperate in the establishment of the facts . In case of traffic - related offences this encompasses the duty of the registered car keeper to be able to provide information on which persons had use of the car at a specific time . As an ultimate consequence of this jurisprudence , the inference may be drawn that the registered car keeper herself was driving the car , as long as she refuses to provide information on the fact of who had been driving the car at a certain time . In the present case the accused did not comply with her duty as she had answered the ORG \u2019s request of DATE by merely stating that she had not been in GPE on DATE . As various family members could have been the driver , she could not define the real driver . Since she had simply denied having been the driver in both instances without submitting any concrete evidence , the authorities were , in the absence of any other evidence , allowed to assume that the accused had committed the offence herself . ( ... )", "ORG found a violation of LAW and LAW in the case of NORP as it was not permissible to draw an inference solely from the applicant \u2019s refusal to disclose the identity of the driver . Where the authority wished to draw such an inference , an oral hearing for the purpose of obtaining a direct impression of his credibility had to be conducted .", "In the present case , the applicant had not been ordered to disclose the full name and address of the person who had been driving her car . Nevertheless the ORG ordered her on DATE , indicating her duty to cooperate in the proceedings , to provide the authority with information regarding the driver of the car at the relevant time or to submit any evidence showing that she had not committed the offence . ( ... )", "The applicant had solely denied in a very general way that she had been driving the car , without submitting any evidence . As it can be taken as an established fact that the registered keeper of a car has the most intensive relationship to the car and should therefore know who was driving the car at a relevant time , the authorities were allowed to assume \u2013 in the absence of any other evidence \u2013 that the applicant herself had committed the offence . ( ... ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ) claiming that the ORG had not been in possession of any evidence indicating that she herself had been driving her car and had thus wrongly established a prima facie case against her . Therefore , the ORG had not only shifted the burden of proof onto her , but had also violated her right to remain silent . Moreover , as the applicant had not been able to attend the hearing due to a sudden illness for which she had been excused by her representative , the ORG should have scheduled another hearing of its own motion in order to obtain a direct impression of her credibility . Thus , not only had the burden of proof been shifted onto her , but her right to remain silent had also been violated .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . In its reasoning the ORG held that the decision was sufficiently reasoned and clear , especially since the applicant had failed to submit any credible evidence in her defence , even though she had had various opportunities to do so in the course of the proceedings . Moreover , the ORG had DATE contrary to PERSON ( cited above ) \u2013 held an oral hearing and had , according to the minutes of the hearing , not been informed about the applicant \u2019s illness , and the legal representative had not requested postponement of the hearing . Therefore ORG found that the ORG could not be blamed for not having postponed the hearing of its own motion and for assuming that the applicant had been driving the car herself . Thus , no violation of LAW was found . Subsequently the case was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint , since the amount of the fine did not exceed the legal value threshold of ORG CARDINAL and no important legal issue was at stake .
