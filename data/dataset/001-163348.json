On TIME CARDINAL DATE , while on a work voyage to GPE on the private ship PERSON , he was found dead in his cabin . He was lying on his back in bed , with the blanket drawn up to his chest , his right hand bent and pressing his chest . On DATE , the ship \u2019s captain assembled a commission to investigate the death . Having inspected GPE \u2019s cabin , the captain sent a report about the death to his superiors in ORG , the GPE shipping company .", "CARDINAL . The following day , CARDINAL DATE , a NORP doctor , ORG , gave acute heart attack ( \u016bmus miokardo infarktas ) as V.B. \u2019s cause of death . The NORP authorities also issued an authorisation to preserve GPE \u2019s body ( \u017emogaus palaik\u0173 konservavimo aktas ) . The authorisation noted that there were no indications against preserving the body , and therefore ORG remains were set to be embalmed with the help of chemicals ( phenol , formalin and others ) at TIME DATE . Afterwards , the body of the applicant \u2019s husband \u2019s was put in a zinc coffin and shipped to GPE , which it reached on DATE .", "On DATE the ship \u2019s captain and chief engineer were questioned by the NORP police authorities . The police also inspected the cabin where GPE had been found dead . Considering that no crime had taken place and that PERSON had died of a heart attack , the NORP police sent the investigation material to a local court .", "CARDINAL . The death certificate issued by the NORP authorities on CARDINAL DATE gave heart attack as LOC \u2019s cause of death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a NORP prosecutor opened a criminal investigation on the basis of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , after receiving notification of GPE \u2019s death from GPE . The prosecutor ordered ORG to conduct the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE provided the investigators with the following documents : the captain \u2019s service report ; an extract from the ship \u2019s logbook of DATE ; a report on the circumstances of GPE \u2019s death , signed by the captain and CARDINAL assistant captains ; CARDINAL reports ( CARDINAL by the captain and CARDINAL by the chief engineer ) to the NORP authorities ; statements by CARDINAL members of the crew ; the death certificate issued on DATE in GPE ; documents about the work instructions given to GPE ; his qualifications and photographs from his cabin .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the prosecutor and ORG ( ORG darbo inspekcija , a ORG body responsible for safety at work , hereinafter DATE \u201c the ORG \u201d ) examine her husband \u2019s body and investigate the cause of his death and his working conditions on the ship . She submitted that conditions on the PERSON were dangerous , and could have led to her husband \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the meantime , on DATE the applicant was granted victim status in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor refused to continue the criminal investigation , finding that there had been no signs of a crime or anything to disprove a finding that the victim had died because of a heart illness . In particular , the forensic report from GPE had shown no sign of poisonous chemicals in GPE \u2019s body fluids ; there had also been no traces of alcohol , and GPE \u2019s body had been embalmed because there had been no indications against such a procedure . Preservation of the body by chemical means irreparably altered the chemical composition of the blood , and therefore there had been no reason to carry out a further examination of the body . The prosecutor noted that in DATE PERSON had passed medical check , which showed that he had been fit to serve at sea . The PERSON \u2019s logbook had had no entry about PERSON ever complaining about his health .", "CARDINAL . After a complaint by the applicant , that decision , however , was quashed by ORG on DATE . The court held that the prosecutor had failed properly to investigate the applicant \u2019s submission that her husband had died because of dangerous conditions on the PERSON . The pre - trial investigation resumed .", "CARDINAL . DATE , FAC questioned as witnesses the sailors who had worked on the PERSON with GPE The sailors testified that PERSON , who was a refrigerator mechanic , worked in the machinery section of the ship , where the refrigerators were placed . There had been frequent fires in the machinery section of the ship during the voyage by the PERSON . When fires broke out , there was a strong smell of fumes . When there was a fire in the machinery section , the air conditioning in the ship \u2019s cabins did not work , and the temperature would rise as high as CARDINAL\u02daC. In the run up to DATE , the ship had been preparing to have goods loaded . For that reason , PERSON had worked for DATE prior to his death in the machinery section preparing refrigerators for the shipment . The applicant \u2019s husband was seen working in the machinery section both with and without a gas mask . In DATE before his death , PERSON had worked intensively and rested little . No repairs in the machinery section had been carried out until PERSON \u2019s death . After the death , the ship had been repaired in a NORP port , after which there had been no smell of gas in the machinery section . The witnesses also stated that PERSON had not complained about his health or stated that he had any heart problems .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was also questioned . Citing conversations with her late husband , the applicant said that in reality the conditions of work on the PERSON had been very difficult as the ship had been in a bad technical state and its mechanics had had to deal permanently with fires and leaks of gas , without any adequate protection .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s report of DATE , no . SD-CARDINAL , stated that the ORG had examined the possible cause of PERSON \u2019s death . The ORG held that the reasons for PERSON \u2019s death were not connected to his work . The ORG discontinued its investigation , on the grounds that GPE \u2019s death certificate had indicated that he had died of a heart attack , and that the authorisation to preserve his body had read that there had been no indication against such an action . When examining the applicant \u2019s complaint , the ORG had obtained internal correspondence between ORG and the PERSON , which showed that the working conditions on the ship had been hard \u2013 the ship \u2019s machinery , including the main engine , would often break down , and the engine emitted combustion gases into the ship ; there had also been frequent fires . However , according to the ORG , GPE \u2019s duties did not include repairs to the main engine or extinguishing fires , and he had not done such jobs . The ORG did not have any other proof that the working conditions on the PERSON had been harmful . The ORG also observed that they had not performed any readings on the ship , because they had not been able to check it when it was at sea .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON stated that it had been informed about a breakdown of the main engine , which could have led to a worsening of the working conditions on the PERSON . Repairs had taken place in DATE , and the problems had finally been solved in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the pre - trial investigation was discontinued by the prosecutor for a second time . The prosecutor held that no crime had taken place and that the applicant \u2019s husband had died of a heart attack , when \u2018 the ship was on a voyage in LOC near the NORP port of Imbituba\u2019 . The prosecutor also relied on the testimony given by an expert , V.A. during the hearing in DATE before ORG ( see paragraph DATE below ) . On the basis of GPE \u2019s medical record of DATE that expert had testified that PERSON had a partial blockage of the nerve in the heart which makes the heart contract . If the nerve did not work properly , heart arrhythmia could occur , which could in turn cause a heart attack . The position of GPE \u2019s body was typical of someone who had died of a heart attack . According to that expert , fire could cause a heart attack if a person had been in a smoky environment or a closed space , and there had been a lack of oxygen . However , a heart attack would happen at a slower pace than a person would die of suffocation . Death from a heart attack caused by a fire could not take DATE to happen .", "The prosecutor noted that , according to the NORP authorities who had considered that the cause of death was a heart attack , no poisons or other toxic materials had been found in the applicant \u2019s body fluids . The prosecutor also pointed out that GPE \u2019s health had been checked on DATE , and it had been concluded that he had been \u201c fit to work in the fleet \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following a request by the applicant , on DATE she was allowed access to the entire criminal case file , which by then comprised CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the prosecutor \u2019s decision to discontinue the criminal investigation . She argued that there had been many flaws in the investigation and that the conclusions as to her husband \u2019s death had been unclear . In particular , the applicant submitted that the ORG \u2019s decision not to treat the death as an accident at work had been hasty . The applicant was also dissatisfied that the ORG had not inspected the PERSON itself , nor had it questioned the crew members , who could have confirmed the unsafe working conditions on board . There had also been no autopsy , nor any test for toxins in her husband \u2019s skin or hair . The body had been embalmed too quickly , without such examinations . The applicant further submitted that NORP diplomats had not been present when the body had been embalmed . The applicant also pointed out that her husband had been healthy : he had been examined by a ORG commission in DATE and that that conclusion was valid for DATE ; moreover , her husband had not complained about any heart issue . The applicant also maintained that even local journalists in the town in GPE where GPE \u2019s death had been given as a heart attack had not been able to find contact data for doctor ORG , thus raising doubts about his credentials .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court observed that on DATE the applicant had asked the prosecutor to order an expert examination to establish whether the constant breathing of combustion gases could cause a heart attack , and to ask the NORP authorities to provide the report on her husband \u2019s autopsy and the results of blood tests , as those documents had not been present among those brought back with PERSON \u2019s body . She had also asked for documents confirming whether it had been verified that PERSON could have died of poisoning by combustion gases ; for the questioning of doctor PERSON , who had signed the conclusion of the ORG commission ( of DATE ) as to GPE \u2019s health ; and for other investigative actions . Given that the applicant had had the status of a victim , the prosecutor had been under an obligation to take a decision on those requests . However , he had ignored the applicant \u2019s requests for DATE , until he had taken the decision to discontinue the criminal investigation , which had been in breach of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision . It emphasised that what was at issue was a criminal investigation into charges of a violation of requirements to protect health and safety at work . Having examined the pre - trial investigation material , the regional court concluded that the kind of breaches alleged by the applicant had not been properly examined during the criminal investigation . Furthermore , as could be seen from the ORG \u2019s report of DATE , the inquiry performed by that body had not been sufficiently comprehensive either ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Accordingly , it could not be stated that the pre - trial investigation into the circumstances of GPE \u2019s death had been performed thoroughly . In the opinion of ORG , it was therefore vital to continue the pre - trial investigation and to eliminate the doubts raised by the applicant as to the reliability of the results of the medical examination of PERSON \u2019s body , and to establish whether PERSON had indeed worked in harmful conditions during the voyage , including whether regulations on hours of work had been observed . Should breaches of working conditions be established , it was also necessary to order a forensic expert to perform an objective investigation and to establish whether such breaches had had any impact on GPE \u2019s death . Without a comprehensive examination of those aspects , it had not been reasonable or lawful to discontinue the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor ordered ORG to establish the whereabouts of the PERSON and whether it was possible to inspect the ship ; to question everyone who worked on it , including about working conditions , as noted in the applicant \u2019s complaint ; to obtain documents from GPE related to safety at work ; and to ask the ORG whether they had examined the actual working conditions on the ship . The prosecutor also asked ORG to prepare a request to the NORP authorities for legal assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked GPE for documents about the technical state of the ship on DATE , information about the ship \u2019s whereabouts , and whether it was possible to inspect it .", "On DATE the shipping company ORG replied that the ship usually worked in the region of south west LOC ; currently it was near the coast of GPE . The ship had passed its yearly check by authorised certification company ORG on CARDINAL DATE in FAC port in GPE , and the inspector of that company had had no remarks as to the technical state of the ship \u2019s machinery . That report was given to investigators .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor again asked ORG to \u201c take active measures \u201d to question everyone who had been working on the ship at the relevant time . It was also necessary to obtain GPE \u2019s medical records and question the doctor who on DATE had diagnosed PERSON with a heart problem , and to obtain documents from GPE related to repairs in the machinery section of the ship , to fires on board and to issues of safety at work .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the NORP inquiry of CARDINAL DATE , on DATE the ORG wrote that its inspectors had not examined the working conditions on the PERSON because , as far as they knew , the ship had not returned to NORP ports after PERSON \u2019s death . It had not been technically possible to examine the ship in the ports of other countries . The ORG noted that the circumstances of GPE \u2019s death had been examined on the basis of the documents provided by ORG and on the experts\u2019 conclusions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the prosecutor , questioning why PERSON had not requested that the NORP authorities perform a test for toxic substances in the body as such an examination could have been performed within DATE . She stated that she had not been asked whether any other reports by experts should have been done , yet GPE \u2019s body had been taken straight away to a funeral parlour on DATE and embalmed at TIME DATE . The applicant emphasised that the ship at that time had been put up for sale . She asked that the ship \u2019s documents up to the time of the sale be examined to establish whether there were any toxic gases in the machinery room or other factors that made for unsafe working conditions . She mentioned the records in the logs of the machinery room ; the service reports to GPE by the captain and chief mechanic ; the description of repairs to the main engine ; and the work which her husband performed on the ship . Lastly , the applicant asked the prosecutor to inform her whether and when ORG had been ordered to keep copies of its communications with the ship during its voyage .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE investigators questioned crew from the PERSON , some of them repeatedly .", "CARDINAL . In addition , on DATE doctor PERSON stated that from DATE he had worked as chief doctor at the ORG health - care centre ( GPE sveikatos prie\u017ei\u016bros centras ) in PERSON . On DATE PERSON had passed a medical board exam as being fit to serve at sea . The conclusion of the medical board examination had been signed by doctor PERSON himself , and it meant that the applicant \u2019s husband was healthy enough to work at sea . The partial blockage of the nerve on the right side of his heart , as seen in the cardiogram , had no effect on PERSON \u2019s health , nor on his ability to work at sea . In the doctor \u2019s opinion , inhalation of combustion gases could lead to poisoning , but not to an acute heart attack .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another witness , PERSON , stated that he had been a chief mechanic on the PERSON in DATE , but had later refused to work on the ship because of poor working conditions . Failures of the main engine meant that fires on the ship had been frequent , happening DATE . All the fires and repairs had been registered in the machinery logbook . ORG had been notified of those facts . The crew had worked in the machinery room wearing respirator masks , but no gas masks had been provided . PERSON would spend TIME ( per day ) in the machinery room .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transferred the criminal file to the applicant so that she could acquaint herself with it . By then , the file comprised CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to a request made the same day by the prosecutor , ORG ( NORP saugios laivybos administracija ) noted that the PERSON had been taken off the register of NORP ships , because a foreign company , ORG ( Nevis ) , had bought the ship .", "CARDINAL . In reply to a question from FAC of DATE , ORG confirmed that it had sold the PERSON to a third party . It noted that the records from the ship \u2019s machinery room , which the investigators had been seeking , had been destroyed before the ship had been transferred to the new buyers , and thus could not be provided .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigators again provided the case file to the applicant . It by then comprised CARDINAL volumes and CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG sent documents to ORG prosecutors concerning a request for legal assistance to be sent to the NORP authorities . The police stated that in order to establish whether ORG death had been caused by dangerous conditions on the PERSON , it was important to establish whether an autopsy of PERSON had been performed and his blood tested ( and , if so , to provide the results of the autopsy and the tests ) , and whether the NORP authorities had inspected the PERSON after the death to examine the working conditions on board .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC submitted a fresh request to the ORG prosecutors for legal assistance from the NORP authorities , this time adding a request that doctor ORG be questioned . The prosecutor then returned the documents , because they had not met the right requirements . On DATE ORG sent a request for legal assistance to the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a response to the request for legal assistance was received from the NORP authorities . However , according to the NORP investigators , the documents contained only internal correspondence between the NORP authorities about the fact that PERSON had died . As a result , there had been no new information relevant for the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the LOC police asked experts from ORG ( PERSON teismo medicinos tarnyba ) to answer the following questions : CARDINAL ) what is characteristic evidence that a person has died from an acute heart attack and is it possible to conclude that a person has died from a heart attack without an autopsy ; CARDINAL ) could a dangerous working environment in a non - ventilated ship machinery room ( where emission gases were present ) have had an impact on GPE \u2019s death , that is , could such conditions have caused an acute heart attack ; CARDINAL ) how long must a person work in a harmful working environment , where there is an elevated level of emission gases , before getting a heart attack .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the forensic experts PERSON and PERSON prepared a report stating that they had not been provided with any medical documents about PERSON \u2019s autopsy ( if one had ever been performed ) , any blood results or other medical records . Neither were they provided with documents , confirmed by special diagnostic methods , about the exact level of combustion gases on the ship . Therefore , they could rely only on the testimony of the crew who had worked on the ship with GPE", "CARDINAL . Proceeding on that basis , the experts stated that , in medical practice , death certificates without an autopsy were delivered only when there was documented medical data that the person had been ill with a long - term disease ( sirgo l\u0117tine liga ) , that the circumstances of death were clear , and that there was no evidence that the cause of death could have been due to physical injuries or other external factors .", "CARDINAL . For the experts , it was known from the criminal case file that GPE had been found dead in a cabin . Without examining the body , and in the absence of any data about GPE \u2019s state of health , or information about any physical injuries or external factors ( for example , acute gas poisoning ) , which could have caused his death , it was possible only to state ( galima tik teigti ) that the cause of GPE \u2019s death was that his heart had stopped for unknown reasons . In that case , it was impossible to either confirm or deny that an acute heart attack had been the cause of GPE \u2019s death . Accordingly , it was not possible to establish a possible link between PERSON \u2019s working in harmful conditions and his death .", "CARDINAL . The experts also stated that the main reason for an acute heart attack was a failure of arterial blood vessels . That happened when physical exhaustion or nervous tension caused the heart muscle suddenly to need a lot of oxygen . TIME , in an environment where there were elevated levels of emission gases , was not a risk factor for a heart attack .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor then discontinued the investigation on DATE , concluding that no crime had been committed \u2018 on the ship , which sailed under a NORP flag\u2019 . According to him , although the existence of harmful working conditions and leaks of gases in the engine room of the ship had been confirmed , they could not have caused the victim \u2019s heart failure .", "CARDINAL . That decision was upheld by a higher prosecutor , and then by ORG on DATE . The first instance court noted , inter alia , that the cause of PERSON \u2019s death had already been established by final decisions in administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to discontinue the criminal investigation , arguing that the report by the specialist , J. NORP , had not definitely confirmed that her husband had died of a heart attack , given that no autopsy had been carried out . She pointed to shortcomings in the investigation , such as the absence of blood test results and toxicology tests , and the lack of documents concerning safety at work on the ship . The applicant also pointed out that the ship \u2019s logbooks had not been obtained , and that the ship had not been inspected .", "CARDINAL . By a final ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . The court noted that the cause of death had already been established by the final and binding decision of CARDINAL DATE by ORG in the administrative case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In addition , the criminal court held that the investigation had been wide - ranging , that numerous witnesses and experts had been questioned and that the necessary forensic examinations had been carried out . As concerned the applicant \u2019s argument about the collection of additional evidence , it was considered as serving no purpose given the amount of time which had elapsed . The criminal court also noted that at certain stage the expert , V.A. , had been questioned by the first - instance court of criminal jurisdiction , and had testified that PERSON could have died from his heart condition .", "CARDINAL . In parallel to the ongoing criminal investigation , the applicant also started administrative court proceedings , asking that her husband \u2019s death be recognised as a work accident .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG acknowledged , on the basis of the ORG report of DATE , that work conditions on PERSON were bad , and the main engine would often break down , causing leaks of dangerous gases . For that reason many mechanics had left the ship . However , the administrative court also took into account the conclusion by a forensic expert V.A. about V.B. \u2019s earlier heart condition and that fire or smoke on the ship , even if they had been present , could not have caused PERSON \u2019s heart attack ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As a result , the applicant \u2019s claim before the administrative courts for her husband \u2019s death to be recognised as a work accident was dismissed .", "CARDINAL .
