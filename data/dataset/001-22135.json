THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , born in DATE and living in GPE . She is the sister of PERSON , who died in police custody on DATE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s brother , PERSON , was DATE when he died . He was a large man who weighed QUANTITY , with no previous history of heart problems .", "Shortly before TIME on DATE , the deceased was allegedly involved in a burglary in FAC , FAC . An intruder broke into a house , awoke the young couple who were its occupants and threatened them at knifepoint before leaving with cash point cards , money and a kitchen knife . The couple rang the police at TIME", "Police Constables PERSON and PERSON responded . They saw the deceased leaving FAC and entering LOC . Believing him to be the intruder , they apprehended him after a chase which ended in a children \u2019s play area . The deceased threatened officers with a kitchen knife , which fell from his hand when his wrist was struck twice with a police baton by PC PERSON . A second officer also struck him . In all , he was struck on the arms and back . Several police officers gave evidence that the deceased punched PC PERSON in the face . The time was TIME The deceased was tackled to the ground , arrested and placed in the prone position , i.e. on his front with his hands restrained behind his back , and handcuffed . The deceased was placed in a police van , prior to which he complained that he had difficulty breathing . He was again placed in the prone position while he was transported to the police station .", "Some of the officers later testified that the deceased was \u201c muttering \u201d incoherently in the van and wriggling , unable to sit of his own will . There was further evidence that on leaving the van , he was still \u201c shuffling \u201d and \u201c muttering \u201d incoherently . Some officers said that he was carried into the police station . The van arrived at the police station at TIME", "The arresting officer PC PERSON told the custody sergeant PERSON of the circumstances surrounding the arrest , and stated that the deceased had assaulted him . Meanwhile , the deceased was placed face - down in the prone position on the floor of the custody suite . He was removed to a cell at TIME and had to be carried . He was then stripped and searched with his handcuffs removed , and was placed in the prone position for part of the search . The custody record notes , inter alia :", "\u201c Subject complains of difficulty in breathing and is turned over on his back for searching . \u201d", "PC ORG stated in oral evidence during the Inquest :", "\u201c He [ the deceased ] then complained that he was finding it difficult to breathe on his front so the handcuffs were removed first and he was straight away turned onto his back . \u201d", "PC ORG said that this appeared to relieve his breathing problem . On examination , PC ORG was asked if he saw any mucus on the deceased \u2019s face , to which he replied , \u201c No \u201d . He did not mention that the prisoner had been placed in a \u201c cell relocation position \u201d .", "The evidence of PC PERSON was not the same :", "\u201c Present were PCs GPE , PERSON and ORG . They stripped him down to his underpants and left the cell one at a time , the last officer holding the prisoner \u2019s legs crossed and then springing off him and then closing the door . ( Cell relocation technique ) . I then slammed the cell door . The prisoner rolled over and groaned , and had what appeared to be nasal mucus over his face . \u201d", "After the search , the deceased was left on his own in the cell . ORG instructed PC PERSON to remain outside the cell and to keep a continuous watch on him . PC PERSON gave evidence that following this instruction he remained outside the cell door and kept watch through the wicket in the door .", "ORG sent for ORG to examine the deceased in case he had suffered any internal injury from a baton and also to examine the CARDINAL police officers who complained of injury from the arrest .", "After a short lapse of time , ORG came to the cell door . PC PERSON stated that he removed his gaze from the wicket to talk to him . When he looked back , the deceased was on his face and in difficulties .", "Officers re - entered the cell at TIME when the deceased was said to be having a fit . His heart was beating but he had stopped breathing . Artificial respiration was commenced and an ambulance was called which conveyed the deceased to ORG where he arrived at TIME He was pronounced dead at TIME", "The inquest into the death of the deceased took place DATE . It was presided over by the Coroner Sir PERSON , and a jury . Over CARDINAL witnesses gave evidence , including CARDINAL pathologists as to the cause of death . The pathologists were unable to agree as to the cause of death . PERSON ( instructed by the Coroner ) considered that the deceased had died of natural causes , due to hypertensive heart disease . However , the applicant claims that the jury rejected this and preferred the evidence of Professor PERSON and Dr N. GPE . The former considered that the most likely cause of death was \u201c positional asphyxia \u201d , and the latter considered that the cause of death was the deceased \u2019s restraint in the prone position , coupled with the stress occasioned by the whole incident .", "At the conclusion of the evidence , the Coroner left CARDINAL verdicts to the jury , namely accident , open verdict , death by natural causes and unlawful killing . The applicant claims that the Coroner misdirected the jury on the meaning of unlawful killing in LANGUAGE law . The jury \u2019s verdict , by a majority of CARDINAL to CARDINAL , was recorded in the following terms :", "\u201c Cause of death", "CARDINAL . NORP ( a ) left ventricular failure", "( b ) stress and exhaustive and positional asphyxia", "Verdict", "Accidental death", "Details of how Accident Happened", "CARDINAL a.m. and TIME in a police cell in FAC following a chase and a series of restraints in the prone position face down as used in current police methods . \u201d", "After the verdict was delivered , the Coroner issued a number of recommendations in respect of police methods of restraint in relation to positional asphyxia . This included :", "\u201c Repeated periods of restraint in the face down position with the arms handcuffed behind the back can be dangerous and every officer should be given guidelines on essential observations to be made of the restrained person , with special emphasis on the possibility of positional asphyxia ; that is taking the pulse rate , listening to the breathing and so forth ... \u201d", "The Director of ORG assured the ORG that these recommendations would be put in progress as policy matters within the ORG .", "The applicant received legal aid to judicially review the decision of the Coroner on the basis of alleged misdirections .", "On DATE Laws J dismissed the application for judicial review . He found that there had been a misdirection in the Coroner \u2019s summing up on the legal definition of \u201c unlawful killing \u201d in that he had had interwoven his explanation on the different aspects of manslaughter concerning unlawful acts and gross negligence in such a way that it may not have been clear to the jury that he was referring to CARDINAL different types of unlawful killing . Nonetheless , he found that on the evidence before them , and in the light of their finding on the cause of death , even if the jury had been properly directed they would have reached the same verdict . He noted that no complaint had been made about the deceased \u2019s arrest . As regarded alleged neglect by the police officers , he recalled the Coroner \u2019s finding that there was no evidence that the police officers should have recognised that the deceased \u2019s condition was due to anything other than stress and exhaustion . Each officer had been individually asked whether he thought that PERSON should have been taken to hospital and each had replied \u2018 no\u2019 . Further , there had been no evidence that had an attempt been made earlier to take him to hospital that this would have had any effect in avoiding his death . The judge agreed with the Coroner :", "\u201c I think it is clear that there was no evidence in the case to the effect that any officer could have foreseen the deceased \u2019s sudden and catastrophic collapse owing to a left ventricular failure ( or at all ) . The Registrar at ORG , PERSON gave evidence . The Coroner said this ...", "\u2018 I asked her this question and this is vital : \u2018 In retrospect , if you were there at the time would you have done anything different than those officers at that point of time?\u2019 and the answer was \u2018 no\u2019 and I think it is to their credit that everything they did when they found the heart had stopped and the breathing had stopped was right , and they did it quickly and it was done efficiently . She , as a doctor , almost a specialist herself , had said that had she been there she could not have done anything differently . She agreed with everything that was done.\u2019", "In my judgment this was never a case in which the exceptional course of leaving neglect as a free - standing verdict should have been taken . One has to postulate circumstances in which a reasonable jury were not satisfied that unlawful killing ( on any basis but in particular on the footing of gross negligence ) was made out , yet could have been satisfied that there was a \u2018 gross failure\u2019 to look after the deceased in the condition he was in . I can not see that on the facts of the case there was any perceptible space for such a scenario ... \u201d", "In the context of the allegations of gross negligence , the judge referred to the undisputed fact that arrangements had been made by the police for ORG to see the deceased .", "\u201c There was also the very important evidence that PC PERSON was instructed to keep continuous watch over the deceased in the cell , looking through a wicket in the door . [ Counsel for the family ] seeks to raise a question whether this instruction was properly carried out . The custody record shows that when the officers re - entered the cell and found the deceased having a fit he was lying on his front . He had previously ... been turned or turned himself onto his back . The Coroner records PC PERSON ( p. CARDINAL CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) as saying he had only momentarily turned his gaze away from the wicket when PERSON arrived outside the cell ; and ( CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) \u2018 when they looked back he was on his face\u2019 . [ Counsel for the family ] points to the expert evidence of Professor PERSON and PERSON to the effect that if a prisoner is taken out of the prone position ( as by being put on his back ) he recovers the ability to breathe ; and so [ counsel ] submits ... \u2018 it is therefore difficult to understand why he further deteriorated and dies , if he was as PERSON alleged on his side or back while he was continuously watched\u2019 .", "I am afraid I regard that this argument is entirely speculative . When the officers re - entered the cell , TIME after PERSON arrived and spoke with PERSON , the deceased was as I have said having a fit ; and most unhappily must have been in a critical and terminal condition as the events which immediately followed demonstrate . He was not in control of his movements . He may have turned voluntarily on his front . There is nothing here to call into question the clear evidence that PC PERSON fulfilled his instructions to watch over him . \u201d", "The applicant appealed this decision . It was dismissed on DATE by ORG composed of Lord Justices PERSON , ORG and PERSON . Lord Justice PERSON considered that there had been only borderline justification for leaving the verdict of unlawful killing to the jury . While there had been misdirections of law on \u201c unlawful killing \u201d , he refused to quash the verdict and order a fresh inquest as", "\u2013 the verdict would not have been affected ;", "\u2013 any fresh inquest after this passage of time would inevitably be less satisfactory and most unlikely to result in any different verdict ; and", "\u2013 the inquest had performed in an exemplary manner the investigation of the facts and little more could be achieved by subjecting all concerned to the considerable expense and stress of a further inquest .", "Lord Justice PERSON commented that it was important to note that it was not suggested that the way the deceased was treated at the time of his arrest was improper .", "Leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE , of which the applicant was informed on DATE .", "The matter was referred by ORG to ORG ( ORG ) , an independent body established by LAW to oversee complaints by members of the public against police officers . It informed the family that it had investigated CARDINAL disciplinary aspects of the case : whether any police officer had abused his authority by using unnecessary violence towards PERSON in effecting his arrest and detention , and whether any police officer had neglected his duty by failing to take proper care of the applicant \u2019s brother whilst in custody .", "The ORG found on DATE that there were no grounds for criticism of the actions of any police officer on these issues .", "Prior to the deceased \u2019s death , there existed significant literature on the dangers of police methods of restraint and that the very scenario which was the context of the deceased \u2019s death had been the subject of the following expert warning : a suspect , particularly one who is large , who has had his breathing compromised ( due to running away from police officers and/or struggling in the course of his apprehension ) who is then handcuffed to the rear , and placed on his front in the prone position , may be in danger .", "ORG were aware of the dangers of positional asphyxia and officers had received training on this . The evidence from PC PERSON and ORG during the Inquest was that they had apparently had such training DATE before the incident . However , this training was limited and the Coroner expressed himself to be \u201c appalled \u201d that the topic had been dealt with in TIME .", "Following the Coroner \u2019s recommendations , an Operational Notice was issued on DATE to all divisions in respect of positional asphyxia , dealing with risk factors , signs and symptoms , and ways of reducing risks . This was to be incorporated into a new DATE training course for ORG with effect from DATE .", "Inquests are governed by LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) and Coroners Rules DATE ( \u201c the Rules \u201d ) . Under s.CARDINAL of the LAW , an inquest must be held if a person has died \u201c a violent or an unnatural death \u201d . It is the function of an inquest , as defined by the s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the LAW and r.

Prior to DATE , there was no right to disclosure of documents , but there is now a scheme for limited disclosure , although not commensurate with that available for other types of proceedings .", "It has been consistently emphasised in case - law that an inquest is an inquisitorial fact - finding exercise , and not a method of apportioning guilt . For example , ORG declared in ex parte PERSON :", "\u201c It is not the function of a coroner or his jury to determine , or appear to determine , any question of criminal or civil liability , to apportion guilt or attribute blame . This principle is expressed in Rule CARDINAL of the DATE Rules . \u201d [ DATE QB CARDINAL ]", "There is no right of appeal in relation to an inquest and ORG role is limited to review , which may be by way of judicial review , or statutory as contained in sections PERSON ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW .
