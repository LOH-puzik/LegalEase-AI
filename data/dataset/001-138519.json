He is currently serving a sentence in the LOC T - Type Prison .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation , namely the ORG .", "On DATE the applicant was placed in detention pending trial .", "On DATE he was convicted of attempting to undermine the constitutional order under LAW of the former LAW . On DATE ORG upheld his conviction .", "At the time of the events giving rise to this application , the applicant was being held in detention at ORG , first pending his trial , subsequently as a convict .", "The applicant suffers from diabetes mellitus type-CARDINAL ( formerly called noninsulin dependent diabetes ) .", "On an unspecified date in DATE , the prison doctor at the Diyarbak\u0131r High - Security Prison referred the applicant to a hospital for what appeared to be routine medical controls in relation to his diabetes . The prison authorities\u2019 initial attempt to escort him to the hospital as instructed was turned down by the applicant on the ground that the relevant tests needed to be done on an empty stomach . He therefore asked the authorities to delay his transfer to the hospital until TIME .", "On DATE , when the applicant had still not been taken to the hospital despite what he alleged to be a DATE lapse since the referral by the prison doctor , he submitted a complaint to ORG ( infaz hakimli\u011fi ) against the prison authorities , whom he accused of neglecting his health and treatment .", "On DATE he was taken to ORG for his medical consultation . The applicant has not submitted a copy of the examination report .", "After reviewing the applicant \u2019s medical file , on DATE the Enforcement Judge confirmed that the applicant had been undergoing regular treatment for his type-CARDINAL diabetes ; that he had been prescribed antidiabetic medication and been provided with a glucose measurement kit to monitor regularly his glucose levels while in the prison ; and that he had been referred to the hospital at the discretion of the prison doctor despite the absence of a request from the specialist at the hospital for such control . He added that in any event , the applicant had been taken to the hospital on CARDINAL and DATE for his controls and concluded that there had been no negligence in the provision of medical treatment to the applicant . He also ordered that a copy of the applicant \u2019s complaint be sent to ORG for an assessment on whether any criminal liability arose on the facts .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection to the decision of the Enforcement Judge and similarly referred the matter to ORG .", "On DATE ORG decided not to bring a prosecution against the relevant prison authorities , on the grounds of lack of evidence indicating neglect . On DATE PERSON upheld the public prosecutor \u2019s decision .", "According to the documents in the case - file , the applicant also suffered from a neuropathic condition , manifesting itself as intermittent numbness in his right leg , for which he was prescribed medication by a neurologist on DATE . It is not clear from the information available whether this condition was related to his type-CARDINAL diabetes .", "On DATE the applicant was taken to ORG for a neurological consultation . Upon reviewing the GPE scan and PERSON of his head , the neurologist who examined the applicant recommended that he also see a neurosurgeon . There is no copy of the neurologist \u2019s examination report in the case - file . While at the hospital , the applicant also consulted a specialist in internal medicine , who told him to continue with his medication and diet and requested to see him again in DATE . He did not , however , see a neurosurgeon at the hospital on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with the ORG Judge against the prison authorities whom he accused of delaying his neurosurgical examination despite his earlier referral by the neurologist .", "On DATE the applicant was examined at ORG by a neurosurgeon , who recommended the placement of fibreboard under his mattress . It appears from the report in the case - file that the neurosurgeon did not make a new diagnosis or recommend a different course of treatment .", "On DATE the Diyarbak\u0131r Enforcement Judge held that since the applicant had already been examined by a neurosurgeon on DATE , there was no need to take a further decision on his claim .

No further information has been provided to the ORG as to any decisions taken by the public prosecutor in this regard .", "According to the medical reports in the file dated DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , the applicant was deemed capable of measuring and monitoring his own blood glucose levels with his glucose measurement kit .

The categorisation of his diabetes as type-CARDINAL , however , remained unchanged .", "In the meantime , on DATE the applicant filed another complaint with ORG . He argued that despite his documented medical condition , the food that he was given in the prison did not comply with the recommended diabetic diet . He therefore requested authorisation to purchase a stove to cook his own food or , alternatively , demanded the provision of separate diet food to meet his specific needs .", "On DATE , the prison management submitted a letter to ORG , explaining that in view of the limited budget , they did not have the means to offer individualised dietary programmes to prisoners . However , the meal programme at the prison was being prepared in consultation with the prison doctor , taking also into account the needs of the inmates with special dietary requirements ( who were CARDINAL out of a total of CARDINAL ) . In cases where a particular meal was not appropriate for their consumption , suitable alternatives were being provided for the persons concerned ; the prison canteen was also available to all inmates , who could moreover store food in the refrigerators provided in their cells . They submitted a sample DATE diet menu in support of their arguments .", "Having regard to the information provided by the prison management , the applicant \u2019s medical reports and the dietary plan prepared by ORG for patients with diabetes , the ORG Judge decided on DATE to dismiss the applicant \u2019s request for an individualised meal plan . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection to the Enforcement Judge \u2019s decision .", "While serving his prison sentence the applicant enrolled in ORG at ORG ( distance learning courses ) .", "On an unspecified date , the applicant requested authorisation from the prison management to obtain , with his own means , an \u201c MPCARDINAL player \u201d , a portable media player , to study LANGUAGE through listening to recorded language courses , which he claimed was essential for his international relations courses .", "On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) refused the applicant \u2019s request , on the grounds that ORG players were not listed amongst the goods and devices authorised in prisons under the relevant regulation . The applicant was informed that he could object to this decision before the Enforcement Judge , which he did .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request on the same grounds as ORG and on DATE ORG upheld this decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
