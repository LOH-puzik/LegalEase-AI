In some of the cases the ORG was acting on complaints and in others ex proprio motu , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON . The applicant was informed of the possibility of contraventions on its part and was invited by the ORG to make written and/or oral submissions if it so wished . Hearings were held in all cases . The applicant did not make written and/or oral submissions in all the cases , however .", "CARDINAL . During the abovementioned period the ORG issued CARDINAL separate decisions finding the applicant in violation of CARDINAL or more provisions of the PERSON and/or the LAW . The ORG imposed fines in all the cases . In certain cases separate decisions were taken as to the merits and the fine . In these cases , following notification of the decisions , the applicant was given the opportunity to make submissions as to the imposition of a fine .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG found in a number of cases that the applicant had breached the provisions of the PERSON . In some cases the applicant admitted the violations in the submissions it made before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In all the cases the ORG held that \u201c Sigma TV \u201d had broadcast advertisements for children \u2019s toys at times prohibited by LAW . The ORG also found that some of the advertisements exploited children \u2019s inexperience and credulity by directly inciting them to purchase the products advertised , in violation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a)(i ) of the PERSON , and that some of the advertisements contained exaggerated or unfounded claims , in violation of paragraph B.CARDINAL of appendix LAW . Moreover , the ORG held that in some of the advertisements the products aimed at children had been promoted by offering gifts , in violation of paragraph MONEY ) of appendix ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In CARDINAL of its decisions ( cases nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) ) the ORG stressed that it had repeatedly indicated in the past , through its decisions , circulars and directives to stations , the significance of protecting minors from the messages they received through advertising , and had underlined the seriousness of such violations . Further , the ORG noted that advertisements for children \u2019s toys were not completely prohibited by the legislation but were subject to limitations ( concerning broadcasting times , approach , methods of promotion , techniques employed , visual and audio material used ) as children were vulnerable and credulous consumers because of their lack of experience and judgment .", "CARDINAL . In case no . CARDINAL ) the ORG found that on CARDINAL occasions the times at which \u201c ORG \u201d had interrupted programmes to broadcast advertisements had not been in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(g ) of the Law . Furthermore , the ORG found that on CARDINAL occasions the duration of the advertising breaks within programmes had been CARDINAL , in violation of paragraph PERSON of appendix PERSON of the Regulations . In its decision the ORG held that the need to regulate the frequency and duration of television breaks derived both from the right of a viewer to watch a programme unhampered , without long and frequent interruptions , and from the need to show respect for the programme , which should be broadcast in its entirety as a human creation . The applicant admitted the violations in the submissions it made before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the ORG found that \u201c Sigma TV \u201d had interrupted a news bulletin twice in order to broadcast advertisements , in violation of section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON .

Lastly , the ORG held that there had been surreptitious advertising in violation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) during a sports bulletin transmitted as part of the main news programme . The applicant admitted a violation of the PERSON on that account .", "CARDINAL . In cases nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the ORG found that the transmission of clear images of various products of real brands in a comedy series had been done in a provocative manner and had clearly been for advertising purposes , contrary to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) of the PERSON . Further , the ORG considered that the images used had not been a necessary part of the set of the series , as the applicant maintained . When imposing the fines the ORG took into account the fact that in spite of previous decisions finding similar violations and imposing fines , the applicant had shown no willingness to comply . In spite of previous findings of violations , for example , the applicant had broadcast repeats of some episodes of the series .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL cases the ORG found that the applicant had infringed a number of provisions of the PERSON and/or the LAW with regard to items broadcast during news bulletins .", "CARDINAL . \u201c Sigma TV \u201d broadcast a report in a news bulletin concerning the arrest of a teacher for photographing naked minors .

The ORG noted that the report included scenes which were taken possibly from a film or documentary and illustrated in detail the procedure of preparing and consuming drugs . The ORG considered that the images shown had not been suitable for transmission during the \u201c family zone \u201d ( see definition in paragraph CARDINAL below ) and had possibly been dangerous for minors . It found a violation of Regulations CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) as the applicant had not ensured that the material shown was suitable for minors , had not prepared and aired the particular news report with accuracy and had not issued a visual and/or verbal warning for viewers . The ORG drew attention to the fact that minors tended to imitate acts out of curiosity and an inclination to experiment . It stressed that it was its duty to take due steps to protect minors from programmes that could cause them any mental or physical harm . In its submissions before the ORG the applicant claimed that the purpose of the images had been to accompany the news story with visual material .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL of its news bulletins \u201c ORG \u201d aired a news report concerning CARDINAL murders . The ORG noted that the report contained close - ups of the dead body of the victim covered in blood and of the grieving relatives . Furthermore , no visual or verbal warning had been given to viewers . It found a violation of Regulations CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a)\u2013(d ) and of paragraph CARDINAL of part II of appendix LAW .", "CARDINAL . \u201c Sigma TV \u201d broadcast a report in a news bulletin about the transfer to court of CARDINAL young men suspected of drug use . The ORG considered that the news story had lacked objectivity , impartiality , accuracy and pluralism , in violation of LAW ) . It noted in this regard that although the allegations made over the phone by the mother of CARDINAL of the accused as to the effectiveness of the relevant institutions and the attitude of the competent medical authorities towards drug addicts had been transmitted , the institutions and medical authorities concerned had not been given the opportunity to express their views . In this connection , the applicant had argued , inter alia , that the issues in question concerned society and that the report should have been evaluated on the basis of the data and information the station had had at its disposal . The applicant further admitted that it did not have a delay unit allowing live telephone conversations to be interrupted when something unsuitable was said .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the ORG found that the news report had gone beyond the scope of information as comments , conclusions and information concerning private matters of the suspects had been broadcast , without the appropriate sensitivity towards human pain or respect for the PERSON personality , honour , reputation and private lives , in violation of Regulation ORG ) and paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , of part I of appendix ORG of the Regulations . The ORG did not accept the station \u2019s allegations that the suspects had turned towards the cameras seeking help , as certain shots showed the suspects covering up their faces and making every effort to avoid the cameras . Even if the suspects had chosen to publicise their problem , the ORG considered that the applicant should have taken into account that they had not been fully aware of their actions and had been in despair , vulnerable and under the influence of strong substances . In addition , the ORG noted that the disclosure of the identity of the persons involved , their media exposure as well as the extensive coverage of their private lives , could stigmatise them in a society such as that of GPE . In the ORG \u2019s view the promulgation of the drug problem could have been accomplished without revealing the PERSON identity and without disclosing information about their private lives .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that during a news bulletin broadcast on \u201c Sigma TV \u201d the name of the victim of a car accident had been mentioned before it had been ascertained whether the victim \u2019s parents had been informed , in violation of ORG ) . The applicant submitted before the ORG that it was standard practice to obtain confirmation by the police and this case had not been an exception .", "CARDINAL . The ORG held that an interview aired during a news bulletin on \u201c Sigma TV \u201d , with a female witness for the prosecution in pending criminal proceedings , advocating the innocence of a man under criminal charges , had lacked accuracy , objectivity , impartiality and pluralism . It was noted that although the interviewee had testified against the suspect in court , in the interview she had given information that pointed to the suspect \u2019s innocence . The ORG held that the manner in which the interview had been presented essentially exonerated the defendant in the proceedings . The ORG found that the broadcasting of such information violated paragraph CARDINAL of part II of appendix LAW . Further , the ORG pointed out that during the interview the interviewee had claimed that the investigating authorities had used her to put pressure on the arrested man to give them information . However , the views of authorities involved had not been stated , in violation of LAW ) , and no mention had been made in the interview of any attempts by the applicant to secure them .", "CARDINAL . In another news bulletin \u201c Sigma TV \u201d broadcast a news report concerning a car accident , as well as a trailer for the report . The ORG considered that the report contained an inappropriate and unnecessary description of the circumstances of the accident . In particular the ORG held that the applicant had not shown due respect for the personality , honour , reputation and privacy of the female driver of the car involved in the accident as it had overstepped the bounds of information and transmitted unnecessary details , comments and conclusions about the accident , in violation of ORG ) . In addition , the ORG found that remarks had been made in the news report that were an insult to the personality , the reputation and the privacy of the driver , in violation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of the PERSON , and that a clear distinction had not been drawn between fact , comment and speculation , in violation of paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of part II of appendix LAW . In respect of the above , the ORG , noted inter alia , that it had been stated in the news report that a young lady had been found injured and CARDINAL - naked in the driver \u2019s seat wearing only underwear on the lower part of her body , that eye - witnesses had claimed that they had seen CARDINAL young men , fleeing from the accident scene and heading towards the fields and that CARDINAL doors of the young woman \u2019s car , and more specifically the front passenger door and the rear door , were open . The ORG further pointed out that the information given in the report , which included video footage of the cars involved in the accident and reference to the place and time the accident occurred , had been sufficient to enable recognition , in particular , of the identity of the female driver . In its submissions before the ORG , the applicant claimed that there was only a slender possibility of recognising the persons involved . In reaching its decision , the ORG also took into account the unpleasant consequences the report had had on the driver \u2019s personal , family and social life , and that the persons involved in the case had not been public figures or public officials and the publication of information concerning their private lives had not served the public interest .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found in a number of cases that the applicant had breached the provisions of the PERSON and/or the LAW by broadcasting on \u201c Sigma TV \u201d , within or partly within family viewing hours , certain films and series and trailers thereof which included scenes of violence unsuitable for children . The ORG held that the scenes in question were likely to impair the physical , mental or moral development of minors , in violation of Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) . In CARDINAL of the cases the ORG found that the film in question contained scenes of humiliation and cruel treatment , in violation of regulation CARDINAL ) ( a rape scene ) . Furthermore , the ORG found in these cases either that the viewers had not been informed of the true content of the programmes as the acoustic and visual warnings given did not correspond to their content , in violation of LAW ) and ( b ) , with a rating of \u201c CARDINAL \u201d and \u201c CARDINAL \u201d had been shown during the family zone , in violation of Regulation CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG held that the applicant had not ensured that programmes transmitted during the family zone had been suitable for all ages , in violation of Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant admitted the violations in CARDINAL of the cases .", "CARDINAL . In its decisions concerning cases nos . CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ) , DATE ) and CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the ORG noted , inter alia , that the content of all broadcasts during the family zone had to be suitable for the whole family . It stressed that the protection of minors was the primary concern of everyone , including ORG and ORG , and that the NORP legislator had set limitations as to the content of programmes which could be transmitted for family viewing in order to protect children from programmes that were unsuitable for them because they contained violent or erotic scenes , or verbal material or subject matter unsuitable for minors . The ORG pointed out that it attached great weight to the above matters and to compliance with the relevant legal provisions .", "CARDINAL . In cases nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) the ORG found that during the family zone \u201c Sigma TV \u201d had broadcast and shown a repeat of a \u201c social documentary \u201d concerning the drug problem in GPE , as well as a trailer for the programme , containing visual and audio material unsuitable for children DATE , in violation of Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , and which could seriously impair the physical mental or moral development of minors , in violation of Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) . In particular , the programme included scenes showing , inter alia , the consumption and trading of illegal drugs and statements made by drug addicts concerning the consumption of drugs . Moreover , the ORG held that the trailer for the documentary contained visual and audio material that might offend the sensitivity of viewers , in violation of LAW ) . It further found that the visual and acoustic warning that had been given did not correspond to the actual content of the trailer and documentary , in violation of LAW ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL , and that information transmitted CARDINAL of the drug addicts had not shown the appropriate sensitivity towards human suffering , in violation of paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of part I of appendix VIII of the Regulations .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted that the personal information concerning the drug addicts in the documentary had been broadcast without due respect for their personality , honour , reputation and private lives , in violation of ORG ) . For example , the identity of a caller , a light drug user , had been displayed on screen , despite his wish to remain anonymous . The ORG considered that the drug addicts who had participated in the programme did not appear to have been fully aware of their actions , and that their free consent and decision should therefore not have been taken into full account because they had been in a state of despair , vulnerable and under the influence of strong substances that had affected their judgment . In any event , the disclosure of their identity , the media exposure and the extensive coverage of their private lives was likely to have numerous negative consequences for them . The ORG stated that it was also concerned about the personalisation of the drug problem through the disclosure of the identity of certain drug addicts , as this might lead to their becoming role models or even \u201c heroes \u201d for vulnerable people who would like to identify with them . According to the ORG the documentary had also lacked objectivity and pluralism , as criticisms and negative comments had been made against the medical authorities , the police drug squad , the Minister of Health and the Director of ORG , without them having been given the opportunity to present their position on the matter , in violation of section PERSON ) of the PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued before the ORG that the social content of the documentary was of interest to families . It admitted that a mistake had been made with regard to the disclosure of the identity of CARDINAL of the callers in question and informed the ORG that measures had been taken to restore the name and honour of a nurse in respect of whom allegations had been made in the programme .", "CARDINAL . In case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the ORG found that a \u201c social documentary \u201d broadcast by \u201c Sigma TV \u201d had not been characterised by objectivity and pluralism , as opinions and allegations had been voiced against doctors and officials working in an institution that had a bone marrow bank , without a complete picture or opposing views being presented , in violation of section PERSON ) of the PERSON . The ORG considered that the discussion , the direction it had taken and the manner in which it had developed indicated that it had been orchestrated to favour the views of the presenter and , more broadly , the station \u2019s views on the issues raised , to the disadvantage of participants with opposing views .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the ORG requested the applicant to pay the licence fee due for operating \u201c Sigma TV \u201d DATE and DATE , as required by LAW . The fee amounted to QUANTITY ( ORG ) for the period in question . The applicant paid the licence fee on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought separate recourses ( appeals for judicial review ) before ORG , seeking the annulment of CARDINAL of the above decisions ( recourses nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , GPE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , FAC , GPE , GPE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , GPE , CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It further lodged a recourse challenging the licence fee requested by the ORG for the period CARDINAL DATE to DATE ( recourse no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Although the recourses concerned different decisions of the ORG , the applicant relied on the same main points , including the same constitutional issues . These may be summarised as follows :", "( a ) The applicant alleged a breach of the rules of natural justice on the ground that in the proceedings the ORG had acted in many capacities , namely , as prosecutor , investigator - witness and , at the same time , judge . The ORG had then imposed fines , which were paid into its own ORG .", "( b ) The applicant claimed that the applicable LAW , and by extension the LAW , were contrary to LAW . In this respect it alleged a breach of LAW , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of the LAW . The main body of its arguments , however , was based on LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW and , in particular , on the imposition of pecuniary sanctions / fines by an administrative body and the exercise of regulatory authority under LAW by a public authority other than the ORG itself . The applicant also argued that the applicable PERSON interfered with its right to enter into contracts freely with producers and directors ( Article CARDINAL ) . Further , in recourse no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL the applicant alleged a violation of LAW and complained of discriminatory treatment vis - \u00e0 - vis ORG ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) , which was not burdened with the same charges .", "( c ) The applicant raised a number of points concerning the interpretation of the relevant legal provisions relating to the imposition of sanctions for the infringement of the Regulations .", "( d ) Lastly , the applicant challenged the decisions of the ORG on a number of other grounds , claiming , for example , that the procedure had not been followed in accordance with the law because there had been no proper inquiry , and insufficient reasoning had been given .", "CARDINAL . In view of the fact that issues as to constitutionality , natural justice and the interpretation of the provisions of the applicable PERSON were raised in all the recourses and because of their significance , ORG decided that they should be heard in priority , together and by GPE ( that is , all CARDINAL judges of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The hearing took place on DATE . Judgment was then reserved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for the reopening of the hearing of the recourses for the purpose , firstly , of submitting further arguments concerning its claim for the annulment of the decisions in question in the light of the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) and , secondly , in order to request the exclusion of CARDINAL of the judges from the bench on the ground that he had given a first - instance judgment , following reservation of the judgment by LAW , in another recourse brought by the applicant raising similar issues .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application . The court first noted that in accordance with its settled case - law it could order the reopening of a recourse or an appeal only in exceptional cases and , in particular , only where it decided that it was necessary in the interest of justice in the light of facts which came to light after judgment had been reserved . In the present case no new fact had been put forward which could justify the re - opening of the recourses . A new fact might be an event which touched on the elements which composed the dispute . The putting forward of further arguments with reference to jurisprudence subsequent to the reservation of the judgment was not such an event . With regard to the request for the exclusion of CARDINAL of the judges , ORG held that in accordance with its settled case - law the solution of a legal question at first instance or on appeal did not exclude the participation of a judge in the composition of the court who had heard the same , or a similar or closely related legal question in the context of other proceedings . ORG therefore concluded , unanimously , that no reason had been shown which could justify contemplating reopening the hearing in cases before it in which its judgment had already been reserved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG gave judgment dismissing , by a majority ( CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL recourses . The ORG \u2019s decisions challenged in recourses nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL were annulled .", "CARDINAL . First of all , with regard to the joining of the recourses , ORG noted :", "\u201c Matters which were put forward in a number of recourses against decisions of ORG , in compliance with ORG of DATE ( Law CARDINAL(CARDINAL)/CARDINAL , as amended ) , were examined at first instance by different judges , the result in each case being a dismissal . Appeals were filed which because of similarity we finally fixed to be heard together . In their course before the ORG it was ascertained that many recourses on similar matters of constitutionality , natural justice and interpretation of provisions of the PERSON were pending and were ready for hearing . ORG , because of their significance , it was decided that the proper course was that they should be heard , in priority , by LAW of the ORG since in ORG the participation of all judges would be impossible . Therefore the list was prepared of the CARDINAL recourses heard together to which this judgment relates . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then noted that , with the exception of recourse CARDINAL , which concerned the payment of a licence fee under LAW , the disputed ORG decision in each recourse had found the applicants guilty of infringement of CARDINAL or more provisions of the PERSON and/or the LAW . After referring to the relevant legal provisions and ORG , ORG proceeded to divide the issues that arose in the recourses into ( a ) general matters which broke down into CARDINAL groups , and ( b ) specific matters . The relevant excerpt of ORG judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The more general matters are classified in CARDINAL groups . The first includes matters of interpretation of provisions which relate to the imposition of sanctions for the infringement of regulations . It is the case of the applicants that section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON , whereby power is conferred on the ORG to impose sanctions / penalties as the applicants describe them , restricts that power solely to cases where there is an infringement of the LAW itself and the terms of the operating licence and not of the LAW \u201c ... which can not by themselves ( outside the authority of the PERSON ) define infringements and sanctions \u201d . In this connection reference is made to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(n ) of the Law \u2013 which confers authority to issue Regulations \u2013 as well as to relevant provisions of the Regulations .", "The second group concerns matters of natural justice . It is argued that in the proceedings which resulted in the imposition of a fine the necessary distinction of roles did not exist , with the result that the ORG was all at once prosecutor , investigator - witness and at the same time judge . It is added that the possibility of ex proprio motu examination conferred by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of the PERSON intensifies the objection . Furthermore , according to the applicants , the ORG can not be regarded as impartial because it has an economic interest since , according to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) of the PERSON , the fine is deposited in its own ORG .", "In the third group there are matters which concern the constitutionality of the PERSON , and by extension the ORG which were issued in accordance with the PERSON . It is submitted that the following provisions of the LAW are violated : ( a ) Article CARDINAL , by which the right to freedom of speech and expression in any form is safeguarded ; ( b ) Article CARDINAL , in accordance with which a person can not be tried or punished twice for the same offence \u2013 but for CARDINAL exception which does not apply here ; ( c ) Article CARDINAL , which refers to the right to enter into a contract ; ( d ) Article CARDINAL , which refers to taxation ; ( e ) Article CARDINAL , which refers to the right to employment , inter alia ; ( f ) Article CARDINAL , which refers to equality , and ( g ) as regards Recourse No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Article CARDINAL , which refers to property .", "In the recourses , in addition to these more general matters of great importance , other , more specific matters are also raised , connected to the particularity of each case , namely ( a ) whether the procedure was carried out in accordance with the law , ( b ) whether a proper enquiry was conducted and ( c ) whether the decision was reasoned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Before examining the above issues , ORG dealt with and dismissed various additional points raised by the applicant in some of the recourses , concerning , inter alia , the composition of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the matters of natural justice , proper enquiry and reasoning , ORG considered it useful to refer to specific instances , so that the procedural course common to most of the recourses and the manner in which the ORG dealt with the violations was indicatively outlined . It took recourse no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the first of the CARDINAL recourses , which , after agreement between counsel , formed the basis of the discussion before it . ORG noted that in that case , as in those at issue in CARDINAL other recourses , the ORG had acted following a complaint , whereas in CARDINAL other cases it had acted ex proprio motu when the respective programmes had come to its notice . However , it distinguished recourse no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which did not concern a violation , and recourse no . FAC , in which a different procedure had been followed .", "CARDINAL . It also held , in respect of recourses ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG , that the procedure provided for in the relevant Regulations had not been complied with by the ORG , and had therefore been defective . It accordingly found that the ORG decisions challenged in these CARDINAL recourses lacked the necessary legal basis .", "CARDINAL . ORG proceeded to look at the procedure followed by the ORG , the proceedings before it and its decision in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) challenged by recourse no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . It then examined the specific matters and the general matters raised by the applicant in the recourses . With regard to the specific matters , it held as follows :", "\u201c With regard to the question of proper enquiry , with the exception of the CARDINAL recourses which we have mentioned \u2013 nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and TIME we have not ascertained a vacuum . On the contrary , it seems to us that the enquiry covered everything , indeed in detail . In some of the recourses the applicants submitted , in this connection , that a legal problem arose because the investigating official who conducted the enquiry put a second report before the ORG , whereas he should have submitted only one . They invoked Reg . PERSON ) which provides that \u201c the official states his conclusion to the ORG fully reasoned ... \u201d . However , the second document contained no material as regards the alleged violations other than that which had already been brought to the notice of the applicants . He simply unified it for the convenience of the ORG . We do not consider this reprehensible . With regard to the question of reasoning , it seems to us that in each case , including those concerning the suitability of programmes or the definition of meanings \u2013 such as toy or game , surreptitious advertising , close - ups \u2013 adequate explanation was given to the applicants both as to the finding of the official ( who conducted the enquiry ) and as to the conclusions of the ORG , which , in our view , were all the result of a correct interpretative approach to the relevant provisions and reasonably arrived at , coming within the recognised boundaries of the essential appraisal of the administration , and in some cases , indeed , also unavoidable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With regard to the general matters , it held as follows :", "\u201c The first group", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(f ) of the PERSON provides that the ORG has the power to :", "... [ provision set out ]", "We observe that while in the first part of the provision the legal basis of the violations for which sanctions are imposed is analysed on CARDINAL legal grounds , in the part where the sanctions are set out , after DATE which is the administrative fine \u2013 the violation is related not to the CARDINAL legal grounds but CARDINAL , namely the PERSON and the terms of the licence . In our opinion this is merely a drafting inadequacy which in this case does not subtract from the clear meaning of the provision which , interpreted in its entirety , leaves no doubt about the uniform range of the sanctions in all the violations .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(n ) to which the applicants referred confers power to issue Regulations ...", "...", "Counsel for the applicants suggested that in the abovementioned Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(n ) in the phrase \u201c of ( the ) PERSON and the LAW ... \u201d the \u201c and \u201d is conjunctive , with the result that a violation of both the PERSON and the LAW is required as a precondition for the imposition of a fine . We are of the contrary opinion . By the word \u201c and \u201d the whole is defined without the independence of the parts being affected . The \u201c and \u201d functions essentially as a disjunction . We note also Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , issued in consequence , by which it is provided that the ORG may impose \u201c any of the sanctions which are provided by the Law \u201d when it considers , in a procedure by virtue of Part III of the LAW , that \u201c the provisions of the PERSON and the Regulations \u201d were not complied with . There again we see a reference to the LAW as a legal basis for the imposition of sanctions .", "The second group", "We do not share the view that the stipulated procedure , which the ORG pursued , is in conflict with the rules of natural justice , which require ( a ) that the judge be impartial and ( b ) that the person judged be afforded the opportunity to be heard . We firstly note their embodiment in DATE ) of ORG , which was ratified by GPE by Law No . CARDINAL , and the essential reproduction of that provision in LAW . The relevant jurisprudence of ORG ) was not invoked during the discussion of the recourses . This is explained , however , by the inherent difficulty in the evaluation of the factors on the basis of which the classification is made , since in the variform sphere of activity of the administrative organs it is sometimes difficult to decide , firstly , whether the case falls within article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG and secondly , if it does , whether its provisions have been complied with . With regard to the first decision , bearing in mind the tendency of the ORG to lay emphasis on rights under private law as opposed to factors of public law , which means beneficial interpretation in favour of the citizens , we are of the view that we must approach the recourses before us on the basis of the right to impartiality . This granted , we proceed to examine whether the procedure fulfilled the safeguards of impartiality . In our opinion the affirmative answer is justified . It appears to us that in all the cases , without exception , there has been a satisfactory distinction between the various stages , which consisted in the collection of the facts , their preliminary examination , the briefing of the applicants in relation to these , affording them the right to be heard , in writing or orally , and the final adjudication . The fact that according to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) of the PERSON \u201c ... income which accrues from the imposition of administrative fines on the stations ... \u201d is deposited with the ORG is not , in our view , inconsistent with impartiality . No private or personal financial interest is involved . The ORG , as a legal person under public law , acts impersonally to further the purposes of the PERSON . According to the same provision , other income also is deposited with the ORG , including fees from the grant of licences , the examination of applications , etc . , as well as the ORG grant , which , in any event , ensures the financial sufficiency of the ORG so that it may carry out its work of particular significance in contemporary society .", "Everything we have mentioned on the subject takes into account the fact that it is the procedure of an administrative organ and not a judicial one . LAW refers to a procedure before a court . What is needed in cases where decisions determining civil rights and obligations are issued by administrative organs is the possibility of access to a court to challenge the administrative decision : see PERSON and ORG v. Belgium Series A Vol . DATE ) . Where such possibility is offered , then the extent of the jurisdiction of the ORG acquires significance . In cases concerning decisions by professional disciplinary bodies the ORG has considered full jurisdiction of ORG indispensable in relation to both factual and legal matters . Certain decisions of state administrative organs were approached in the same manner later , whereas in other decisions which , as it was held , belonged to a domain where the need for recognition of the state authority in the determination of policy ought to prevail , it was decided that judicial review was sufficient . PERSON , O\u2019Boyle and PERSON deal with this aspect in their work \u201c PERSON of ORG ( DATE ) page CARDINAL . We quote the following passages which have as a point of reference the judgment of the ORG in the case of GPE v. GPE , Series A Vol . CARDINAL ( DATE ) :", "\u201c A problem with the application of LAW to administrative decision - making is that in some areas there are policy considerations that suggest that the final decision on the merits should rest with the executive , rather than a court , despite the impact upon an individual\u0384s civil rights and obligations that the decision may have . Decisions concerning the expropriation of land for a road or for public housing are obvious cases where this can be argued . Whereas the Court\u0384s jurisprudence concerning decisions on such matters as the disciplining of doctors , access to children and the dismissal of employees require a right of appeal to a tribunal with \u0384full jurisdiction\u2019 , it is noticeable that in the LOC case , concerning expropriation , the ORG stated that Article CARDINAL was complied with , regard being had , inter alia , \u2018 to the respect which must be accorded to decisions taken by the administrative authorities on the grounds of expediency\u2019 ... The PERSON case was interpreted in this sense in GPE v. GPE ... The only judicial remedy then available to the applicant in respect of the resulting interference with their property rights was recourse to the English High Court \u2018 on a point of law\u2019 ; ORG did not have a full right of appeal on the law and the facts . The Commission held that this limitation on the High Court\u0384s jurisdiction did not infringe LAW . The applicant society had appealed to ORG and had been able to put and have considered by the ORG all of the arguments that it wished to make . Rejecting the applicant\u0384s , argument that ORG had lacked the \u2018 full jurisdiction\u2019 that LAW stated that it is \u2018 not the role of LAW to give access to a level of jurisdiction which can substitute its opinion for that of the administrative authorities on questions of expediency and where the courts do not refuse to examine any of the points NORP . \u201d", "We are of the view that in the case where the infringement of the regulatory provisions of the law is examined in the particularly sensitive and significant domain of radio and television , the decision in matters which by their nature may be characterised by subtle nuances and many gradations is justifiably left , as a matter of state policy , to a special independent ORG . We are of the view that the judicial review provided for in our system is adequate . We do not , therefore , discern a violation of the rules of natural justice which are embodied in Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the LAW .", "The third group", "With regard to LAW , the matter of constitutionality that is raised is centred on the position that the power conferred on the Republic , on the basis of paragraph CARDINAL , to require an operating licence in the field of radio and television broadcasting and cinema , comes within and is not outside everything included in paragraph CARDINAL as regards the boundaries of the fundamental right to which paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL refer .", "...", "According to the applicants , since paragraph CARDINAL is subject to paragraph CARDINAL , the obligations which are imposed by the operating licence can not depend on the judgment of ORG . They arise only with reference to all that paragraph CARDINAL subtracts from the fundamental right of paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Where a difference appears in relation to the observance of the limits , the matter is decided by the court . They add , with reference to paragraph CARDINAL , that the power to require a licence belongs to the Republic itself and can not be transferred to a legal person of public law , such as ORG . Their basic position however has as its core paragraph CARDINAL and more specifically the part of it which refers to \u201c ... penalties prescribed by law ... \u201d . \u201c Penalties \u201d , according to the applicants , are only sanctions which are imposed by a criminal ORG . And DATE they continue \u2013 the sanctions under consideration for violation of the PERSON and the LAW can be viewed only by reference to the said part of paragraph CARDINAL , the entrusting of their imposition to an administrative organ is not conceivable .", "In relation to the meaning of \u201c penalty \u201d , learned counsel for the applicants referred to LAW , where reference is made to \u201c penalty \u201d in the context of criminal liability . He also referred to LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW by which the power of imposing punishment for contempt is conferred on the court . The advocate contrasted the administrative fine which , according to his suggestion , \u201c ... is only the specific sum fixed by the LAW , as an automatic consequence ( without an administrative procedure and decision taken in accordance with any free discretionary power of the administrative organ ) . \u201d He referred in this connection to the case Director of ORG v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL ORG DATE , which concerned delays in the payment of social security contributions . The advocate also referred to the judgment of GPE in GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL FAC , which he characterised as another example of the automatic imposition of sanctions by law . At the same time , however , he suggested that if the decision in ORG can not be viewed in this way , then the deviation from its reasoning is justified .", "In relation to LAW a matter was raised from another angle as well , namely that of dual liability , disciplinary and criminal . In paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL it is stated that :", "The position of the applicants on this is summarised in that while section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( f ) of the PERSON , which is the basic provision from which the challenged decisions arise , provides for administrative sanctions for various violations , section PERSON ) nevertheless establishes parallel criminal liability .", "In the written addresses the advocate expressed criticism in relation to the said established system and raised a query with regard to how the ORG chooses CARDINAL procedure or the other , and also about the consequences . This aspect , however , was not raised in the legal points of the recourses and can not occupy us . We observe , in any case , from the standpoint of more general classification , that while the parallel criminalisation creates disharmony from which problems could arise , the characterisation of the cases as administrative is nevertheless not reversed . It is not necessary for us to go into the potential problems .", "We consider that , subject to the scope of the exercise of the power conferred by paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL for the regulation of radio and television broadcasting , the said power comes within the boundaries of paragraph CARDINAL and can not exceed them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then referred , in connection with the third group of issues raised , to LAW in the context of the regulation of radio and television broadcasting , with particular emphasis on the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of PERSON and Others v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , and PERSON gegen PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI . It further referred to relevant ORG legislation and case - law , namely the CARDINALth recital of the preamble of ORG Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by LAW in Member GPE concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities \u2013 specifically advertising , sponsors and telemarketing and the judgment of ORG in ORG GmbH v. PERSON privaten ORG , DATE .", "CARDINAL . It went on to hold as follows :", "\u201c ... we do not share the opinion of the applicants that the supervisory prevalence of paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL over paragraph CARDINAL excludes administrative sanctions for infringements of provisions in consequence of arrangements made on the basis of paragraph CARDINAL . By ORG of DATE and the ORG issued in accordance with it , the domain to which paragraph CARDINAL refers is regulated in a manner which in our opinion is not in conflict with paragraph CARDINAL . Because even if it is identified with the criminal meaning of Article CARDINAL or the quasi - criminal meaning of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL , the sanctions which are provided for by LAW in question are related not to the possibility of penalties provided for in paragraph CARDINAL but to non - compliance with the provisions of the Law and the Regulations , which constitute the basis for the issue of the broadcasting licence . And these provisions are in harmony with what paragraph CARDINAL permits as terms and restrictions of the right to freedom of speech and expression in any form , with reference inter alia to the protection of the rights of others as well , as it was said also in ORG ( supra ) .", "As to the meaning of administrative sanctions , the case of ORG ( supra ) , like the cases before us , shows clearly the latitude with which it is viewed . It is not confined to the financial charge which is automatically imposed by the LAW for non - fulfilment of the stipulated obligation . In Demand Shipping Co. Ltd. ( supra ) as in the cases before us , a decision was issued by the competent ORG whereby a violation was found in relation to which the fine was imposed : an \u201c administrative penalty \u201d as the full bench described it there . We see no reason for divergence from that approach .", "Nor do we share the view of the applicants that the regulatory powers conferred on the Republic by paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL can not be exercised on behalf of the ORG by a public ORG established by LAW . On the contrary , we are of the opinion that the role of the ORG is expressed more effectively and more objectively through such an ORG than through a government service . The same was done in GPE in DATE with the establishment of ORG before Article CARDINAL of LAW was amended in DATE .", "With reference to LAW , the position of the applicants , as their learned counsel explained in the written submissions , is basically as follows :", "\u201c Law CARDINAL(CARDINAL)/CARDINAL is an unconstitutional intervention there where the applicants carry out their work , in the course of which they are entitled to deal freely ( LAW ) with producers and directors who provide information , familiarisation , entertainment through television to any television viewer who may watch their programme \u2013 free of charge \u2013 , with the obligation of course NOT to violate any of the \u201c benefits \u201d which LAW listed specifically , which alone could restrict the right to freedom of information .", "It is , we believe , obvious that this position does not extend beyond what has been put forward in relation to LAW , and in particular as regards the relationship between paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL . This we have already decided . The same is also valid for LAW ) , which has been included in the formulation of certain arguments . LAW was argued in particular in recourse No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL in connection on the one hand with the said LAW and CARDINAL and on the other hand with Articles CARDINAL ( Property ) and CARDINAL ( Taxation ) . However the same discussion has been included to some extent in other recourses also . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , with regard to recourse no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG examined the applicant \u2019s arguments concerning differential treatment vis - \u00e0 - vis the ORG . ORG held as follows :", "\u201c The applicants complain that ORG , which is a ORG institution , is not burdened with the same charges and furthermore that it is supported financially . They present the charges as an unacceptable deprivation of property , as the imposition of tax and as an interference with their work and the contracts they enter into . We do not discern any unconstitutionality in the imposition of charges . Obviously this is not taxation . Next , objection to the co - existence of a public television station and private ones may not in principle be put forward since the right which is safeguarded by LAW may be promoted more fully and more effectively by this co - existence . In ORG and another v. ORG CARDINAL . ORG , ORG CARDINALth DATE , GPE , by the judgment of PERSON , said the following in this connection :", "\u201c We therefore hold that the existence and operation in our country of public radio and television , which does not aim at profit , constitutes a form of indirect state control which also aims at guaranteeing the objectivity of private radio and television . Such a guarantee serves the public interest . Therefore the existence and operation of the ORG . , which is a public utility , serves the public interest . And as stated in the preamble of CARDINAL , the operation of the LOC . fulfils an essential social function in the contemporary state . Consequently we hold that the need to secure income which will ensure its viability continues to exist even after the enactment of LAW . \u201d", "Public and private radio and television differ in their nature and mission . This justifies different arrangements for each case concerning the viability and the adequacy of their operation and also the financial needs of the independent ORG which the PERSON established to safeguard the right referred to in LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , ORG held that recourses nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG were successful and annulled the corresponding ORG decisions on the basis of LAW ( CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW . The remaining recourses were however dismissed and the respective ORG decisions were upheld on the basis of LAW .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL judges delivered dissenting opinions in which they focused on the applicant \u2019s arguments concerning the impartiality of the ORG in view of the different capacities in which it acted in the proceedings . The judges expressed the view that in the circumstances the disputed procedure violated LAW and consequently should be annulled . In their opinion , the cumulative result of the convergence of so many different competences by the ORG and especially the fact that the imposed fine was collected by the authority itself , might reasonably create doubts about its independence and impartiality . They noted that the whole climate was aggravated as the ORG \u2019s decision was liable to nullification procedure without the right to dispute the substance . The recourse under LAW had only a nullifying character and ORG could not go into the essence of the case . For example , it could not examine the amount of the fine in terms of proportionality . The dissenting judges stressed , however , that the above conclusions had no bearing on the constitutionality of administrative fines .", "CARDINAL . Following the judgment , the applicant was reimbursed the sums it had paid in fines on the basis of the decisions in cases nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) which were annulled by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG brought civil proceedings against the applicant before ORG seeking payment of the fines it imposed by CARDINAL of its abovementioned CARDINAL decisions , namely the decisions in ORG cases nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( civil actions nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s recourse concerning case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was still pending before ORG at the time ( recourse no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) whilst its recourse against the decision in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( recourse no . ORG ) had been dismissed by ORG on DATE as the applicant had failed to file written observations . The applicant did not bring a recourse against the decision taken in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appeared and filed its defence in the actions on DATE . In its submissions the applicant raised pre - trial objections alleging that the claims , and consequently the actions , were based on an unconstitutional law . According to the applicant the legal provisions for the imposition of the administrative fines in question were unconstitutional . Further , the applicant claimed that the ORG had imposed penalties and not administrative fines and that the imposition of such penalties infringed the rules of natural justice and LAW as the plaintiffs had acted as prosecutors , witnesses and judges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG filed CARDINAL separate applications for summary judgments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed objections to these applications . It pleaded , amongst other things , that it had a good defence as ( a ) the dispensation of justice was complete only when the arguments of all the parties had been heard in toto ; ( b ) the claims of the plaintiff were based on an unconstitutional law ; ( c ) the legal provisions for the imposition of monetary penalties and the claims for the specific monetary penalties were based on an unconstitutional law ; and ( d ) it was a penalty which was imposed on the appellants and not an administrative fine , in violation of the LAW , which granted the power of imposing penalties only to the courts ( Articles CARDINAL and ORG ) of the LAW ) . The applicant \u2019s objections were accompanied by affidavits from CARDINAL of its directors stating , inter alia , that the matter of the constitutionality of the relevant law was pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The hearing of the applications for summary judgments took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment in favour of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having set out the principles governing summary proceedings and having referred to the relevant NORP and LANGUAGE jurisprudence , came to the conclusion that the plaintiff had satisfied all CARDINAL conditions set by LAW of the civil procedure rules . Consequently , the burden of proof shifted to the defendant to put before the court such facts as would show that it was right and just to allow it to put forward its defence . It therefore proceeded to examine the main points raised by the applicant .", "DATE . ORG analysed the remit of the ORG under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON by which it had been established and made reference to the relevant LAW . Referring to the relevant case - law , the court emphasised that the decisions of the ORG by which administrative fines had been imposed on the applicant were executory administrative acts which produced legal results until their annulment by ORG . Consequently , the fact that a recourse was pending before ORG did not constitute a good defence for an action for the collection of a pecuniary fine imposed by an administrative decision . The court also made reference to a number of first - instance judgments of ORG in recourses brought by the applicant against certain decisions of the ORG in which the applicant \u2019s allegations as to a breach of the rules of natural justice and the unconstitutionality of the PERSON had been rejected . In conclusion , ORG decided , on the basis of the material relied upon by the applicant , that an arguable defence had not been made out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged appeals before ORG against the first - instance judgments ( civil appeals nos . DATE , DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed , inter alia , that it had been deprived of the right to a fair trial in violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW given , firstly , that the first - instance judgments had been given on the basis of LAW ( a ) of ORG , which circumvented its constitutional right to have recourse to a court and to present its defence in full , and secondly , that the first - instance court had wrongly decided that the applicant did not have a good defence despite the fact that matters concerning the constitutionality of PERSON CARDINAL(CARDINAL)/CARDINAL were pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment dismissing the appeals . It concluded as follows :", "\u201c ( a ) The procedure for the issuance of a summary judgment which is provided for by LAW secures the right to a fair trial and provides sufficient guarantee to the parties for the presentation of their case within a settled framework . In this connection , we observe that , according to the jurisprudence , only in cases where the defendant fails to show that he has an arguable defence is summary judgment given against him .", "( b ) The decisions of the respondents were for the imposition of administrative fines on the appellants by virtue of LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL)/CARDINAL and constitute executory administrative acts , the legality of which may only be disputed according to LAW by recourse before ORG . Until an administrative act is annulled it remains in force and produces legal results . In this case the administrative acts were not annulled .", "( c ) The monetary claims of the appellants , in the aforementioned actions , were based completely on the aforementioned administrative acts . The appellants did not succeed in showing in sufficient detail , as they should have ( since the respondents had satisfied the conditions of ORG ) , that they had an arguable defence .", "( d ) With reference to the constitutionality of LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL)/CARDINAL we observe that every law is presumed to be constitutional until the opposite is proved . This law has not been judged unconstitutional .", "We consider the decisions of ORG to be correct and the grounds of appeal unfounded . The respondents satisfied the conditions of LAW of the Rules of Civil Procedure while the appellants failed to show that they had a good defence against the claims or to put before the ORG such facts which would show that it was right and just to allow them to put forward their defence . Correctly , also , ORG did not take into consideration the defence statements already filed by the appellants since in applications for summary judgment the facts which are taken into consideration are those which are set out , in the correct procedural form , in the application and the objection and the affidavits which accompany them . The filing of a defence by a defendant can not deprive the plaintiff of his right to submit an application for summary judgment , in the appropriate case , as was this one . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
