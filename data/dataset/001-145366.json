It appears from the domestic judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that he was registered with the local migration authorities from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE of GPE brought criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of his alleged membership DATE of PERSON ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a transnational NORP organisation , banned in GPE , GPE and NORP republics , and making public calls to overthrow the constitutional order of GPE and to establish an NORP state in its place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged in absentia in GPE with attempting to overthrow the NORP State \u2019s constitutional order ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW of GPE ) ; storage and disseminating of documents containing ideas of religious extremism , separatism and fundamentalism , and threats to national security and public order ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of the Code ) ; and participation in and direction of religious , extremist , separatist and other prohibited organisations ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code ) . The statement of charges indicated that DATE the applicant , as a member of ORG , had regularly held unlawful religious gatherings with CARDINAL other persons at which they had made \u201c public calls to overthrow the existing constitutional order \u201d in their home country and \u201c made use of materials containing ideas of religious extremism \u201d .

Furthermore , since DATE the applicant had systematically participated in religious studies and physical training sessions of a \u201c shahid belt community \u201d , as well as meetings organised by NORP at which public calls for the replacement of ORG by an NORP state in the form of a recreated ORG had been made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest , and his name was put on the cross - border list of wanted persons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police in GPE as a person wanted by the NORP authorities . On DATE ORG of GPE of GPE confirmed their intention to request the applicant \u2019s extradition and requested that he be remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . When interviewed by the police on DATE after his arrest , the applicant stated that he had moved to GPE in DATE to look for work . He had not registered as a foreign national temporarily residing in the country and had not applied for refugee status in GPE . He was unaware of the reasons for his criminal prosecution in GPE and had not been persecuted on political grounds in his home country . His wife and CARDINAL minor children lived with him in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General of GPE submitted a formal request for the applicant \u2019s extradition . The request contained assurances that the applicant would be prosecuted only for the offences for which he was being extradited , that he would be able to freely leave GPE once he had stood trial and served any sentence , and that he would not be expelled or extradited to a third State without the consent of the NORP authorities . The NORP prosecutor \u2019s office further assured its NORP counterpart that the applicant would not be prosecuted in GPE on political or religious grounds , or subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment , that he would be provided with an opportunity to defend himself , inter alia , through legal assistance , that the criminal proceedings against him would be conducted in compliance with the domestic law of GPE , and that he would receive any medical treatment required .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative filed objections against the extradition request . She argued that according to independent international observers , illtreatment was widespread in the NORP prison system and fair - trial guarantees were not respected . Referring to the ORG \u2019s caselaw on the matter ( PERSON v. GPE , no . ORG , CARDINAL DATE ; PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ; and Zokhidov v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) , as well as to the reports by ORG bodies and NGOs cited in paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL below , she submitted that the applicant , who had been charged with religious and political offences , including membership of ORG , would run an increased risk of illtreatment and would be deprived of the minimum fair - trial guarantees if extradited to the requesting country . The applicant \u2019s representative also referred to a report of DATE by ORG of ORG of GPE in which the department , referring to various international NGO reports , pointed out that criminal proceedings in GPE depended to a considerable extent on self - incriminating statements . She further referred to a letter of DATE from the same ORG , which stated that any extradition to GPE would be in breach of LAW from the point of view of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to a letter from the prosecutor \u2019s office of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on DATE ORG refused to order the applicant \u2019s extradition , since his criminal prosecution had become time - barred . According to the applicant , neither he nor his representatives had been informed about the refusal at that point . The parties have not submitted a copy of the relevant decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE ordered the applicant \u2019s detention pending extradition until DATE . The decision was not appealed against .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Kuntsevskiy ORG of GPE ordered an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE in order to ensure his extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision on appeal .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the head of the extradition department of ORG informed the Kuntsevskiy ORG prosecutor of GPE that on DATE ORG had refused to order the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE since his criminal prosecution had become time - barred , and requested that the applicant be immediately released from custody . The letter continued as follows :", "\u201c At the same time , [ I ] ask you to check the lawfulness of Mr PERSON \u2019s residence in GPE and his compliance with the immigration laws .", "[ I ] ask you to send a copy of the release order , as well as information about the results of the check , to the extradition department of the city prosecutor \u2019s office no later than CARDINAL DATE by fax and mail . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A hand - written note on the letter , apparently made by the addressee , indicated that it would be necessary \u201c to conduct a migration check under LAW [ of LAW ] if there are grounds [ for it ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Kuntsevskiy ORG prosecutor \u2019s office ordered the applicant \u2019s release from detention , because on DATE the extradition proceedings had been discontinued . At TIME on that date the applicant was released from a remand centre in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , at TIME on DATE he was apprehended by the police at the exit of the remand centre , immediately after his release from detention , and taken into custody .", "CARDINAL . According to the administrative offence record ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant was arrested at TIME by an officer of ORG in connection with a violation of the immigration laws ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code of Administrative Offences ( \u201c the CAO \u201d ) ) .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE an officer of ORG of the ORG recorded that the applicant had been arrested \u201c for the purpose of drawing up an administrative record \u201d . In the part of the record reserved for comments the applicant wrote that he objected to the arrest and that he could not be removed to GPE since he ran a risk of torture there . Furthermore , proceedings were pending in respect of his refugee status .", "CARDINAL . At some point on DATE an administrative - offence record was drawn up on account of the applicant \u2019s failure to leave GPE after DATE . The applicant , in a hand - written comment made in the relevant part of the record , conceded that he had breached the migration laws but claimed that he could not be removed to GPE because he would be tortured in his home country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case file was forwarded to ORG of GPE . By a separate petition the head of ORG of the ORG requested the court to order the applicant \u2019s detention pending administrative removal , since he had been residing in GPE unlawfully and in breach of the immigration laws and had been avoiding leaving GPE ; accordingly there were grounds to believe that he would continue to breach the immigration laws .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Kuntsevskiy ORG of GPE examined the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing the defence acknowledged that the applicant had failed to register with the migration authorities or leave GPE , contrary to the requirements of the immigration laws . However , they submitted that , in accordance with LAW ORG , administrative proceedings should have been brought against him as soon as sufficient data indicating the occurrence of an administrative offence had been obtained . When the applicant had been arrested on CARDINAL DATE , the authorities had already been in possession of sufficient information on the applicant \u2019s immigration status . However , administrative proceedings had not been brought against him until DATE , once the term of his detention pending extradition had expired . In those circumstances , the defence considered that the administrative removal of the applicant , if ordered , would amount to a form of extradition in disguise .", "CARDINAL . The defence further submitted that in any event the applicant \u2019s expulsion could not be ordered , since proceedings were pending in respect of his refugee status . They pointed out in this connection that the applicant \u2019s request for refugee status had been accepted for examination ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and that he had received no response by the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the defence made a detailed argument to the effect that the applicant was wanted by the NORP authorities in connection with charges relating to religious offences , and would therefore run a risk of illtreatment if expelled to GPE . They referred to reports by the ORG and international nongovernmental organisations ( cited in paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL below ) , as well as the ORG \u2019s case - law in support of that position .", "CARDINAL . The Kuntsevskiy District Court found the applicant guilty of the administrative offence of breaching LAW ( LAW . The court considered that the administrative - offence record had been compiled by a competent officer and in accordance with the domestic law . It rejected as irrelevant the applicant \u2019s arguments to the effect that the authorities had been aware of the impugned breach of the immigration laws as early as DATE , arguing that on that date the applicant had been arrested on different grounds . The court took note of the applicant \u2019s submissions concerning his request for refugee status and dismissed them as having no bearing on the administrative offence under examination . The lack of information on the progress of the proceedings in respect of refugee status did not preclude the court from applying an administrative sanction under LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . When deciding on the sanction to be applied , the court took note of \u201c the information on the applicant \u2019s personality \u201d , as well as of the fact that he had admitted breaching the immigration laws . On the other hand , it observed that the applicant had been unlawfully residing in GPE for a considerable period of time and that he did not have a permanent residence or job in GPE . In accordance with LAW of the ORG the court fined the applicant MONEY ( RUB ) and ordered his administrative removal from GPE .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court granted the request of the head of ORG of the ORG for the applicant \u2019s placement in detention pending removal . It reiterated that the applicant had been residing in GPE in breach of the law and had avoided DATE and was likely to further avoid \u2013 leaving GPE of his own will . The court decided that the applicant should be detained in a special detention centre for foreigners of ORG of the ORG until his administrative removal . No specific timelimit for the applicant \u2019s detention was given by the court .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the defence submitted their points of appeal before ORG . In addition to their initial arguments , they submitted , first , that the first - instance court had incorrectly established the facts of the case , including in respect of the applicant \u2019s arrest . Contrary to the case materials , on DATE the applicant had only just been let out of the remand centre when he was immediately arrested at the exit of the detention facility . They argued that the administrative - offence record had been forged and therefore was inadmissible . Secondly , they maintained that the applicant \u2019s expulsion would amount to his \u201c extradition in disguise \u201d . They pointed out , with reference to the letter of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that the very initiative to conduct an urgent check of the applicant \u2019s migration status had been taken by the prosecutor \u2019s office , that is the authority in charge of his extradition case . The interest the prosecutor \u2019s office displayed in the carrying out of the migration check \u2013 a matter clearly outside their competence \u2013 could be interpreted as an indication of that authority \u2019s interest in ensuring the applicant \u2019s return to GPE . However , the applicant , if removed to his home country , would be unable to benefit from the minimum guarantees he could have in extradition proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , the defence maintained that domestic law prohibited the expulsion of a person who had applied for refugee status until a final decision in that respect had been made . However , the domestic court had omitted to elaborate on that aspect of the case . They argued that , contrary to the first - instance court \u2019s findings , the requirement to take into account the proceedings in respect of the applicant \u2019s refugee status had had no effect on the lower court \u2019s findings as to whether an administrative offence had DATE or had not \u2013 taken place . However , it could have had a bearing on the determination of the administrative sanction . In that regard , they drew the appeal court \u2019s attention to the fact that administrative removal constituted a sanction additional to an administrative fine .", "CARDINAL . Fourthly , the defence stressed that the first - instance court had failed to make any assessment of their ill - treatment argument . Having referred to the ORG \u2019s case - law , they reiterated their extensive submissions as regards the risk of ill - treatment if the removal order were to be enforced . They complained that the first - instance court had refused to admit to the case the reports by reputable NGOs , the NORP courts\u2019 decisions , or the ORG \u2019s decisions in similar cases .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the defence submitted that the decision ordering the applicant\u2019 s detention did not contain any time - limit and was therefore in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The examination of the case was initially scheduled for DATE but was adjourned in order to obtain updated information on the proceedings in respect of the applicant \u2019s refugee status from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE , finding it lawful and justified . It held that the first - instance court had been right in finding that the applicant \u2019s actions had constituted an administrative offence . The appeal court upheld the administrative sanction as lawful and found no grounds to amend it . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument to the effect that he could not be removed from GPE in the absence of a final decision in the refugee - status proceedings as irrelevant , since \u201c the examination of the respective appeal did not have a bearing on the event or the legal qualification of the administrative offence \u201d . The court further noted that , in any event , on DATE his application for refugee status had been refused . As regards the applicant \u2019s argument about the authorities\u2019 failure to bring the administrative proceedings against him in a timely manner , the court considered that this circumstance did not constitute a ground for quashing the lower court \u2019s judgment . It argued that that violation had been insignificant , since the time at which the respective record of the administrative offence had been drawn up had not had a \u201c preclusive effect ( \u00ab \u043d\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c ORG ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . At some point in DATE the applicant applied to ORG of ORG ( \u201c the GPE FMS \u201d ) for refugee status in GPE on the grounds of fear of persecution on account of fabricated charges against him relating to a religious offence . He submitted that the accusations against him were unfounded . On DATE his case was accepted for consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) concluded , in a letter to the applicant \u2019s representative , that there existed a real risk of ill - treatment of persons whose extradition was sought in connection with politically motivated charges of a religious nature .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for refugee status . According to a copy of the decision as submitted by the parties , it observed that the applicant was wanted in GPE in connection with his alleged membership of ORG and noted that \u201c the initiator of the search had confirmed its intention to claim extradition \u201d . The authority reiterated that it was for a petitioner to adduce persuasive arguments why there existed an individual risk of persecution on the grounds of nationality , religious beliefs or membership of a social group . The authority took note of both the administrative removal order of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the indication by ORG interim measure in the applicant \u2019s case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The GPE ORG found as follows :", "\u201c It transpires from the case materials that after the death of the applicant \u2019s mother in DATE the applicant \u2019s father married another woman . In order to obtain the father \u2019s heritage , in DATE she complained to the local police that some time before the applicant had come to GPE to kill his father . However , according to the applicant , criminal proceedings had not been brought against him . However , in DATE she wrote a new complaint , this time accusing the applicant of extremism . It may be concluded from the above that the reason for which , according to the applicant , unfounded charges had been brought against him was a domestic conflict . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The GPE FMS also noted that the applicant had deliberately hidden the fact of the State border transfer between CARDINAL and DATE and that he had not applied for refugee status until his arrest , even though he had learned of the extremism charge against him in DATE . The authority also observed that the applicant \u2019s brother was living in GPE and had not been persecuted . It therefore concluded that the applicant had lodged a request with the sole purpose of avoiding criminal prosecution in GPE and that he did not satisfy the refugee criteria .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence lodged an appeal against the refusal with the NORP ORG office , arguing that the FMS GPE had omitted to take into account the political and religious nature of the charges against him and to analyse the specific circumstances of his case . They submitted , in response to the regional authority \u2019s findings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , that it was immaterial who had brought the complaint against the applicant . Nor was the situation of his brother of relevance , since no criminal case had been opened against him in GPE . Contrary to the migration authority \u2019s findings , the applicant had not learned about the exact nature of the charges or the stage of the proceedings against him in GPE until his arrest . The fact of his border crossing in DATE was of little relevance and did not undermine his statement that since DATE he had not left GPE for a considerable period of time . ORG in its decision had referred to the extradition proceedings but had omitted to note the crucial point , namely the fact that extradition had been refused in the meantime ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Lastly , the defence reiterated that the practice of torture against detainees in GPE could be described as systemic and that there was no evidence of any improvement in DATE . The defence referred , in particular , to the concluding observations of ORG of DATE , as well as ORG reports of DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , the ORG reports published in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , and other material ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . They maintained that the applicant , charged with membership of ORG , ran a particularly serious risk of illtreatment and detention in his home country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . The federal migration authority considered that ORG had thoroughly analysed all the relevant circumstances and had taken a wellfounded and lawful decision that the applicant did not meet the refugee criteria . The NORP ORG further noted that it was not competent to conduct investigative activities within a criminal case or to doubt the wellfoundedness of the materials submitted by ORG of GPE about the criminal case brought by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . By the same decision the NORP ORG instructed the GPE FMS to examine the issue of granting the applicant temporary asylum in GPE , with regard to the indication made by ORG CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The parties have not informed the Court of any follow - up to that instruction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE before ORG of GPE as unlawful and unfounded . They reiterated their earlier submissions regarding the risk of ill - treatment in the event of the applicant \u2019s expulsion ( see paragraphs DATE above ) and referred , in addition to the international material cited in their earlier submissions , to ORG released by ORG in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They argued that the federal migration authority had failed to address the foreseeable consequences of the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE , and above all the risk of ill - treatment run by the applicant in the event of his removal . Instead of conducting such an analysis , the migration authority argued that they were not competent to conduct an investigation or review the extradition materials , even though that issue had been clearly outside the scope of the applicant \u2019s request . That attitude , in the applicant \u2019s view , rather demonstrated that the NORP ORG were relying on the presumption of his guilt in the criminal proceedings brought against him by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the appeal proceedings are pending to date .", "CARDINAL . After his arrest on TIME CARDINAL July DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the applicant was placed in a cell at the LOC police station of GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the cell measured CARDINAL sq . m and accommodated , during the applicant \u2019s detention there , CARDINAL detainees . It was separated from the main corridor by a barred grill . The applicant did not have an individual sleeping place , since the cell was equipped with CARDINAL metal bench instead of beds . There were no windows in the cell , so he had no access to natural light and air . The cell was not equipped with a lavatory or toilet facilities . No linen or mattresses were available . The applicant received food and water once a day .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the cell measured CARDINAL sq . m. The applicant was provided with food and bed linen .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on CARDINAL DATE ( according to the Government ) or on DATE ( according to the applicant ) the applicant was transferred to the GPE special detention centre for foreigners . The parties have not submitted documents in respect of the date of that transfer .", "CARDINAL .
