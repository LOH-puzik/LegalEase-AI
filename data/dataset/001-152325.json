The applicants , PERSON and PERSON PERSON , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . The first applicant is the mother of the second applicant . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant gave birth to the second applicant in DATE and shortly thereafter ended her relationship with the child \u2019s father , GPE , to whom she was never married .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the GPE ORG confirmed an agreement reached between the first applicant and GPE According to the agreement , the first applicant was to exercise the parental rights related to the upbringing and DATE care of the child , and GPE was to see his daughter under a \u201c free access regime \u201d , which included the right to see the child in private as often as he wished after informing the mother and not less than two weekends a month , and DATE during the child \u2019s DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant got married to a NORP - NORP citizen in GPE , GPE , GPE , on DATE . She left her job in GPE in DATE with a view to joining her husband in GPE .", "CARDINAL . During CARDINAL periods , DATE to CARDINAL DATE and DATE to DATE , the first applicant stayed in GPE with her husband . During the rest of the time , she lived in GPE with her daughter . On DATE , the first applicant settled in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant brought proceedings before ORG under LAW DATE . She sought a decision from the court , in the absence of the father \u2019s consent , to allow the child to be issued with a passport and to travel abroad to join her in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The GPE ORG granted her claim on DATE . The court found that the possibility for the second applicant to travel abroad would enrich her life and stimulate her personal development . It considered that ORG \u2019s refusal to allow her to travel was provoked by his personal interest which should not be allowed to bear negatively on the child \u2019s rights , especially since GPE could seek protection of his rights in separate court proceedings . Nothing in the mother \u2019s personality and demeanour was found to represent a risk for the child \u2019s well - being . Guided by the primary interest of the child , the court recalled LAW on LAW , which was ratified by GPE , and held that the second applicant had the right to move about freely , including to leave her country .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by ORG , the ORG confirmed the lower court \u2019s findings on DATE . It found that , as the first applicant had married and settled in GPE , not allowing the daughter to join her there would impede the mother \u2019s ability to act as her primary carer . Those were the terms reached in the DATE court agreement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which ORG had not sought to amend at any time . During the periods which the mother had spent in GPE , the second applicant had been primarily cared for in GPE by the first applicant \u2019s parents . When the second applicant had stayed at GPE \u2019s house , her daily care had been carried out by the child \u2019s aunt and grandmother . A report by the social services favoured the second applicant \u2019s free travel with her mother and found that both mother and child had strong emotional ties to each other . The child had specifically asked to live with her mother in GPE and to visit her father in GPE during the holidays . The decision of QUANTITY DATE of ORG was not appealed against and became enforceable on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested the police to issue a passport to her daughter . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the head of ORG \u201d section in ORG refused to issue a passport to the girl . He referred to the absence of a document giving the father \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant applied for judicial review , challenging the police refusal . On DATE , ORG , examining the application under LAW , quashed as unlawful the police refusal to issue a passport to the second applicant . The court observed that the absence of both GPE agreement to the issuing of a passport to their child was not sufficient grounds to justify a refusal . It went on to say that the police should have carried out an in - depth analysis of the specific circumstances of the applicants\u2019 case , being guided in their assessment primarily by the interests of the child . The court returned the case to the police with specific instructions as to how to apply the law when examining the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . I.P. appealed against the decision of DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the findings of GPE that the police refusal of CARDINAL DATE had to be quashed as unlawful . It further noted that , on the question whether or not to issue a passport to a child , the police enjoyed decisionmaking discretion ( \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 ) pursuant to section CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the first applicant again applied for a passport for her daughter . On DATE the police refused to issue a passport , referring to the fact that the GPE ORG decision of DATE in respect of replacing the father \u2019s agreement was not final as ORG had appealed against it ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant asked once again that a passport be issued to her daughter , referring to the CARDINAL judgments of the administrative courts ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . On DATE the police informed both the border authorities and the applicant that a procedure was underway for the refusal of a passport to the second applicant . On DATE the police refused the ORG request because of the absence of written consent from the child \u2019s father . In doing so , the head of ORG referred to the social services\u2019 latest conclusions that , while the first applicant spent time in GPE , the second applicant was well cared for in GPE by the first applicant \u2019s parents . In addition , he found that the girl \u2019s departure from GPE would impede the possibility for the father effectively to exercise his access rights and that would affect his relationship with the child in an irreparable manner . The police concluded that the competent body to decide on the relationship between the father and the child was the relevant district court in accordance with Articles DATE and CARDINAL of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . After the judgment giving permission to the second applicant \u2019s travel became final ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the police issued a passport to the child on DATE . She obtained a visa and left for GPE with her mother in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant brought proceedings for damages under LAW , as related to the ORG and ORG DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , on behalf of herself and her daughter . The applicants claimed they had both suffered as a result of the unlawful refusals by the police to issue a passport despite the findings of the administrative courts which had quashed the first refusal . They also claimed damages as a result of the unlawful failure of the police to comply in good time with the final decision of ORG of DATE . The applicants invoked a breach of LAW in respect of them both and of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW in respect of the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Administrative Court partly upheld their claim on CARDINAL DATE . The court found that ORG had to pay : ( a ) QUANTITY ( ORG ) to the first applicant and around EUR CARDINAL to the second applicant , for non - pecuniary damage stemming from the quashing as unlawful of the police refusal of CARDINAL DATE to issue a passport to the second applicant ; and ( b ) around EUR CARDINAL for nonpecuniary damage to each applicant , as a result of the police unlawful failure to decide within the statutory DATE deadline on the applicant \u2019s request for a passport made on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below and CARDINAL above ) . The court also awarded around EUR CARDINAL to the applicants for costs and expenses , to be paid by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On appeal by the applicants and cross - appeal by ORG , on DATE ORG ( ORG ) quashed the lower court \u2019s decision in its entirety . It found that the appeal by the applicants had been inadmissible as lodged out of time . Ruling on the appeal by the police , the court observed that the first condition for the application of the Act DATE was not present , given that a court had not quashed as unlawful an administrative act as required by LAW DATE . It then went on to say that the lower administrative court had not decided the matter in the place of the police . Instead , it had returned the case to the interior authorities with instructions as to how to apply the law . The head of ORG had then given ample reasons for his refusal of CARDINAL DATE to issue a passport . The applicants had not appealed against that refusal . As to the second condition under LAW DATE , namely a causal link between the failure by the police to decide in good time on the request for a passport and the damage suffered by the applicants , the court found that such a causal link was missing . More specifically , when deciding whether to issue passports to minors , the police did not enjoy discretion in respect of how to apply the law . Instead , the police were bound to act within the remit of \u201c subordinate competence \u201d ( \u043e\u0431\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 ) . It meant that , in their decision - making process , the police did not need to analyse the circumstances of each case , but rather only had to check whether the conditions listed in law were present or not . Consequently , the ORG concluded in its final decision of CARDINAL DATE , the damage caused to the applicants did not stem from the police refusal to issue a passport to the second applicant . The police had acted in application of the law . The fact that a passport had not been issued was entirely the result of the first applicant \u2019s failure to submit either an authorisation by the father or by the relevant district court for the second applicant \u2019s travel , as required by law .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW DATE , in force until DATE , parental rights and obligations were to be exercised by both parents together as well as separately by each parent . In case the parents disagreed , the relevant district court resolved the disagreement after hearing both parents and , if need be , the child . The court \u2019s decision was subject to appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the new Family Code CARDINAL , LAW provides that parental rights and obligations are exercised following an agreement between the parents . If the parents disagreed , they could bring the matter before the district court whose decision is subject to appeal . LAW provides that , in cases where the parents do not live together , if they disagreed on questions related to the child , the disagreement is to be decided by the district court whose decision is subject to appeal . As of DATE , a new Article CARDINALa specifically provides that the questions related to a minor \u2019s travel abroad and to the issuing to him or her of identity papers , are to be decided jointly by both parents . If the parents disagreed , the issue is to be settled by the district court of the minor \u2019s place of residence .", "CARDINAL . According to section DATE , as worded at the time of the events , an application for the issuing of a passport or another identity document for a minor was to be made \u201c in person \u201d ( added in DATE ) and by the minor \u2019s parents or guardians . The police have to issue a passport within DATE of such an application ( section DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

That right is subject only to such limitations as may be necessary for the protection of national security , public order , people \u2019s health or the rights and freedoms of others .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the police may refuse to allow a minor to leave the country in the absence of a written consent for that of his or her parents . If the parents disagreed , LAW DATE specifically provided between DATE and DATE that the matter was decided in accordance with LAW ; as of DATE , the matter is to be decided in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , adopted in DATE , provided that , in cases where the authorisation of CARDINAL parent for the issuing of passport to a minor was missing , such an application had to be submitted together with CARDINAL of the following documents : a judicial decision allowing the issuing of a passport which had become enforceable ; a judicial decision depriving the missing parent of his or her parental rights ; or , a death certificate of the parent who had not given his agreement .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , individual administrative acts are subject to judicial review as regards their lawfulness .

For questions not covered by this PERSON , the ORG and ORG DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) is applied .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE provides that the ORG and municipalities are liable for damage caused to private individuals and legal entities as a result of unlawful decisions , acts or omissions by their own authorities or officials while discharging their administrative duties . Section CARDINAL of the LAW provides that compensation is due for all damage which is the direct and proximate result of the unlawful act or omission .
