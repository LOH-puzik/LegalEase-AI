NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC in GPE , GPE of GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant entered GPE in DATE . From DATE onwards he had a relationship with A. , another NORP national living in GPE . The couple \u2019s relationship was marked by conflict , and the applicant repeatedly threatened and also committed major assaults against NORP Numerous criminal proceedings were instituted but subsequently closed because ORG withdrew her accusation or refused to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was however found guilty by the appeal court of the GPE of ORG Basel - Stadt , \u201c the appeal court \u201d ) of endangering A. \u2019s life by pushing her into the LOC and of raping her . He was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , of which DATE suspended for DATE . It was planned that the applicant would serve the prison sentence from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG ordered the expulsion of the applicant from NORP territory . It is unknown whether that decision became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal court of the GPE of ORG ( ORG Basel - Stadt , \u201c the criminal court \u201d ) sentenced the applicant for threatening behaviour towards DATE imprisonment . Since the applicant was sentenced during the probation period under the former conviction of DATE , the criminal court decided that the previously suspended CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment was to be enforced as well .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was sentenced on the basis of the following event . On CARDINAL DATE , during an appointment with his psychiatrist , who had been treating him since DATE , the applicant had declared that he was planning to take revenge on his ex - girlfriend , PERSON , whom he considered to be the cause of all his problems . He had stated that he would find her , rape her and kill her , and that he did not care if he were sentenced again . As later stated by the psychiatrist , this was not the first time that the applicant had expressed feelings of revenge against A. This time , however the psychiatrist had had the impression that the applicant was very determined to accomplish those acts , especially because at the end of the session the applicant had thanked him \u201c for everything \u201d and refused to make another appointment . Fearing for A. \u2019s life , the psychiatrist had therefore sought authorisation from ORG of the GPE of ORG to be released from his duty of professional confidentiality , and subsequently informed the police . The same day the police informed A. about the applicant \u2019s threats . Anxious about what could happen to her , she made a criminal complaint against the applicant for threatening behaviour .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings before the criminal court , the applicant denied that he had threatened to kill A. He stated that his psychiatrist had misunderstood him and that he had effectively said that he was going to kill himself . Partly contradicting himself , the applicant also claimed that he \u201c had not meant seriously \u201d what he had said . In defence of the applicant , his representative further submitted that the applicant had made those statements to his psychiatrist , who was acting under professional confidentiality . He could not have anticipated that his psychiatrist was going to inform the police , and he had therefore not acted with the intention to threaten his ex - girlfriend .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the criminal court however found that the applicant had fulfilled all the elements of threatening behaviour as established in LAW ( \u201c the SCC \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On the one hand , it was not necessary for the applicant to have made the threat directly to A ; it was sufficient that she had become aware of it . On the other hand , the criminal court held that the applicant could have anticipated , in the light of the seriousness of his threats and his general behaviour during the session with the psychiatrist , that his psychiatrist would take action to prevent him from carrying them out ; even more so as his psychiatrist knew his former criminal record and had been treating him for DATE . The criminal court found that it must have been clear to the applicant that his psychiatrist , especially as a doctor , would give more weigh to the health of a third person than to his duty of professional confidentiality . Furthermore , at a later time , when the applicant \u2019s sister informed him that the police were looking for him , he had immediately known the reason for it . He had hence anticipated his psychiatrist \u2019s acts and acted with the intention of threatening his ex - girlfriend . He therefore fulfilled all the elements of threatening behaviour according to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision . He claimed in particular that he had not acted with the intention of threatening PERSON could not have anticipated that his psychiatrist would be released from his duty of professional confidentiality and would subsequently inform the police , who would in their turn inform PERSON had therefore not fulfilled the subjective elements of threatening behaviour as established in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal court endorsed the decision of the criminal court . It established that during questioning the applicant had never stated that he was relying on the psychiatrist \u2019s duty of professional confidentiality . He had only disputed that he had ever said that he was planning to rape and kill A. The appeal court further held that from the applicant \u2019s decisive behaviour on DATE in not making another appointment and saying goodbye to his psychiatrist in a dramatic manner , it could even be concluded that he wanted his psychiatrist to do something . Even if the applicant had wished to provoke his psychiatrist into taking action other than seeking an intervention by the police , the psychiatrist would have been obliged to be released from the duty of professional confidentiality in any event , and A. would have come to know about the threats anyway . The appeal court therefore concluded that the applicant had intended to threaten GPE and that he was guilty under LAW SCC .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicant , ORG upheld the appeal court \u2019s decision on DATE . It reasoned that in the given circumstances the applicant could have predicted that the psychiatrist would give more weight to ORG \u2019s life higher than to his duty of professional confidentiality . In behaving as he did that day the applicant had at least regarded this as possible and accepted that the threats would come to be known by NORP The applicant had therefore been correctly sentenced .", "CARDINAL .
