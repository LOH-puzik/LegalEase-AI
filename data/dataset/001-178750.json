On DATE the mother travelled to GPE with the QUANTITY children and they have not returned to GPE since .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant commenced proceedings in the NORP courts for the return of his children to GPE under LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , ORG and , following an appeal by the mother , ORG , ordered the return of the children to GPE as their country of habitual residence and issued several ancillary orders .", "CARDINAL . The return order became enforceable on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for judicial enforcement of the return order since the mother had not complied with it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG attempted to have the mother comply voluntarily with the order . In response , she informed ORG that she had lodged a request with ORG for him to exercise his discretionary power to challenge the return order by way of an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( mimoriadne dovolanie ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the enforcement proceedings on the return order pending the outcome of the mother \u2019s request to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG resumed the enforcement proceedings after ORG had found that there were no reasons to lodge an extraordinary appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , ORG and , following an appeal by the applicant , ORG , found that the return order was not enforceable . They based their conclusions on the following CARDINAL grounds .", "Firstly , they concluded that there already existed a previous decision on provisional measures , which had been delivered by ORG on DATE . That decision had temporarily entrusted the children to the care of the mother and required the applicant to pay child maintenance in the meantime . Those interim custody rights were to be determined later by the competent courts in GPE .", "Secondly , the return order had failed to specify that it was directed at the mother or to give a precise time frame for its implementation .", "Given the fact that the mother had not been identified as the recipient and that the applicant had not been provisionally entrusted with the care of the children , the order could not be enforced .", "CARDINAL . Following the unsuccessful enforcement proceedings , the applicant applied to the same court which had delivered the return order , the Bratislava ORG . He referred to the shortcomings in the order as identified by the enforcement courts and asked the court to specify to whom the order had been directed and to provide a time frame for the return of the children . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s action was res iudicata and dismissed it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant challenged the enforcement courts\u2019 decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE by way of a complaint under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint admissible and on DATE it found on the merits that ORG had violated the applicant \u2019s rights , as specified below ( \u201c the first constitutional judgment \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , it found a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW ( family life ) , QUANTITY ( protection of parenthood and children , right to child care ) , and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( judicial protection ) of the LAW , and LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( fairness ) and Article CARDINAL ( family life ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that ORG decision had been taken on purely formal grounds and had been arbitrary and in contravention of LAW , the Brussels II bis regulation , LAW and LAW . That arbitrary decision had meant that the positive obligations guaranteed by LAW and the applicant \u2019s parental rights had been breached as well .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the Constitutional Court quashed the contested decision , remitted the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE to ORG for reexamination and awarded him MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation for nonpecuniary damage . In addition , ORG awarded the applicant everything he had claimed in legal costs ( EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . It noted that he had made no claim for costs in respect of his observations in reply to those of the enforcement courts concerned by his complaint and concluded that no award was therefore possible in that regard .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was final and not amenable to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Following the first constitutional judgment , the enforcement proceedings resumed before ORG , which heard the case on DATE . It acknowledged that it was bound by ORG judgment . However , having regard to the considerable length of time that had elapsed , it deemed it necessary to assess afresh all the circumstances decisive for the enforcement of the return order , such as the children \u2019s whereabouts , their health and the possibility of their returning to GPE . It therefore quashed ORG decision under appeal and remitted the matter to it for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again declared enforcement of the order impermissible on the basis of newly obtained evidence . It relied on medical reports concerning the children \u2019s health , a psychological report referring to negative consequences for them if they were separated from the mother and an opinion from the court - appointed guardian ( the NORP office of employment , social affairs and family ) about the stable family environment they had while living with their mother . It also took into account the children \u2019s wish to stay with their mother and her new husband , their social ties in GPE , where they had been residing since DATE , and the applicant \u2019s lack of contact with them while in GPE . Relying on the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the ORG \u2019s ORG judgment in the case of ORG and GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) , it concluded that their return to GPE would go against their best interests .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the applicant , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision on DATE and it became final and binding on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant on CARDINAL DATE lodged another constitutional complaint aimed at the enforcement proceedings held before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He alleged a violation of Articles CARDINAL ( length ) and CARDINAL ( family life ) of the LAW and their constitutional equivalents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under both of those LAW provisions ( \u201c the second constitutional judgment \u201d ) . When dealing with the applicant \u2019s length of proceedings complaint , ORG took into account that it was the first time the applicant had raised such a grievance . There had accordingly been no previous constitutional assessment of that matter to prevent it from assessing the impugned enforcement proceedings in their entirety , from when they had been initiated . Having regard to the sensitive nature of the matter and its importance for the applicant \u2019s enjoyment of his parental rights , ORG found that ORG had proceeded with the matter over a long time ( for DATE ) and inefficiently ( it had stayed the proceedings , delivered an arbitrary enforcement decision on the first occasion , and had taken lengthy procedural steps ) . Notably , the Constitutional Court emphasised that it was precisely the passage of time which had led ORG to dismiss enforcement of the return order . It also reproached ORG for the inadequate way it had dealt with the mother \u2019s procedural requests . It further stressed the particular nature of the enforcement of such return orders and pointed out that they required prompt and efficient decisionmaking that was in accordance with international standards .", "Moreover , ORG found that there had been a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his family life as a consequence of the fact that throughout the enforcement proceedings , whose length had been in breach of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time , he had been unable to assert his parental rights before the competent courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered ORG to reimburse the applicant \u2019s legal costs and to pay him ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . After the enforcement proceedings had been completed by a final and binding decision and before the second constitutional judgment had been issued , the applicant applied to ORG a third time on DATE . He relied on that occasion on DATE ( fairness and length ) in conjunction with LAW and DATE ( family life ) of the LAW and challenged the decisions of DATE and QUANTITY DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) on their merits . That complaint is still ongoing ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
