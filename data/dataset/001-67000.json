ORG accepted the ORG 's request on DATE . The judgment was served upon the applicant by mail on DATE .", "Subsequently , on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , the IAET refused the applicant his entitlement to the benefits and decided to request the applicant to reimburse all the benefits paid , amounting to approximately EUR CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG examined the applicant 's appeal and quashed the PERSON 's decision of DATE and returned the case for re - examination , finding that the applicant 's application had been dismissed without first obtaining a fresh certificate from the unemployment office .", "As it appears from the documents , on DATE the local ORG found that the applicant was still self - employed .

The decision of ORG could not be appealed .", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW , as in force at the relevant time , concerned the reimbursement of benefits paid . If a benefit referred to in the LAW had been paid wrongly or in too large an amount , the excessive amount was to be recovered . Recovery could be waived completely or in part if this was considered reasonable . A final decision on reimbursement could be enforced in the same way as any final decisions .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , as in force at the relevant time , concerned the annulment of decisions . According to that section , when a final decision concerning a benefit referred to in the LAW was based on incorrect or insufficient information or was manifestly unlawful , ORG could annul the decision after having heard the other interested parties if so recommended by the relevant unemployment fund or requested by the person concerned , and order the matter to be reprocessed . After having given the said recommendation , the unemployment fund could temporarily suspend payment of the benefit or pay it in accordance with the recommendation , until the matter had been resolved .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myyskassalaki , lag om arbetsl\u00f6shetskassor ; CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the purpose of an unemployment fund is , inter alia , to provide its members unemployment benefits pursuant to LAW . LAW provides that ORG and ORG grants licences to establish an unemployment fund .", "An unemployment fund receives state funding ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) and its rules must be registered to ORG ( vakuutusvalvontavirasto , PERSON ) , which is subordinated to ORG ) . ORG supervises the unemployment funds and has the right to obtain information from them as well as to order the unemployment funds to take actions which ORG regards as necessary for the fulfilment of the provisions of LAW ( sections DATE and CARDINAL of the Act ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
