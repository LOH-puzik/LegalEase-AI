The present case relates to the issue of \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency deposits ( foreign currency deposited before the dissolution of ORG \u2013 \u201c the SFRY \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Until the DATE economic reforms ( the so - called ORG reforms , named after the then Prime Minister PERSON ) , the commercial banking system of the SFRY consisted of self - managed basic and associated banks . Basic banks , founded and nominally controlled by socially owned enterprises , carried on day - to - DATE commercial banking activities . CARDINAL or more basic banks could form an associated bank through a self - management agreement , while preserving their legal personality . In the SFRY , there were CARDINAL basic banks and CARDINAL associated banks ( namely GPE , GPE udru\u017eena banka GPE , GPE banka ORG , GPE banka GPE , PERSON banka GPE , GPE banka GPE , GPE banka GPE , GPE banka GPE and PERSON banka ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Hard - pressed for hard currency as it was , the SFRY made it attractive for its expatriate workers and other citizens to deposit their foreign currency with commercial banks based in the SFRY : such deposits earned high interest ( the DATE interest rate often exceeded PERCENT ) and were guaranteed by ORG see , for example , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON and Other Financial Institutions Act DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Foreign - Currency Transactions Act DATE introduced a system for redepositing of foreign currency by commercial banks with ORG . Although the system was optional , it allowed commercial banks to shift the currency risk to the ORG and practically all foreign currency was thus redeposited . In addition , ORG was required to grant national - currency loans ( initially , interest - free ) to commercial banks to the value of the redeposited foreign currency . It should be underlined , however , that such redepositing was as a rule only a paper transaction , because commercial banks had insufficient liquid funds : it would appear that commercial banks redeposited in total MONEY ( ORG ) , out of which MONEY ( PERCENT ) was actually transferred to ORG ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and DATE , ORG CARDINAL- ... ; see also decision ORG CARDINAL of ORG DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . In DATE the system of redeposits was brought to an end ( see section CARDINAL of ORG DATE , as amended on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Problems resulting from the foreign and domestic debt of the SFRY caused a monetary crisis in DATE . The national economy was on the verge of collapse and the SFRY resorted to emergency measures , such as statutory restrictions on the repayment of foreign - currency deposits ( see section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ) . As a result , foreign - currency deposits were practically frozen .", "CARDINAL . Within the framework of the ORG reforms , the SFRY abolished the system of basic and associated banks described above . This shift in the banking regulations allowed some basic banks to opt for an independent status , while other basic banks became branches ( without legal personality ) of the associated banks to which they had beforehand belonged .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some important features of the banking system remained , however , unaffected by the reforms . First of all , commercial banks remained under the regime of \u201c social ownership \u201d \u2013 a concept which , while it does exist in other countries , was particularly highly developed in the SFRY . Secondly , both commercial banks and the ORG had financial obligations arising from foreign - currency savings : depositors were entitled to collect their deposits at any time , together with accumulated interest , from commercial banks ( see sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) or , in the event of a commercial bank 's \u201c manifest insolvency \u201d or bankruptcy , from the State ( see sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , section CARDINAL of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Insolvency Act DATE and a decision of ORG of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the SFRY ceased to exist . It was replaced by CARDINAL successor GPE : GPE , GPE , GPE ( succeeded in DATE by GPE ) , \u201c the former GPE \u201d and GPE .", "CARDINAL . A brutal war started in GPE shortly after its declaration of independence . During the war , GPE took over the statutory guarantee for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings from the SFRY ( pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) . Furthermore , the concept of \u201c social ownership \u201d was abandoned ( see LAW DATE and ORG DATE ) . As a result , all commercial banks based in GPE were effectively nationalised . While the use of \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings was allowed in some exceptional situations during the war , it would appear that this possibility remained only theoretical ( see a decision of the Presidency of GPE of DATE and a decision of ORG of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the General Framework Agreement for Peace in GPE ( \u201c the GPE Peace Agreement \u201d ) entered into force . It confirmed the continuation of the legal existence of GPE as a ORG , while modifying its internal structure ( LAW to ORG , named LAW of GPE \u201d ) . In accordance with LAW , GPE and GPE consists of QUANTITY Entities : ORG and PERSON . ORG failed to resolve ORG in the GPE area , but the parties agreed to a binding arbitration in this regard under ORG rules ( LAW to ORG ) . Meanwhile , the rural parts of the pre - war GPE municipality remained under the control of ORG and the town of GPE under the control of ORG . An arbitral tribunal issued its final award on DATE . It suspended the legal authority of the ORG within the whole territory of the pre - war GPE municipality and transferred all of the Entity powers to the newly - created GPE under the exclusive sovereignty of GPE and international supervision . GPE was formally inaugurated on DATE . Nevertheless , Entity legislation continued to apply in the District until modified by the Supervisor of GPE or ORG . All Entity legislation ceased to have legal effect in LOC DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG assumed full liability for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings in locally based commercial banks in order to prepare them for privatisation ( in accordance with section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE and ORG ) . While withdrawal remained impossible , residents of that Entity were given the possibility of using their \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings to purchase the ORG - owned flats in which they lived ( where this was indeed the case ) and certain ORG - owned companies ( see section CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL , as amended on DATE and on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , the Republika Srpska assumed full liability for \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings in commercial banks based there ( see section CARDINAL of ORG DATE , as amended on DATE ) . However , unlike in ORG , where the liability shifted simultaneously with respect to all commercial banks , in the Republika Srpska the liability shifted for each commercial bank upon its privatisation . The relevant dates for the CARDINAL main commercial banks with \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency deposits , the ORG banka and the PERSON banka , were DATE and DATE respectively . The privatisation process was completed in ORG in respect of commercial banks on DATE . Residents of that Entity were also given the possibility of using their \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings to purchase the ORG - owned flats in which they lived and certain ORG - owned companies ( see section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of DATE all commercial banks in LOC were privatised by the Entities through an agreement with the District and with the approval of the Supervisor of Br\u010dko .", "CARDINAL . Legislation providing for the use of \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings in the privatisation process had limited appeal and , moreover , led to abuses : an unofficial market emerged on which such savings were sometimes sold for PERCENT of their nominal value . In DATE , in an attempt to remedy the situation , the ORG and the LOC agreed to recompense \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savers in cash and government bonds and set up repayment schemes to this effect . However , pursuant to decision ORG of ORG DATE , the CARDINAL repayment schemes were replaced by CARDINAL for the entire territory of GPE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the vicinity of PERSON , in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He worked across LOC as a mailman , construction worker and handyman in DATE and deposited foreign currency earned abroad with a basic bank based in GPE , a member of the GPE banka GPE . During the ORG reforms the bank became a separate entity , named PERSON banka . In DATE it was nationalised ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and in DATE it was sold to a commercial bank based in GPE banka ) .", "CARDINAL . After several failed attempts to withdraw his funds , the applicant complained to ORG ( a human - rights body set up under Annex CARDINAL to ORG ) . By a decision of DATE ( decision CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL et al . ) , ORG , the legal successor of ORG , found the contemporary legislation to be contrary to LAW lack of procedural guarantees ) and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention ( on account of the lack of a fair balance between the relevant interests ) . Besides some general measures , it awarded the applicant MONEY ( BAM ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage and legal costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent verification agency assessed the amount of the applicant 's \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings at BAM ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received BAM CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE he received the first instalments of the principal debt and of interest on the bonds , both due on DATE , in the total amount of BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the government bonds due on DATE have not yet been issued ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that the second instalment of interest on the bonds , due on DATE , has not yet been paid ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . For the relevant law and practice , see the admissibility decision in GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXII ; ORG v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; and the judgment in GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-XII .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG DATE entered into force on DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) . GPE undertook to recompense original deposits in locally based banks and interest accrued by DATE at the original rate , less any funds already used ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . Interest accrued from DATE until DATE is to be cancelled and calculated afresh at an DATE rate of PERCENT . The assessment of the amounts due to each claimant is to be carried out under an administrative procedure by verification agencies . The deadline for submitting an application to this effect has been extended on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court of GPE has examined the constitutionality of the provision concerning the reduction of the interest rate to PERCENT for the period from DATE until DATE and considered it to be justified given the overall circumstances , notably the need to reconstruct the national economy following a devastating war ( see decision U CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . All claimants that have obtained verification certificates ( see the penultimate sentence of paragraph CARDINAL above ) are entitled to a cash payment of up to BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL in GPE and LOC and up to BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL in PERSON . Any remaining amount will then be reimbursed in government bonds .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with LAW , government bonds were to be issued by DATE . They should be amortised by DATE at the latest and earn interest at an DATE rate of PERCENT . While it had initially been planned to issue ORG bonds through ORG , on DATE PERSON passed its own ORG Act DATE ( \u201c the RS Act \u201d ) , cutting the amortisation period for government bonds down to DATE , and issued its own Entity bonds on DATE . On DATE ORG declared LAW constitutional ( decision LAW DATE ) . It decided that the constituent units ( the ORG and the District ) had jurisdiction to regulate the matter of \u201c old \u201d foreign - currency savings , provided that they remained within the framework of LAW . Following this decision , ORG refused to issue government bonds only for some constituent units . As a result , ORG and GPE had to issue their own bonds . While LOC did so on DATE , it would appear that bonds have not yet been issued in ORG .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , amortisation plans were adopted on DATE for ORG and on DATE for ORG and GPE . On DATE a new amortisation plan was adopted for GPE which is along the lines of that of DATE .", "In the Republika Srpska , bonds are to be amortised by DATE in CARDINAL instalments ( on DATE and CARDINAL DATE from DATE to CARDINAL DATE ) together with interest on the bonds ( at an DATE rate of PERCENT ) . The first CARDINAL instalments were paid , as planned , on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . In the event of late payment , default interest is to be paid at the statutory rate .", "In GPE , bonds are to be amortised by DATE in CARDINAL instalments as follows : PERCENT of the entire debt is to be paid on DATE , PERCENT on DATE , PERCENT on DATE , PERCENT on DATE , PERCENT on DATE , PERCENT on DATE , PERCENT on DATE and PERCENT on DATE . Interest on the bonds ( at an DATE rate of PERCENT ) is to be paid on DATE and DATE every year from DATE to DATE . The first instalments of the principal debt and of interest on the bonds ( both due on DATE ) were paid on DATE . It would appear that the instalments due on DATE and DATE have not yet been paid .", "Lastly , under the old amortisation plan , the Br\u010dko District paid the first instalments of the principal debt and of interest on the bonds ( both due on DATE ) on DATE and the second instalment of interest on the bonds ( due on DATE ) on DATE . Pursuant to the new plan , bonds are now to be amortised by DATE in CARDINAL instalments as follows : PERCENT of the entire debt is to be paid on DATE , PERCENT on DATE , PERCENT on DATE , PERCENT on DATE , PERCENT on DATE , PERCENT on DATE and PERCENT on DATE . Interest on the bonds ( at an DATE rate of PERCENT ) is to be paid on DATE and CARDINAL DATE every year from DATE to DATE . The instalment due on CARDINAL DATE has been paid in time . In case of the late payment of any forthcoming instalment , default interest is to be paid at the statutory rate .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since government bonds are redeemable before their maturity , once issued , they may be traded on ORG . In ORG , their current trade price on ORG is PERCENT of their nominal value . Given that government bonds have been issued in LOC only recently , their trade price on ORG has not yet consolidated . As mentioned above , it would appear that bonds have not yet been issued in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1", "P1-1-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
