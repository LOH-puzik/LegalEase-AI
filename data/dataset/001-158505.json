GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . If the Government failed to rebut this presumption , that would entail a violation of LAW in its substantive part .

CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the circumstances of the present case , the ORG notes that no assessment of evidence was carried out by the domestic courts .

The ORG also notes that the investigation obtained various theories concerning the reasons for his disappearance : kidnapping for ransom ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , abduction relating to hostile relationship ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and , lastly , abduction by law - enforcement agents ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In such circumstances , in the absence of unequivocal prima facie evidence of the latter , the ORG is unable to conclude that ORG agents or persons acting with their consent could be the sole possible perpetrators of the alleged abduction .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , it has not been established to the required standard of proof \u2013 \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d \u2013 that ORG agents were implicated in Mr PERSON disappearance ; nor does the ORG consider that the burden of proof can be entirely shifted to the Government ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
