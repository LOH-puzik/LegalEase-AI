FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant worked as a sheet - iron worker . He had graduated from secondary school and had received training in technical design . He had also taken a course in management with the intention of carrying on his father 's sheet - iron business . On DATE he was involved in an accident at his place of work . He sustained injuries to his legs and heels . After the accident he commenced business studies at a university in DATE .", "CARDINAL . An insurance company granted the applicant an allowance for PERCENT reduction of his working capacity for the period from DATE to DATE . The same insurance company also granted the applicant an industrial injury pension for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the insurance company gave CARDINAL decisions regarding the applicant 's further insurance claims . It granted the applicant an allowance for DATE for studies which would upgrade his skills in technical design . He was also granted funding for DATE support training for finding a job .", "CARDINAL . The insurance company also granted the applicant inconvenience compensation ( haittaraha , meners\u00e4ttning ; \u201d compensation \u201d ) and found that the injuries sustained to the applicant 's right leg and heel corresponded to the category CARDINAL disability ( haittaluokka , invaliditetsklass ; \u201d category \u201d ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( tapaturmalautakunta , olycksfallsn\u00e4mnden ) about the said decisions . He requested , inter alia , that his compensation be graded at category CARDINAL ( instead of CARDINAL ) . For this purpose , he submitted CARDINAL medical opinions written by his doctors , PERSON , in which the applicant 's injuries were assessed as being comparable to category CARDINAL or CARDINAL injuries .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested an oral hearing in order to present evidence in support of his view on how his injuries should be graded . In particular , the applicant wanted PERSON to be heard concerning the facts on which they based their estimation of the injuries . The applicant also wanted to give an oral statement about the handicaps in his everyday life due to his injuries .", "CARDINAL . ORG requested further written arguments from the insurance company , which objected to an oral hearing . ORG then requested the applicant to present his written observations on the insurance company 's arguments . The applicant submitted further arguments in support of his view on the grading of his injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's claim and his request for an oral hearing , reasoning that the proceedings before it were usually written . It noted that PERSON had already submitted their written statements to ORG and , thus , there was no need for an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) , again claiming a higher ( category CARDINAL ) grading of his injuries . He also requested an oral hearing , repeating his wish to have Drs H. and A. heard as witnesses concerning his disability in movement and standing in order to assess the disability category to which he was entitled . He requested that the latter question be examined from the wider perspective of the condition of the \u201c lower extremities as a whole \u201d and not from the more restricted perspective of the injuries to his heels and ankles .", "CARDINAL . ORG received further observations from the parties regarding their demands and a new medical opinion . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG and rejected the applicant 's request for an oral hearing , reasoning that the procedure in ORG was as a general rule written and that an oral hearing in the present case was unnecessary . It found that given the medical opinions submitted , the applicant 's entitlement to compensation had to be based on the evaluation of the injuries sustained to his heels and ankles , in which assessment it was satisfied with the written medical evidence . ORG maintained that the various medical reports at its disposal were sufficient evidence without the need to have them confirmed under oath . It further noted that the hearing of the applicant in person was not necessary as the decisive factor in the decision - making was the medical reports .", "CARDINAL . There was no appeal against the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The procedure in ORG and ORG is governed by ORG ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslag ; Act no . ORG ) , which entered into force on DATE . Section CARDINAL of the Insurance Court Act ( laki vakuutusoikeudesta , lag on f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended by the Act no . CARDINAL ) , as in force at the relevant time , provided that LAW was to be applied when examining a matter in the ORG unless otherwise stipulated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the new LAW ( vakuutusoikeuslaki , lag om f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) entered into force . Under LAW of the Act the Insurance Court shall hold an oral hearing as provided in LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW of ORG an oral hearing , in which witnesses and experts may be heard and other evidence obtained , shall be held when necessary for establishing the facts of the case . Under LAW an oral hearing must be held if requested by a private party . An oral hearing may however be dispensed with if the application is dismissed without considering its merits or if an oral hearing would be manifestly unnecessary in view of the nature of the matter or for another reason .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Insurance Court Act , as in force at the relevant time , provided that a medical doctor participated in the decision - making in ORG in cases where a medical assessment was deemed necessary .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINALa , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( tapaturmavakuutuslaki , lag om olycksfallsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that inconvenience compensation shall be paid to an employee who , inter alia , has suffered permanent injuries as a result of an accident .", "CARDINAL . NORP The grading of injuries is based on the decision of ORG and Health ( sosiaali- ja terveysministeri\u00f6 , social- och h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rdsministeriet ; decision No . CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; \u201c ORG 's decision \u201d ) , according to which injuries and disabilities are divided into CARDINAL disability categories . The applicable category is determined by choosing an equivalent or comparable injury on the scale of injuries . For example , an amputation of instep bones corresponds to category CARDINAL and an amputation of an ankle or QUANTITY corresponds to category DATE . In cases where the above scale of specific injuries can not be applied , a more general title , for example \u201c the lower extremities as a whole \u201d , may be used . In such a case , minor insufficiency in movement corresponds to category CARDINAL and medium insufficiency category CARDINAL .", "The quality and extent of the injuries are taken into consideration in the assessment . On the other hand , personal circumstances , such as a profession , are not material . The injured person 's abilities are compared with the abilities of a healthy person of the same age ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
