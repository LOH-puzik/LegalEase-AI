BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in the village of PERSON , near the town of PERSON .", "He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "On TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant went to a neighbouring village on business . While on his way back to his home village , he allegedly met a neighbour , PERSON , who was transporting stones in a horsecart . Apparently the applicant and PERSON had for DATE been involved in a property dispute relating to a plot of agricultural land owned by the applicant .", "After that the applicant had lunch in his house and at TIME went to clean the abovementioned plot of land . He saw a pile of stones there and started throwing them out . Then PERSON allegedly tried to enter the applicant \u2019s plot with his cart . The applicant took a pole and tried to hit PERSON horse . According to the applicant \u2019s allegations , at that point PERSON PERSON struck him in the face with a pitchfork and then knocked him on the back of the head with it . The assault left the applicant blinded and bleeding . After that he reportedly heard the noise of a horsecart driving away . There were no other persons present at the scene .", "Some time later Mr NORP and Mr GPE arrived at the scene of the incident . Mr PERSON took the applicant to a hospital . They did not witness the incident , but the applicant told them that PERSON had assaulted him .", "As a result of the pitchfork blow to the face , the applicant lost the sight of both eyes .", "DATE the police opened a preliminary inquiry ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) into the incident and impounded CARDINAL pitchforks from Mr PERSON \u2019s house . They did not apprise the competent prosecutor of the impounding . It seems that in the course of the inquiry Mr PERSON admitted to having hit the applicant .", "Later , a criminal investigation was opened and on an unspecified date in DATE PERSON was charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm on the applicant , contrary to LAW ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) . The investigation authorities interviewed the applicant , CARDINAL witnesses , and PERSON , who denied any wrongdoing .", "A medical expert report drawn up during the proceedings found that the applicant had completely lost the sight in his left eye , and could only distinguish light from dark with his right eye . The report also established that the injuries were consistent with a pitchfork blow as the CARDINAL described by the applicant . The report concluded that the applicant had become permanently blind in both eyes , which amounted to grievous bodily harm , while the other injuries , to his face and the back of his head , were minor .", "On DATE the applicant applied to join the proceedings as a private prosecutor and a civil claimant .", "On an unspecified date the investigator in charge of the case sent the file to ORG with a proposal to indict PERSON ORG", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE a prosecutor of ORG decided to drop the charges against PERSON and discontinue the investigation in respect of him , continuing it against an \u201c unknown perpetrator \u201d . She reasoned that he had denied his guilt and that , apart from the applicant , there were no eyewitnesses who could positively establish the identity of the perpetrator of the offence ; the statements of the witnesses could not fill this lacuna . It followed that the charges could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt , whereas a conviction or even an indictment could not rest on inferences . All possible investigative steps had been taken and no further incriminating evidence had been uncovered . It was true that the police had impounded a pitchfork on DATE of the offence , but it could not be admitted in evidence , as the impounding had not been carried out in accordance with the relevant rules of procedure . According to ORG caselaw , all acts of procedure carried out prior to the institution of criminal proceedings , within the framework of a preliminary inquiry under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) , could exceptionally be considered valid only if they had been undertaken with the knowledge of the competent prosecutor . In the case at hand the competent prosecutor at ORG had not been informed of the impounding either before or immediately after it had been carried out . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) , this omission had compromised the evidence thus obtained . Finally , the prosecutor decided to stay the investigation , as the identity of the perpetrator was unknown .", "In line with LAW of the ORG , as in force at the relevant time ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) , ORG sent a copy of the decision to ORG . On DATE that office confirmed it , citing the same reasons . It added that the impounding had not been carried out in the presence of certifying witnesses , that the scene of the crime had not been preserved , that after the incident of DATE Mr PERSON had not been examined for traces of blood on him , and that he had an alibi , confirmed by CARDINAL witnesses . No other investigative steps were possible .", "A copy of the prosecutor \u2019s decision was sent to ORG . In a decision of DATE it also confirmed the discontinuation , agreeing with the ORG reasoning . The applicant was not notified of the court \u2019s decision .", "After he found out about it , on DATE he lodged an appeal with ORG . On DATE that office dismissed the appeal , informing the applicant that the discontinuation of the proceedings was not subject to appeal . The review procedure was automatic and had already taken place .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to reopen the investigation . In reply , on DATE ORG informed the applicant that following the amendments of the ORG which had come into force on DATE ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) it was not possible to reopen criminal investigations whose discontinuation had been confirmed by a court .", "On DATE the applicant resubmitted his request and as a result on CARDINAL DATE the Chief Prosecutor requested ORG to reopen the criminal investigation . He argued that the decisions to discontinue it were overly formalistic and not sufficiently reasoned , and that the competent authorities had not properly assessed the evidence . In his view , this constituted grounds for reopening under LAW ( CARDINAL ) in conjunction with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) .", "In a judgment of DATE ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b DATE \u0433. , \u043f\u043e \u043d.\u0434. CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. , ORG , ORG \u043d.\u043e. ) ORG rejected the Chief Prosecutor \u2019s request as inadmissible . It noted that reopening had been possible prior to DATE . However , under the amendments to the ORG of that date prosecutors alone had competence to discontinue criminal proceedings . Their decisions were subject to appeal before the respective firstinstance courts , whose decisions were subject to appeal and then to appeal on points of law ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) . The counterpoise of these newly introduced possibilities to appeal had been the withdrawing of the possibility of setting aside the court \u2019s decision by way of reopening . The LAW for the amendment of the ORG contained no provisions allowing judicial decisions confirming discontinuations of criminal investigations under the old system to be reviewed in reopening proceedings .", "No investigative steps were taken DATE in the investigation against an \u201c unknown perpetrator \u201d .", "Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW make it an offence to inflict bodily harm on another . Harm is classified as minor , intermediate or grievous by reference to medical criteria laid down in the second paragraphs of these ORG . Permanent blindness in CARDINAL or both eyes constitutes grievous bodily harm ( LAW ) . Inflicting grievous bodily harm is a publicly prosecutable offence in all cases ( LAW of the Code ) .", "Criminal proceedings for publicly prosecutable offences could be opened only by the decision of a prosecutor or an investigator ( LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG , as in force at the relevant time ) . They had to open an investigation whenever they received information , supported by sufficient evidence , that an offence might have been committed ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "If the investigation authorities did not have enough evidence to institute criminal proceedings and no immediate investigative steps were required , they could carry out a preliminary inquiry ( \u201c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430 \u201d ) to determine whether the institution of criminal proceedings was warranted . The inquiry could be opened by the investigator or the police , who had to inform the competent prosecutor , or be ordered by the prosecutor ( LAW ORG , as in force at the material time ) . The authorities carrying out the inquiry could search the crime scene and impound objects they found there if this was the only opportunity for preserving the evidence . The investigator had to inform the prosecutor about these actions forthwith ( LAW ORG , as in force at the material time ) .", "Evidence which was not gathered in the manner prescribed by the ORG was inadmissible ( LAW ORG ) . According to ORG caselaw , this requirement meant that the results of investigative actions undertaken before the institution of criminal proceedings could be taken into account only if they had taken place in the course of a preliminary inquiry . It followed that the competent prosecutors had to be apprised promptly , so as to be able to exercise their supervisory powers . This was an essential prerequisite for the results of these actions to be taken into account in the ensuing criminal proceedings . The failure to inform the prosecutor had the effect of compromising these actions and the evidence obtained through them ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u044e\u043b\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e ORG DATE \u0433. , ORG , I \u043d.\u043e. ) .", "LAW ORG provided that the victim of an offence who had suffered damage could bring a civil claim in the context of the criminal proceedings . Until DATE such a claim could be lodged even during the preliminary investigation ( LAW ORG , as in force until DATE ) . After that it could be made only after the case had proceeded to trial ( LAW ORG , as in force after DATE ) . The latter position was maintained under LAW DATE Code of Criminal Procedure . Civil claimants are entitled to take part in the proceedings , acquaint themselves with the case file and make copies , adduce evidence , make requests and objections , and challenge the decisions which impinge on their rights and legitimate interests ( LAW ORG and LAW DATE Code ) .", "The DATE Code of Criminal Procedure gave the victims of offences certain rights which do not depend on their joining the proceedings as private prosecutors or civil claimants . Under LAW of this Code , they are entitled to be apprised of their procedural rights , be kept abreast of the progress of the proceedings , if they have so requested , and challenge the decisions to discontinue the proceedings .", "By LAW ORG , as in force until DATE , public prosecutors discontinued proceedings if they found that the charges had not been proven . Paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of that Article , as in force between CARDINAL January CARDINAL and DATE , provided that after the discontinuation the prosecutor had to send the file and his decision to the immediately superior prosecutor \u2019s office , which could confirm , modify or quash it . If it confirmed the decision it had to send the file to the appropriate court , which had to rule in private on the wellfoundedness or otherwise of the discontinuation ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG , as in force at that time ) . Paragraph CARDINAL of that Article provided that the court \u2019s decision was not subject to appeal . No provision was made for the victim of the offence to be notified of the discontinuation .", "Article CARDINAL of the ORG was completely changed with effect from DATE and henceforth provided that the prosecutor \u2019s decision to discontinue the proceedings was to be served on the accused and the victim of the alleged offence . Either of them could then appeal against it to the respective firstinstance court within DATE . The court \u2019s decision was in turn subject to appeal to the higher court within DATE of its delivery ( LAW ORG , as in force DATE and DATE , and LAW ORG ) . The higher court \u2019s decision was then subject to appeal on points of law to ORG , within DATE of its delivery ( LAW ORG , as in force DATE and DATE , and LAW . In DATE the ORG was amended again , following which the firstinstance court \u2019s decision was not subject to appeal .", "Under LAW , the decision of the firstinstance court to uphold the discontinuation of a criminal investigation by the prosecutor is served on the accused and the victim of the offence and is subject to appeal before the higher court , but the latter \u2019s decision is not appealable on points of law ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of that Code ) .", "Article CARDINAL of the ORG enumerated the judicial rulings which could be set aside by way of reopening . In its version DATE and DATE the list included the decisions confirming the discontinuation of a criminal investigation by the prosecutor ( see above ) . The amendment to the ORG which entered into force on DATE ( see above ) removed those decisions from the list , with the result that decisions upholding the discontinuation of a criminal investigation made after its entry into force were not annullable by way of reopening . However , the amendment was silent on the issue whether such decisions made prior to its entry into force were likewise no longer capable of being set aside by way of reopening . The issue was settled in a couple of judgments given by the First and FAC of ORG in DATE : the judgment in the applicant \u2019s case and a judgment delivered DATE , on DATE ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e ORG \u0433. , ORG , I \u043d.\u043e. ) . In both of them the court , after analysing in some detail the amendment \u2019s overall scheme , ruled , against the views of ORG , that decisions made prior to the entry of the amendment into force \u2013 CARDINAL DATE \u2013 could not be set aside by way of reopening . A majority of ORG of the court confirmed this approach in a decision of DATE ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e ORG \u2116 ORG \u0433. , ORG , I \u043d.\u043e. ) , against the dissent of the presiding judge , who was of the view that reopening was still available in respect of decisions made before DATE .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Code of Criminal Procedure provides that judicial decisions upholding the discontinuation of a criminal investigation by the prosecutor are capable of being set aside by way of reopening .", "Requests for reopening are examined by ORG ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG and LAW ) .
