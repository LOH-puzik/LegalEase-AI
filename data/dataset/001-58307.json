Given his attitude to the charges , there is a risk that , if released , he would be tempted to pressurise the victims , and indeed his wife , into retracting their statements . These violent crimes , even if not widely publicised , have caused serious prejudice to public order as far as the protection of children \u2019s physical and psychological well - being is concerned . This prejudice , temporarily contained by remanding the applicant in custody , would recur if he were to be released , particularly as the investigation is almost complete . [ The applicant ] , who is unemployed and has several previous convictions ( for theft , handling stolen goods , misappropriation , driving while under the influence of alcohol and a hit - and - run offence ) , is described as a violent individual who presents a danger both to himself and others , particularly when under the influence of alcohol , and thus can not provide sufficient guarantees that he will appear for trial . It therefore appears necessary to keep the accused in detention on remand in order to prevent him from reoffending , to protect public order from the consequences of these offences and to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

An order was made on DATE extending pre - trial detention for DATE from DATE . On DATE the investigating judge ordered him to be released subject to judicial supervision and on payment , before release , of security in the amount of MONEY . MONEY of that amount was intended to ensure that he appeared for subsequent proceedings and up to a ceiling of MONEY to guarantee payment of \u2018 compensation for the damage caused by the offence , the expenses incurred by the ORG and ORG ; that order was not complied with , since the defendant paid MONEY of the required security ; on DATE the investigating judge dismissed an application by [ W. ] for the judicial supervision order to be discharged in part and extended the pre - trial detention for DATE from CARDINAL DATE , \u2018 subject to activation of the order for his release that was made on condition that a security in the amount of MONEY was paid in NORP ; in an order of DATE , against which the defendant appealed , the pre - trial detention was extended for a further period of DATE with effect from DATE .", "In upholding that order [ extending the pre - trial detention , following non - payment of the sum set by way of security ] , ORG , after referring to the offences with which [ PERSON ] had been charged and to the fact that the order of CARDINAL DATE releasing him subject to judicial supervision had become final , stated : \u2018 The discussion initiated by [ W. ] \u2019s lawyer of the criteria for pre - trial detention has no place here ; it is of no relevance now that the defendant \u2019s release has been ordered subject to judicial supervision and that his detention is being extended as a result of his own acts and therefore does not violate the rules laid down by ORG The Indictment Division added : \u2018 As a subsidiary consideration , his failure to comply with the conditions accepted by him suggests that were he to be released DATE , he would not appear for trial.\u2019", "However , in reaching that decision and not addressing the pleading submitted to it , in which reliance was placed on a violation of LAW of the above - mentioned LAW , according to which everyone arrested or detained is entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial , and in failing to set out the considerations of law and of fact which , under LAW , justified extending pre - trial detention , the rules on which ( as laid down by LAW ) do not provide for any exception , ORG infringed the aforementioned provisions and principle and deprived its decision of a legal basis .", "The decision must therefore be quashed .

The length of his detention had thus been justified neither by the complexity of the case nor by his own conduct .", "In upholding the order appealed against , ORG stated that despite [ ORG denials , there was strong evidence that he had committed the offences with which he was charged ; that detaining him was the sole means of ensuring until the trial that no pressure was brought to bear on witnesses and that the accused , who had no regular employment and no fixed address , appeared for trial ; and that the investigating judge \u2019s refusal of the application for release therefore had to be upheld , notwithstanding the length of time already spent in detention , which had been justified by the difficulties encountered by the judge in carrying out his task and especially in identifying the deceased .", "But by confining itself to referring , in order to justify the length of detention , to an investigative measure carried out by an expert and omitting to address the main arguments in the pleading submitted to it , ORG infringed the principles alluded to above .", "The decision must therefore be quashed .
