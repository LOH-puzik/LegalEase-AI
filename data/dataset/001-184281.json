The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant married ORG and their daughter PERSON was born in DATE . Following the couple \u2019s divorce on DATE , the mother was granted physical custody of the child . As the parents had reached an agreement regulating the applicant \u2019s contact with the child , the visiting rights were not discussed in the divorce proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , the applicant had unhindered opportunity to talk to his daughter on the phone and to take her to his home whenever he wished . After DATE , ORG stopped answering the phone and the only possibility for the applicant to see his daughter was outside her school .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE the applicant instituted contact proceedings before the ORG , as a result of which on DATE a visiting schedule was established in favour of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . DATE N.E.C. appealed , arguing that the applicant had never been prevented from visiting the child but that since the divorce he had not visited her more than once DATE and had not contributed in any way to the continuous medical treatment she required .

On CARDINAL May DATE ORG questioned PERSON and noted :", "\u201c The parents divorced DATE and after that she often used to visit her father up until DATE , when her mother stopped allowing her to answer the phone , because the father only wanted to make [ ORG ] angry . Since then , she can no longer answer the phone and her father has not seen her .", "From her mother \u2019s accounts , she understood that her father was a bad person who caused trouble to [ ORG ] as they both had businesses selling the same products , and her father had taken away her mother \u2019s employees by promising them higher salaries .", "She does not wish to visit her father because that would make her mother upset and she does not want that because she cares a lot about her mother .

In a decision of DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the contact order \u201d ) ORG took note of the GPE agreement as to the visiting schedule and considered that it was beneficial for the child to maintain contact with her father .", "CARDINAL . N.E.C. lodged an appeal on points of law , unhappy that the child would have to go to the applicant \u2019s home . In a final decision of DATE ORG upheld ORG decision . It noted that the child was used to going to her father \u2019s home and continuing this habit would help consolidate their relationship . It found :", "\u201c The consolidation of the relationship between the applicant and the minor by means of complying with ORG decision is even more necessary since , from the report of the interview with the minor , it appears that the minor had been visiting her father after the GPE separation until DATE before the hearing , [ when the mother ] stopped allowing her to talk on the phone with the applicant ; from the same report it appears that the minor does not wish to see her father in order not to upset her mother .", "In these circumstances , the [ ORG ] has correctly decided that the visits should take place in the applicant \u2019s home , in order to allow the normal parental ties to develop and to avoid the possibility of inculcating feelings of hatred towards the father , which would run counter to the child \u2019s harmonious psychological development . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , at the applicant \u2019s request , the bailiff lodged with ORG an application for penalties against ORG , under the provisions of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

On DATE the court ordered ORG to pay a fine of CARDINAL NORP Lei ( RON \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) at the relevant time ) for DATE of non - enforcement of the contact order , starting from the date on which the ORG decision was notified to her . ORG reiterated the findings of the report of CARDINAL DATE concerning the interview with PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and found that the mother was responsible for the failure to enforce the visiting schedule . It found :", "\u201c From the same report it appears that , although the minor likes to visit her father , she does not wish to do so any more because she does not want to upset her mother .", "The court concludes that the non - enforcement of the obligation set down in the contact order is caused exclusively by the debtor and there is no evidence to show that the minor herself would refuse in absolute terms contact with the creditor or that she would manifest aversion towards him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting on an application lodged by the bailiff under LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG fined ORG RON CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL at the relevant time ) for obstructing the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant objected to the stay of execution and asked ORG to compel the bailiff to continue the enforcement proceedings . He also argued that the provisions of the ORG allowing the bailiff to stay the execution while a criminal complaint was ongoing were unconstitutional in so far as it allowed the debtor \u2212 in bad faith \u2212 to stay or obliterate the enforcement efforts and to manipulate the child \u2019s behaviour to the point of rejecting the non - custodial parent . He did not otherwise contest the findings of the bailiff \u2019s report . On DATE the Brezoi ORG dismissed his objection on the grounds that it had become objectively impossible to enforce the court order and that the bailiff had correctly stayed the enforcement once the prosecutor \u2019s office had taken over the case . On DATE the appeal lodged by the applicant was also dismissed as unfounded by ORG . The latter found that the bailiff had complied with all the obligations arising from Articles CARDINAL of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Later on , in its decision no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the constitutional complaint raised by the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to quantify the amount of damages to which he was entitled under LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG maintained that it had been the applicant who had distanced himself from the child and that due to the break - up of the father - daughter relationship it was impossible to comply with the contact order at that time . On DATE ORG ordered ORG to pay the applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL at the relevant time ) . The latter could not obtain this payment as ORG had sold all her possessions and had not declared any fixed income .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the child protection authority to seek a court order for DATE of psychological counselling for his daughter , reiterating that ORG was alienating PERSON from her father .

On DATE the applicant reiterated his request for psychological counselling . In addition , he asked that the relationship between the parties involved be monitored for a period of DATE and that ORG be fined for the delays in executing the contact order . The child protection authority \u2019s inspectors met ORG on four occasions : on CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE , and DATE . Subsequently , in a letter of CARDINAL DATE the authority informed the applicant that ORG had not allowed them to talk with the child about her relationship with her father . The child protection authority advised as follows :", "\u201c In view of the fact that for DATE your relationship with your daughter has only consisted of a few isolated encounters , we consider that reinitiating the fatherdaughter relationship must be done gradually , bearing in mind the child \u2019s wishes , her school programme and her extra - curricular activities . ( ... )", "For the time being , [ ORG ] considers that it is not in the child \u2019s best interest to reinitiate the father - daughter relationship and refuses to lend her support to this end .", "In the light of the above , we consider that it is important for the child that both you and your former spouse try to improve your communication and that you change your current attitude ( complaints before courts and other institutions , enforcement proceedings ( ... ) ) , in order to overcome the conflicts and to offer your daughter the support and reassurance that she requires at this age . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , acting at the prosecutor \u2019s request , the psychologists from the child protection authority assessed M.A. They noted in their report that PERSON refused to see her father because she had been disappointed by the manner in which he had tried to get in touch with her , namely via the authorities , thereby causing upset to her mother . The expert did not consider that counselling for PERSON would be beneficial for re - establishing the relationship between the applicant and his daughter . He recommended psychological support for the parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor decided to terminate the investigation on the grounds that it had not been established beyond any doubt that ORG had acted in such a manner as to repeatedly prevent the applicant from seeing his daughter and that the lack of communication was caused by ORG \u2019s unequivocal wish and will .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to a complaint lodged by the applicant , the prosecutor in chief of the prosecutor \u2019s office upheld the above decision .
