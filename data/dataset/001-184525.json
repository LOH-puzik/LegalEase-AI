On DATE the public prosecutor ordered a temporary measure restraining disposal of property in respect of all the buildings in question . He also added the names of certain individuals to the register of persons prosecuted , including those of the authorised representative of ORG . and the managers and foremen responsible for the building work .

NORP The representatives of ORG . challenged the temporary restraining measure before ORG . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE that court declared the measure null and void and ordered the return of all the buildings to their owners , on the ground that it was not prohibited to build on the site according to the land - use plan .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG acknowledged the illegality of the buildings erected at GPE as they had been built in breach of Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c PERSON no . CARDINAL \u201d ) , which prohibited the granting of planning permission in respect of sites of natural interest , including coastal areas . However , since in the present case the local authority had issued the building permits , and in view of the lack of coordination between Law no .

On DATE the public prosecutor appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG quashed ORG decision without remitting it . It acknowledged the material illegality of the site development plans on the ground that the land in question was subject to an absolute ban on building and to a landscape protection measure , both provided for by law . In that connection , the court noted that at the time the development plans had been adopted ( DATE ) , Regional Law no . DATE on landscape protection had not yet entered into force . Consequently , the applicable provisions in the present case were those of Regional Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ( on land use and development ) and ORG no . DATE ( on landscape protection ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that PERSON no . CARDINAL in fact imposed a prohibition on building within the meaning of section CARDINALowed no derogation , because the site development plans concerned plots of land that were not situated within the city limits .

DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , at the time when the site development plans had been approved , no implementation scheme ( programma di attuazione ) had been in force . In that connection the court referred to its case - law to the effect that an implementation scheme had to be in force at the time of the approval of site development plans ( Court of Cassation , LAW , DATE , PERSON ; DATE , PERSON ; DATE , ORG ) . The reason for this was again according to the case - law \u2013 that once an implementation scheme had expired , a building ban which had been discontinued by the scheme would become effective once again . Consequently , it was necessary to find that the land in question had been subject to a building ban at the time of the approval of the site development plans .", "CARDINAL . ORG further referred to the existence of a landscape protection measure , under section CARDINAL of National Law no . CARDINAL . In the present case , as the competent authorities had not issued a notice of conformity with the requirements of landscape protection ( that is , neither the nulla osta approval issued by the national authorities attesting to such conformity DATE under LAW of PERSON no . DATE nor the prior approval of the regional authorities under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , nor the approval of ORG under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Regional Law no . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG noted that the site development plans concerned only QUANTITY . m , whereas , according to the specifications of the general land - use plan for the city of PERSON , the minimum area was set at QUANTITY . m.", "CARDINAL . In the light of those considerations , ORG thus found that the site development plans and building permits had been illegal . It acquitted the defendants on the grounds that they could not be found to have negligently or intentionally committed offences and that they had made an \u201c unavoidable and excusable mistake \u201d in the interpretation of the regional legislation , which was \u201c obscure and poorly worded \u201d and interfered with the national law . ORG also took into account the conduct of the administrative authorities , and in particular the following facts : on obtaining the building permits , the defendants had been reassured by the director of the relevant municipal office ; the site - protection prohibitions with which the construction project was at odds did not appear in the land - use plan ; and the competent national authority had not intervened . Lastly , ORG found that in the absence of any investigation concerning the reasons for the conduct of the public bodies , it was not possible to speculate on those reasons .", "CARDINAL . In the same judgment ORG ordered the confiscation of all the buildings and plots of land , on the ground that , in accordance with its case - law , the application of section CARDINAL of Law no .

On DATE the applicant company applied to ORG of PERSON seeking the return of its land .

The judge found that the public imperative of protecting land had to prevail over the individual interests .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company appealed on points of law . It emphasised that no construction work had actually been carried out on its land , which had not been the subject of a building permit . By its very nature , it argued , a confiscation measure should be directed solely against land upon which unlawful construction had taken place .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , deposited in the court \u2019s Registry on DATE , ORG , finding that the PERSON preliminary investigations judge had addressed all the points in dispute giving logical and correct reasons , dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal on points of law . The court noted that the confiscation of the applicant company \u2019s land had been compliant with its settled case - law whereby the measure provided for in LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE was a mandatory administrative sanction imposed by the criminal court on the basis of the incompatibility of the situation of the property in question with the legislation on unlawful site development , even where the defendants had been acquitted .

According to the information provided by the parties , in DATE the PERSON municipal authority , having regard to the principles set out and the violations found by ORG in its ORG . and Others judgments ( merits and just satisfaction , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , asked ORG to return the confiscated land to the applicant company . In a decision of DATE the preliminary investigations judge of that court revoked the confiscation measure and ordered the return of the land on account of the fact that , first , the ORG had found a violation of LAW . and Others and , secondly , that the company was to be regarded as a bona fide third party because none of its directors had been found liable for the offence of unlawful site development . The judge \u2019s decision was entered in the land register on DATE and the applicant company was thus able to recover its property on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company had applied to ORG , seeking compensation for the damage it had sustained as a result of the conduct of the PERSON municipal authority and the consequences for the company \u2019s assets . It reproached the municipal authority for : ( CARDINAL ) failing to adopt an alternative to the land - use plan ; ( CARDINAL ) failing to clarify the existence of the constraints arising as to the authorised use of the areas concerned by the site development at issue ; and ( CARDINAL ) approving site development procedures which had apparently been lawful but had led to the confiscation of the land and had caused a significant economic loss .", "According to the information provided by the parties , the proceedings were still pending , as the expert \u2019s report evaluating the damage , estimated at MONEY by the applicant company , had not yet been filed .", "CARDINAL .

In the meantime , on DATE , Regional Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL had entered into force . It removed the possibility of derogating from the prohibition on building near the sea and fixed the minimum distance at QUANTITY for dwellings and QUANTITY for hotels . As regards buildings intended for hotel - type use , such as the hotel - type residential complexes for tourists in the present case , they were to be treated as dwellings . Under the same law , the minimum distance of QUANTITY thus had to be maintained , except in the cases where , before DATE , a site development agreement had already been signed and the infrastructure work had already begun .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG . , which was seeking new partners to optimise the project and share the risks , asked the municipal authority whether the sale of the buildings to third parties was compatible with the development agreement . On DATE the municipal authority stated that the agreement had been drafted clearly enough ; it therefore did not need clarification . It gave a favourable opinion as to the possibility of selling the buildings , but not in single units and provided the intended use of the properties remained unchanged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipal authority , again approached by the applicant company , confirmed the opinion issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At an unknown date , PERSON . entered into a preliminary contract of sale with ORG . concerning part of the land covered by the development agreement and certain buildings erected in the meantime .

On DATE the municipal authority approved the transfer ( voltura ) of the building permit concerning the land and buildings purchased by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , further to a request by ORG . for a planning certificate in respect of the relevant property for the period DATE , the municipal authority stated that the development agreement signed with ORG . and the permits granted were compatible with the planning regulations in force at the material time , and in particular with Regional Law no . DATE , and it therefore considered that the offence of unlawful site development was not made out in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the public prosecutor of ORG opened a criminal investigation in respect of PERSON and PERSON , the legal representatives of the applicant companies . They were suspected of a number of offences , including that of unlawful site development within the meaning of LAW no .

On DATE a court order restraining disposal of property was imposed on the land and buildings .", "DATE . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG returned the land and buildings to their rightful owners .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG acquitted GPE and GPE on the merits in respect of all the offences , with the exception of that of unlawful site development , the prosecution of which was declared statute - barred .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the entry into force of Regional Law no . DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the new minimum distance from the sea introduced therein , ORG took the view that the municipality of GPE should never have issued the building permits and that the previously issued authorisations could not legitimise the situation . The building permits were thus in breach of the law or , at least , ineffective ( inefficaci ) . Although erected in accordance with the permits issued by the municipal authority , the constructions were thus incompatible with the statutory provisions and their existence thus constituted unlawful site development . In addition , the sale of the housing units to individuals cast doubt on their continued use for tourist - hotel purposes and this change of purpose also placed the buildings in breach of the law . In conclusion , ORG ordered the confiscation of the property previously placed under a restraining order and the transfer of ownership to the municipality of GPE within the meaning of section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . As regards , in particular , the charge of fraud , the court took the view that the offence was not made out because there had been no financial loss to the municipality , since the cost of the infrastructure work remained the same even if the intended use changed . In addition , the mental element , that is to say the existence of intent to defraud the municipality , had not been proved in view of the fact that the sale had been carried out as a result of the financial difficulties of ORG . Moreover , the court pointed out that the municipal authority had issued the company with a favourable opinion as regards the sale of the buildings .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld ORG finding of dismissal ( non doversi procedere ) in respect of the offence which was statute - barred and reiterated that the municipality of GPE should not have issued the building permits , which were illegal and in any event ineffective . The constructions erected were de facto incompatible with the regional legislation prohibiting them . In addition , DATE and DATE most of the housing units had been sold off , thus changing their intended use . As to the charge of fraud , ORG upheld the acquittal of the applicant GPE legal representatives on the basis of the same considerations , on this point , as those of ORG . It confirmed the confiscation order .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE and Mr PERSON appealed on points of law but their appeal was dismissed by ORG in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the information provided by the Government , on DATE the individual purchasers of the confiscated property still retained full possession . Shortly before that , on DATE , a resolution of the municipality of GPE had acknowledged the genuine interest of the community in keeping the confiscated complex , referring in particular to the possibility of using the housing to cope with situations of urgency in the event that the local authorities should decide to assign the use of the property , directly or indirectly , for rent by persons with low income .", "CARDINAL . The company PERSON . and Mr PERSON were the coowners , each with a PERCENT interest , of a plot of land at ORG and PERSON ( GPE di GPE ) with a total surface area of CARDINAL sq . m. The land - use plan provided solely for the possibility of building hotel - type residential complexes for tourists on that land .", "DATE . On DATE the applicants applied for a building permit to erect a tourist residential complex consisting of CARDINAL houses and sports facilities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipality of GPE di GPE issued the building permit .", "CARDINAL . After verification by the municipality , a number of variations from the plan were noted . The municipality ordered the suspension of the work on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed an amended plan ( variante in corso GPE ) , which provided for fewer houses ( CARDINAL instead of CARDINAL ) and restricted the construction area . This amended plan sought to regularise the work as already carried out , within the meaning of PERSON no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mayor of GPE di GPE cancelled the order suspending the work on the ground that the discrepancies in relation to the initial construction project could be regularised by means of the amended plan submitted in respect of ongoing work under LAW of PERSON no .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the GPE di ORG acquitted all the defendants on the merits ( perch\u00e9 il fatto non sussiste ) in respect of all the charges , except for the offence of unlawful site development , the prosecution of which it declared statute - barred . The court noted that the project had provided for the construction of residences for hotel - type tourist accommodation . However , the structural specifications of the buildings ( caratteristiche strutturali ) and the evidence suggested that the real purpose of the project was the sale of houses to individuals , thus casting doubt on the intended hotel - type tourist use . This change of purpose rendered the site development unlawful . In conclusion , the court ordered the confiscation of the land and buildings and the transfer of the property to the municipality of GPE di GPE under LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the GPE di ORG acquitted the applicants on the merits ( perch\u00e9 il fatto non sussiste ) in respect of all the charges , including that of unlawful site development . It revoked the confiscation of the property and ordered its return to the owners .", "CARDINAL . ORG took the view , in particular , that the approved project was compatible with the land - use plan and the planning regulations . Given that there had been no preliminary or final contract of sale , there was no evidence of any change in the purpose of the constructions and therefore no unlawful development .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , deposited in the Registry on DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of ORG without remitting it , finding that the change in purpose of the constructions was proved by statements made by third parties and by documents in the file . For ORG , the offence of unlawful site development ( the prosecution of which was statute - barred , entailing the dismissal of the case ) had thus indeed been knowingly committed by the defendants . Consequently , the property in question again became subject to the confiscation order made at first instance by the GPE di ORG . The acquittals were maintained .", "CARDINAL . According to an expert \u2019s report of CARDINAL DATE , the expert having been appointed by the applicants , the complex confiscated from the latter was in an advanced state of abandonment and neglect .
