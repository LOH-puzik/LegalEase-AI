They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON Necatigil and PERSON GPE , lawyers practising in GPE , in the northern part of GPE .", "and as derived from the documents submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants , a NORP couple , purchased a plot of land in DATE in the \u201c GPE \u201d ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) from a private vendor who was the registered owner under the law of the \u201c GPE \u201d . The land is situated in the village of ORG , in the district of GPE . The applicants built a villa there and regularly use the property as their holiday home .", "Mr PERSON ( \u201c the plaintiff \u201d ) , a NORP - Cypriot , claimed ownership of the above land and brought proceedings against the applicants before ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) seeking damages for trespass to his property . He also applied for a demolition order of the villa , swimming pool and fence and for the return of the property .", "On DATE CARDINAL writs were issued in NORP by ORG and served on the second applicant in person at the applicants ' holiday home . She did not sign them . The writs stated that in order to prevent a default judgment an appearance had to be entered before FAC within DATE of service , namely by DATE . The applicants obtained the assistance of a lawyer , PERSON , who agreed to enter an appearance on their behalf on DATE . However , the lawyer did not enter an appearance on DATE . No explanation for this has been given .", "On DATE the plaintiff filed an application for judgment to be entered in default of appearance . On DATE , as no one had entered an appearance for the applicants , ORG gave a default judgment on the plaintiff 's claim . The applicants ' lawyer attended ORG on the above date in order to enter an appearance on behalf of the applicants but judgment had already been entered . The order of ORG required immediate demolition of the villa and other constructions which the applicants had erected on the land and delivery to the plaintiff of free possession of the land . It further required the applicants to refrain from continuing the unlawful intervention on the land . Orders for damages ( special and mesne profits ) and costs were also made .", "On DATE the applicants ' lawyers , PERSON and ORG , entered an appearance on behalf of the applicants and filed an application to have the judgment set aside .", "On DATE , after hearing evidence and arguments from the parties , ORG delivered a judgment dismissing the application .", "In its judgment ORG held , firstly , that it had jurisdiction to try the case as the land in question was situated in the district of GPE which came under its jurisdiction following the merger of that district with the district of GPE in DATE ( relying on/ referring to sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG Law CARDINAL - Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended ; and ORG . CARDINAL in ORG DATE ) . ORG relied on the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( ( merits ) , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINALVI ) as authority that ownership of land in the northern part of GPE remained with its original NORP - Cypriot owners . It noted that the argument that the court should take into account the de facto situation in the north had been put forward and dismissed by the ORG in its judgment in the case of ORG and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . ORG then considered the merits of the application . Relying , inter alia , on the ORG 's judgments in the cases of PERSON v. GPE ( cited above ) and GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIV ) , it held that the plaintiff had not lost his right to his land . It further found that the conduct of the applicants towards the property amounted to trespass and neither \u201c local custom \u201d nor the claim that the applicants had acted in good faith could provide a defence . It noted that ORG . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( \u201c Regulation No . CARDINAL \u201d ) was not applicable in the case as it concerned exclusively the question of the recognition and enforcement of judgments in other jurisdictions and was irrelevant to the question of setting aside the judgment obtained by the plaintiff . ORG concluded that the applicants had failed to show that they had a prima facie or arguable defence and dismissed the application on that ground . Costs were awarded to the plaintiff .", "It appears that due to difficulties faced in serving the applicants ' lawyers , whose offices were in the northern part of GPE , with documents and/or notices of hearings , on DATE , CARDINAL of the applicants ' lawyers , Mr M.A. , informed ORG that he would appoint an office of a colleague in GPE as an office for service and would notify the Registrar of this .", "According to the applicants , on DATE , a bailiff of ORG telephoned the office of one of the applicants ' lawyers and asked them to contact the court to pick up the date for the appeal before ORG . According to the applicants a message was left with the secretary . The applicants submit that no written notification was sent to their lawyers and that , on DATE , CARDINAL of their lawyers , Mr M.A. , happened to be at ORG representing other clients and was called in by a ORG judge to appear for the applicants at the hearing . The applicants state that this was the first time that Mr PERSON had heard of the date of the appeal .", "The appeal was heard on the above date .", "The verbatim record of the hearing reports the following submissions by the applicant 's lawyer ( translation ) :", "\u201c Mr PERSON : please there is no need for translation as I understand and speak the NORP language . It would therefore be a waste of time .", "Your honour Mr President , your honours , at this stage I do not wish to waste the ORG 's time and I will simply adopt the outline of my address .", "The only thing I wish to add is that the ORG , ORG , had this case at an unfortunate time when there was no arrangement as to whether the retainers would be in the NORP , LANGUAGE or LANGUAGE ( language ) . As you will see in the file before us , we asked for the same facility in this ORG too . In the end we agreed that it would be in the NORP language . It was a time immediately after the opening of the roadblocks when cases of such a nature came before the ORG in GPE and the Registrar had his doubts . I remember asking whether the retainer would be in LANGUAGE and they told us that the authorities of the Republic use only the NORP and NORP language . I brought a retainer before DATE in LANGUAGE , those we had in our Court and consequently there was a period of confusion . And I am sure that this confusion led to the decision that the ORG gave in these circumstances in the wrong exercise of its discretion .", "All this case is based on the case of Wella and I argue and submit that her honour the judge in the lower ORG approached it wrongly . Thank you . \u201d", "Following the submissions of the plaintiff 's lawyer , ORG reserved judgment .", "Subsequently , on DATE the applicants ' lawyers sought to file an amended notice of appeal before ORG . In particular , in a letter dated DATE , the applicants requested ORG to hold DATE hearing so that all relevant principles of ORG law could be examined ; reminded ORG that it had a duty , under LAW establishing ORG to consider all relevant principles of ORG law ; and , lastly , relying on LAW expressed the view that the hearing of DATE had not afforded sufficient time for the examination of the complicated questions of ORG law that arose in the case . To their letter the applicants attached a detailed memorial and a copy of the judgment of ORG of GPE .", "The applicants stated that they had not been permitted to file the aforementioned documents . On DATE , however , the clerk at the Registry informed them that although the documents would not be formally accepted they would be shown to the judges .", "In the meantime the court had fixed the case for judgment for DATE . On that date , immediately before judgment was delivered , the verbatim record reports the following exchange as having taken place ( translation ) :", "\u201c Court : DATE we fixed the case for judgment . Mr M.A. , you are submitting an application , which has not been of course translated but you have made a letter in LANGUAGE . If I understand correctly you wish to file amended grounds of appeal and reopen the case ? The case has finished and has been reserved . Will you file an application for amended grounds of appeal at this stage ?", "Mr PERSON : We will withdraw this application .", "Court : There are decisions that at this stage after judgment has been reserved the case is not reopened unless the ORG itself requires any clarification .", "We will ignore this application and proceed to deliver judgment . The judgment is unanimous . The judgment will be given by Judge PERSON .", "Mr PERSON : We do not need a translator . We waive the right for translation in NORP . \u201d", "ORG then delivered its judgment dismissing the appeal . With regard to the issue of jurisdiction the court noted the following :", "\u201c At the beginning of the address of learned counsel for the appellants , argumentation was put forward which aimed to show that the first instance court did not have jurisdiction or territorial competence to try the case before it . The issue of the jurisdiction of the first instance court was raised before us also by learned counsel for the respondent , who indeed invited this court to refer the issue of jurisdiction to ORG as a preliminary legal point . Following the observation made by our ORG that the issue of jurisdiction is not raised in the present appeal as it does not constitute any of the grounds of appeal , learned counsel for the respondent abandoned in essence his original suggestion . We do not intend to examine the question of jurisdiction or territorial competence of the first instance court as this matter is not raised in the appeal and is not a ground of appeal . It is correct that the matter of jurisdiction can be raised at any stage of the proceedings and can be raised ex proprio motu by the ORG , but in the present case it is not raised in the grounds of appeal and our ORG does not consider it useful to raise it on its own initiative . \u201d", "In the meantime , on DATE , the plaintiff applied under Regulation No . CARDINAL for recognition and enforcement in GPE of the judgments of ORG ; namely , ( i ) the default judgment of DATE and ( ii ) the judgment of DATE .", "On DATE Master PERSON ordered that the above judgments be registered in and be declared enforceable pursuant to the above Regulation .", "The applicants brought a successful challenge against that order before ORG under LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . By order dated DATE Mr Justice PERSON allowed the appeal and set aside the registration of the CARDINAL judgments . The applicants were successful on CARDINAL grounds . The first was that PERSON Justice PERSON considered that the effect of LAW No . QUANTITY Act of Accession , was that the acquis , and therefore Regulation No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , were of no effect in relation to matters which related to the northern part of GPE . Hence , the plaintiff could not rely on the acquis in order to secure the recognition of the judgments he had obtained . In this respect , he noted , however , that the land was within the territory of GPE and that the case law of the ORG showed that the \u201c GPE \u201d laws could not be relied on by the applicants to deprive the plaintiff of his title to the land . The second ground arose from the circumstances in which service of the original proceedings was effected and the time that was permitted for entry of an appearance to the proceedings . He granted permission to appeal to ORG .", "The plaintiff lodged an appeal under LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL to ORG ) ( GPE and GPE ) .", "By order dated DATE ORG referred to ORG ( \u201c ECJ \u201d ) for a ruling on the issues raised , CARDINAL questions being specified in the schedule to the order . The questions , in sum , concerned , firstly , the application of Regulation No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL to a judgment relating to claims to the ownership of land situated in the northern area of GPE , in view of suspension of the application of the acquis communautaire in that area pursuant to LAW No . CARDINAL ; and , secondly , the interpretation of Articles CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of Regulation No . CARDINAL with regard to the possible grounds for non - recognition and non - enforcement within the meaning of these provisions .", "Following an oral hearing before the ECJ , Advocate General PERSON delivered an opinion on DATE . In her view LAW No . CARDINAL and Articles CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of Regulation No . CARDINAL did not constitute grounds for refusal of recognition or enforcement of the default judgment . With regard to LAW Advocate General PERSON concluded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ) of Regulation No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL is to be interpreted as meaning that recognition and enforcement of a default judgment may not be refused by reference to irregularities in the service of the document which instituted the proceedings , if it was possible for the defendant , who initially failed to enter an appearance , to commence proceedings to challenge the default judgment , if the courts of the State where the judgment was given then reviewed the judgment in full and fair proceedings , and if there are no indications that the defendant 's right to a fair hearing was infringed in those proceedings . \u201d", "On DATE , ORG ) gave judgment . It ruled as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The suspension of the application of the acquis communautaire in those areas of GPE in which the Government of that Member ORG does not exercise effective control , provided for by LAW No . CARDINAL on GPE to the LAW concerning the conditions of accession [ to ORG ] of ... GPE ... and the adjustments to the Treaties on which ORG is founded , does not preclude the application of ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters to a judgment which is given by a NORP court sitting in the area of the island effectively controlled by ORG , but concerns land situated in areas not so controlled .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Regulation No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL does not authorise the court of a Member ORG to refuse recognition or enforcement of a judgment given by the courts of another Member ORG concerning land situated in an area of the latter ORG over which its Government does not exercise effective control .", "CARDINAL . The fact that a judgment given by the courts of a Member ORG concerning land situated in an area of that ORG over which its Government does not exercise effective control , can not , as a practical matter , be enforced where the land is situated does not constitute a ground for refusal of recognition or enforcement under LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and it does not mean that such a judgment is unenforceable for the purposes of LAW that regulation . \u201d", "Further , the ECJ found , unlike ORG , that LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL , could not legitimately be relied upon to refuse recognition or enforcement of a default judgment as the applicants had been able and did commence proceedings to challenge the default judgment of ORG . In particular , the ECJ stated as follows :", "CARDINAL . The recognition or enforcement of a default judgment can not be refused under Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Regulation No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL where the defendant was able to commence proceedings to challenge the default judgment and those proceedings enabled him to argue that he had not been served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with the equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence . \u201d", "ORG then gave judgment on DATE in favour of the plaintiff . It first noted that the answers of the ECJ to the questions put were such that , subject to the further issues raised before it , the appeal should be allowed and the orders of PERSON registering and declaring enforceable the NORP judgments reinstated . It then went on to examine the CARDINAL issues raised by the applicants for determination . These concerned the denial of enforcement on the basis of public policy and the possibility that the ruling of the ECJ was affected by the apparent bias of the President of that court and whether further questions on these matters should be referred to the ECJ . ORG found firstly , that there was no public policy applicable in GPE to which the recognition and enforcement of the judgments of the NORP court would be manifestly contrary and secondly , that there was no appearance of bias on the part of the President of the ECJ . It therefore considered that no reference on the above issues should be made to the ECJ .", "From a letter dated DATE sent to the ORG by the applicants ' lawyers it appears that the applicants have filed an appeal before ORG of GPE and that their application for stay of execution of ORG judgments was refused .", "\u201c CARDINAL .
