LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Guido Raimondi;Kristina Pardalos;Nona Tsotsoria", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Elijus NORP , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE a prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings in a case where a hostage had been taken in the territory of GPE , then removed and held in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and questioned as a suspect in that case . On DATE he was charged with taking a hostage and remanded in custody .", "On DATE the prosecutor ordered that the applicant be released from custody on bail .", "On DATE the prosecutor informed the applicant that a milder remand measure \u2013 the obligation not to leave his place of residence DATE would be imposed on him .", "On DATE the prosecutor of ORG office discontinued the pre - trial investigation with regard to the applicant since the prosecution of the crime had become time - barred . The authorities also revoked the obligation for the applicant not to leave his place of residence .", "The applicant appealed , arguing that the criminal proceedings in his case had been protracted and that the prosecutors , not being able to collect evidence against him , had been stalling the pre - trial investigation until the prosecution would become time - barred . Moreover , whilst the pre - trial investigation had been pending , he was obliged not to leave his place of residence and therefore could not travel , search for a job or participate in employment competitions . The applicant requested the prosecutors to reopen the pre - trial investigation and to discontinue his case on rehabilitation grounds .", "By a ruling of DATE , the prosecutor dismissed the applicant \u2019s request as unfounded . The prosecutor observed that the case was complicated as it involved CARDINAL suspects and a crime which had been committed in the territories of CARDINAL States \u2013 GPE and GPE . It followed that the length of the pre - trial investigation was reasonable and did not violate the applicant \u2019s right to a trial within a reasonable time . The prosecutor also observed that the crime had been committed in DATE and that the national law provided for a DATE term to prosecute it . Therefore it had been correctly decided to discontinue the pre - trial investigation as having become time - barred .", "The applicant appealed .", "On DATE the Panev\u0117\u017eys City District Court found that the domestic law indeed provided for a possibility to discontinue the criminal proceedings as being time - barred . It observed , however , that a person \u2019s guilt could be established only by a judgment of a court . By discontinuing the criminal proceedings as time - barred the applicant had been left accused of a crime with all the legal and moral consequences stemming from that . As under the domestic law the pre - trial judge could not himself discontinue the criminal proceedings on rehabilitation grounds , ORG returned the case to the prosecutor and ordered him to rectify the situation .", "On DATE the prosecutor again discontinued the pre - trial investigation with regard to the applicant on the ground that the prosecution had become time - barred . The applicant appealed .", "On DATE ORG , having examined the evidence collected during the pre - trial investigation , decided that there was no proof that the applicant had committed the crime with which he had been charged . Consequently , the pre - trial investigation in respect of the applicant had to be discontinued by way of acquittal . GPE further noted that even though on DATE the case had been returned to the prosecutor , the latter failed to perform any actions for DATE and had ignored the court \u2019s ruling by repeating his original decision . The court decided that , in order to avoid further delays , it was competent to resolve the question itself , and ruled that the pre - trial investigation of the applicant had been discontinued on the ground that no crime had been committed .", "The prosecutor challenged the decision , lodging a petition to the President of ORG .", "On DATE the President of ORG adopted the final procedural decision and dismissed the appeal .", "The applicant instituted proceedings for non - pecuniary damage against GPE . He argued that from DATE to CARDINAL DATE he had been a suspect in a criminal case , the proceedings lasted unduly long and therefore caused him great moral suffering . The applicant claimed MONEY ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) in non - pecuniary damages and LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) which he paid for his defence in criminal proceedings .", "In a decision of DATE the ORG relied on LAW and LAW and granted the applicant \u2019s claims in part . The court found that when instituting criminal proceedings and charging the applicant the authorities followed the law . Moreover , the rules of criminal procedure were observed when remand measures \u2013 detention , bail , obligation not to leave his place of residence DATE were imposed on the applicant . ORG found , however , that the pre - trial investigation in the applicant \u2019s case had not been conducted with sufficient intensity and speediness , too few procedural actions had been performed and none at all for certain rather long periods . In contrast , no actions of the applicant that would have contributed to the length of proceedings were established . As a result , there was a breach of the applicant \u2019s right to a trial within a reasonable time , enshrined in LAW .", "As to the non - pecuniary damage award , the first instance court acknowledged that the criminal proceedings at issue had caused the applicant much distress . The applicant was dismissed from his job and negatively portrayed in the press . His situation was further compounded by the length of the proceedings , the serious nature of the charges against him and the fact that he had to endure various remand measures . Those negative repercussions extended to the applicant \u2019s family members . In the light of the above and having considered the practice of ORG , the ORG deemed it equitable to award the applicant a sum of LTL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) for non - pecuniary damage he had sustained . Moreover , noting that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were discontinued on rehabilitation grounds , the court also decided that the ORG should cover the applicant \u2019s defence costs in the sum of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "On DATE ORG upheld the above decision , fully concurring with the first instance court to the effect that the length of the criminal proceedings was not justified . The award for non - pecuniary damage remained at LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The appellate court however lowered the sum for the applicant \u2019s legal costs by LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL , because it was established that those costs were incurred on DATE that is DATE after the criminal proceedings had been discontinued .", "The applicant submitted an appeal on points of law ; however , by a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to examine it as raising no important legal issues .", "On DATE ORG ordered a bank to transfer to the applicant the sum of LTL CARDINAL , in \u201c compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage \u201d .", "Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code allows a civil claim for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage , in view of the unlawful actions of the investigating authorities or court , in the context of a criminal case . The provision envisages compensation for an unlawful conviction , an unlawful arrest or detention , the application of unlawful procedural measures of enforcement . According to recent domestic case - law , this provision may also allow claims for damages arising from the excessive length of criminal proceedings ( see FAC , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "The court practice also provides that on the basis of the above legal norm civil liability of the ORG arises irrespective of whether there was guilt of the investigating authorities or court . For the liability to arise it is sufficient that the LOC actions ( inaction ) would be unlawful , that they had caused damage and there must also be a causal link between those actions ( inaction ) and damage ( ORG ruling of CARDINAL DATE in civil case no . ORG - CARDINAL/CARDINAL and the ruling of CARDINAL DATE in civil case no . ORG - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Furthermore , LAW is to be applied directly \u2013 a court must apply it in a civil case for damages irrespective of whether a procedural measure , which the plaintiff alleges has caused damage , had ever been challenged in criminal proceedings ( ORG ruling of DATE in civil case no . CARDINALK-CARDINAL - DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
