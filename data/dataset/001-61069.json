On DATE the investigating judge made orders for a nationwide search to be made for A.U.A. and for the child \u2019s immediate return to its mother . Subsequently , the first applicant also made criminal complaints against various members of LOC \u2019s family who , she said , had assisted in her son \u2019s abduction .", "CARDINAL . During the investigation , the first applicant requested PERSON investigating judge no . CARDINAL to monitor calls on LOC \u2019s mobile telephone and to interview members of ORG \u2019s family . In a decision of DATE , the investigating judge turned down both requests , the former on the ground that there was no evidence that the mobile telephone number that had been given was LOC \u2019s and the latter because the first applicant had not given precise details of the questions she wished to be put to her former husband \u2019s relatives . The first applicant also asked the investigating judge for a search to be carried out at the registered office of a company belonging to LOC that was responsible for administering his property in his absence , and for the examination of a vehicle he had used to leave GPE . The judge again refused .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant asked the judge to issue an international search and arrest warrant against A.U.A. , but in an order of CARDINAL DATE , he declined , stating :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . As regards the international search and arrest warrant , the offences of coercion and extortion have not been made out . It is debatable whether there has been an offence of criminal contempt , since it has not been proved that the person concerned was ordered to comply with the judgment of the family court and warned that he was liable to commit this offence . In addition , since this offence ( LAW ) only carries a prison sentence of DATE , an international search and arrest warrant is not justified , [ especially ] as the conduct complained of appears to come within Article CARDINAL of LAW , which characterises it as a minor offence .", "...", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , it should be noted that the requested procedural steps are neither lawful , nor adapted to the aim pursued , and must therefore be refused pursuant to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Investigative steps are taken in order to establish whether an offence has been committed .

A wanted notice has been issued for LOC nationally . As soon as he has been traced , final provision CARDINAL of Institutional Law no . CARDINAL of DATE on the legal protection of minors can be applied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE , the investigating judge also examined whether a person could be prosecuted for the abduction of a minor for whom he had joint parental responsibility . He found that this was not possible under the case - law , as the only offences that could be committed in such circumstances were criminal contempt and extortion . In a further order dated DATE the investigating judge reiterated that no international search and arrest warrant could be issued for the suspected offence of criminal contempt , for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... As regards an international search and arrest warrant against A.U.A. , this issue was resolved by LAW in its decision of DATE . No new facts have emerged since then that would justify reclassifying the offence . Under no circumstances can it amount to \u2018 false imprisonment\u2019 , as the judgment of DATE on the abduction of minors makes clear . In that judgment , the court held : \u2018 The fact that a father has taken his minor child with him solely in order to enjoy its company can not amount to the offence of child abduction\u2019 ...", "Lastly , as to the suspected offence of criminal contempt , no international search and arrest warrant can be issued as it is not an offence that comes within the extradition treaties . Consequently , ORG would not act on such a warrant , as it would not be valid in law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the first applicant was dismissed by FAC on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant sought amparo relief under LAW ( right to a fair hearing ) , CARDINAL ( right to life and mental and physical integrity ) and CARDINAL ( right to liberty and security ) of the LAW , and LAW on the Rights of the Child of DATE . In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed her appeal as manifestly ill - founded , holding that she had not stated why she disagreed with the reasoned decisions of the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the investigation , on DATE , ORG investigating judge no . CARDINAL issued a provisional discharge order dismissing the charges against A.U.A. However , he renewed the orders for a nationwide search for A.U.A. and the order freezing his assets . He also made a final order dismissing the charges against the members of LOC \u2019s family who had been implicated by the first applicant . The reason given by the judge for making the provisional discharge order in respect of A.U.A. was that the latter \u2019s absence from GPE had prevented his being questioned or formally charged in accordance with LAW of LAW . An appeal by the first applicant was dismissed by FAC on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant lodged an amparo appeal against those decisions with ORG , in which she alleged violations of LAW ( right to liberty and security ) , taken together with Articles CARDINAL ( rights to private life and family privacy ) , CARDINAL ( right to a fair hearing ) and DATE ( social , economic and legal protection of the family and children ) of the LAW . She also relied on LAW . In her appeal , she complained in particular of the investigating judge \u2019s systematic refusal to issue an international search warrant for her child , a refusal which , she said , was in breach of the positive duty to protect children and families . She also alleged a violation of LAW of DATE , which requires GPE to take measures to combat the illicit transfer and non - return of children abroad . In her submission , by refusing to take any investigative steps , the investigating judge had directly infringed both her and her son \u2019s right to private and family life , and her right to judicial protection , as guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the amparo appeal as unfounded , holding that the first applicant had confined herself to contesting the decisions of the criminal courts which , in reasoned and well - founded decisions , had decided to make a provisional discharge order in respect of her criminal complaint of child abduction , while renewing certain preventive measures .", "CARDINAL . In connection with an appeal by the first applicant to FAC against one of his decisions , investigating judge no . CARDINAL said in a report to FAC on DATE :", "\u201c ... The purpose of criminal proceedings is to prosecute the offence and , if appropriate , to punish the perpetrators . However , an investigating judge can not , under any circumstances , allow himself to be manipulated by a woman driven by jealousy or hatred against her former husband \u2019s family and take a series of procedural measures that serve no purpose other than to inconvenience third parties uninvolved in the proceedings . In the present case , all that has been proved so far is that A.U.A. did not return his son GPE to his mother at the end of the period he was allowed by the family court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An application for an order requiring investigating judge no . CARDINAL to stand down was dismissed in a decision of DATE . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , an application for the proceedings to be declared null and void was likewise dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG withdrew parental responsibility from LOC and awarded the first applicant full parental responsibility . It gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c ... Having considered the evidence , the ORG has decided to grant the applicant \u2019s application . ... the case file shows that , after continually failing to comply with the access arrangements ( see this ORG \u2019s decision of DATE ) , the respondent did not return the child to its mother at DATE stipulated in the decision of DATE . Furthermore , since DATE , the whereabouts of both father and child have been unknown , which means that the child has been removed from the applicant \u2019s custody in breach of a court order . Such conduct can only be described as very serious , as it has entailed the cruel and abrupt removal of the child from the family background in which it was being happily brought up , thereby depriving it both now and then of its mother \u2019s love and protection ... at the most tender of ages , with the serious harm which that entails ... Thus , by putting his own interests before those of his child , [ A.U.A. ] has acted in a manner that is seriously detrimental to the child \u2019s welfare ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to a psychologist \u2019s report produced by the first applicant in DATE , LOC first made contact with her through a telephone call in which he imposed various conditions for the child \u2019s return , threatened her and used the prospect of her not seeing her son again as blackmail . On DATE the first applicant lodged a criminal complaint against A.U.A. alleging threatening behaviour and coercion . On DATE Vigo investigating judge no . CARDINAL made a provisional discharge order . On an appeal by the first applicant , that order was quashed by FAC in a decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant saw her son for the first time since his abduction in DATE . On DATE A.U.A. voluntarily appeared before the investigating judge , who , after hearing his representations , decided not to order his detention pending trial . Finally , on DATE the first applicant was able to recover her child with police assistance on LOC \u2019s return to ORG with the child . She said that for a time she was forced to go into hiding with her son in a shelter for women .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted A.U.A. access .
