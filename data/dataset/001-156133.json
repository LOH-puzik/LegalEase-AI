The applicants are Mr PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) and PERSON ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is also the second applicant \u2019s authorised representative . The second applicant is a limited liability company based in GPE . Both applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr M. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the second applicant bought a cargo ship ( teretni brod ) outside of GPE . This ship \u2019s estimated worth was MONEY ( \u201c EUR \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant , acting on behalf of the second applicant , retained the services of a forwarding company ( \u0161pediter ) , which company specialised in customs - related matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the forwarding company filed a declaration with the customs authorities , supplementing it with the relevant documentation provided by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( carinarnica ) , having , inter alia , heard a number of witnesses , established that the ship had been improperly classified ( svrstan pod pogre\u0161ni tarifni stav ) , as a sea - going vessel , which classification , in turn , implied that no customs duty would be payable . The forwarding company and its authorised representative , as well as the applicants in the present case , were thus found guilty of a customs offence ( cariski prekr\u0161aj ) and fined in accordance with the relevant legislation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In particular , the first and the second applicants were ordered to pay MONEY ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) respectively , whilst the forwarding company and its authorised representative were fined in the amount of ORG CARDINAL in that order . ORG noted that its own classification of the ship , as primarily a river - going vessel , was based on the assessment of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL expert organisations which had submitted opposing opinions during the proceedings . ORG also referred to an attesting declaration , issued by the NORP authorities and provided by the applicants themselves , to the effect that the ship was \u201c suitable for sailing on the LOC , between GPE and the open sea \u201d . In any event , the head of ORG , at CARDINAL point , recommended that the ship be classified as a river - going one , but the applicants refused to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG finansija ) partly accepted the appeals filed by the CARDINAL defendants , and in so doing amended the fines imposed at first instance . In particular , the first and second applicants were ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL , ( approximately EUR CARDINAL and EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL at that time ) , respectively , whilst the forwarding company and its authorised representative were fined less , i.e. RSD CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and EUR CARDINAL at that time ) respectively . ORG stated that the reason for this distinction was that the forwarding company had merely complied with the applicants\u2019 request for the improper classification of the ship in question , as established on the basis of a witness statement given in the course of the proceedings . Also , ORG accepted that there was no intent on the part of the applicants to deceive the authorities , which was why they were found guilty under LAW , an offence not requiring the existence of such intent but rather the mere failure to provide accurate information upon submission of a customs declaration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law ( zahtev za vanredno preispitivanje pravosna\u017enog re\u0161enja ) , which appeal was supplemented on DATE , DATE and DATE . Therein , the applicants maintained , inter alia , that : ( a ) although ORG had taken into account CARDINAL expert opinions regarding the classification of the ship , it had accepted , without proper explanation , CARDINAL opinion and effectively given no credence to the other ; ( b ) they had had no expertise to navigate their way through the complex customs proceedings , which was why they had hired the forwarding company to deal with this issue ; and ( c ) the impugned decisions of the customs authorities had been inconsistent with their decisions in other similar cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) ruled on the ORG appeal on points of law . The first applicant \u2019s claims were rejected as inadmissible ( odba\u010deni ) , since the amount of the fine imposed in his case was below the statutory threshold of FAC ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , whilst the second applicant \u2019s claims were considered on their merits and rejected ( odbijeni ) . ORG endorsed the reasoning contained in the impugned decisions issued by the administrative authorities . The applicants received ORG judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was granted the possibility to pay the fine in DATE instalments , and by DATE the fine was paid in full .", "CARDINAL . The above - described proceedings were conducted on the basis of LAW DATE , as amended in DATE , as well as LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE ORG and ORG ( PERSON kasacioni sud ) , applying LAW , issued CARDINAL decisions in respect of situations broadly similar to that of the applicants . Specifically , they noted that it was the responsibility of the importer to provide accurate documentation to the forwarding company and the forwarding company \u2019s duty to properly classify the goods in the customs declaration . No intent to deceive the authorities was deemed necessary for the existence of the said offence . In CARDINAL of these cases the importers were , ultimately , acquitted or formally cautioned ( opomenuti ) , without being fined , whilst in the remaining CARDINAL cases they were fined in accordance with the applicable legislation ( see , for example , re\u0161enja PERSON finansija od CARDINAL . septembra DATE . i CARDINAL . januara DATE , P\u017ec nos .
