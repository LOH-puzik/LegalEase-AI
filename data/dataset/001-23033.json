FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "Until DATE , at the time of retirement a person was granted , inter alia , ( a ) an employment pension which was counted on the basis of his or her salary earned prior to the retirement , amounting to a maximum of CARDINAL per cent of that salary , and ( b ) a national pension \u2019s basic amount ( kansanel\u00e4kkeen pohjaosa , folkpensionens basdel ) , if the person was entitled thereto on the basis of his age and/or number of DATE of employment .", "DATE , employees were obliged by law to deposit part of their salaries in individual accounts kept by ORG for the purpose of accumulating employment pensions for their retirement . From DATE onwards these contributions were no longer deposited on accounts earmarked for the employees themselves but went into the general pension fund .", "The CARDINAL parts of the pension ( the above - mentioned ( a ) and ( b ) ) were combined together with the result that a pensioner \u2019s employment pension was reduced by the amount of the national pension \u2019s basic amount so that the total amount of the pensions did not exceed the maximum limit of CARDINAL per cent of his salary . The national pension \u2019s basic amount was granted to all persons entitled to it without their requesting it ( although it was apparently possible to refuse it ) , reducing automatically the amount of the employment pension .", "In DATE LAW was amended as a budgetary savings measure to the effect that , as from DATE , the national pension such as the old - age pension was to be replaced by a pension calculated with reference to new criteria . Those whose total income in the form of other pensions and various entitlements exceeded certain ceilings would no longer be entitled to a national pension . In such a case the so - called basic amount of their national pension would be reduced by MONEY annually DATE , when payment thereof would cease ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Following a public debate on the matter ORG passed LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on DATE , according to which pensioners whose employment pension has been twice reduced on the basis of their national pension \u2019s basic amount , are entitled to receive a compensation for their loss as from DATE . The compensatory amount will be CARDINAL per month , depending on the amount of the pension at issue .", "On DATE the applicant was granted an employment pension as from DATE . DATE he was also granted , without requesting it , a national pension \u2019s basic amount which was FIM CARDINAL ( MONEY ) per month . The CARDINAL parts of his pension were considered together with the result that his employment pension was reduced by ORG DATE , since the total amount of the pensions was not to exceed the maximum limit ( MONEY of the salary on which the pension was based ) .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s pension was changed into an old - age pension .", "In DATE , after some index - linked increases had been granted to the applicant \u2019s pension , his national pension \u2019s basic amount was FIM CARDINAL ( MONEY per month ) . As a result of the entry into force of the LAW , the applicant \u2019s national pension \u2019s basic amount was again reduced until it ceased to exist in DATE . The applicant now receives only a pension which is MONEY of the salary on which his pension was originally based .", "The applicant has used all domestic remedies ( CARDINAL appeal instances decisions submitted , the final ones given by ORG in DATE ) . According to the decisions of the domestic courts , it is impossible to revoke the reduction of the pensions which is based on the amendment to LAW as the courts can not override a law .", "As a result of LAW of DATE , the applicant in the present case will be awarded the full MONEY per month in compensation for his loss as from DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
