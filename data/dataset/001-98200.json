After it had collected certain information from various administrative authorities , the ORG established that the daughters had been recorded in the register of births ( matica ro\u0111enih ) on DATE and in the register of citizens and the domicile register on DATE , and that their health insurance cards were valid from CARDINAL DATE . Against that background the ORG reasoned as follows :", "\u201c From the printout of the database [ of insured persons ] the second - instance authority has established that [ the appellant \u2019s claim that her daughters ] ORG GPE were insured \u2018 through the mother\u2019 is not correct because their status as persons insured with ORG was recognised on DATE with the registration date of DATE as family members of the insurance holder : [ their grandmother ] S.\u0160.", "The case file shows that the twins ORG at the time of their medical treatment in GPE did not have the status of insured persons with ORG , owing to the appellant \u2019s failure to notify FAC in GPE of the birth of the children ; whereas all the necessary notifications were made only after the first - instance decision had been adopted .", "Pursuant to LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the Ordinance on Rights Related to Compulsory Health Insurance and the Criteria for their Enjoyment ... the status of an insured person is established by ORG on the basis of the prescribed application [ for registration ] ...", "The insured person acquires the rights related to compulsory health insurance on DATE their status as an insured person is established .", "Section CARDINAL of the Ordinance on the Criteria for Registration and Deregistration of an Insured Person requires legal and natural persons to apply for [ registration with ] the compulsory health insurance with the ORG \u2019s competent regional office within DATE after the conditions for recognition as an insured person have been met .", "Section CARDINAL of the same Ordinance allows for the status of family member [ as the ground for insurance ] to be established only in respect of persons having their domicile or habitual residence in GPE .", "The enclosed domicile certificates show ... that ORG have their domicile in PERSON , ... DATE from DATE , that is , after the adoption of the [ impugned first - instance ] decision , after which they were also registered with compulsory health insurance ...", "[ In the light of the ] foregoing the ... arguments adduced by the appellant are unfounded ... \u201d", "The applicant then brought an action in ORG ( ORG ) challenging the second - instance decision .", "On DATE ORG dismissed her action . It held as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL of the Ordinance on the Criteria for Registration and Deregistration of an Insured Person and ORG of the Person Insured under Compulsory Health Insurance requires natural persons to apply for compulsory health insurance with the ORG \u2019s competent regional office within DATE of the conditions for recognition as an insured person having been met .", "Under LAW paragraph CARDINAL point QUANTITY of GPE and the Criteria for their Enjoyment ... the status of an insured person is established from the date of birth , on the basis of the application [ for registration ] .", "However , section CARDINAL of the Ordinance on LAW ... allows the status of a family member [ as the ground for insurance ] to be established only in respect of persons having their domicile or habitual residence in GPE , unless an international agreement provides otherwise .", "Since it was established during the proceedings ... that at the time of their medical treatment abroad the ... twins did not have the status of insured persons with the ORG in accordance with section CARDINAL of the Ordinance on the Rights Related to Compulsory Health Insurance and the Criteria for their Enjoyment , it follows that , according to section CARDINAL of that GPE , they did not have the right to healthcare nor the right to reimbursement [ of costs of medical services rendered abroad . ]", "In the light of the foregoing , this court has no legal possibility to find the impugned decision unlawful . \u201d", "The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint alleging violations of her constitutional rights to equality , judicial review of administrative decisions , a fair hearing and healthcare .

Therefore , when reaching the impugned decisions , neither the competent administrative authority nor ORG could have examined questions such as the lawfulness and the correctness of the registration of domicile of the new - born children with the date when the request for registration was made ( and not with the date of birth ) or the lawfulness and the correctness of the issuance of the health insurance cards with a date different from DATE of birth .", "It follows that the possible violations of the constitutional rights which occurred in the proceedings for acquisition of the status of an insured person ... can not be examined in the instant constitutional court proceedings .", "Examining the [ impugned ] decisions by which the complainant was denied reimbursement of the costs of her children \u2019s medical treatment abroad , because when these costs were incurred the children had not been recognised as having the status of insured persons ... , ORG has established that these decisions are based on the relevant provision of section CARDINAL of the Ordinance on the Rights and Criteria for ORG .", "In finding so , it has to be noted that the decision of the second - instance administrative authority and the judgment of ORG are partly based on legislation that is not relevant in the present case ... in particular ... section CARDINAL of the Ordinance on the Criteria for Registration and Deregistration of an Insured Person and ORG of the Person Insured under Compulsory Health Insurance . That provision provides for a time - limit of DATE to apply for [ registration with ] compulsory health insurance .
