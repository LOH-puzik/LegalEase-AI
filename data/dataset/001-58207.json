When the ORG again returned to its position near DATE , the body was no longer lying in the main street .", "Mr PERSON stated that the LOC was equipped with an MG-CARDINAL automatic rifle . This was the weapon he had used to fire into the air . He had pressed the trigger CARDINAL or CARDINAL times . He did not know the exact number of bullets he had fired but he estimated that it must have been CARDINAL . The MG-CARDINAL machine gun was a combat weapon . If he had fired on the crowd , many people would have been killed .", "Mr PERSON stated that he knew that an investigation into these events had been opened but did not remember giving a statement to anyone in authority . He did not remember whether the spent cartridges from the weapon he had used had been passed on to the judicial authorities . If not , they would have been kept in the gendarmerie depot and handed over to superior officers .", "In response to a question concerning the death of another demonstrator , Mr PERSON stated that the LOC had fired in the air in a narrow street . As soon as the trigger of an MG-CARDINAL machine gun was pressed , it immediately fired CARDINAL bullets . Mr PERSON thought the victims had been killed by bullets fired by the ORG . ORG militants were not professionals and often hit the wrong targets .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that on DATE he was in ORG and had seen the demonstration . While on his way to his office , he had heard shots and slogans and had taken refuge in the gendarmerie building . At that moment , he had heard numerous gunshots coming from the centre of town .", "From the garden of the gendarmerie building he could see the ORG armoured vehicle moving along FAC , firing in the air in order to disperse the crowd . Shots fired in the air made a different sound than straight shots . He had also heard GPE and GPE fire coming from the gendarmerie building .", "As regards the investigation , he had conducted an inquiry following the criminal complaint filed with the ORG public prosecutor \u2019s office by ORG . He had taken a statement from PERSON and other witnesses . He had ordered an autopsy on the victim \u2019s body .", "The autopsy , which was a full one , had been performed in ORG paramedical health centre and produced the following findings : the victim had been dead for TIME as rigor mortis had not yet set in . The victim had been hit by a single bullet . The point of impact was below the right armpit and the bullet had lodged in the left shoulder , causing internal bleeding . The bullet had been found in the victim \u2019s body . It had followed a rising trajectory .", "Mr PERSON considered that it was not impossible , in view of the trajectory followed by the bullet - core found in the victim \u2019s body , that it had been fired from the LOC armoured vehicle and had then ricocheted . He referred to the autopsy report , which he had in front of him , and which stated that the fatal bullet must have ricocheted off a building or wall . The bullet - core found in the victim \u2019s body had been knocked out of shape , and this could not be accounted for by the bullet \u2019s passage through the victim \u2019s body .", "A ballistic report on the spent cartridges had been drawn up by the regional criminal police laboratory . According to that report , a bullet fragment which had passed through the body had been found and compared to CARDINAL specimen bullets . No match had been found . Since the other fragments of the bullet had not been found , it had been impossible to identify the weapon which had caused the victim \u2019s death . However , the bullet - core , which was an important piece of evidence , had been preserved as an exhibit , in accordance with the relevant procedure .", "PERSON had seen to it that the wounded were examined by doctors . CARDINAL medical reports had been filed and placed on the case file sent to the District Commissioner . According to those reports , certain demonstrators had wounds QUANTITY and the knees . None of them had been wounded on the upper body .", "The position of these wounds might have been due to crossfire and bullets ricocheting off the ground or buildings .", "Since the criminal complaint concerned civil servants , PERSON had made a declaration on DATE to the effect that he had no jurisdiction to deal with it , in accordance with the legislation on prosecution of civil servants . He had then transferred the investigation file to the District Commissioner .", "CARDINAL . When appointed as the investigator in the PERSON case , he had opened an inquiry and compiled a case file . He had taken witness statements from ORG , PERSON and the other civil servants working in the town hall , who had taken part in the demonstration .", "In his report he stated that the accusations against Major PERSON were unfounded and did not reflect what had actually happened . Before arriving at that conclusion , he had taken evidence from witnesses , read expert reports and gathered other evidence from various official and private sources . Finally , he had taken a decision on the basis of his personal conviction . He had put himself in the place of the security forces faced with the demonstrators . He had thought about the case for DATE before reaching his decision , weighing all the possibilities .", "Mr PERSON had also taken evidence from the gendarmes and Major PERSON . He did not remember whether he had taken evidence from GPE and had not taken a statement from ORG , the mayor of ORG , whom he had seen by chance on his way to ORG town hall . Mr PERSON had only told him that if the gendarmes had intervened sooner , they would have prevented most of the incidents .", "In his statement , PERSON had told Mr PERSON that he had not seen exactly what had happened . He had only heard shots and seen the crowd but had not seen people being killed or wounded . Mr PERSON \u2019s case file also contained statements from demonstrators . These statements had been taken by the public prosecutor and the previous investigator .", "Mr PERSON did not remember taking evidence from Mr PERSON , the driver of the LOC vehicle . Nor did he remember how many shots had been fired in the air from the Condor .", "Before reaching his conclusion , he had taken into account not only witness statements , but also the results of his own investigations . These indicated that the young man had been killed before the security forces intervened . The ORG militants had been in the middle of the crowd of demonstrators , surrounded by women and children . They had fired shots in all directions in order to create an atmosphere of terror . Some bullets had ricocheted and hit PERSON . The gendarmes had not even been there when he was wounded .", "He had found that the security forces had taken all necessary precautions . Those who had come forward as witnesses were reliable people . The mayor of ORG was one of them .", "There had been CARDINAL demonstrators . If firearms were discharged haphazardly , accidents could happen , even in a group of CARDINAL people . In the case in point , the CARDINAL demonstrators had not been aware of the danger . It had even been inevitable that someone would be killed . He had interviewed everyone , even the victim \u2019s relatives , who had explained to him that PERSON had very probably been killed by ORG bullets .", "Mr PERSON had not immediately ruled out the possibility that the security forces had fired on the demonstrators . He had been completely impartial and had begun his investigation with an open mind . He had come to the conclusion that the gendarmes had intervened after the victim \u2019s death . The complaint filed against the gendarmerie commander had really been an emotional reaction intended to tarnish his reputation . Major PERSON had been armed only with a handgun .", "The crew of the ORG armoured vehicle had controlled the situation effectively . If the machine gun mounted on the vehicle had been fired towards or at the crowd , there would have been a large number of deaths .", "The CARDINAL spent cartridges referred to in ORG decision had come from bullets fired in the air by the gendarmes . The DATE spent cartridges referred to in the report on the incidents and in the public prosecutor \u2019s report of DATE had come from weapons used by the demonstrators . The reference to \u201c weapons registered \u201d related to the weapons seized during searches and preserved as exhibits .", "Mr PERSON had interviewed only those people who had been listed by the gendarmerie commander as injured . The difference between the number of injured referred to in his report and the number mentioned by the chief of police could be explained by the fact that some people had gone to hospital and received immediate attention there whereas others had been admitted . Some people did not immediately realise that they had been injured , while others did not inform all the relevant authorities .", "He had seen the injured gendarmes in their barracks . Their injuries had been caused by stones and other hard objects which had been thrown at them , not by bullets .", "The commanding officer was responsible for operations . The troops had taken up their positions on his orders . If a subordinate misapplied CARDINAL of the commanding officer \u2019s orders , or acted outside the scope of that order , the subordinate was answerable for the consequences .", "He thought that the commanding officer of the district gendarmerie had given appropriate orders . When the police proved to be unable to handle the situation , the gendarmerie had intervened . Major PERSON had therefore intervened in good time and taken the appropriate steps .", "Where the investigating officer was not a gendarmerie officer , the chief of police or his deputy could investigate the case . If no such person was available , someone else , an engineer for example , could act as the investigating officer .", "Mr PERSON confirmed that he had worked in \u015e\u0131rnak from DATE . He also confirmed that Major PERSON had worked in \u015e\u0131rnak for part of that period and stated that he had taken over the investigation in the case long after the events in question .", "CARDINAL . Mr G\u00fcven had been standing in for the Governor as Chairman of ORG when it discontinued the proceedings against the commanding officer of the gendarmerie forces ordered to suppress the demonstration of DATE . He himself had not been present at the scene of the incidents .", "He described the rules governing prosecution of civil servants , which were as follows . The Governor appointed an investigator , who gathered all the evidence and submitted his conclusions to ORG . The case file was examined at a meeting of ORG at which each member expressed his or her views . The investigator did not attend that meeting . A decision to commit for trial or discontinue proceedings could be taken either unanimously or by a majority . ORG decision was transmitted to ORG which , after examining the case file , upheld or quashed it . These special rules governing the prosecution of civil servants applied in regions where a state of emergency was in force . A state of emergency had to be declared according to the democratic process by ORG , by a majority vote .", "In the present case , ORG had unanimously discontinued the proceedings , on the ground that the persons responsible had not been identified . No one had testified to seeing how PERSON had died . In GPE , gendarmes did not fire on citizens except when driven by necessity to do so .", "CARDINAL", "The ORG based its decisions on the documents which the investigator had placed on the case file , and was not strictly speaking empowered to conduct an investigation itself . That power belonged to the Governor . In general , ORG met DATE , although DATE there was no meeting . If so , the Governor circulated a draft decision among the members of ORG .", "When ORG met , it was chaired by the Governor or his representative . The ORG \u2019s Secretary read the case file aloud . The members of the ORG could examine the documents on the file . They were then invited to express their views and to sign a draft decision . In theory , the members could oppose the Governor \u2019s proposal . Those who were not convinced of the correctness of what was proposed could ask for further investigations to be carried out . However , in the final analysis , the procedure was based on the trust placed in the Governor . Either the members of the ORG were convinced and signed the decision , or they were replaced by others who were willing to sign it . In practice , it was not possible for the decision , as proposed by the Governor , not to be signed .", "PERSON stated that he thought the decision given in the present case had not been a discontinuation order but a decision not to commence criminal proceedings against civil servants and to transfer the case file to the public prosecutor for him to carry out a further investigation with a view to identifying those responsible . He had not been informed of subsequent developments in the case .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE stated that the local population had spontaneously organised a demonstration on DATE in order to protest against acts of brutality committed by the gendarmes DATE in the village of GPE . The District Commissioner had called him to the town hall . On his way there , he had seen the demonstrators in the street , and also the security forces and their armoured vehicles . When he got to the town hall , the demonstrators were already assembled .", "At the town hall , the witness had seen and heard gendarmerie major , PERSON , give the order to open fire by walkie - talkie . As the town hall was the tallest building in ORG he had seen a ORG - type armoured vehicle open fire while travelling along FAC in front of the town hall . All the demonstrators were trying to run away . CARDINAL of his friends had been killed before his eyes . He had seen shots being fired from the armoured vehicle . The vehicle was following the demonstrators and the soldiers manning it were firing at the ground , in the direction of the demonstrators .", "CARDINAL people had been wounded in the abdomen and chest by ricocheting bullets . Some of the wounded had refused to be taken to hospital because they were afraid of the authorities\u2019 reaction .", "Mr GPE had not seen how PERSON had been killed . With others , he had signed a complaint filed with the ORG public prosecutor \u2019s office against PERSON . A gendarmerie officer , Major PERSON , had taken his statement in the course of an investigation into the incidents . But the investigation had come to nothing .", "Mr GPE had been arrested , in relation to another matter , in DATE . In DATE he had left GPE while proceedings against him were pending . He had eventually been sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW for membership of an armed group , namely the ORG .", "After examining the photograph of the armoured vehicle on the case file , Mr PERSON stated that it was a NORP and that the ORG was smaller . In fact , a ORG was a jeep equipped with a machine gun . The ORG had fired for TIME .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON stated that he had been at home when the demonstration started . His house was QUANTITY from the centre of town . From his balcony , he had been able to see the route taken by the demonstrators ( mainly FAC ) and the armoured vehicles belonging to the security forces following them .", "The demonstration had been called to protest against what gendarmes had done to certain inhabitants of a village in GPE . The demonstrators were not armed . At TIME he had heard shots . From his balcony , he could see the armoured vehicles firing in all directions . Later he had gone to the health centre where there were a number of wounded people and PERSON body . He had helped to take the wounded to various hospitals in the region .", "The soldiers inside the armoured vehicle were not necessarily shooting to kill but might have been trying to disperse the demonstrators . However , they had fired without concern for the risk to the ORG lives . Most of the wounded had not gone to hospital for fear of being prosecuted for demonstrating illegally . PERSON had not seen any gendarmes injured in the course of the incidents .", "While PERSON was at the health centre in the social security hospital he had been arrested by gendarmes and held in police custody for DATE before being brought before one of the public prosecutors at ORG . CARDINAL members of his family had later been charged but then acquitted . The gendarmes had seized weapons and cartridges from citizens and fabricated evidence . However , this ploy had not fooled anyone for long .", "CARDINAL . PERSON stated that the demonstration had been called in protest against searches carried out by the army and arrests made on DATE in a village near ORG .", "PERSON had taken part in the demonstration together with PERSON PERSON , who had been a school friend of hers . There were no lessons because of the demonstration . They had decided to take part with other pupils from the senior high school . There had been many demonstrators and they were not acting under anyone \u2019s orders . They were not carrying weapons or stones .", "With regard to the circumstances surrounding the death of PERSON , PERSON stated that she was with him in the middle of the crowd when they found themselves trapped between the gendarmes who were barring the road in front of them ( QUANTITY away ) and a ORG tank which was following close ( CARDINAL or QUANTITY ) behind the demonstration , having come from the centre of town . The armoured vehicle had fired from behind the demonstrators , many times , at random and directly at the demonstrators , although this was not necessary to bring them under control . She had seen PERSON fall to the ground beside her when the shooting first started . He had remained lying on the ground while the demonstrators were running off into the adjacent streets . She had taken refuge in a house from which she had called her father . She had got home TIME . At that time , she could still hear shots . She had later found out that her friend had died .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in question Mr PERSON had gone to his caf\u00e9 at TIME At TIME the demonstration began . It was a large one . The demonstrators did not have weapons , or stones or sticks . They were chanting slogans such as , \u201c Stop the torture , stop the repression \u201d .", "The soldiers had formed a barricade in front of the demonstrators .
