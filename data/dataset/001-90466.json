The CARDINAL men were not committing any offence , but PERSON noticed in his car mirror that CARDINAL of them turned to look at the police car as it passed . Since several burglaries had been recently reported in that area , he decided to carry out an identity check . However , as he drove back towards them , the CARDINAL men ran away .", "CARDINAL . The QUANTITY police officers got out of the car and ran after them . The chase apparently continued for TIME . The CARDINAL young men split up and ran off in different directions .", "CARDINAL . G.A. ran after PERSON . As he approached him , PERSON put his hand inside his jacket . Suspecting that the latter might take out a weapon , G.A pulled out his own service revolver , a CARDINAL magnum Smith and ORG , which had no safety catch and was loaded . Holding the revolver in his right hand , with his finger on the trigger , he ordered PERSON to stop . After running QUANTITY , PERSON tired of the chase , lost his balance and tripped . That allowed PERSON to catch hold of him with his left hand . PERSON then pushed him against a car and immobilised him by forcing him to raise his hands and place them on the car roof while he was pointing his gun towards the sky .", "CARDINAL . Then , with his left hand PERSON twisted the young man \u2019s left wrist behind his back in order to handcuff him . At that point PERSON jabbed him with his right elbow in the right side , causing him sharp pain . Reacting to the pain , PERSON bent forward , and while he was drawing himself back up , his revolver went off , firing a single shot in the lower part of GPE right ear , instantly killing him .", "CARDINAL .

The report indicated that CARDINAL cartridge had been fired from ORG weapon .", "CARDINAL . Following the preliminary inquiry the case was referred to ORG , which on DATE decided not to press charges against G.A. , considering that PERSON death had resulted from his sudden and violent assault on G.A. and the accidental discharge of the latter \u2019s revolver that was its consequence ( decision no .

NORP ORG also heard statements from CARDINAL experts the defendant had asked to be called . The first expert , a forensic medicine expert , who had read the post mortem examination , reached a conclusion supporting the defendant \u2019s view . The second expert was a mathematician who put forward a theory on the trajectory of the bullet in support of the defendant \u2019s view . The court also read out various documents , such as the results of the post mortem examination of the deceased , forensic medical reports , autopsy reports , photos and the crime scene reconstruction report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG published its judgment acquitting the defendant by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL ( judgment no . PERSON ) . On the basis of the case - file and the evidence submitted the majority held in particular that :", "\u201c ... the violent blow surprised the defendant , who felt pain and bent forward and then backwards to the left and his muscles were \u201c contracted \u201d because of the pain that the violent and unexpected hit had caused him ( ... ) ,", "... because of his reflex action the defendant involuntarily squeezed the trigger of his revolver , which was not equipped with a safety catch , and a bullet was fired ( ... )", "... It is apparent that the defendant had not intended to kill the victim , as charged , since : CARDINAL ) the gun went off against his will and it was the result of the involuntary reflex action of the muscles of his right arm as a response to the sudden and intense blow that he had received from the victim ; CARDINAL ) he did not know the victim and he had no reason to hurt him , let alone to kill him ; CARDINAL ) if he had really wanted to kill PERSON ... , he would have shot him during the chase and before his arrest ; in any event there was no longer any reason to shoot him since he had already immobilised and arrested him ... ; CARDINAL ) CARDINAL bullet was fired from the gun ... ; CARDINAL ) from the trajectory of the bullet [ according to the report of the mathematical expert ] , it appears that the hand that had fired the gun had not been steady ... ; furthermore , it does not appear from the evidence that the defendant shot the victim in cold blood ... or that he acted in self - defence , since no attack was launched by the victim , who had already been immobilised ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG examined the facts complained of under the provisions concerning reckless homicide . It concluded that :", "\u201c ... on TIME [ G.A. ] carried out his duties in the most impeccable way possible . He pursued the deceased with professional consciousness , he did not fire his gun during the pursuit , although another in his place might have done so , and , most importantly , he arrested and immobilised the deceased holding his revolver in his right arm and pointing it to the sky , in order to avoid accidents ... What followed , i.e. the death of PERSON , was not the result of an intentional act of the defendant or the latter \u2019s reckless behaviour , but of the victim \u2019s violent and sudden assault that caused the reflex action of the defendant ... and the discharge of the revolver that the latter was holding in his right hand . The reflex action of the defendant was an instantaneous reaction of the nervous system , an automatic contraction of the body muscles ( including those of the right arm ) out of the defendant \u2019s control , as a response to the pain suffered from the violent and sudden blow ; since this contraction was not a voluntary action , it can not be considered an actus reus and hence he [ the defendant ] can not be considered criminally liable ...", "CARDINAL . The ORG reached the same conclusion as far as the charge of unauthorised use of weapons was concerned . In particular , it held :", "\u201c Consequently , since neither the death of the victim nor the use of the defendant \u2019s gun can be considered as \u201c acts \u201d in the legal sense of the term , the objective element of the crimes that the defendant is being accused of has not been established and he should be declared innocent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the minority judges , including the President of ORG , considered that the defendant should have been declared guilty of reckless homicide and unauthorised use of weapons . They based their reasoning on the way revolvers function :", "\u201c ... There is a slight time delay of TIME between the moment the trigger is pulled and the moment the gun fires . This is the time the hammer needs to be cocked and released ; the time the hammer needs to be cocked corresponds to the time the cylinder needs to rotate clockwise . When the hammer has already been cocked , it needs less pressure on the trigger to release the hammer and fire the gun . On the contrary , when the gun is in a hammer - down position , it needs more pressure on the trigger and more time to fire the gun , since in this case , the trigger first cocks the hammer ( thus advancing the cylinder ) and then releases the hammer at the rear of its travel , firing the round in the chamber . In the present case , it appears from the testimonies ... that ... with his left hand [ G.A. ] twisted the young man \u2019s left wrist behind his back in order to handcuff him , while with his right hand he was holding the revolver , obviously with the hammer cocked , pressing against the victim \u2019s right scapula . ... [ ORG \u2019s death ] resulted from the defendant \u2019s negligent conduct , since : CARDINAL ) he should not have cocked the hammer of his gun , since in that case the trigger needs less pressure to fire the gun ; CARDINAL ) he should not have had his finger on the trigger but on its protective frame ; CARDINAL ) he should not have been pressing the gun against the victim \u2019s scapula while he had his finger on the trigger and the hammer cocked . If the gun had been in a hammer - down position , even if the defendant had had his finger on the trigger , it would have been more difficult for the gun to go off , since it required more pressure on the trigger . ... the defendant had no intention to kill the victim ... he should have been declared guilty of reckless homicide and unauthorised use of weapons . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who did not have the right to appeal in cassation under domestic law , asked ORG to bring the case before ORG . On DATE the Prosecutor dismissed his request .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after the shooting , PERSON was declared free of duty for DATE and he was later granted sick leave for a total period of DATE . On DATE he resumed his duties in ORG . On DATE he was transferred to an administrative post in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , DATE after the fatal incident , the NORP police headquarters launched ORG ( \u0395\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03ba\u03b7 \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03be\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 , DATE ) in order to ascertain the exact circumstances in which PERSON death had occurred and whether police officer PERSON was guilty of any disciplinary offence . That investigation was assigned to an officer of the police department dealing with administrative investigations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the report on the findings of the ORG was issued . According to the report , the death of PERSON was not the result of the police officer \u2019s reckless behaviour , but of the victim \u2019s violent and sudden assault and the discharge of the latter\u2019", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , while the case was pending before the penal courts , on DATE the applicant brought an action against the ORG under section CARDINAL of the PERSON introducing the Civil Code seeking compensation for damage sustained as a result of an unlawful act by a public authority , namely , his son \u2019s killing by police officer PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE prior to ORG \u2019s acquittal by ORG , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claims in part ( judgment no . DATE ) . It held inter alia :", "\u201c ... The grounds set forth in LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which authorises the use of firearms , do not apply under the circumstances of the present case , since [ G.A. ] had not been attacked by the victim ... nor was he acting in self - defence ... The use of the firearm by the police officer in order to arrest the deceased was unlawful and resulted in the young man \u2019s death . ... The police officer \u2019s outline of events , according to which the firing was provoked by a \u2018 reflex ORG following the blow he had received from DATE in the sense that he involuntarily pulled the trigger DATE can not be accepted , because it is in contradiction with his own statement concerning an \u2018 unconscious instinctive reaction caused by the violent blow he had NORP . In fact , that means that pulling the trigger was an instinctive reaction to the victim \u2019s behaviour , which implies that [ G.A. ] acted without using his reason and without showing the prudence and discipline expected from a police officer with DATE of experience . ... thus , police officer PERSON is PERCENT responsible for PERSON death since he used his firearm in violation of the applicable law ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appealed to ORG challenging the implementation of the substantive law and the assessment of the evidence . It referred subsequently , in a separate memorandum , that PERSON had been acquitted by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal and awarded the applicant LAW GPE for non - pecuniary damage ( judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , considering inter alia :", "\u201c Even supposing that the use of the firearm by the police officer in order to arrest the deceased was not in breach of a specific provision , nevertheless it constituted unlawful conduct , since he failed to take those steps that are appropriate to his duties , that result from the relevant legislation , from common sense , from his scientific and professional education and experience and from the notion of good faith and aim at the protection of individual freedoms , namely the right to life and limb . Consequently , the appellant is responsible ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the use of firearms by law - enforcement officials was regulated by Law no . CARDINAL , which was enacted on DATE when GPE was under NORP occupation . LAW of that statute listed a wide range of situations in which a police officer could use firearms ( for example in order \u201c to enforce the laws , decrees and decisions of the relevant authorities or to disperse public gatherings or suppress mutinies \u201d ) , without being liable for the consequences . These provisions were modified by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which authorises the use of firearms in the situations set forth in PERSON no . CARDINAL \u201c only when absolutely necessary and when all less extreme methods have been exhausted \u201d . Law no . CARDINAL was criticised as \u201c defective \u201d and \u201c vague \u201d by ORG ( see Opinion no . CARDINAL ) . Senior NORP police officers and trade unions have called for this legislation to be updated . In a letter to the Minister of Public Order dated DATE , ORG ( ORG ) , an advisory body to the government , expressed the view that new legislation which would incorporate relevant international human rights law and guidelines was imperative ( ORG , DATE Report , pp . CARDINAL ) . In DATE the Minister of Public Order announced that a new law would shortly be enacted , which would \u201c safeguard citizens against the reckless use of police weapons , but also safeguard police officers who will be better informed as to when they can use them \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
