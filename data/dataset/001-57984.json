It is indeed the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for murder . But the sentence itself is closer in substance to the discretionary sentence of which part is punitive ( retribution and deterrence ) and the balance justified only by the interests of public safety when the test of dangerousness is satisfied . The fact that the mandatory life prisoner may be given similar rights as regards release on licence does not alter the fact that the mandatory life sentence is justifiable as punishment for the whole of its period : see NORP v.

The order for detention under LAW is by its terms both discretionary and indeterminate : it provides for detention \u2018 during Her Majesty \u2019s pleasure\u2019 I would decide the present case on the narrow ground that , notwithstanding ORG practice , the applicant should be regarded as equivalent to a discretionary life prisoner for the purpose of deciding whether ORG rather than ORG governs his case . \"", "( transcript , pp .
