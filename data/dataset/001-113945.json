The CARDINAL applicants , PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON as well as PERSON , are NORP nationals who live in GPE . They are represented before the Court by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The case concerns the death of the applicants\u2019 children in a fire in DATE in FAC ( \u201c the Stardust \u201d ) in GPE . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In TIME of DATE a catastrophic fire swept through the PERSON in which CARDINAL persons were present . CARDINAL persons died and CARDINAL were seriously injured . The overwhelming majority of the victims were DATE . It remains the greatest disaster to have occurred in the history of the State .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the first applicant \u2019s children died in the fire , the second applicant lost a daughter as did the third and fourth applicants . CARDINAL of the fifth applicant \u2019s daughters also died in the fire and a third was injured .", "CARDINAL . Within TIME of the first call to ORG , all available police officers in the area were dispatched to the scene . A police investigation commenced immediately . An investigation team , of CARDINAL persons of various specialities , was assembled at the special incident centre under the control of ORG from ORG . Extensive forensic examinations were carried out and CARDINAL witness statements were taken . Post - mortem examinations were carried out by ORG pathologists . The Coroner held Inquests ( the Coroner \u2019s Act CARDINAL ) in DATE and made findings as to the physical causes of death . In DATE DNA tests allowed the identification of the remaining CARDINAL unidentified bodies ( not the deceased children of the applicants ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG was established ( Tribunal of Inquiry Evidence Acts DATE and DATE ) to inquire into all aspects of the fire including its cause . It was chaired by Mr Justice PERSON assisted by CARDINAL assessors : a Professor of ORG of ORG ; the Chief Inspector of ORG in GPE ; and the Head of ORG of An GPE ( ORG ) . It sat for DATE ( DATE ) , it heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses including victims , next - of - kin of the deceased and many experts and it commissioned extensive tests .", "CARDINAL . The Tribunal \u2019s ORG dated the CARDINAL DATE made findings and recommendations in relation to a very broad range of issues .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that there had been serious deficiencies as regards the content of , compliance with and application of applicable planning , building , electrical , safety and fire standards by the owners of the Stardust , by relevant ORG bodies and officials . The ORG treated CARDINAL of the owner \u2019s evidence \u201c with great reserve \u201d , which owner bore a special responsibility for the \u201c recklessly dangerous \u201d practice of keeping the emergency doors chained which was done with \u201c reckless disregard \u201d for the safety of those on the LOC . The ORG found that , without all of these deficiencies , the injuries sustained would have been unquestionably less and the death toll would almost certainly have been reduced .", "CARDINAL . While the ORG \u2019s conclusions were critical of ORG ( responsible for the fire services , building regulations and planning ) , the ORG did not point to the particular fault or deficiencies of individual officials in the ORG and no administrative or disciplinary enquiries were later pursued . The ORG mentioned by name a number of officials of ORG but it did not appear to allot individual blame given the system failures at issue . Some responsibility was attributed to a Senior Building Surveyor in ORG as regards failing to follow up on the use of carpet tiles on the walls . However , the ORG accepted that it was possible , as the Surveyor had argued , that the relevant regulations were not clear on this subject .", "CARDINAL . As to the police investigation , the ORG found that it was exhaustive and meticulous and to be commended , although there had been \u201c serious short comings \u201d in the forensic investigation . Some of the owners and staff of the PERSON did not give the police the assistance to which they were entitled , CARDINAL member of staff deliberately attempting to deceive the police on whether the exit doors had been locked .", "CARDINAL . The ORG went on to make broad recommendations on the approach to be adopted to fire safety in GPE ( \u201c serious shortcomings in the approach to fire safety in GPE which much be remedied as a matter of urgency \u201d ) including on education , training , allocation of responsibility for fire safety and legislative / regulatory changes as well as recommendations concerning the enforcement of standards .", "CARDINAL . As to the cause of the fire , it made CARDINAL findings . On the one hand , it found , based on the absence of any evidence , that the cause of the fire was \u201c not known and may never be known \u201d . On the other hand , based on a hypothesis , it found that the more probable \u201c explanation \u201d was that the fire was started deliberately in LOC of the PERSON . However , the ORG went on , erroneously as later accepted , to adopt its hypothetical explanation of arson as a \u201c finding of fact \u201d and as its conclusion as to the probable cause of the fire .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s finding of arson provoked anger and immediate protestations among the survivors and the bereaved . It was perceived as casting a suspicion of criminal wrongdoing over all who attended the PERSON on TIME of the fire . It was considered to exclude negligence proceedings against the owners of the PERSON and that it facilitated the award of damages for malicious damage by the ORG to the owners ( see immediately below ) . It would appear that the fifth applicant \u2019s husband set up ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in DATE , its main objective being to campaign for a further inquiry .", "CARDINAL . A police preliminary investigation report was completed in DATE : nothing factual as to the origin of the fire had come to light . The police report and file was forwarded ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) who directed that no prosecution be pursued . In DATE , following the conclusion of the ORG , a further police file ( including an engineering report which was unable to identify evidence of any fault in the electrical , heating or ventilation systems which could have started the fire ) was sent to the ORG , who again directed that no prosecution be pursued . At the time , no reasons were given for the ORG \u2019s decisions . All police investigation material was made available to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the owners of the PERSON brought a claim in malicious damage against the ORG . They relied on their own expert evidence and , while they did not specifically rely on ORG , they did rely heavily on experts who had given evidence to the ORG to the effect that the fire had been caused deliberately . The ORG \u2019s expert witness considered he could not refute this evidence and ORG accepted their evidence . In DATE that court found in favour of the owners , the trial judge stating that he had no doubt that the fire was malicious . In DATE the owners were awarded a total of CARDINAL NORP Pounds ( ORG ) . The ORG was legally advised that an appeal had no reasonable prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government established the Stardust Victims Compensation Tribunal ( \u201c the Compensation Tribunal \u201d ) to award ex gratia compensation for loss attributable to the fire . This tribunal comprised a ORG judge , a barrister and solicitor . Bereaved persons could claim compensation and acceptance of an award was conditional on discontinuing , or waiving the right to take , civil actions . Rejection of an award left claimants free to take civil actions except before ORG . Awards could not be appealed and no award could be made for the benefit of a deceased \u2019s estate . Claimants were entitled to be heard and could call witnesses unless the tribunal considered it unnecessary . Claimants\u2019 costs , even those already incurred in discontinued civil actions , would be discharged by the ORG . CARDINAL applications were received . Cases were heard from DATE . Given the distressing circumstances of the fatalities , claimants were awarded the maximum statutory amount for mental distress . CARDINAL applicants were refused compensation and CARDINAL withdrew their applications . CARDINAL awards , totalling GPE CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , were made . All awards were accepted .", "CARDINAL . The fifth applicant \u2019s husband challenged the refusal by ORG of an award for nervous shock . While it was accepted that he had suffered grief and sorrow , he had not suffered a psychiatric illness and was not therefore entitled to damages for nervous shock under the scheme . By judgment of DATE ORG rejected his case ( The ORG ( PERSON and PERSON v. the ORG ( [ DATE ] I.L.R.M. CARDINAL ) . Mr PERSON died that DATE . The PERSON family award ( including damages for mental distress and loss of earnings ) totalled DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG published a report which recorded general conclusions and the total sum of compensation paid . The report criticised the fact that it was only before it that that many victims had been able to be medically examined and treated by doctors for the first time since the fire . The report therefore recommended that the Government put in place contingency plans , not only for rescuing victims and for their treatment in hospital , but also for monitoring their later progress .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG submitted a report to ORG , ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . ORG referred the report for expert analysis which concluded that the ORG \u2019s report did not contain any new evidence . ORG was informed of this in a meeting in DATE . A letter DATE from the police to the solicitor of the ORG explained the scope of this expert analysis and detailed why there was no new evidence warranting the police re - visiting the investigation . The applicants maintained that they were given a copy of this letter only after ORG ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG then obtained reports from CARDINAL fire experts whose evidence was that a more probable cause of the fire was that it started , or involved combustibles in , FAC ( in the roof space ) which contained a considerably greater fuel load than LOC . The findings were published in a report called \u201c Nothing but the Truth \u201d and the report was the subject of a television documentary in DATE . In DATE the ORG , through its solicitors , presented a full submission for a further inquiry ( also called \u201c Nothing but the Truth \u201d ) to the Government . In DATE the ORG was informed that , while the expert advice to the Taoiseach ( Prime Minister ) was that the report contained no new material which would justify holding an enquiry , he was willing to arrange for an independent examination of the ORG \u2019s submissions by an appropriate person with legal experience .", "CARDINAL . Further to negotiations between the Government and the ORG , an agreement was reached on the appointment of an independent person to review the case made by ORG for a further inquiry . In DATE the appointment of Mr PERSON GPE was agreed . On DATE the Government established the independent \u201c PERSON \u201d review of the ORG \u2019s case for a renewed inquiry to establish the cause of the fire . The terms of reference were :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ Mr PERSON ] shall :", "- consider the [ Report of the ORG ] ;", "- consider all the issues which are raised by the [ ORG ] , as are summarised in the submission \u201c Nothing But The Truth \u201d and in the supplemental submission to \u201c Nothing But The Truth \u201d ( delivered on the CARDINALth of DATE ) , and all the evidence and submissions as may be presented on their behalf as he considers necessary and relevant to the case for a further inquiry .", "- In the course of a private examination of the issues ,", "( a ) meet such people and secure such advice as he considers necessary to ensure complete understanding of the matters and issues .", "( b ) facilitate a detailed presentation by the [ Committee ] of the case for renewed inquiry as they see it .", "( c ) have such regard to as he thinks appropriate to submissions , if any , as may be made by other persons / parties including any Government Departments or ORG or the owners of the PERSON together with any observations on or response thereto from the [ Committee ] .", "- carry out such inquiries or investigations that he , in his sole discretion , considers necessary for clarification of the issues raised by the [ ORG ] , but he shall not initiate any further investigations into the cause of the fire .", "CARDINAL . Following his assessment of the issues raised by the [ ORG ] and related matters , as set out above , Mr PERSON shall , without undue delay , report to the Government and shall therein make a recommendation as to whether a new inquiry should be established and may make such other recommendations as he considers appropriate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON advertised in local and national newspapers seeking submissions . He heard submissions from all interested persons and parties . ORG , whose legal representation was financed by the Government , gave oral evidence over DATE and made written submissions . A large body of documents was gathered , all of which were made available to the ORG \u2019s legal representatives . Mr PERSON considered he was entitled to assess not only the applicants\u2019 new evidence , but any other issue pertinent to the question of the need for a further enquiry .", "CARDINAL . The ORG summarised the issues raised by it as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) that the ORG \u2019s finding of fact that the fire was probably caused deliberately is based on hypothesis and not established by evidence and is for that reason inherently unsatisfactory ;", "( CARDINAL ) that the hypothesis upon which the ORG \u2019s finding is based is itself demonstrably flawed because it can not be reconciled with the known facts of the fire including evidence accepted by the ORG ;", "( CARDINAL ) that new expert and factual evidence establishes as a probability that the fire began in the Lamp Room and spread via ORG to LOC ;", "( CARDINAL ) that the \u201c methodology \u201d used by the ORG was flawed insofar as insufficient scrutiny or examination was given to the possibility that the fire originated in the roof space having regard to the very considerable quantity of combustible material that was contained in FAC and the fact that FAC was effectively in the roof space ;", "( CARDINAL ) that only the very considerable fuel load in FAC could have provided the basis for the rapid development of the fire which engulfed the PERSON within TIME . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was published . Having reviewed the evidence and submissions of ORG together with the ORG \u2019s database of material , PERSON concluded ( paragraph CARDINAL ) that the ORG had established a prima facie case that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) the ORG \u2019s finding of fact that the fire was probably started deliberately is on its face a mere hypothetical explanation for the probable cause of the fire and is not demonstrated by any evidence that the fire was started deliberately ;", "( CARDINAL ) in the absence of any such evidence and on the basis of new expert evidence relating to the early collapse of the ceiling in LOC , the explanation can not be demonstrated to be objectively justifiable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was further satisfied , on a prima facie basis , that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) that neither the ORG nor the ORG have identified any evidence which can establish the cause of the fire ;", "( CARDINAL ) that the new and other evidence relied upon by ORG at its highest merely establishes that the fire began in the roof space but does not establish its point of origin or cause . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the ORG \u2019s call for a new inquiry to establish the cause of the fire , PERSON considered that , in the absence of any identified evidence which could establish its cause , the issue was whether a new inquiry would serve any useful purpose . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL It could be argued that a further inquiry would at least establish whether the fire began in LOC or in the roof space . However , it seems to me that at a remove of DATE from DATE of the fire and in the absence of any identified evidence which can establish the cause of the fire wheresoever it arose , the public interest would not be served in establishing a further inquiry solely for that purpose . It could also be argued that there should be a further enquiry to establish the probable cause of the fire . However , it seems to me that in the absence of any identified evidence capable of establishing the cause of the fire , such an inquiry can only at best produce a hypothetical finding neither capable of proof or disproof and therefore of no obvious or any forensic value . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON went on to point out that :", "\u201c PERSON The real difficulty is CARDINAL of record and lies in the fact that despite having made a finding based on the absence of evidence that \u201c the cause of the fire is unknown \u201d , the ORG has failed to acknowledge and record this finding as its conclusion as to the cause of the fire . Instead the ORG has only recorded its finding as to the probable cause of the fire . In so concluding and in the absence of any evidence that the fire was started deliberately , the ORG has placed on the public record a finding of probable criminal wrongdoing which is prima facie speculative and fraught with evidential and logical difficulties . Moreover , insofar as it is stated to be a \u201c finding of fact \u201d , the finding is so phrased as may well give the mistaken impression to a reasonable man or woman in the street that it is a finding established by evidence that the fire was started deliberately and not a mere hypothetical explanation for the probable cause of the fire . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON found this to be profoundly unsatisfactory to the survivors and the bereaved who , through ORG , argued that such was the scale of the disaster that it has become a matter of communal if not national history to an extent that engaged a public interest in ensuring that the public record was factually accurate and established by evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the new and other evidence relied on by the Committee , at its highest , established that the cause of the fire was unknown , a finding already made but not properly acknowledged and recorded by the ORG . As to how to correct this , PERSON proposed alternative solutions . Since the ORG was established by ORG , the ORG could consider whether it could correct the public record by placing on the record of ORG an acknowledgement of the ORG \u2019s findings that there was no evidence that the fire was started deliberately and that the cause of the fire was unknown ; or , if such an acknowledgement could not be made by the ORG , a further limited inquiry would be needed but simply to clarify the public record in this limited respect .", "CARDINAL . Finally , noting the failure by the ORG to act on the earlier recommendation of ORG , PERSON recommended that a committee be formed to monitor the progress of victims and to ensure that counselling and medical treatment , where necessary and appropriate , was afforded to survivors and the bereaved at the expense of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Coffey Report was published , the Government published a statement acknowledging and accepting the conclusions and recommendation of ORG . On DATE and DATE PERSON ( ORG ) and PERSON ( the ORG ) respectively , passed motions acknowledging and accepting the conclusions and recommendation of ORG and , notably , that the cause of the fire was unknown and that arson was merely a hypothetical explanation which had not been demonstrated .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government published a LAW which began operating in DATE .", "CARDINAL . A building regulation regime was introduced by LAW DATE and LAW DATE . LAW DATE was brought into force in DATE and updated in DATE and ORG were also adopted thereunder which , inter alia , made locking of exits and blocking escape routes from places of assembly an offence . ORG DATE provided for increased powers for fire authorities to inspect LOC , issue warning notices and , where necessary , serve closure notices . A series of ORG have been published by ORG providing fire safety advice for persons in control of LOC . Following a full review of fire services in GPE in DATE , ORG was implemented to further enhance fire safety enforcement powers . A ORG ( DATE ) was introduced to improve responses to major emergencies and a ORG was formed in DATE . The numbers of fire services\u2019 staff sharply increased and fire services funding and training significantly improved . Following the criticisms of it in ORG , ORG significantly increased staffing especially in fire prevention , established a training centre and purchased new fire stations and equipment as well as a new communications centre ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
