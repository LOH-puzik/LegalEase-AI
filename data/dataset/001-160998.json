The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is self - employed and runs a business .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP commercial television channel ORG broadcast an episode of a television show entitled \u201c Insider \u201d , in which it was claimed that \u201c shady transactions and shady characters \u201d were revealed . The show was broadcast live with a few recorded features . In the show , the applicant , who was unknown to the broader public , appeared in pictures and was mentioned by name . He was singled out as the central figure of organised crime within media and advertising and as being guilty of several counts of fraud and other economic offences . The programme was rebroadcast on DATE and DATE . At this time , no criminal investigation had been initiated against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The television programme was produced in GPE by the NORP company ORG . It was sent by satellite link from GPE to the GPE - based company ORG and from there sent unaltered to a satellite which transmitted the programme to the NORP audience . The encoded programme was viewable via a satellite receiver or a cable connection in GPE a fraction of a second after it had been sent by satellite link . Even if it was viewable in GPE , which is doubtful , it would have been watched there by a small audience . It was presented in the NORP language for a LANGUAGE - speaking audience , and was sponsored by companies competing in the NORP market . The anchorman of the show , X , a NORP national , was a celebrity and a well - known television personality in GPE ; he was also the Chief Executive Officer of ORG . The show had a long run and was watched by many viewers .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant brought a private prosecution against X for gross defamation , claiming damages in the amount of MONEY ( SEK ; MONEY ) . He maintained that he had been unreservedly pointed out as the central figure of organised crime within media and advertising and as being directly or indirectly responsible for a large number of serious crimes . He further alleged that X was responsible for the content of the programme since he had failed in his duty to appoint a legally responsible editor ( ansvarig utgivare ) for the programme and because he had been its anchor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant relied on DATE of LAW ( PERSON , ORG ; hereafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , regarding freedom of expression offences and liability rules , and LAW ( ORG ) , dealing with defamation , as well as ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . In the latter respect , he argued that his appearance in the show breached his right to privacy as well as his right to be presumed innocent and that a decision to dismiss his claims would constitute a violation of his right to an effective remedy . The applicant submitted a legal opinion stating that it would be impossible , or at least not useful , to bring an action in GPE in the present case since the damage flowing from the television programme at issue had not occurred in GPE .", "CARDINAL . X disputed the claim on the grounds , inter alia , that he was not the responsible editor of the show and that he enjoyed the freedom to communicate information as provided for under LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW and as clarified by ORG ( ORG domstolen ) in the case ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a preliminary ruling on DATE ORG ( PERSON tingsr\u00e4tt ) dismissed the claim in so far as it was based on LAW . It referred to ORG judgment in an almost identical case , ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , and held that LAW of LAW were not applicable to the television programme since it could not be regarded as emanating from GPE . This was because the programme had first been sent by satellite link to ORG , the NORP company responsible for the programme content , and thereafter uplinked to a satellite , which had in turn transmitted the programme to viewers in GPE . As LAW of LAW were not applicable , X could not be held responsible for the programme content under LAW . ORG further held that the applicant \u2019s claims under LAW were to be determined following the main hearing in the case . The court finally drew the parties\u2019 attention to ORG case ORG DATE p. CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , repeating what he had stated in his earlier submissions . He further argued that all companies involved in the case were NORP , including the receiving company in GPE , allegedly named ORG , with its seat in GPE . Although ORG had acquired the right to transmit the show from the NORP company ORG , it had had no impact on or responsibility for the programme selection . Having regard to the above , the offence committed against the applicant through the programme could not be examined by GPE courts . The applicant also submitted that NORP courts were competent to examine the case under ORG ( see further paragraph CARDINAL below ) . X contested the arguments and submitted that it was the company ORG , whose seat was in GPE , which was responsible for the programme service and decided on the final content of the programmes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) upheld ORG decision . It held that the issue for it to determine was whether the general provisions in LAW were applicable to the programme in question , that is , whether or not the broadcasting of the programme could be considered to have originated from GPE within the meaning of LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that law . It further stated that the burden of proof concerning the applicability of LAW rested on the applicant and that he had not , in response to X \u2019s refutation , established that the decisions concerning the programme content were taken in GPE . Consequently , LAW were not applicable in the case . The court further held that the material before it indicated that it was possible for the applicant to bring claims before a NORP court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed and referred to his earlier submissions . In addition , he requested that a question concerning the interpretation of ORG be referred to ORG of ORG ( ECJ ) for a preliminary ruling . According to the applicant , the regulation entitled a person claiming non - contractual damages to bring actions where the harmful event occurred . In the present case , the harmful event had occurred in GPE and the applicant thus should have had the right to bring his action before the NORP courts . Consequently , the position hitherto taken by the NORP courts ran contrary to Community law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s referral request and refused leave to appeal in the case . It held that , since ORG had found itself competent to examine the applicant \u2019s claims in so far as they were based on grounds other than LAW , there was no reason to request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently withdrew his remaining claims before ORG since there was no practical prospect of success in a continued procedure . On DATE ORG struck the case out of the list and ordered the applicant to pay X \u2019s legal costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were taken against the applicant in regard , inter alia , to the matters described in the television programme . He was convicted of aggravated fraud as well as tax and bookkeeping offences and sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The criminal proceedings were finalised by a ORG decision to refuse leave to appeal on CARDINAL October CARDINAL . These proceedings , in particular their compliance with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , are the subject of an application lodged with ORG on DATE ( no .
