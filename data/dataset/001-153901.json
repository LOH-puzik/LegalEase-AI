It transpires from ORG statements to ORG that the order issued by ORG was explicable by his desire to move on to a more \u201c incisive \u201d phase involving arrests of suspects in order to dispel any impression that the police had remained inert vis - \u00e0 - vis the looting and unlawful damage perpetrated in the city .

On their return to the police station , the police officers who had headed the patrol recounted the events at a meeting called by the most senior police officials ( including PERSON , PERSON , Police Commissioner PERSON and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Having contacted the ORG official to whom ORG had been assigned , the police decided to conduct a search of the LOC in order to secure evidence and possibly arrest LOC members responsible for the unlawful damage . Having discussed and dismissed the idea of bombarding the school with tear gas , they agreed on the following modus operandi : a police unit made up essentially of officers belonging to a division specialising in anti - riot operations who had benefited from ad hoc training ( the VII Nucleo antisommossa operating within the GPE mobile unit ) was to \u201c secure \u201d the building ; another unit would carry out the search ; lastly , a carabinieri unit would surround the building to prevent suspects escaping . The Head of Police was also informed about the operation ( see first - instance judgment , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL , and Final Report of the Parliamentary Inquiry , pp . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Late in the TIME a large number of police officers from various units and departments left the NORP police station for ORG ( see Final Report of the Parliamentary Inquiry , ibid . ) . According to ORG judgment , the total number of officers participating in the operation was \u201c approximately CARDINAL police officers and carabinieri , the latter being responsible exclusively for encircling the building \u201d . The appeal judgment ( p. CARDINAL ) pointed out that that figure had never been precisely substantiated .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the members of the VII Nucleo antisommossa , having arrived close to both schools with helmets , shield and tonfa - type truncheons , together with other similarly equipped officers , began to run towards the LOC . A journalist and a municipal councillor standing outside the schools were kicked and struck with batons ( see first - instance judgment , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Some of the persons occupying the Diaz - Pertini School who had been outside re - entered the building and closed the gates and entrance doors , attempting to block them with school benches and wooden planks . The police officers assembled in front of the gate , which they forced open with an armoured vehicle after unsuccessful attempts to shoulder - charge them . Finally , the aforementioned police unit broke down the entrance doors ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . The officers invested all the floors of the building , many of them in complete darkness . With , in most cases , their faces concealed by scarves , they began to punch , kick and club the occupiers , shouting threats at their victims . Groups of officers even struck seated or prostrate persons . Some of those who had been awakened by the noise were struck while still in their sleeping bags , while others were assaulted while holding their hands up as a sign of capitulation or showing their identity documents . Some of the occupiers attempted to escape and hide in the school toilets or lumber - rooms , but they were caught and beaten up , and some of them were hauled out of their hiding places by the hair ( see first - instance judgment , pp . CARDINAL , and appeal judgment , pp . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who was DATE of age at the material time , was on the ground floor . Having been awakened by the noise , when the police arrived he sat down against the wall beside a group of persons with his arms in the air ( see first - instance judgment , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . He was mainly struck on the head , arms and legs , whereby the blows caused multiples fractures : fractures of the right ulna , the right styloid , the right fibula and several ribs . According to the applicant \u2019s statement in ORG , the healthcare staff who arrived at the school after the violence had subsided attended to him last , despite hiss cries for help .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was operated on at the GPE hospital in GPE , where he remained for DATE , and then DATE , at the PERSON hospital in GPE . He was granted over forty days\u2019 unfitness for work . The aforementioned injuries left him with a permanent weakness in his right arm and leg ( see first - instance judgment , pp . ORG and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after the storming of ORG , a police unit stormed ORG , where journalists were filming events both outside and inside the Diaz - Pertini School . A radio station was broadcasting the events live .", "CARDINAL . When the police officers arrived the journalists were forced to stop filming and broadcasting . Cassettes containing the reports filmed over DATE of the LOC were seized and the ORG lawyers\u2019 hard disks were seriously damaged ( see first - instance judgment , pp . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . After the storming of ORG the security forces emptied the ORG rucksacks and other luggage without attempting to identify their owners or to explain the nature of the operation under way . They wrapped some of the items collected in a black flag in the school gymnasium . During that operation , some of the occupiers were taken to the gymnasium and forced to sit or lie down ( see first - instance judgment , pp . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

Some were immediately transferred to the PERSON barracks .", "CARDINAL . During TIME CARDINAL to DATE the Head of the NORP police press unit , who was interviewed close to the schools , stated that during the search of the LOC the police had found black clothing and balaclavas similar to those used by LOC .

The prosecution against the occupiers on charges of conspiracy to commit unlawful damage and destruction , serious or aggravated r\u00e9sistance to the police and the unlawful carrying of weapons led to the acquittal of all concerned .", "CARDINAL . The Genoa public prosecutor \u2019s office initiated an investigation to ascertain the facts underlying the decision to storm the Diaz - Pertini School and to shed light on the methodology of the operation , the alleged knife attack on CARDINAL of the officers and the discovery of the Molotov cocktails , as well as the events that had occurred in FAC .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after DATE of investigations , CARDINAL police officers and officials were committed for trial . CARDINAL further sets of proceedings concerning CARDINAL other officers were subsequently joined to the initial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had claimed damages at the preliminary hearing on DATE . A total number of CARDINAL parties claiming damages , including CARDINAL of NORP and foreigners who had occupied both schools , as well as trade unions and other non - governmental associations , came to a.", "CARDINAL . Those proceedings concerned the events in the Diaz - Pertini School , where the applicant had been accommodated ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , and the events in ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) . They involved hearing CARDINAL individuals , both defendants and witnesses ( including many foreigners ) , CARDINAL expert opinions and the viewing of a great deal of audio - visual materiel .", "CARDINAL . The charges relating to the events in the Diaz - Pertini School were as follows : giving false information for inclusion in a document , simple and aggravated slander , misfeasance in public office ( particularly on account of the unlawful arrest of the persons occupying the buildings ) , simple and aggravated bodily harm and unlawful carrying of weapons of war .", "CARDINAL . By judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , deposited on CARDINAL DATE , ORG found CARDINAL of the accused guilty of providing false information ( one accused ) , simple slander ( CARDINAL accused ) and aggravated slander ( one accused ) , simple and aggravated bodily harm ( CARDINAL accused ) and the unlawful carrying of weapons of war ( CARDINAL accused ) . The court sentenced them to CARDINAL imprisonment , a prohibition of holding public office for the period of the main sentence and , jointly and severally with ORG , payment of costs and expenses and of damages to the parties claiming the latter , to whom the court awarded advances of CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( ORG ) .", "The applicant , in particular , was awarded an advance of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , which was paid in DATE following an attachment .", "CARDINAL . In determining the main sentences the court had regard to the mitigating circumstances that the perpetrators of the offences had no criminal records and that they had acted in a state of stress and fatigue . CARDINAL of the convicted persons was granted a conditional suspension of sentence , whereby the court ordered that the conviction should not appear on his criminal record . Furthermore , pursuant to Law No . CARDINAL of DATE laying down the conditions for remission of sentence ( indulto ) , CARDINAL of the convicted persons were granted total remission of the main sentences , and CARDINAL of them , who had been given a DATE prison sentence , was granted a DATE remission .", "CARDINAL . In the reasons for the judgment ( CARDINAL pages of a total of CARDINAL ) , the court first of all rejected the argument that the operation had been planned from the outset as a punitive expedition against the demonstrators . It accepted that the security forces might reasonably have thought , in the light of the events preceding the storming of the buildings ( particularly the information provided by local residents and the attack on the patrol during TIME of DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , that there were also members of LOC in the Diaz - Pertini School . It held , however , that the events at issue constituted a clear violation of the law , \u201c of human dignity and of respect for the individual \u201d ( di ogni principio di umanit\u00e0 e di rispetto delle persone ) . The court considered that even in confronting members of LOC , the security forces were allowed to force inasmuch as the latter was necessary in order to overcome violent resistance from the persons occupying the buildings , subject to proportionality between the resistance encountered and the means used . According to the court neither the applicant nor , for instance , a slightly built young woman who had also been present could have put up such resistance as to justify the blows which they had received , causing bruising and fractures .", "CARDINAL . The court also emphasised that the prosecution had not requested the committal for trial of the actual perpetrators of the violence on account of the difficulty of identifying them , and that the police had not cooperated effectively . It noted in that connection that the prosecution had been provided with old photographs of the officers accused and that it had taken DATE to identify CARDINAL particularly violent officer \u2013 filmed during the storming of the buildings \u2013 even though he had been easily recognisable by his hairstyle .", "CARDINAL . In its assessment of the individual responsibility of the accused , the court held that having regard to the circumstances of the case , the perpetrators had acted in the conviction that their superiors tolerated their acts . The fact that some officers and officials who had been in situ right from the beginning of the operation had not stepped in immediately to halt the violence had encouraged the officers of the VII Nucleo antisommossa and the other members of the security forces in their actions . The ORG therefore took the view that only those senior officials could be considered guilty of aiding and abetting the offence of causing bodily harm .", "CARDINAL . The court then considered the prosecution argument that the security forces had produced false evidence and recounted fictitious events with a view to justifying , a posteriori , both the search of the LOC and the acts of violence .", "CARDINAL . As regards the behaviour of the persons occupying the buildings before the police stormed them , the court observed that the video recordings added to the case file had not shown them throwing any large objects from the building , but that it might be considered , according to the statements of a witness and the attitude of the police officers , who had been filmed with their shields raised above their heads , that a number of small objects ( coins , bolts , etc . ) had probably been thrown at the officers while they had been attempting to break down the entrance door to the school .", "CARDINAL . As regards the alleged knife attack on an officer , the court , drawing on the results of the expert opinion prepared on that officer \u2019s behaviour and the evidence at its disposal , observed that it could neither find that that attack had actually taken place nor preclude the possibility that it had in fact occurred .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the court noted that the CARDINAL Molotov cocktails shown to the press on DATE had been found by the police in the city during TIME of DATE and subsequently brought , at the behest of the Deputy Police Commissioner of Genoa , to the schoolyard towards the end of the search of the LOC , and that they had ended up , under obscure circumstances , mingled with the items that had been gathered together in the gymnasium .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court considered that the police report on the operation contained a misleading description of the facts , because it stated that all those occupying the school had resisted violently and glossed over the fact that most of them had been injured by the security forces .", "CARDINAL . The accused , the prosecutor \u2019s office with ORG , ORG , ORG ( which was civilly liable ) and most of the victims , including the applicant , all appealed to ORG against the first - instance judgment . By judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , filed on DATE , the court of appeal altered the challenged judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG found the accused guilty of the following offences : providing false information ( CARDINAL accused ) , aggravated bodily harm ( CARDINAL accused ) and the unlawful carrying of weapons of war ( one accused ) . It imposed prison sentences on them of DATE and prohibited them from holding public office for DATE . Pursuant to Law No . CARDINAL of DATE , all those convicted were given the benefit of a DATE remission of sentence .", "CARDINAL . Since the limitation period for offences of aggravated slander ( in the case of CARDINAL accused ) , abuse of public authority on account of the unlawful arrest of the persons occupying ORG ( CARDINAL accused ) and simple bodily harm ( CARDINAL accused ) had elapsed , ORG discontinued proceedings against them . The proceedings against the Head of the VII Nucleo antisommossa , who had been convicted at first instance for causing aggravated bodily harm , were also discontinued on account of mitigating circumstances . Finally , ORG acquitted a person accused of simple slander and unlawful carrying of a weapon of war and another person accused of simple slander .", "CARDINAL . Most of the sentences involving payment of damages and costs and expenses as passed at first instance were upheld in substance , and , at the appeal level , the accused persons who had been convicted for the first time were also held civilly liable .", "CARDINAL . In the reasons for the judgment ( CARDINAL pages of a total of CARDINAL ) , ORG firstly pointed out that even if the suspicions concerning weapons used by LOC members during their looting could , in principle , have justified searching the schools , there was nevertheless scant evidence that all the persons occupying the CARDINAL schools were armed and could be considered as belonging to LOC .", "CARDINAL . ORG further stated that several factors demonstrated that the operation had in no way been geared to identifying the members of LOC and had been quite different in nature .", "CARDINAL . First of all , right from the planning stages of the \u201c search \u201d the senior police officials had allegedly specified that the VII Nucleo antisommossa and other heavily armed officers would be in the front line of the security forces ; those units had not been given any precise instructions concerning the use of force against those occupying the school , their sole task being to \u201c secure \u201d ( mettere in sicurezza ) the building .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , even those individuals who had been outside the Diaz - Pertini School and had not put up the least resistance had been immediately attacked by the security forces .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , the security forces had launched their assault by breaking down the doors without attempting to negotiate with the occupiers , explaining that a \u201c non - violent search \u201d was to be carried out , or to induce them voluntarily to open the door , which , according to ORG , they had justifiably closed . On entry into the building the officers had systematically beaten those inside in a cruel and sadistic manner , inter alia using non - regulation batons . According to ORG , the traces of blood to be seen on the photographs taken during the inspection of the LOC had been fresh and could only have stemmed from the above - mentioned violence , contrary to the \u201c shameful contention \u201d ( vergognosa PERSON ) that they had been the result of injuries sustained during the clashes which had occurred over DATE .", "DATE . In the light of those factors ORG concluded that the aim of the whole operation had been to carry out a large number of arrests , even in the absence of any judicial purpose , the main thing being to remedy a media image of a powerless police force . The most senior officials of the security forces had therefore surrounded the VII Nucleo antisommossa with a heavily armed unit equipped with tonfa - type truncheons capable of dealing lethal blows , and that unit have been exclusively instructed to neutralise the persons occupying the Diaz - Pertini School , stigmatising them as dangerous troublemakers who had caused all the unlawful damage of DATE . The violent and coordinated action of all the officers who had participated in the operation had been the logical consequence of the instructions given .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , according to ORG , all the most senior officials of the VII Nucleo antisommossa , as a minimum , had been guilty of causing the injuries inflicted on the persons occupying the buildings . As regards the higher - ranking police officers , ORG pointed out that the decision not to request their committal for trial had impeded proper assessment of their criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG held that once the decision to storm the building and make the arrests had been taken , the security forces had attempted to justify their action a posteriori .", "CARDINAL . In that connection ORG noted that during the investigation the persons occupying the school had been attributed responsibility for offences which they had not committed : the investigation had in no way shown that the occupiers had resisted the security forces or that they had thrown objects at them while standing in the schoolyard , whereby some of the officers had probably raised their shields merely as a precaution ; and above all , having regard to all the circumstances of the case , the alleged knife attack on an officer during the storming of the building had proven to be a \u201c bare - faced lie \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further noted that the most senior officials in the security forces who were present in situ , had decided to place both the Molotov cocktails that had been found elsewhere during the afternoon among the items collected during the search , with a view to justifying the decision to conduct the search and to arrest the persons occupying the school . ORG of PERSON took the view that since the arrests had been devoid of any factual or legal basis , they had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In determining the appropriate sentences , ORG found that apart from the Head of the VII Nucleo antisommossa , who had attempted to limit the violence and had finally admitted the offences during the proceedings , no mitigating circumstances could be acknowledged in respect of the other accused . Having regard to the applicant \u2019s statements , ORG pointed out that the members of the security forces had turned into \u201c violent thugs \u201d indifferent to any physical vulnerability bound up with sex and age and to any sign of capitulation , even on the part of persons who had just been abruptly awakened by the noise of the attack . Moreover , the officers had compounded the violence with threats and insults . In doing so they had discredited GPE in the eyes of the international community . Moreover , once the violence had been perpetrated , the security forces advanced a whole series of fabricated \u201c facts \u201d implicating the occupiers .", "In ORG opinion , the systematic and coordinated nature of the act of violence committed by the police officers and the aforementioned attempts to justify them a posteriori constituted a deliberate , concerted effort rather than a state of stress and fatigue .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , having regard to the fact the whole impugned operation had originated in the instruction from the Head of Police to carry out arrests and that the accused had therefore clearly acted under the psychological pressure of that instruction , ORG determined the sentences on the basis of the minimum penalty laid down in criminal law for each of the offences in question .", "CARDINAL . The accused , ORG with ORG , ORG ( which was civilly liable ) and some of the victims , appealed on points of law against the appeal judgment ; the applicant and other victims claimed civil damages in those proceedings .", "DATE . By judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , deposited on DATE , ORG essentially upheld the impugned judgment , although it declared the offence of aggravated bodily harm for which CARDINAL of the accused had been convicted at first instance and CARDINAL at second instance ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In its grounds of judgment ( CARDINAL pages of a total of CARDINAL ) , ORG first of all examined the objection as to the constitutionality of LAW on statute - barring of criminal offences as submitted by ORG under LAW and , secondarily , under LAW . It observed DATE as the first- and second - instance decisions had noted , in a finding which had never in fact been contested DATE \u201c the violence perpetrated by the police during their storming of the PERSON school [ had been ] egregious \u201d . The \u201c utmost gravity \u201d of the police conduct stemmed from the fact that the widespread violent acts committed throughout the school premises had been unleashed against individuals who were obviously unarmed , sleeping or sitting with their hands up ; it was therefore a case of \u201c unjustified violence [ which ] , as rightly pointed out by ORG , [ was carried out ] for punitive purposes , for retribution , geared to causing humiliation and physical and mental suffering on the part of the victims \u201d . According to ORG , the violence might have qualified as \u201c torture \u201d under the terms of ORG or else as \u201c inhuman or degrading treatment \u201d under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that in the absence of an explicit criminal offence within the NORP legal system , the impugned violent acts had been prosecuted on the basis of simple or aggravated bodily harm , which offences , pursuant to LAW , had been the subject of a discontinuance decision on the ground that the limitation period had expired during the proceedings . It noted that that had been why ORG had complained of the contradiction between the regulations on the statute - barring of the criminal offences laid down in LAW inasmuch as that provision did not include ill - treatment within the meaning of LAW among the offences not subject to limitation DATE and in LAW , which , in accordance with the ORG \u2019s well - established case - law , required the imposition of appropriate penalties on ill - treatment and therefore impeded the limitation of offences or criminal proceedings in cases of ill - treatment .", "Nevertheless , ORG considered that a change in the rules on limitation as envisaged by ORG lay outside the jurisdiction of ORG because , LAW , only the law could establish offence and criminal penalties .", "CARDINAL . As regards the convictions for offence of bodily harm , ORG , having reiterated the events preceding the impugned police storming of the school ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , considered logical ORG finding that the instruction from the Head of Police to carry out arrests had , right from the outset , \u201c militarised \u201d the search operation which the police was to conduct in the school . ORG held that the very large number of officers and the lack of instructions regarding alternatives to a tear - gas assault on the school ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and regarding the use of force against the occupiers , among other factors , showed that that operation had not been designed as a peaceful search of the LOC . The operational methods used had caused virtually all the persons occupying the school to be beaten up , which explained ORG upholding of the responsibility , inter alia , of the officials heading the VII Nucleo antisommossa . First of all , the latter had given no instructions on how the building was to be \u201c secured \u201d and had at no stage informed the officers of the possible presence of harmless individuals ; secondly , they had not prevented the attacks on persons standing outside the building , the violent storming of the school and the assault on the persons occupying the LOC . In conclusion , as ORG had rightly found , those officials had been aware that violence was inherent in that type of operation .", "ORG noted , however , that even the offences of aggravated bodily harm had become statute - barred on DATE by dint of scheduling , the calculation criteria and the interruptions of proceedings provided for in Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW as amended by LAW . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG also upheld the findings of the appeal judgment as regards the offences of providing false information , slander and unlawful carrying of weapons of war perpetrated in the framework of a \u201c disgraceful whitewashing operation \u201d in order to justify a posteriori the violence perpetrated in the school and the arrest of those occupying it . ORG noted that the persons occupying the school had not put up any r\u00e9sistance either before the entrance door had been broken down or inside the LOC , and also that the occupiers had not been in possession of Molotov cocktails , which had been brought into the school from the outside by the police . Therefore , ORG declared mendacious the police reports to the contrary and slanderous the conspiracy charges levelled against the occupiers . As regards the conclusions of the appeal judgment concerning the alleged knife attack on an officer , ORG merely specified the sentence passed on CARDINAL officers convicted of providing this false information ( DATE and DATE , as indicated in the reasons given for the appeal judgment , rather than DATE and DATE as indicated in the operative part ) .
