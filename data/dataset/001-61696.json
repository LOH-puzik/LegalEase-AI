Further , medical evidence of recent ill - treatment by the police was obtained by the ORG delegation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further observed that several of the police establishments visited still possessed interrogation rooms of a highly intimidating nature and stressed that facilities of this kind had no place in a modern police service .", "DATE . In the ORG report on its visit in DATE , published on DATE with the authorisation of ORG , the ORG expressed concerns about the continued use in the eastern part of GPE of interrogation rooms with a highly intimidating character , such as those seen in the Anti - Terror Departments at A\u011fr\u0131 , ORG , ORG and ORG and in ORG . According to the ORG , such oppressive facilities had no place in a modern police service .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further stated in this report that the findings made in the DATE visit indicated that the blindfolding of persons in police / gendarmerie custody remained common practice throughout GPE and that persons suspected of narcotics or terrorist offences were apparently particularly prone to this practice . It noted that blindfolds were usually applied at the \u201c preliminary questioning \u201d stage prior to the taking of a formal statement , i.e. at the time when ill - treatment was most likely to occur . It could further not be ruled out that blindfolds were also applied at later stages . The ORG had been told by certain persons that they had been obliged to sign statements attributed to them whilst blindfolded . After the ORG delegation had discovered a blindfold in an interrogation room inspected , the delegation was informed by a senior officer that it would be applied to certain suspects undergoing questioning in order to prevent them from seeing the interrogating officers . In its report the ORG stated that it was clear from the information gathered by it over DATE that in many , if not most , cases , persons were blindfolded in order to prevent them from being able to identify law - enforcement officials who inflicted ill - treatment upon them . As a result of this practice , legal proceedings against those who tortured and illtreated could be severely hampered .", "CARDINAL . As regards the medical examination of persons held in custody , as already addressed in considerable detail in previous ORG visit reports , the ORG noted that dialogue with the NORP authorities on this point had focused on QUANTITY issues : the principle that law - enforcement officials should not be present during the medical examination , and possible exceptions to that principle ; and the need to ensure that doctors carrying out the medical examination used the standard forensic medical form approved by the NORP authorities . The ORG delegation that carried out the visit in DATE found that there remained much room for progress as regards both these issues , in particular in the eastern part of GPE , where interviews with detained persons suggested that it was very rare for lawenforcement officials not to be present during medical examinations . Numerous persons stated that they had been warned prior to the examination not to say anything to the doctor about the treatment they had received , and that the presence of law - enforcement officials during the examination had ensured that they heeded that warning . Some persons interviewed stated that when the doctor had inquired as to the origin of injuries they bore the law - enforcement official present had protested . Doctors at ORG in ORG acknowledged that the examination always took place in the presence of police officers or members of the gendarmerie . In discussion with doctors at ORG , it was indicated that it was common for CARDINAL or more persons to be examined simultaneously and that lesions observed might not be recorded \u201c in order to avoid problems with the police \u201d . The ORG further concluded that it was clear that , instead of using the \u201c ORG \u201d approved by the NORP authorities , the old practice of very brief findings set out on a piece of paper without any headings , and often covering several detained persons , remained common .", "CARDINAL . Reiterating that no legal safeguard against ill - treatment was more fundamental than the requirement that the fact of a person 's deprivation of liberty be recorded without delay , the ORG indicated in its report that the current practice concerning the recording of detention required improvements in certain respects . It appeared that the trigger for making an entry in the book of admissions was the fact of placing someone in a cell . As a person could be deprived of his liberty for TIME in a lawenforcement establishment before being placed in a cell , this initial period of detention often appeared to go unrecorded .", "CARDINAL . In the preliminary observations made by the ORG delegation on its visit carried out in DATE , it was noted that prison staff were still present during medical examinations . The ORG delegation further indicated that it had gathered compelling evidence of severe ill - treatment of several persons held by the gendarmerie in ORG in DATE . This illtreatment had apparently begun during the initial period of custody and had continued during the period spent in the custody of the gendarmerie . The delegates ' visit to ORG , where the illtreatment was said to have occurred , reinforced the credibility of the allegations made . It was of an oppressive and intimidating nature , not unlike the facilities criticised in the ORG report on its DATE visit .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG delegates further discovered that , in GPE , lawenforcement officials were systematically present when suspects were medically examined at the outset and at the end of their custody . Many prisoners interviewed told the ORG delegates that they had been warned not to make any complaints to the doctor about how they had been treated , and that the presence of law - enforcement officials had deterred them from making complaints . Some doctors spoken to indicated that , despite their objections , law - enforcement officials had been present during medical examinations . Moreover , some doctors mentioned cases in which reports which they had drawn up recording injuries had been torn up by law - enforcement officials ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "3", "5", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "5-1", "5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
