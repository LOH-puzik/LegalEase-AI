She brings this application on her own behalf and on behalf of her children , A. , born in DATE , and B. born in DATE , also GPE nationals . She is represented by PERSON , of FAC , GPE .", "The applicants in application no . CARDINAL , C. and NORP , born in DATE and DATE , are represented by their guardian and solicitor , Mr P. ORG , a solicitor practising in GPE and are also GPE nationals .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "S. met the father of A. and B. in DATE . They started to cohabit in DATE . She already had a son PERSON from a previous relationship . In DATE , a boy , was born and PERSON , a girl , was born in DATE .", "Serious problems emerged in the family in DATE when P ran away from home . He alleged that his stepfather , the father of GPE and PERSON , had repeatedly beaten him . ORG arranged a foster placement . The father denied the allegations and S. supported him . At a case conference in DATE , the father was arrested for threatening behaviour . He was subsequently charged and sentenced to community service . ORG issued applications for a care order in respect of P. and supervision orders in respect of A. and B.", "In DATE , PERSON made allegations of sexual abuse against his stepfather . A child protection investigation followed . The stepfather denied the allegations , supported by S.", "On DATE , NORP and NORP were taken into care pursuant to an emergency protection order and placed in foster care .", "In DATE , S. separated from A. and B. \u2019s father .", "While the paediatric examinations of A. and B. were inconclusive , an expert reported that the father presented an unacceptable risk to them and that S. , their mother , was unable to protect them . He recommended therapy for the mother .", "ORG sought care orders for all CARDINAL children . Its care plan for PERSON was that he should remain in care . The care plan for PERSON and PERSON was to attempt to rehabilitate them with S.", "On DATE , after a hearing , ORG judge found that the father had sexually abused PERSON and beaten the children with a slipper . She also found that PERSON had failed to protect them . While it was agreed that there should be a care order in respect of P. , there was some debate as to the orders to be made in respect of GPE and GPE and the children \u2019s guardian elicited assurances from ORG on the package of support and treatment available to the family which was needed to make rehabilitation viable . S. \u2019s counsel sought some guarantee of performance , or a safeguard in respect of breach . She argued , inter alia , that it was neither necessary nor proportionate for a care order to be made on the footing that all power and responsibility should pass to ORG . PERSON was sceptical , on past experience , whether ORG would carry out the care plan for A. and B. She contended that only interim care orders should be made while the children \u2019s guardian sought final care orders . The judge made final care orders in respect of all CARDINAL children expressing confidence that ORG would implement the care plan . The applicant appealed .", "The care plan had envisaged reunification within DATE . Within DATE which followed between the orders and the appeal hearing , little happened . Meetings occurred between PERSON and the social worker assigned to NORP and PERSON of the planned family therapy work took place . No social worker was provided to assist LOC programme was not started until DATE . No therapy was started for the mother . ORG later called this a \u201c striking and fundamental failure \u201d to implement the care plan and noted that most of the assurances given by the social workers and accepted by the guardian ad litem and judge had proved vain . It found that this was not a matter of bad faith and that the principal cause of the failings was a financial crisis within the authority leading to substantial cuts in the social services budget . The sad history of potentially disastrous failure fully vindicated the line taken by PERSON \u2019s counsel at trial .", "The CARDINAL brothers , C. and NORP , were born in DATE and DATE respectively , to an NORP mother and NORP father . The parents had a volatile relationship with periods of separation .", "Concern arose as to the GPE ability to meet the children \u2019s needs centring on the GPE relationship and the mother \u2019s mental health . In DATE , anxiety deepened . The mother made allegations about the father which were not substantiated . The mother \u2019s conduct deteriorated . Her medical history included diagnoses of borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder . There was concern about the children \u2019s emotional development .", "On DATE , ORG ( \u201c the Council \u201d ) applied for care orders and moved the children into foster care under an emergency protection order . The ORG \u2019s final care plan was that the children should be placed with the maternal grandparents with continuing direct contact for both parents . The grandparents who lived in the GPE agreed to move to GPE . The children were to remain in foster care until they arrived . The children \u2019s guardian supported this placement . During the period leading up to the hearing , both parents showed significant progress in understanding their own problems and those of the children and made efforts to work with the various doctors and experts engaged in the case . The mother , now conclusively diagnosed as having bipolar disorder and a personality trait , had come to accept her mental illness and the need for treatment and medication . The parents were living together again and wished to have the children returned .", "On DATE , ORG commenced hearing evidence on the care applications . In his judgment on DATE , the judge stated that there was no question of ruling the parents out in the longterm but , for the present and near future , concluded that the children were unable to return safely to their parents : \u201c possibly , or even probably , it may be appropriate in DATE , but not now . \u201d All the parties agreed that the maternal grandparents would be suitable carers , although the evidence that they would in fact be able to move to GPE was \u201c exiguous in the extreme \u201d . The judge described the care plan as inchoate because of all the uncertainties involved , not only concerning the grandparents but also the outcome of further assessment and therapy for the boys , the final outcome of marital work for the parents and the possibility of improvements with the mother \u2019s personality traits . Nonetheless , the judge made care orders for both children .", "The parents applied for and obtained permission to appeal , submitting that the judge had erred in granting a final care order when so many issues were uncertain . Meanwhile , there was delay in the maternal grandparents obtaining residence and work permits and the boys were moved due to their foster mother suffering an accident .", "ORG heard appeals in both cases together .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG proposed adopting a new approach to meet the situation where the judge \u2019s evaluation of what was in the best interests of a child risked conflicting with events as they occurred after a final care order had been made . It was noted that while the parents might have the right to apply to the courts under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE alleging a fundamental failure to implement a care plan , there was no person to act for a child if the parent did not choose to act . The guardian would have ceased to act and would no longer have any supervisory authority .", "First , the court enunciated guidelines intended to give trial judges a wider discretion to make an interim care order , rather than a final order .", "Second , in an innovation described by ORG as \u201c radical \u201d , ORG propounded a new procedure for the period after the making of a care order by which at trial the essential milestones of a care plan would be identified and elevated to a \u201c starred status \u201d . If a starred milestone was not achieved within a reasonable time after the date set at trial , the local authority would be obliged to \u201c reactivate the interdisciplinary process that contributed to the creation of the care plan \u201d . The local authority would at least have to inform the child \u2019s guardian . Either the guardian or the local authority would then have the right to apply to the court for further directions .", "As regarded the GPE case , ORG considered the outcome finely balanced and declined to disturb the judge \u2019s order . It was noted that the children might have remedies under LAW if necessary but that meanwhile there had been sufficient progress in the case to make further referral to ORG an unnecessary distraction in the case .", "As regarded the GPE case , it was clear that the care plan was insufficiently mature and that the judge had wanted more time to await developments but had been constrained by case - law to make the full care order . The judge should have insisted on more information before making the order or on a report back if matters did not turn out as expected . It allowed the appeal in that case , replacing the final care order with an interim one and remitting the case to the judge for further consideration .", "S. appealed in the ORG case while the Secretary of ORG and ORG , supported by ORG , appealed against the reasoning of ORG , although not against the substantive orders made .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , the judge in the ORG case starred various items in the final care plan : a parenting assessment was to be completed by DATE , a course of therapy for PERSON was to be completed by DATE and a decision about the immediate goals of the care plan ( reunification with PERSON or long term foster care ) was to be made by DATE . She directed ORG to provide a progress report to the children \u2019s guardian , or in the absence of the guardian , to the court if a starred element was not achieved within DATE of the specified dates . By the time of ORG hearing , it was stated that the starred plan was working well and the children \u2019s interests were being met .", "In the GPE case , setting aside the final care order had the unfortunate consequence of augmenting uncertainty . The maternal grandparents were reluctant to move to GPE without a final care order . On DATE , the judge made a final care order with the consent of the guardian and without any opposition from the parents . The care order was not starred . The agreement attached to the care order which was intended to supplement the care plan , indicated that the children would be in the care of the ORG , that the maternal grandparents would be encouraged to move to the area as soon as possible and that it was in the best interests of the children for the legal proceedings to end . It was recorded that the parents believed that the family would be rehabilitated within DATE and that the parents would apply to discharge the care order in the event that the children had not been placed with the grandparents by DATE , the grandparents became unable to care for the children or the children were not rehabilitated to the GPE care within DATE . It was further agreed that the ORG would convene a statutory review in DATE at which the issue of rehabilitation would be specifically considered .", "In its judgment of DATE ( ORG Care Order : Implementation of Care Plan ) and ORG ) ( Care Order : Adequacy of Care Plan ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL FLR CARDINAL ) , ORG rejected PERSON \u2019s appeal and allowed the appeal of the local authority .", "The headnote of the reported case summarised the judgment as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG had set out its clear intention in LAW DATE that once a care order had been made , the responsibility for the child \u2019s care thereafter lay with the authority , not with the courts , and the courts were not empowered to intervene . The division of responsibility was a cardinal principle of the LAW . The introduction of a system which gave the court a supervisory role following the making of a care order went beyond the bounds of the court \u2019s judicial jurisdiction because it involved a substantial departure from one of the cardinal principles of LAW . LAW DATE required primary legislation to be read and given effect in a way compatible with Convention rights , so far as was possible , but the judicial innovation of starred milestones passed well beyond the boundary of interpretation and would constitute amendment . The starring system could not be seen as a mere judicial remedy for victims of actual or proposed unlawful conduct by local authorities entrusted with the care of children , justified by ss CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , as the proposed system would impose obligations on authorities in circumstances where there had been no finding of unlawful conduct and , indeed , no breach or proposed breach of the Convention ...", "( CARDINAL ) LAW DATE was not itself incompatible with or inconsistent with Art CARDINAL of the Convention . Infringement of the right to respect for family and private life was only likely to arise if a local authority failed properly to discharge its responsibilities under LAW DATE ; those responsibilities were not themselves an infringement of rights under Art CARDINAL . It might be that there was a failure to provide an effective remedy against local authority infringements of rights under Art CARDINAL , as while parents would have an effective remedy in the judicial review process or through proceedings under s CARDINAL of LAW DATE , in practice a child with no parent to act for them might not always have such a remedy , but that was not in itself an infringement of Art CARDINAL . Under the Convention , failure to provide an effective remedy for infringement of a Convention right was an infringement of Art CARDINAL , but Art CARDINAL was not a Convention right under LAW DATE . Therefore , legislation which failed to provide an effective remedy for infringement of Art CARDINAL was not , for that reason , incompatible with a Convention right within the meaning of LAW DATE ...", "( CARDINAL ) Circumstances might perhaps arise in which LANGUAGE law relating to some decisions by local authorities concerning care of children would not satisfy the requirements of Art CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ... The failure to provide access to a court as guaranteed by Art CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) meant that LANGUAGE law might be incompatible with Art CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , but the absence of such a provision from a particular statute did not mean that the statute itself was incompatible with Art CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . The absence in LAW DATE of effective machinery for protecting the civil rights of young children with no parent or guardian was a statutory lacuna , not a statutory incompatibility . The inability of parents or children to challenge in court care decisions , however fundamental , made by a local authority while a care order was in force , was a different matter . Judicial review apart , the opportunity to challenge such decisions in court would be in conflict with the scheme of the CARDINAL LAW . The issue of whether in this respect LAW DATE was incompatible did not arise in this case , as the parties concerned had not lacked a court forum in which to express their concern at the lack of progress ...", "( CARDINAL ) Interim care orders were not intended to be used as a means by which the court might continue to exercise a supervisory role over the local authority in cases in which it was in the best interests of a child that a care order should be made . Problems had arisen about how far courts should go in attempting to resolve the uncertainties within care plans before making a care order . Where an uncertainty needed to be resolved before the court could decide whether it was in the best interests of the child to make a care order at all , the court should finally dispose of the matter only when the material facts were as clearly known as could be hoped . Some uncertainties relating to the details of the care plan were suitable for immediate resolution , in whole or in part , by the court in the course of disposing of the care order application ; other uncertainties could and should be resolved before the court proceeded , during a limited period of \u2018 planned and LOC delay . Frequently the uncertainties involved in a care plan could only be worked out after the making of an order . Despite all the inevitable uncertainties , when deciding to make a care order the court should normally have before it a care plan which was sufficiently firm and particularised for all concerned to have a reasonably clear picture of the likely way ahead for the child in the foreseeable future . The degree of firmness to be expected , as well as the amount of detail in the plan , would vary from case to case , but if the parents and the child \u2019s guardian were to have a fair and adequate opportunity to make representations to the court on whether a care order should be made , the care plan must be appropriately specific . The court must always maintain a proper balance between the need to satisfy itself about the appropriateness of the care plan and the avoidance of over - zealous investigation into matters which were the responsibility of the local authority . \u201d", "Lord PERSON noted that the court would only ordinarily grant relief to a person who was victim of an actual and proposed breach of a Convention right . In the GPE case , the problem had been essentially \u201c drift \u201d in the implementation of the care plan . In practice however , the mother , PERSON , had not lacked a court forum in which to express her deep concern . Her appeal enabled her to raise these matters in ORG and the intervention of that court appeared to have galvanised the local authority into taking the necessary action , if belatedly .", "He went on to state :", "\u201c I must finally make an observation of a general character . In this speech I have sought to explain my reasons for rejecting ORG initiative over starred milestones . I can not stress too strongly that the rejection of this innovation on legal grounds must not obscure the pressing need for the Government to attend to the serious practical and legal problems identified by ORG or mentioned by me . CARDINAL of the questions needing urgent consideration is whether some degree of court supervision of local authorities\u2019 discharge of their parental responsibilities would bring an overall improvement in the quality of child care provided by local authorities . Answering this question calls for a wider examination than can be undertaken by a court . The judgments of ORG in this case have performed a valuable service in highlighting the need for such an examination to be conducted without delay . \u201d", "In the GPE case , the ORG had decided that long term reunification should be the stated goal of the care plans of A. and PERSON had continued to receive therapy after DATE , in particular regarding her re - instigation of contact with the children \u2019s father . Contact was suspended in DATE as a result of ORG renewed contacts with the father but resumed after DATE and ad hoc TIME stays had taken place by DATE . The care plans were amended in light of changed circumstances so as to state that shared care ( between PERSON and a children \u2019s home or foster family ) was the immediate goal . By DATE , the children were regularly staying with S. at DATE . The most recent review meeting in DATE recorded that the care plan was for shared care , with up to TIME per week with PERSON , together with long term foster placements for NORP and PERSON However , contact is currently less than that , due to difficult behaviour by GPE and B.", "In the GPE case , the grandparents moved to GPE , with financial assistance , and the children were duly placed with them on DATE . They had contact with their parents CARDINAL to CARDINAL times a week . By DATE , a dispute had arisen between the parents and the ORG as to the appropriateness of TIME contact . The parents intimated that they might apply to the court DATE of LAW DATE to increase their contact rights but did not do so . Contact gradually increased and overnight contact began on CARDINAL DATE . DATE , the children stayed alternate weekends with their parents and after a review in DATE this was increased to CARDINAL weekends per month . At DATE , a dispute arose as to whether the children should return permanently , which the local authority considered could not yet occur due to lack of compliance with the relevant regulations , in particular that a written agreement be reached with the parents as to various matters . The parents again intimated that they might apply to the court for increased contact but did not do so . By DATE , the children had been formally placed with their parents . At a further review on DATE , the chairperson of the statutory review considered that an application should be made to discharge the care order although family support would continue . The ORG however considered that there should be a further period of assessment .", "Under LAW of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , on the application of any local authority or authorised person , the court may make an order placing the child in the care of a designated local authority ( \u201c a care order \u201d ) . The preconditions under section LAW ) are that the court must be satisfied that the child is suffering , or likely to suffer , significant harm ; and that the harm is attributable to the care given , or likely to be given , not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give . There is no power under LAW for a care order to be made on terms , or accompanied by directions , whether in accordance with a care plan or otherwise . A care plan may be discharged ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) or substituted by a supervision order ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . An interim care order may be made under section ORG which lasts for DATE initially and if renewed for DATE . The judgment of Lord PERSON in this case is regarded as the leading authority on the scope for the granting of interim care orders , namely , as a temporary \u201c holding \u201d measure where the care plan seems inchoate or where the passage of a relatively brief period seems bound to see the fulfilment of some event or process vital to the planning and deciding the future . An interim care order is not a means of exercising a supervisory role over the local authority \u2019s implementation of its care plan but gives the court sufficient flexibility to defer making a final order until satisfied that the way ahead is no longer obscured by an uncertainty that is neither inevitable nor chronic .", "In deciding whether to make a care order , the court must have before it the details of the local authority \u2019s proposed care plan . This is to be put on a statutory footing by new legislation . Section CARDINAL of ORG will insert a new section CARDINALA in the LAW requiring a care plan to be prepared by the local authority for the purposes of any application which may result in the making of an order . According to the Government , this was expected to come into force in DATE .", "Once a care order has been made , a court retains jurisdiction CARDINAL aspects :", "under LAW , the local authority must allow the child reasonable contact with his parents and the court can adjudicate on any dispute as to what is reasonable contact or to vary or discharge any contact order ;", "the court may entertain an application by the local authority , parent or child , to discharge the care order or substitute some other order e.g. a supervision order .", "Section CARDINAL provides for the appointment by the court of a \u201c Children \u2019s Guardian \u201d ( an officer of ORG \u201c ORG \u201d ) for the purposes of specified proceedings e.g. applications for the making or discharge of care and supervision orders . ORG \u2019s primary function is to safeguard and promote the welfare of children . When the court rules on an application , the ORG \u2019s role comes to end . There is no statutory provision for ORG to have a role outside active court proceedings .", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides for the appointment by the local authority of an \u201c independent reviewing officer \u201d ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The ORG is independent of the line management involved in the child \u2019s case and his / her role is to participate in statutory reviews , monitoring the authority \u2019s functions and referring the case to ORG if appropriate . Referral allows a Children \u2019s Guardian to take any necessary action through the courts by acting for the child either in proceedings for judicial review or freestanding claims under LAW DATE ( \u201c HRA \u201d ) .
