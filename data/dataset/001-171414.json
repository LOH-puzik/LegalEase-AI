On DATE the Radom - Wsch\u00f3d District Prosecutor discontinued the investigation into the alleged failure by the prison guards to fulfil their duties . The allegation was related to their failure to keep the applicant \u2019s father under constant surveillance and to seize his belt , which he had used to commit suicide ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The prosecutor established that those acts did not constitute a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor also discontinued the investigation into alleged negligence by PERSON , a clerk at FAC who had incorrectly credited a payment of ORG MONEY by ORG to another debtor . The prosecutor established that prosecution of the impugned offence had become time - barred .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the facts , the prosecutor established that during PERSON \u2019s admission to the remand centre on DATE , the prison guard FAC had noticed that GPE had been anxious and tearful . PERSON had contested his imprisonment as unjust . Consequently , the guards S.S. and PERSON had decided to check with ORG as to whether the fine had been paid and were told that that was not the case . Next , PERSON was to be examined by a male nurse , PERSON The male nurse noticed that PERSON had been agitated and tearful and had declared that he would go on a hunger strike . Having regard to those circumstances , the male nurse had requested that GPE be taken to a medical room for examination by a doctor . At TIME PERSON had been taken to a medical room where he was to be examined by a doctor , ORG had been anxious , tearful and convinced that he had been wronged by the court and the police . PERSON had refused to be examined or take any medication . He had also declared that he would refuse any food and drink in protest at his imprisonment . PERSON had not revealed any suicidal thoughts . Doctor PERSON had agreed to ORG incarceration but had recommended that he be seen by a psychiatrist at DATE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME PERSON had been taken to transit cell no . CARDINAL where he was to wait for his prison underwear and hygiene products . At QUANTITY the prison guard GPE had seen through the peephole that GPE was lying on the floor . PERSON had entered the cell and noticed that a belt was tied around GPE \u2019s neck . He had taken the belt off GPE \u2019s neck and , together with another guard , PERSON , had begun resuscitation procedures . At TIME an emergency services doctor had declared PERSON dead .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor also had regard to the findings of the forensic expert . The expert , having carried out a post - mortem , established the presence of a slight strangulation mark on ORG \u2019s neck and a number of injuries which had likely resulted from his hitting objects while in convulsion . The expert further established that the direct cause of death had been hanging . The result of his examination allowed it to be established that it had been a suicide .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor found no evidence pointing to the involvement of third parties in the impugned incident .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor took a number of investigative measures aimed at determining whether the prison guards had failed to fulfil their duties . She interviewed the prison guard GPE He testified that certain objects , such as mobile telephones , penknives and screwdrivers , were taken from prisoners . However , the applicable regulations did not require that belts or laces should also be seized . The prosecutor analysed the applicable regulations and concluded that belts and laces were not regarded as dangerous objects .", "CARDINAL . With regard to alleged negligence on the part of the prison , the prosecutor established that the actions of the prison guards had not disclosed any failure to fulfil their duties . The prison guards had acted with appropriate diligence in supervising PERSON Not seizing ORG \u2019s belt in the process of his admission to the remand centre had been in compliance with the relevant regulations . There had been no grounds to suspect that ORG would make an attempt on his own life despite his strong emotional reaction to his incarceration . The doctor interviewing PERSON had not identified any suicidal tendencies . Furthermore , after seeing PERSON lying unconscious on the floor , the prison guards had reacted appropriately to the situation . In conclusion , the prosecutor found that the actions of the prison guards had not constituted any of the criminal offences prescribed in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother appealed against the prosecutor \u2019s decision . She argued , inter alia , that the prison guards had failed in their duties by not seizing ORG \u2019s belt . That , in consequence , had led to his suicide and death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the applicant \u2019s mother had sought to have the investigation continued and for charges to be brought against specific individuals , eventually leading to their trial and conviction . However , the evidence secured in the investigation had not provided any grounds to accept such a demand .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the prosecutor had correctly established the facts and had properly assessed the comprehensive evidence obtained in the case . It noted that the prosecutor had carried out a number of investigative measures aimed at determining if there had possibly been negligence on the part of the prison guards . However , no such negligence had been established .", "CARDINAL . The court found nothing untoward in the manner in which the prison guards had carried out their duties vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant \u2019s father . They had ensured , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s father had been seen by a doctor . There had been no grounds to believe that the applicant \u2019s father would commit suicide , despite his strong emotional reaction to imprisonment . In accordance with the applicable regulations , the prison guards had not been required to seize the applicant \u2019s father \u2019s belt . Furthermore , they had attempted to resuscitate the applicant \u2019s father . In conclusion , the court accepted the prosecutor \u2019s finding that the actions of the prison guards had not amounted to any of the offences prescribed in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG . It noted that the findings of the civil court could not alter that conclusion and lead to attributing criminal responsibility to the prison guards . The court found that the applicant \u2019s mother had not indicated any relevant circumstances which could lead to the prosecutor \u2019s decision being overturned .", "CARDINAL . The court also accepted the prosecutor \u2019s decision to discontinue the investigation with regard to the court clerk .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a claim against ORG with ORG . His mother acted on his behalf since the applicant was a minor . He sought ORG ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in compensation and a DATE allowance of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in connection with his father \u2019s death . The applicant argued that ORG was liable for his father \u2019s death on account of gross negligence by the prison guards who had failed to ensure his father \u2019s safety . In his view , the belt had been a dangerous object and should definitely have been seized by the prison guards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It held that the prison guards had acted lawfully and in accordance with LAW and that therefore ORG could not be held liable . In addition , the court held that there had been no causal link between ORG \u2019s death and the actions of the prison guards .", "CARDINAL . ORG established that GPE had been agitated during his admission to the remand centre but considered that to be a standard reaction . The prison guards had checked with ORG and , despite PERSON \u2019s claims to the contrary , it had confirmed that CARDINAL instalment of ORG \u2019s fine had not been paid . During his medical examination , ORG had informed the doctor that he had left children at home unsupervised but he had not revealed any suicidal thoughts . The doctor had concluded that ORG could be admitted to the remand centre and that there was no need for an immediate psychiatric consultation . Having regard to the above , the court found that there was nothing in GPE \u2019s medical history or circumstances related to the offence which would have indicated that he needed to be put under particularly close supervision or that his belt should have been seized .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG partly allowed his claim . It found ORG liable under LAW and awarded the applicant LAW ( QUANTITY ) in compensation and a DATE allowance of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) . The court dismissed the remainder of the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that under LAW , the administration of a penal institution had a duty to ensure ORG \u2019s behaviour could not be considered as simple agitation . His behaviour had suggested a nervous breakdown caused by a feeling of injustice as ORG had been convinced that he had paid the fine in full . For example , the prison guard GPE had stated in his report that PERSON had displayed disturbing behaviour ( hitting the bed with his fist ) , had been tearful , anxious and agitated , and had declared that he would go on a hunger strike .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that since PERSON \u2019s behaviour had been very different from the norm and that a psychiatric consultation had been recommended for him , then the prison guards should have taken all the necessary steps to ensure his safety . They should have seized any object presenting a risk to his life or health , including his belt or , alternatively , should have put him under constant supervision . Such actions would have prevented ORG death . The court thus held that there was a causal link between the omissions of the prison guards and ORG death .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the claim for compensation , ORG noted that under LAW of LAW it could award an appropriate level of compensation to relatives of a deceased if their situation significantly deteriorated as a result of the person \u2019s death . A significant deterioration in a claimant \u2019s situation depended on the degree of adverse material and immaterial consequences resulting from the death of a relative . ORG found that the amount of compensation sought was grossly excessive and that the claimant ( the applicant ) had not established that his situation had deteriorated to such a degree . For the claimant , the death of his father when he was DATE had certainly been a particularly acute loss which had limited his prospects in life and had amounted to a loss of natural support . Having regard to those and other relevant factors , the court found that the appropriate level of compensation was PLN MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The amount of DATE allowance sought by the applicant was also inflated , the court found . The size should not be higher than the amount ORG would have contributed as a father . Having regard to GPE \u2019s financial situation prior to his death , the court found that a DATE allowance of PLN CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) was reasonable and commensurate with the applicant \u2019s justified needs .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal , contesting the amounts of compensation and DATE allowance as too low . ORG also lodged a cassation appeal . On CARDINAL DATE ORG accepted the defendant \u2019s cassation appeal for examination and refused to admit that of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment in part and remitted the case . It held that the lower court had failed to examine the defendant \u2019s plea that the claim was time - barred . However , it upheld ORG findings in respect of the prison PERSON failure to ensure the safety of the applicant \u2019s father ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a judgment awarding the same level of compensation and DATE allowance to the applicant and dismissing the remainder of the defendant \u2019s appeal . The court examined the defendant \u2019s plea based on the limitation period . To that end the court heard the applicant \u2019s mother . It established that in DATE the applicant \u2019s mother had found proof of payment of all CARDINAL instalments of the fine imposed on her partner made DATE and DATE . It further established that the prosecutor had refused to consider her a party to the investigation and to grant her access to the file . It had only been after the applicant \u2019s mother had complained to ORG that she had been served with the decision to discontinue the investigation on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Accordingly , the DATE limitation period should start to run on DATE . As the claim had been brought on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the defendant \u2019s plea had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW refers to the ORG \u2019s civil liability in the following way :", "\u201c Everyone shall have the right to compensation for any harm done to him by any act of a public authority in breach of the law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment ( no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of DATE , ORG examined the compatibility of LAW with LAW . It held , inter alia , that :", "\u201c In accordance with LAW , the sole basis for [ ORG civil ] liability is an unlawful act by a public authority , it is of no significance whether such an act was subjectively culpable ( subiektywnie zawinione ) . ...", "Having regard to the conditions for [ State ] liability laid down in LAW previously analysed , there is no doubt that \u2018 the personal culpability of a state official\u2019 does not form part of the list of conditions necessary for liability on the part of the public authorities . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
