THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Pauliine Koskelo;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a firm of solicitors based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Google Inc. is a corporation registered in GPE and with its principal place of business there . It provides an Internet blog - publishing service via ORG , a platform that allows any Internet user in any part of the world to create an independent blog free of charge . It includes design tools to help users create layouts for their blogs and , if they do not have their own web address , enables them to host their blogs on ORG web addresses .", "CARDINAL . Blogger.com operates a \u201c Content Policy \u201d which sets out restrictions on what users can do using the service . This makes clear that content such as child pornography , or promoting race hatred , is prohibited . The policy is explained in the following terms :", "\u201c Blogger is a free service for communication , self - expression and freedom of speech . We believe that Blogger increases the availability of information , encourages healthy debate and makes possible new connections between people .", "We respect our users\u2019 ownership of and responsibility for the content they choose to share . It is our belief that censoring this content is contrary to a service that bases itself on freedom of expression .", "In order to uphold these values , we need to curb abuses that threaten our ability to provide this service and the freedom of expression it encourages . As a result , there are some boundaries on the type of content that can be hosted with Blogger . The boundaries we have defined are those that both comply with legal requirements and that serve to enhance the service as a whole . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , ORG operates a \u201c Report Abuse \u201d feature . There are CARDINAL grounds for reporting abuse , including \u201c LAW \u201d . If the user selects LAW , a second screen is displayed which makes it clear that the ORG service is operated in accordance with GPE law , and that defamatory material will only be taken down if it has been found to be libellous ( i.e. unlawful ) by a court . According to ORG , the reason for this policy is that , given the volume of content uploaded by users of the ORG service , it is usually not practicable for it to remove content without first receiving a court \u2019s determination that the content is , in fact , libellous . ORG is not in a position to adjudicate such disputes itself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a piece appeared on the \u201c GPE NORP \u201d blog , a blog hosted on the PERSON website . It contained a photograph of the applicant and the following text :", "\u201c PERSON a NORP council candidate with a TIME shadow has resigned from the party after calling GPE girls \u2018 PERSON .", "GPE who on his ORG page describes himself as an \u2018 ambitious NORP Muslim\u2019 is bizarrely studying law so one would have thought this PERSON prat with Star Trek Spock ears might have engaged the odd brain cell before making these offensive remarks . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A number of anonymous comments were subsequently posted in response to the publication . CARDINAL of the approximately CARDINAL comments are set out , as originally posted , in the following paragraphs .", "CARDINAL . Comment A :", "\u201c I know Mr GPE very well and am surprised that it has taken this long for all this to come out , PERSON is a known drug dealer in thanet and has been taken to court for theft from his employers tescos in GPE .
