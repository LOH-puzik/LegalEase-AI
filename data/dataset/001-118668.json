NORP The applicant , Mr Liborio Garofolo , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in ORG , GPE of GPE - Landschaft . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Deputy Agent , Mr A. Scheidegger , of ORG . ORG , who had been informed of their right to intervene under LAW , did not make use of this right .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Swiss ORG ( Eidgen\u00f6ssische Spielbankenkommission \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) opened investigations against ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a stock corporation under NORP law , on suspicion of having illegally installed gaming machines in establishments other than licensed casinos . On the occasion of a search of the ORG \u2019s business LOC on DATE , ORG officials seized documents indicating that the gaming machines had been installed in agreement with the operators or tenants of such establishments who had shared the profits resulting from the machines\u2019 illegal operation with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . It followed from several of the documents seized during the search that CARDINAL illegal gaming machines delivered by the ORG had been operated in a club run by the applicant . For instance , according to CARDINAL letter agreements addressed to the applicant \u2019s club and dated DATE and DATE respectively it was stipulated that in each case a gaming machine of a type that was not authorised for use outside licensed casinos was to be installed by the ORG at the applicant \u2019s club . It was further agreed that the proceeds from the operation of the respective machines were to be equally split between the parties . The agreement dated DATE was accompanied by a delivery note ( PERSON ) of the same date stating the type and serial number of the machine supplied to the applicant \u2019s club . The seized documents further comprised CARDINAL bills dated DATE , DATE and DATE respectively , demonstrating that gaming machines installed at the applicant \u2019s club by the ORG had generated proceeds which had been divided equally between the ORG and the club \u2019s tenant . Each of the receipts carried the signature of PERSON who at the time had been an employee of the ORG as well as of a representative of the club \u2019s tenant or - as regards the receipt of DATE - the applicant \u2019s own signature . The authorities further seized a list dated CARDINAL DATE setting out commissions collected by PERSON on behalf of the ORG in connection with the operation of gaming machines installed by the ORG at the applicant \u2019s club . The list referred , inter alia , to machines of the type that had been the subject of the aforementioned agreements of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . In addition , the ORG officials seized several computer - generated reports depicting revenues of the ORG resulting from the operation of the said CARDINAL gaming machines .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an official of the ORG accompanied by a police officer carried out a control visit at the applicant \u2019s club , where they discovered an unlicensed gaming machine . The machine carried several stickers indicating that it was for sale . After having verified that the machine , even though switched off , was nevertheless fully operational , the ORG officer ordered that it be confiscated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was heard as a witness ( Auskunftsperson ) in the administrative criminal proceedings ( Verwaltungsstrafverfahren ) instituted by the ORG against the ORG and its management . While conceding that the ORG had installed gaming machines at his club \u2019s LOC in the past which had included machines of the type appearing on the documents seized at the ORG \u2019s premises , the applicant maintained that he had not been aware that the use of such machines outside licensed casinos was prohibited . A machine of the type in question had been operated at his club for DATE but had been disposed of in DATE . By contrast , the gaming machine confiscated by the authorities on DATE had not been installed by the ORG but had been bought by himself DATE back in GPE for private use . The applicant explained that since the machine was no longer functioning he had brought it to the club for the purpose of selling it . The applicant further contended that he did not have any recollection of having been in contact with PERSON in the past .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the ORG also commenced an investigation against the applicant without the latter \u2019s knowledge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON was heard as a witness in the criminal administrative proceedings instituted against PERSON , one the ORG \u2019s management board members . PERSON specified that as an employee of the ORG at the time of the events at issue it had been his task to empty the cash registers of the gaming machines installed by the ORG at a given establishment and to divide the proceeds between the ORG and the respective tenant in accordance with the previously agreed ratio . PERSON testified in this context that he had also collected proceeds generated by gaming machines installed by the ORG at the club run by the applicant , whom he knew personally . He further confirmed that he had drawn up and signed the aforementioned statements on the division of the related proceeds dated CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE at the club \u2019s premises and in the presence of its tenant but did not have any recollection who had signed the receipts on the tenant \u2019s behalf . When presented with a photo of an illegal gaming machine of the type allegedly operated at the applicant \u2019s club , PERSON recalled having seen a similar machine at the club \u2019s premises . He pointed out that it followed from the information on the receipts dated DATE and DATE that proceeds had also been generated by such gaming machine . This clearly showed that the machine had been in use since otherwise its cash register would have been empty . PERSON further stated that he did not know who had drawn up the remainder of the seized reports on revenues generated by the CARDINAL allegedly illegal gaming machines . In PERSON \u2019s opinion it was unlikely that the applicant had been aware that the operation of these machines had been illegal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG established the final record ( Schlussprotokoll ) of its investigations conducted against the applicant which was served on the latter the following day . The record informed the applicant that he was accused of having illegally organised games of chance in violation of LAW lit . a of LAW pertaining to gambling and gambling houses ( GPE \u00fcber GPE und ORG \u2013 see Relevant domestic law below ) . According to the record , the information obtained in the course of the investigations , in particular the documents seized at the ORG \u2019s premises , had demonstrated that in the period from DATE until DATE the applicant had operated up to CARDINAL unlicensed gaming machines at his club and that the resulting proceeds had been equally split between him and the ORG . While the applicant when heard as a witness in the proceedings against the ORG had admitted that an illegal gaming machine supplied by the ORG had been operated at his club for DATE , he had denied that the machine seized at his club had been installed by the ORG or operated for commercial purposes . Having regard to the fact that this machine showed the same serial number as indicated on the delivery note dated DATE , the ORG did , however , conclude that it had been delivered by the ORG . It was further specified in the record that according to the documents seized , the profit realised by the applicant in the period at issue as a consequence of the illegal operation of the said machines amounted to a total of MONEY ( CHF MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "The final record further informed the applicant that , within a time - limit of DATE , he had the right to comment on the ORG \u2019s findings , to apply for the investigations to be complemented and to inspect the investigation files . It was further specified that since the applicant had so far only been heard as a witness in the proceedings against the ORG , he would have the right to request a further hearing in his capacity as accused in respect of the charges brought against him .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant did not submit any comments within the set time frame the ORG , by an order ( PERSON ) of CARDINAL November CARDINAL , found him guilty as charged and imposed a fine of MONEY ( ORG MONEY ) . It further ordered that the confiscated gaming machine be destroyed and sentenced the applicant to pay compensation to the ORG in the amount of CHF MONEY corresponding to the profits he had generated by the machines\u2019 illegal operation . He was further informed about his right to file an objection ( Einsprache ) against the order within a time - limit of DATE , providing reasons and setting out possible means of evidence in its support .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , now represented by counsel , objected to the order after having been granted access to the investigation files . He contended , in particular , that while he had been heard as a witness in the proceedings against the ORG , he had not been informed that investigations had also been commenced with respect to him . He had thus not been granted an opportunity to defend himself . He further contested having exploited illegal gaming machines at his club for commercial purposes . The confiscated machine had not been in use at the club . As regards any other gaming machines installed by the ORG these had been exclusively operated by and for the benefit of the latter .", "CARDINAL . By a penal order ( Strafverf\u00fcgung ) of DATE the ORG , endorsing its order of DATE , dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection . It pointed out that NORP administrative criminal law did not request a formal decision by the authorities on the opening of investigations against an individual but merely required that the initiation of such proceedings was apparent from the official files . In the instant case it followed from the final record of the investigations served on the applicant on DATE that investigations had been opened against him . In accordance with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) such final record could be drawn up even before the accused had been questioned . The record had further informed the applicant about his right to submit comments , to apply for further evidence to be taken and to be heard again by the ORG in his capacity as accused . The applicant had , however , not availed himself of these rights . The ORG further pointed out that the applicant \u2019s allegations that the ORG alone had been entitled to the profits resulting from the machines\u2019 operation and that the gaming machine seized at his club had never been used for commercial purposes were clearly refuted by the content of the documents seized and the veracity of which the ORG had no reason to doubt .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s appeal against the ORG \u2019s penal order , the case was referred at his request to the GPE - Landschaft Criminal Court ( ORG ) for judicial review in accordance with LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "CARDINAL . In his written submissions to ORG the applicant reiterated his allegations that the proceedings before the ORG had disregarded basic rights of the defence on the grounds already set out in his objection of DATE ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) . He complained that criminal proceedings had never been formally opened against him and he had not been informed in due course of the investigations instituted against him . Furthermore , he had never been heard in his capacity as accused in the course of the investigations but only as a witness in the proceedings against GPE He further invoked that due to his insufficient command of the NORP language he had not understood the content of the ORG \u2019s final protocol dated DATE . He finally maintained that the charges brought against him were time - barred .", "The applicant requested that the originals of the seized documents be produced at trial , that the signatures of the club \u2019s representative on the receipts dated DATE , DATE and DATE as well as the delivery order of CARDINAL DATE be compared with his own handwriting and that the files in the proceedings against the ORG \u2019s management be included as evidence in his trial . He further requested that PERSON , PERSON and CARDINAL further employees of the ORG , namely ORG and GPE , who had allegedly supplied gaming machines to his club , be heard as witnesses . He argued that PERSON was a key witness in the proceedings since he was the author of several of the documents that had been used by the ORG as evidence against him and the accuracy of which he contested .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request to hear the aforementioned witnesses and to admit the investigation files against the ORG \u2019s motion on the ground that he had not established why the taking of the requested evidence was relevant for the court \u2019s finding of facts . On DATE ORG decided to abstain from summoning PERSON The witness had informed the ORG that he was currently residing in GPE and while he was ready to appear at trial against compensation of his travel expenses , he did in any event not know the applicant or have any recollection of events relating to the period at issue . Under the circumstances , the court concluded that his convocation would be disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard , inter alia , the applicant , who was represented by counsel and assisted by an interpreter , the ORG official who had seized the illegal gaming machine at the applicant \u2019s club on DATE , PERSON , one of the managing directors of the ORG , as well as ORG , an employee of the ORG who had been involved in the delivery of gaming machines to the applicant \u2019s club . PERSON did not attend the hearing .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the vice - president of ORG ) found the applicant guilty as charged . While reducing the fine previously imposed by the ORG from CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) ORG upheld the remainder of the sentence imposed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG , relying in particular on the contents of the documents seized at the ORG \u2019s premises , found it established that the illegal gaming machines had been used at the applicant \u2019s club for commercial purposes . The copy of the letter agreement dated DATE on the supply of an illegal gaming machine by the ORG to the applicant \u2019s club had provided for the equal splitting of the proceeds resulting from the machine \u2019s operation between the parties . By agreement dated DATE it had been agreed that a gaming machine of the type that later was confiscated by the ORG at the applicant \u2019s club was to be delivered by the ORG and that the proceeds from its operation were also to be divided equally between the ORG and the applicant . The related delivery note of DATE showed the serial number of the installed gaming machine which was identical with the serial number on the confiscated machine . Furthermore , the compilation of commissions collected by PERSON on behalf of the ORG dated DATE as well as the further reports on revenues obtained by the ORG demonstrated that proceeds had been generated by both such machines during the period at issue and showed what proportion of such profits had been allocated to the ORG . The related figures corresponded to statements on the amounts of payments credited to the ORG \u2019s accounts . The court further pointed out that the applicant \u2019s allegations that the confiscated gaming machine had not been functioning was refuted by the testimony of the ORG official who had been present at the club on the occasion of the control visit on DATE and , when heard as witness at trial , had confirmed that the machine had been accessible to the public and fully operational .", "CARDINAL . ORG further referred to the witness statement made by PERSON on DATE in the proceedings against PERSON ( see above \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The court explained that it had not been possible to hear the witness in person on the ground that the latter , according to information provided by the cantonal police , was hospitalised abroad . The court , while noting that the applicant had not had the opportunity to confront PERSON at any stage of the proceedings against him , held that PERSON \u2019s statements could nevertheless be admitted as evidence in the instant proceedings since they were not decisive for the applicant \u2019s conviction and the remaining available evidence was sufficient to prove the applicant \u2019s guilt .", "CARDINAL . ORG specified in this context that in addition to the aforementioned documentary evidence , PERSON had testified at trial that as a rule the proceeds from the operation of gaming machines had been equally split between the ORG and the tenants of the enterprises where the machines had been installed . ORG , who at the time had worked as commercial executive for the ORG , had confirmed that the proceeds from the operation of gaming machines installed at the applicant \u2019s club had also been divided equally . He had further confirmed that he had drawn up the documents dated DATE in relation to the delivery of the machine that had later been confiscated at the applicant \u2019s club . He had handed the documents over to the chauffeur who had been charged with delivering the machine to the applicant \u2019s club . ORG had further testified that the conclusion and implementation of agreements on the installation of gaming machines had been within the exclusive competence of GPE and PERSON and it was inconceivable that machines had been delivered also by PERSON whose function had been limited to emptying the cash registers of machines installed by the ORG . PERSON stated in this context that PERSON had been a reliable employee and the commission invoices established by him had always been accurate . In view of these testimonies ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s allegations that PERSON had regularly exchanged and replaced the machines installed at his club and that for this reason he had not been aware of the type of machines installed at a given moment , were not credible .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Basel - Landschaft Cantonal Court ( PERSON ) and by written submissions dated DATE requested to be acquitted .", "He invoked again that the proceedings had disregarded fundamental rights of the defence in violation of LAW reasons already set out on the occasion of his previous appeals . He further argued that while he had been assisted by an interpreter on the occasion of the trial before ORG he had not disposed of such assistance at the pre - trial stage in the proceedings before the ORG . For this reason his statements on the occasion of his hearing as a witness in the proceedings against the ORG on DATE had been contradictory .", "The applicant further maintained that neither he nor his counsel had been granted an opportunity to examine PERSON , the main witness against him , at any stage of the proceedings in breach of LAW ( d ) of the LAW . This witness had not only incriminated the applicant on the occasion of his hearing on DATE in the proceedings against PERSON but had also produced several of the documents on which ORG had based his conviction and the veracity of which the applicant contested . In the instant case the national authorities could also not exceptionally dispense with a witness hearing on the ground that PERSON was not in a position to attend the trial due to his hospitalisation . In this context it was relevant that the ORG had failed to provide for a possibility to examine PERSON at the pre - trial stage where such confrontation could have been arranged without problems . The applicant consequently reiterated his request that PERSON be heard as a witness in the proceedings . He further repeated his request for an examination of PERSON at trial .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request to hear PERSON and dismissed the remainder of his request for the taking of evidence . On DATE the court was informed by the municipal police that PERSON was currently hospitalised in GPE . This information was confirmed by e - mail messages from PERSON and a representative of the hospital . Furthermore , PERSON \u2019s brother had explained over the phone that PERSON had undergone surgery and had to remain in hospital for further treatment . By a decision of DATE the court , pointing out that a confrontation between the applicant and PERSON was not so important as to justify the postponement of the hearing scheduled for CARDINAL DATE , ordered that the trial be pursued without PERSON being questioned .", "CARDINAL . On the occasion of the hearing on DATE counsel for the defence again requested that PERSON be examined at trial . The ORG , acting as joint plaintiff to the prosecution , moved that the application be dismissed since the court disposed of sufficient further means of evidence for a conviction . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment rendered on DATE ORG fully endorsed ORG findings at first instance . The court further took the view that the rights of the defence had been fully respected in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s request to hear PERSON as a witness ORG , while noting that the applicant had not been granted an opportunity to confront PERSON at any stage of the proceedings , emphasised that by the ORG \u2019s final record of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant had been informed of his right to request that the investigations be complemented and could thus have asked already at this point in time for PERSON to be examined . ORG further pointed out that the courts at both instances had made efforts to enable PERSON \u2019s examination at trial . ORG had summoned PERSON to appear at the hearing . The latter being hospitalised abroad , however , could not attend the trial . The witness had again been summoned to appear at the hearing on DATE in the appellate proceedings . According to information obtained through the competent municipal police on DATE and from the witness \u2019s brother , the latter was subject to further treatment in a hospital in GPE where he had to remain for some time . His examination had thus been objectively impossible . Another adjournment of the hearing would have further delayed the proceedings that had already lasted a considerable time and would have contravened the principle that criminal proceedings should be conducted expeditiously .", "CARDINAL . ORG further stated that pursuant to LAW evidence was only to be obtained to the extent this was necessary with a view to establishing the facts relevant for deciding on an appeal . The ORG took the view that in the instant case it disposed of sufficient elements for its findings of fact and that PERSON \u2019s testimony and the documents produced by him were not of significant importance in this respect . The fact that PERSON had not been examined had thus not violated the rights of the defence . ORG at first instance had based its assessment of the applicant \u2019s guilt on the applicant \u2019s submissions , the testimonies of the witnesses heard at trial as well as the agreements and delivery notes of DATE and CARDINAL DATE and the reports on profits allocated to the ORG . The documents issued by PERSON had been taken into account to the extent they were consistent with and had corroborated these available pieces of evidence .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , on the basis of the whole body of evidence taken together , and even without taking into account PERSON \u2019s testimony , it was established that the applicant had operated CARDINAL illegal gaming machines at his bar which had been provided by the ORG and that the latter and the applicant had equally shared the gains from their illegal operation . The applicant \u2019s submissions to the contrary had all been refuted by the available evidence . The fact that at his hearing before the ORG on DATE the applicant had stated that he did not recall having met PERSON in the past whereas in the proceedings before ORG he had submitted that PERSON had regularly installed and replaced gaming machines at his club and had also been a good client provided a further indication that his testimony was not credible .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s additional complaint regarding the lack of a formal decision by the authorities with respect to the opening of criminal investigations against him and the fact that he had not been heard by the ORG in his capacity as accused , ORG reiterated the related explanations provided in the ORG \u2019s penal order of DATE ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) . It recalled that even though in the final record of the investigations established by the ORG the applicant had been informed about his defence rights and had disposed of sufficient time to avail himself of such rights he had failed to do so . The court specified in this context that although the applicant \u2019s knowledge of the NORP language was limited it could have been expected of him to enquire about the record \u2019s contents .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , endorsing ORG decision , rejected the applicant \u2019s related appeal lodged on DATE . ORG judgment was posted on DATE and served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW lit . a of LAW pertaining to gambling and gambling houses ( GPE \u00fcber PERSON und ORG ) stipulates that the organisation or commercial offering of games of chance outside licensed gambling houses is subject to imprisonment or a fine of MONEY . ORG is the competent authority for the prosecution of illegal gambling .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber das Verwaltungsstrafrecht ) of DATE as amended provides for the procedural rules to be observed in the event the prosecution of an offence falls within the competence of an administrative authority . Pursuant to LAW . of the LAW the relevant administrative authority is competent to rule on breaches of administrative criminal law unless a superior authority holds that the offence committed requires that a prison sentence be imposed , in which case the matter is referred to the criminal courts . Officers of the competent administrative authority who are specifically trained for this purpose may conduct the investigations with the support of the cantonal and municipal police . Article CARDINAL of the LAW requires that the opening of investigations , their conduct and their outcome shall be apparent from the official files . Articles CARDINAL et seq . stipulate that the investigating officers may collect written and oral evidence and hear witnesses . The provisions further specify under which conditions the search of apartments or business LOC and the confiscation of documents or objects be ordered within the scope of ongoing investigations .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , once the investigating officer deems the investigations to be complete he or she draws up a final record ( ORG ) , to discontinue the proceedings or to refer the case to the criminal courts . The convict may object to such a decision within DATE from the date it was served on him . The objection has to be made in writing , contain a specific and reasoned request and set out any related means of evidence . The administrative authority , having re - examined the case , then renders a new decision . The convict may , within DATE after the decision has been served on him , request that the case be referred for judicial review to the criminal courts ( Article CARDINAL ) . In this case , the concerned administrative authority transfers the files to the prosecution authorities at the competent cantonal criminal court . Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL contain rules regarding the ensuing proceedings before the criminal courts . The referral shall constitute the bill of indictment . The accused , the competent public prosecution authorities and the concerned administrative authority are parties to the court proceedings . The evidence gathered within the scope of the administrative criminal proceedings as set out in the investigation file established by the administrative authority shall form an integral part of such court proceedings . The criminal court may on its own motion or at the request of either party order the taking of further evidence . The rules of LAW apply to the proceedings to the extent GPE does not contain specific regulations .", "Pursuant to Section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafprozessordnung ) of the GPE Basel - Landschaft of DATE the parties to proceedings before the criminal court may within a time - limit set by its president file an application for the taking of further evidence . The president may , inter alia , refuse a related request in the event the taking of the requested evidence is obviously not necessary or in the event it is impossible to obtain .
