The applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant married in DATE and had CARDINAL children . In DATE and DATE she suffered miscarriages and a stillbirth , which caused her a long lasting psychological trauma .", "CARDINAL . In DATE she became pregnant with twins after an extramarital affair . The natural father insisted on an abortion , as did the husband of the applicant . Both men threatened to leave her .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the husband of the applicant moved out and threatened to stop paying maintenance for his CARDINAL sons and to the applicant . He put further pressure on her by threatening to break off all contact with his sons if she sued for maintenance . Instead , he offered to move back in with the applicant if she gave away the \u201c illegitimate \u201d children . The applicant \u2019s sister and her mother refused to support her . The applicant felt extremely guilty for having destroyed the family situation for her CARDINAL sons , yet she was determined not to have an abortion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the twin sisters , PERSON , were born prematurely . The applicant and the newborn children had to remain in hospital , where until DATE the applicant cared for the children .", "The applicant did not specify the identity of the natural father of the twins .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made initial contact with ORG during her pregnancy . She allegedly initially thought about having the twins placed in foster care , due to her difficult family and financial situation . ORG DATE according to the applicant \u2013 instead suggested adoption as the applicant herself or her husband would have to pay for the foster care .", "CARDINAL . DATE until DATE the applicant received psychological treatment on the advice of her gynaecologist . According to her psychoanalyst the applicant was depressed , had suicidal tendencies , and suffered from anxiety , panic attacks and extreme feelings of guilt as well as a sleeping disorder . The applicant felt overwhelmed by the situation and the decisions to be taken . The potential adoption was a topic of discussion during the treatment .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant could not take the newborn children home she consented to having them placed in provisional care with a view to later adoption . In this way she hoped to avoid too many changes of the children \u2019s primary carers . She was allegedly told that if placed in foster care the newborns would first be given to an emergency foster family for DATE before being handed over to a long - term foster family .", "CARDINAL . From CARDINAL DATE onwards a staff member from ORG advised the applicant to stop visiting the children if she really intended to give them up for adoption .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the children were handed over to the couple who later became their adoptive parents .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant personally met the future adoptive parents of the twin sisters . The applicant was allegedly so upset that she burst into tears and had to cut the visit short .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it was legally acknowledged that the husband of the applicant was not the father of the twin sisters by judgment of ORG ( no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The applicant began to work full time in order to support herself and her CARDINAL sons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant formally consented to the adoption of the children in a deed before the civil law notary , PERSON , in GPE . The declaration reads as follows :", "\u201c I hereby give consent for my children , PERSON born CARDINAL in GPE , to be adopted by the married couple identified under no .

I am aware that this declaration can not be revoked .", "I have been instructed by the civil law notary as to the legal consequences of the adoption , in particular the fact that all kinship of the children and their children to me and my relatives will cease as will all duties and rights that follow from kinship .", "Although I do not know the names of the future parents of my children I trust that ORG has made a proper choice regarding the parents and respected the interests of the children .", "In case the family court wishes to inform me about the beginning or the end of care , the beginning or the end of guardianship regarding my children or about the granting of adoption , I hereby empower ORG to receive that information for me . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As the identity of the natural father of the children remained unknown , he could not consent to or object to the adoption .", "CARDINAL . After the declaration of consent had been made , the applicant , the prospective adoptive parents and the twin infants met again in person . On DATE an oral agreement was reached between the prospective adoptive parents and the applicant at a meeting at ORG in the presence of a staff member . It was considered that the adoptive parents would send a short report together with photographs of the children to the applicant once DATE through ORG . Whether this agreement laid down any rules regarding regular meetings between the children and the applicant is disputed . A personal meeting in DATE was considered , but did not take place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the future adoptive parents declared in a deed before a civil law notary that they wished to adopt the twin sisters PERSON", "CARDINAL . In DATE the District Administrator ( PERSON ) of GPE , ORG and Adoption gave an expert opinion on the development of the children in the care of the prospective adoptive parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the guardianship division of ORG ( proceedings no . CARDINAL XVI CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) held a hearing with the prospective adoptive parents in the presence of the twins . The record of the hearing reads :", "\u201c It was debated how the children have been getting on in the family . Particular attention was paid to addressing anxieties resulting from the fact that the natural mother is obviously having enormous difficulties coping on a psychological level with the fact that she has given away her children . There are signs , given that a CARDINAL - open adoption was agreed on , which lead to the conclusion that the mother seeks contact with the twins . However , the arrangement involving the staff of ORG and the natural mother remains valid , namely , that photographs of the children are to be sent annually to the natural mother . The children will also be told early on that they were adopted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG concluded the adoption of PERSON declared them the legitimate children of the adoptive parents . The family and the given names of the children were changed accordingly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant commenced proceedings before ORG in order to declare her consent to the adoption void . The court transferred the case to the competent ORG ( no . CARDINAL XVI CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The applicant argued that the adoption was void because the father of the child had not consented to the adoption . She further argued that at the time of giving her consent she had been either in a temporary or in a pathological state of mental disturbance , which had prevented the free exercise of her will . She had not been aware of what she had been doing . She argued DATE referring to medical evidence \u2013 that she had been suffering from an \u201c aggravated reactive form of depression with acute risk of suicide \u201d since DATE , when she had been traumatised by the stillbirth .", "CARDINAL . The guardian ad litem of the children argued that a revocation of the adoption would be against the best interests of the children , as since their birth they had been almost continuously in the care of the adoptive parents who had established a very good parental relationship with them .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reaction to the arguments of the guardian ad litem the applicant partly withdrew her application with regard to custody rights and made clear that her aim was no longer to integrate the children into her own family . She acknowledged that the children were well cared for and fully settled in the adoptive family . She underlined that her aim was to regain kinship in order to have a right to contact with the children . In her view her vulnerable situation at the time of the birth had been exploited by ORG ; she now felt that she had been unduly influenced to put the children up for adoption .", "CARDINAL . ORG procured a psychiatric opinion on whether the applicant had been temporarily legally incapable of acting at the time of consenting to the adoption . The expert contacted the applicant , her psychoanalyst at the time and her long - term gynaecologist . According to the psychiatric expert the applicant had been in a situation of extreme conflict from the time she had become aware of her pregnancy . This had aggravated the depression she was already suffering from due to the accidental stillbirth in DATE . He put the applicant \u2019s decision to put the twin sisters up for adoption down to her desire to \u201c get her husband back \u201d . He diagnosed a certain weakness in the applicant \u2019s personality and a dependency on male authority . However , he could not diagnose any past or present psychotic illnesses and therefore concluded that although she had been suffering from a deep inner conflict at the time of consenting to the adoption , the applicant had been legally capable of making a decision on her own .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court heard the applicant , who explained how , in her view , ORG had unduly used her wish to see her children in DATE in order to pressurise her into signing the adoption declaration .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It acknowledged the situation of extreme conflict the applicant had been in at the time of consenting to the adoption and the psychological implications of that . It stated that solutions other than putting the children up for adoption might have been available to resolve the applicant \u2019s personal crisis . In line with the expert opinion , however , the court held that the applicant had still been capable of making decisions . Furthermore , the court stated that the applicant had no legal standing to rely on the lack of consent of the children \u2019s father to the adoption .", "CARDINAL . Since the applicant did not appeal against the decision , it became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed proceedings ( no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) for contact with the children and the right to receive information about them at ORG . She argued that she had been promised meetings with the children DATE and letters and photos of them . A meeting with the children in DATE had been scheduled according to the agreement , but did not take place because the responsible member of ORG was on extended leave . No other member of ORG had replaced the absent staff member . In DATE the applicant received photos of the children . When she mentioned that she was thinking about revoking her consent to the adoption , staff of ORG threatened to stop her contact with the children . A letter that the applicant wrote to the adoptive parents and handed over to ORG was returned with the remark that the applicant should seek psychological treatment . The applicant based her claim for contact on DATE and additionally on LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . Her claim for the right to receive information about the children was based on LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the adoptive parents were heard . They opposed the claim of the applicant and asked for it to be dismissed . They referred to the legal basis of adoption under LAW , which only provided for anonymous adoption . According to the hearing record the adoptive parents declared that they still intended to inform the children about the adoption before they started primary school . They had planned to see the mother of the children together with the children in DATE . This meeting had been set up for the sole benefit of the applicant , as the children would not have benefited from it . They had had the intention of sending letters to the applicant with information about the children . Now , in view of the court proceedings , they felt insecure and preferred to wait for the court decisions .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for contact with the children . According to the court LAW was not applicable to the applicant \u2019s case as she had lost her legal status as a parent as a result of the adoption . An analogous application of the LAW was , according to a decision of ORG of DATE ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , not possible . DATE of LAW was applicable , but would not grant contact rights to the applicant as she did not fulfil the legal requirements . The applicant could not be considered as a person who had cared for the children for an extended period of time . In fact , she had only cared for them for DATE . Even if the criteria of ORG in the above - mentioned decision \u2013 whether there was a social and family relationship \u2013 were applied , the applicant could not be granted contact , as she had not created a significant social and family relationship with the children . The time of pregnancy and DATE after the birth did not suffice . The Civil Code grants to the adoptive parents the sole right to establish , grant or deny contact with the children even in respect of the natural mother . Furthermore , the court argued that the children , who were DATE , might be overwhelmed by the fact that they had CARDINAL mothers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court also dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim in regard to the right to receive information about the children . LAW was not applicable , as the applicant was not a parent any more . Insofar as LAW might be construed more widely , it would not apply to the applicant as her case did not fall under the scope of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG . She mainly complained that ORG had neither decided on DATE of LAW as a potential basis of her claim nor on whether a contractual agreement existed ; furthermore , her petition for an expert opinion on the children \u2019s best interests had been ignored . She further argued that the criteria of a \u201c long duration \u201d , when applied to parent - child relationships , had to be interpreted from the perspective of the child , whose concept of time differed from that of adults . The natural mother was always a \u201c relevant person \u201d in the sense of LAW , and this evaluation did not change even after the natural mother ceased to have legal responsibilities . Regarding the right to information , she argued that although she had consented to the adoption , she remained the natural mother and the constitutional protection of the family applied to her . Even the ORG had acknowledged that during pregnancy a psycho - social relationship between mother and the foetus was established ( judgment of DATE \u2013 CARDINAL BvL CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Lastly , she complained about the length of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted legal aid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL UF CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decisions of ORG of DATE and DATE . CARDINAL hearings , CARDINAL on DATE and the other on DATE , had taken place . Regarding the length of the proceedings before the district court , ORG found that that court had dealt adequately with the complex case within DATE . Concerning the contact rights of the applicant , the court found that only LAW was applicable . Although the applicant was the children \u2019s natural mother , she did not belong to the circle of people who had lived in \u201c domestic community \u201d with the child for a long period of time . According to the court , only foster parents are covered by this terminology . Furthermore , in order to determine \u201c a long period of time \u201d one had to establish whether a child had come to accept that his or her \u201c relevant surroundings \u201d ( PERSON ) were with the individual in question . In the present case , the time of pregnancy was irrelevant , as an unborn child does not have a concept of its surroundings . LAW was in line with the constitutional protection of the family . The natural mother ceased to have contact or custody rights at the moment of adoption . The legal provisions regarding adoption were aimed at the undisturbed development of the child , and they served the best interests of the adopted child , who had to be fully integrated into the adoptive family ; the biological family became irrelevant in accordance with the law . Even if the criteria of the judgment of ORG of DATE regarding the natural father of a child born out of wedlock were applied , the natural mother would have to have lived with the children for a considerable time , which was not the case here . As the applicant knew , the right to contact on the basis of a contractual agreement could not be enforced by the family courts , as they were not empowered to regulate such matters . DATE LAW did not give grounds for a different solution .", "CARDINAL . Having considered the claim for the right to receive information about the children DATE of LAW , the court found that the applicant had ceased to be a parent at the moment of adoption . As the legal basis was unambiguous and the circle of people who had a right to such information was strictly limited to the parents , the court found no room for a different interpretation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant raised a constitutional complaint regarding the denial of her rights to receive information about and have contact with the twin sisters after their adoption .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE , a panel of CARDINAL constitutional judges refused to admit the constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also commenced proceedings in DATE concerning the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the twin sisters , in order for the children to be able to raise a constitutional complaint against the adoption decision of the guardianship division of ORG of DATE ( no . CARDINAL XVI CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . These proceedings are the issue of another complaint before this ORG ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant divorced her husband and is now remarried . She had a child with her new husband in DATE .", "CARDINAL .
