LATVIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE ( GPE ) . He was represented before the ORG by Mrs I. Jansone , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant , together with CARDINAL other individuals and a legal entity , set up a limited - liability company named ORG ( \u201c the company \u201d ) , which was entered immediately in the companies register ( ORG re\u0123istrs ) . The new company \u2019s base capital amounted to CARDINAL lati ( ORG ) , comprising CARDINAL shares worth ORG each . The applicant held CARDINAL shares , making him the majority shareholder . In DATE the applicant used his shares as security for a loan from a commercial bank in GPE , but continued to own them .", "On DATE a general meeting of company members decided to wind up the company . On DATE a winding - up petition was lodged with ORG , which examined it at a hearing on DATE . Despite the explanations of the company \u2019s representatives to the effect that the company \u2019s financial situation had improved in the meantime , with the result that it was now able to honour its debts , the court declared the company insolvent , placed it in compulsory liquidation and appointed a liquidator ( administrators ) , ORG In addition , the court appointed the company \u2019s Chairman , GPE , its Chief Executive , ORG , and its accountant , ORG , as the debtor \u2019s representatives ( par\u0101dnieka p\u0101rst\u0101vji ) . ORG judgment of DATE was final .", "In DATE a LOC meeting adopted a recovery plan ( san\u0101cijas pl\u0101ns ) for the company , based in particular on a very substantial increase in its share capital . However , by an order of DATE , ORG refused to ratify the plan .", "Notwithstanding this refusal , ORG forwarded amendments to the company \u2019s memorandum and articles of association for entry in the companies register . The amendments were entered straight away . On an application by the applicant dated DATE , ORG ( galvenais valsts not\u0101rs ) cancelled the registration of the amendments in question . According to ORG , the liquidator had acted in bad faith , as he had had no right to amend the company \u2019s memorandum and articles of association when the recovery plan had not been ratified by the courts . ORG also observed that the increase in the company \u2019s share capital envisaged by ORG would interfere with the applicant \u2019s right of pre - emption over the new shares .", "On DATE a NORP meeting again approved the increase in the company \u2019s share capital and the amendments to its memorandum and articles of association .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL individual associates concluded a deed of gift with a third party , PERSON , under which they transferred all their shares to him . PERSON thus became the majority shareholder , with CARDINAL shares . The applicant continued to own CARDINAL shares and CARDINAL shares were held by the legal entity which had been CARDINAL of the company \u2019s founders .", "On DATE and DATE the company \u2019s creditors met and adopted a new recovery plan . Under the terms of the plan , PERSON was to increase the company \u2019s share capital to ORG within DATE . The funds required for the purpose were to come from the public limited company GPE , of which PERSON was Chairman and Chief Executive . By a final order of DATE , ORG ratified the new plan .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant , represented by the bank to which he had pledged his shares as security , lodged an application with ORG challenging the decisions of the company \u2019s creditors and the actions of the liquidator . In his memorial he submitted a series of complaints concerning the conduct of the insolvency procedure . Firstly , he contended that ORG did not have the right to increase the company \u2019s share capital and that the creditors had no right to approve the unlawful decisions taken by the liquidator . Secondly , he criticised the final version of the recovery plan . In his view , the text contained a number of shortcomings and irregularities which made it incompatible with the legislation on company insolvency . He argued , for instance , that the plan did not set out in sufficient detail the recovery measures and the deadlines for their implementation ; the debt repayment schedule was unfair as it gave small creditors an advantage ; the overall recovery period exceeded the statutory maximum period of DATE ; and the PERSON meeting had not had all the documents it needed in order to take an equitable decision . Thirdly , in the applicant \u2019s view , ORG \u2019s conduct demonstrated that he was incompetent and had acted in bad faith , and he should be dismissed as liquidator . Accordingly , the applicant requested the court to declare all the decisions taken by ORG and the creditors null and void , to refuse to ratify the recovery plan and to dismiss ORG", "By an order of DATE , the relevant judge of ORG declared the applicant \u2019s application inadmissible . The order stated that no legislation conferred on ordinary shareholders a right of appeal against decisions taken by the liquidator or by meetings of the creditors of a company in liquidation . In that connection the judge pointed out that only the official representatives of the debtor company could participate in the insolvency proceedings and that the applicant was not one of the CARDINAL representatives appointed under the judgment of DATE . Finally , the judge found that the applicant was not entitled to request the dismissal of the liquidator ; such a request could be made only by a meeting of the creditors .", "This order was served on the bank , as the applicant \u2019s representative , but not on the applicant himself . Consequently , he did not receive a copy until DATE . On DATE he challenged the order by means of an appeal to ORG of ORG . At the same time he requested ORG to extend the time allowed for lodging an appeal against the order in question , explaining that he had received a copy of the order on DATE of the DATE period laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW and had therefore been unable to lodge his appeal within the time allowed .", "On DATE the relevant judge of ORG transmitted the appeal to ORG without giving a formal ruling on the extension of the time allowed . The judge simply noted that \u201c the appeal [ had been ] lodged within the period set down by section CARDINAL of LAW and [ was ] to be forwarded \u201d to the recipient .", "By a final order of DATE , the relevant judge of ORG declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that it had been lodged out of time and that the first - instance judge had not extended the period specified in section CARDINAL of LAW .", "The applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law with the ORG of ORG , which dismissed it by a final order of DATE . In the ORG \u2019s view , the fact that the first - instance judge had omitted to rule on the extension of the time allowed for lodging an appeal did not alter the finding that the appeal had been lodged out of time ; the appeal court had therefore been right not to examine it .", "Insolvency proceedings are governed by LAW of DATE ( NORP \u201c ORG uz\u0146\u0113mumu un uz\u0146\u0113m\u0113jsabiedr\u012bbu maks\u0101tnesp\u0113ju \u201d ) . In accordance with the LAW , the chief players in insolvency proceedings are the liquidator , the company \u2019s representatives , the LOC meetings and , where appropriate , the PERSON committee . As a rule , a meeting of creditors includes all the creditors of the company in liquidation ; any person with a claim against the company has the right to attend ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The liquidator is appointed by the relevant court ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . At the material time the debtor company \u2019s representatives were usually appointed by the liquidator ( section DATE ) , but could also be appointed or approved by the court . They are now appointed by the court in all cases .", "Once a company has been declared insolvent , it loses the right to dispose of its assets , that right being transferred to the liquidator . Similarly , the bodies responsible for administering and managing the company are suspended and their powers transferred to the liquidator ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The latter must report to a meeting of creditors , which can request his dismissal ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The procedure for dismissal is laid down in CARDINAL : if the PERSON meeting considers that the liquidator no longer fulfils the statutory requirements , is incompetent or is acting in bad faith , it must pass a vote of no confidence in him . It must then request the relevant court to dismiss the liquidator and replace him .", "At the relevant time a LOC meeting could challenge the decisions of the liquidator before the courts , on condition that it had first made an application to the liquidator himself . This option was also available to the debtor company and to individual creditors . The latter had first to apply to the liquidator ; if their application was rejected , explicitly or implicitly , they had to propose legal action to a PERSON meeting . If the meeting rejected the proposal , they could then institute legal proceedings themselves ( section GPE ) ) .", "A company recovery plan adopted by a LOC meeting may be challenged before the courts by the liquidator , a single creditor or a group of creditors ( section CARDINAL ) .", "ORG insolvency proceedings are governed by LAW of LAW ( ORG likums ) . At the material time the relevant provisions of this LAW were identical in substance to those of LAW . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) stated that the liquidator had the right to appeal against any decisions taken by a meeting of creditors ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
