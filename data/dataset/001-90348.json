Article CARDINAL provides that NORP citizens shall have the right to petition in person , as well as to submit individual and collective appeals to , ORG authorities and local self - government bodies .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW is a general provision containing a list of the forms of redress which can be obtained in respect of civil rights . It includes recognition of a right , restitutio in integrum , compensation in respect of pecuniary or non - pecuniary damage and other forms of redress prescribed by law . LAW reads in its relevant parts as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A citizen shall have the right to claim through the court that the information discrediting his honour , dignity or business reputation be refuted , unless the person who has disseminated such information proves its truthfulness ...", "CARDINAL .

Resolution no . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE ( as amended on DATE , in force at the material time ) established that the notion \u201c dissemination of information \u201d employed in LAW was understood as the publication of statements or their broadcasting , inclusion in professional references , public speeches , applications to ORG officials and communication in other forms , including oral , to CARDINAL another person .

In their ORG of DATE , ORG recalled that under LAW of LAW no one can be compelled to express his opinions or beliefs or compelled to refrain from expressing them . It thus instructed the courts below that an apology , whatever its form , was not prescribed under NORP law , including LAW , as redress ( point CARDINAL ) . The above does not exclude the possibility for a judge to approve a friendly - settlement agreement the terms of which require such an apology . ORG also instructed the other courts that when a citizen lodges a complaint with a public authority alleging , for instance , that a criminal offence has been committed and when such an allegation proves to be unfounded , the latter fact can not serve as a basis for an action under LAW . ORG explained that civil liability could not arise in such a situation in view of the applicant \u2019s exercise of his right of petition to a public authority , which was to carry out an inquiry , and that such a situation did not equate to dissemination of false defamatory information ( point CARDINAL ) . A defamation action may only succeed if a court has established that the petition to the public authority lacked any foundation and was intended to cause damage to another person , thus amounting to an abuse of the right ( ibid ) .", "CARDINAL .
