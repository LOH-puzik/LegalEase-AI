The first applicant , Mr. PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in Hard . The second applicant , Mr. PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . They are both journalists employed by the third applicant , Zeitungs- und Verlags GmbH , a limited liability company with its seat of business in PERSON . The applicant company publishes the regional newspaper ORG .", "CARDINAL . At DATE R.H. , a NORP football referee , admitted to having participated in bet rigging ( PERSON ) by manipulating football matches together with other persons , in particular the brothers GPE , GPE and GPE .. PERSON told the police that he knew that football matches were also manipulated in GPE and GPE . As regards GPE , he referred to the football club ORG GPE , which still existed at the time of the events in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an article written by the first and second applicants appeared in the NORP dealing with the NORP betting scandal \u2019s links to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On the front page the headline , printed in a black box in white , read as follows : \u201c PERSON players bribed with MONEY ( ORG ) \u201d ( \u201c ORG mit CARDINAL.CARDINAL \u20ac bestochen \u201d ) . Below that headline , and still in the black box , were photographs of ORG , ORG and PERSON and in a yellow box the phrase : \u201c The investigators are at the heels of this trio : They may have manipulated matches for the betting - mafia ! \u201d ( \u201c PERSON die PERSON den LOC : NORP soll f\u00fcr ORG LOC manipuliert haben ! \u201d ) . In the upper left corner , a little box contained the following phrase : \u201c Terrible suspicion against football pros confirmed : \u201d ( \u201c Schlimmer Vedacht gegen Fussball - Profis erh\u00e4rtet : \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The main article on this subject , written by the first and second applicants , appeared on page CARDINAL . The headline read as follows : \u201c Sold and betrayed the team for LAW ? \u201d ( \u201c FAC verkauft und verraten ? \u201d ) . The article stated that the CARDINAL football players had been bribed by the betting - mafia with ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for QUANTITY matches . Bets for these NORP SW PERSON matches had been placed in the GPE area ( GPE ) . In CARDINAL match , which had ended with the result of CARDINAL against ORG GPE , the goal - keeper , PERSON , had made serious mistakes , as expected , and another player , PERSON had been replaced because of his poor performance . PERSON had also been playing in that match . The reason for the manipulations was the ORG financial difficulties : they had not received their salary for DATE . They had all signed a public statement prepared by the management of the club , denying their involvement in the betting scandal .", "CARDINAL . On the following page there was an article under the headline \u201c A CARDINAL result shocks a second time ! \u201d ( \u201c Ein CARDINAL:CARDINAL schockt ein zweites PERSON ! \u201d ) in which a football match of DATE was reviewed again and it was hinted that the poor performance of some of the players was connected to the betting - scandal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , GPE and PERSON filed a private prosecution ( PERSON ) against the applicants before ORG . They argued that the accusation raised in the article published by the applicant company in its newspaper on DATE , that they had accepted bribes and manipulated football matches , was particularly serious for a professional football player and his professional reputation . This accusation , which was untrue , constituted defamation and they requested the court to convict the first and second applicants of this offence . They indicated in particular the following passages of the article as defamatory :", "( i ) \u201c Terrible suspicion against football - pros confirmed : PERSON players bribed with LAW \u201d ( \u201c Schlimmer Vedacht gegen Fussball - Profis erh\u00e4rtet : PERSON mit CARDINAL,CARDINAL \u20ac bestochen \u201d ) ;", "( ii ) \u201c Sold and betrayed the team for CARDINAL EUR ? \u201d ( \u201c FAC verkauft und verraten ? \u201d ) ;", "( iii ) PERSON players PERSON , ORG and PERSON were bribed CARDINAL ORG for their team to lose CARDINAL matches . ( \u201c PERSON , ORG , und FAC sollen bestochen worden PERSON . CARDINAL \u20ac , damit ihr Team drei PERSON . \u201d ) ;", "( iv ) ( Regarding the third plaintiff . ORG ) \u201c ORG had made contact with the NORP betting - mafia . \u201d ( \u201c PERSON zur kroatischen ORG soll A.T. hergestellt haben . \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . They also claimed compensation from the applicant company for the harm caused and requested that the judgment be published in its newspaper .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant company to publish within DATE a short piece ( kurze Mitteilung ) on the institution of criminal proceedings for defamation in respect of the article at issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants commented on the charges against them . They argued that they had only voiced a suspicion against the plaintiffs but that in any event their statements were true or , at least , the first and second applicants had had good reason to believe that they were true , which would rule out punishment .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE ORG held CARDINAL hearings in the case in which it heard several witnesses , inter alia , ORG , a freelance journalist working for the third applicant \u2019s newspaper and who had contacted CARDINAL informants who had wished to remain anonymous , and PERSON ( see above ) . PERSON spoke about his contacts with the PERSON brothers since DATE and stated that CARDINAL of them , ORG , had contacts in GPE , in particular the football club Casino SW Bregenz . In his opinion CARDINAL players of that team were in contact with ORG , but he did not give any names or other details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the incriminated statements from the article of DATE amounted to defamation , convicted the first and second applicants of that offence and sentenced them to a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL respectively , suspended on probation for DATE . It ordered the applicant company to pay compensation of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to each plaintiff and to publish an extract of the present judgment in its newspaper .", "CARDINAL . As regards the impugned article , ORG paid particular attention to its visual appearance which , through its layout and presentation , in particular the printing in white in a large black box , conveyed to the reader the impression that the investigators were about to catch the pictured persons , who had filled their pockets with money by using dirty tricks . That first impression was not mitigated by the small reference to a suspicion in the upper left corner . The same was true for the headline on page CARDINAL which read : \u201c Sold and betrayed the team for EUR CARDINAL ? \u201d . This was a leading question which already contained the answer , and again that first impression could hardly be mitigated by the use of the subjunctive in some phrases of the article itself . The court therefore concluded that , seen as a whole , the article created the impression of being a statement of facts about the scandal and not a genuine expression of a suspicion .", "CARDINAL . ORG therefore examined whether the accused had acted with due journalistic diligence when they considered these statements as true , or if they could prove their veracity . As regards the first element , ORG accepted that there was a public interest in being informed on the question of whether or not players of the Casino SW PERSON team had actually been involved in a betting scandal , but found that the first and second applicants had not acted with sufficient professional diligence . They had not personally conducted any research to verify the well - foundedness of the rumours but had merely relied on the research of ORG , a freelance collaborator with the newspaper , and had not checked the reliability of the sources - anonymous informants not known to them . Furthermore , they had not given ORG , ORG and PERSON an opportunity to react even though there had been important new elements going beyond a general suspicion of involvement in the betting scandal to which they had already reacted in the past , namely that they had received a specific amount , LAW , for manipulating CARDINAL football matches in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the proof of truth put forward by the applicants , ORG observed that ORG and PERSON had only been accused by ORG CARDINAL informants , X and Y , of being involved in the betting scandal , and these informants had not given any details nor stated that they themselves had witnessed a transaction . Also PERSON , when heard by the court , did not refer to them directly or indirectly . There was clearly no proof of the truth .", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON , ORG observed that he had lied when he stated that he did not know ORG , that ORG had repeatedly visited GPE and that there had been football matches in which that player had given a very poor performance . Also the informants X and Y had stated that PERSON was involved in the betting scandal . These were arguments speaking in favour of his involvement in the betting scandal , but there were also arguments speaking against . It was understandable that ORG had not admitted to knowing ORG immediately , when all kinds of suspicions were discussed in connection with the betting scandal , as GPE was one of the principal persons involved in that scandal . Furthermore , there was only evidence that ORG had visited GPE on various occasions DATE and DATE , whereas the football match which , in the eyes of the authors of the article , was particularly suspicious had taken place in DATE . According to the information given by X and Y , ORG had paid the CARDINAL accused football players LAW in DATE for CARDINAL matches which had not yet taken place . That did not coincide with his habits as described in detail by PERSON Lastly , the amount claimed by X and Y , namely LAW , was not plausible , given that Casino SW PERSON had been at the very end of the national football league table in GPE throughout DATE and the quota for bets on that team losing a match would have been so small that it would not have justified the investment of a considerable sum .", "CARDINAL . Weighing all these elements , ORG concluded that the applicants had not succeeded in proving the truth of the statements made in the impugned article . As regards the compensation under LAW , ORG found that the particular seriousness of the accusations raised , and the adverse effect they could have on the career of a professional footballer , justified the sum of compensation granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against this judgment . They argued that the impugned article did not contain a statement of fact but merely a suspicion against ORG , ORG and PERSON Moreover , the first and second applicants had fully complied with journalistic ethics . As PERSON and the applicants had acted as a team , there was no need to check further the information received and at that stage of the investigations there had also been no need to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to react to the information to be published .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal of the first and second applicants , but partially granted the appeal of the applicant company and reduced the amount of compensation to ORG CARDINAL for each plaintiff . It found that ORG had carefully weighed the arguments and had arrived at a correct and well - reasoned judgment . It agreed with ORG that the first and second applicants had not reported on a mere suspicion but had presented their allegations as facts which they had failed to prove ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
