He alleged that , under Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , property belonging to certain social categories had been exempt from nationalisation and that his parents had belonged to CARDINAL such category .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the court allowed the action on the ground that the ORG had taken possession of the property without any valid title . It ordered the defendants to restore the building and the adjoining land to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the GPE mayor 's office acting on behalf of the local council , ORG upheld the decision of the first - instance court in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , on an appeal by PERSON , set aside the impugned decision and allowed the applicant 's action . ORG observed that in its final judgment of DATE ORG had held that the ORG had appropriated the building without any valid title .

CARDINAL ) of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON became ORG ( Regia autonoma PERSON patrimoniului protocolului PERSON \u2013 \u201c the NORP \u201d ) . The applicant 's property continued to appear in the lists attached to that decision as ORG property managed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL .
