At TIME on DATE , the PERSON liberties and detention judge , to whom the matter had been referred by the investigating judge , interviewed the applicant and remanded him in custody pending trial .", "CARDINAL .

Firstly , it held that ORG had specified that the abrogation of the provisions in question would apply only in the case of persons in police custody or under formal investigation who were questioned or interviewed following the publication of its decision , so that his argument had in that respect become devoid of purpose . Secondly , it observed that the applicant had not been questioned in police custody and that , although his interviews by the investigating judge had not been recorded on video , \u201c this did not result in any infringement of his rights under the LAW , be it his defence rights or the right to a fair trial , seeing that he was given the option of receiving legal assistance , and had the opportunity to review the manner in which the questions and answers had been transcribed in the record , which had been approved by a registrar , to ask for any corrections to be made and to challenge , at any stage of the proceedings , the meaning and scope of his statements as transcribed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ...
