The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in the Tren\u010d\u00edn hospital for charged and convicted persons .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant was arrested on DATE and charges were brought against him the following day for the criminal offence of endangering public safety . The charge was based on the suspicion that he had made home - made explosive devices ; that he had sent some of them , together with written threats , to veterinarians and the head office of a supermarket chain ; and that he had planted CARDINAL of the devices next to a fast food outlet and had allowed it to explode with a view to promoting animal rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG remanded the applicant in custody pending trial to prevent him from continuing his criminal activity . ORG took into account , inter alia , the nature of the criminal charge and the fact that the applicant had been having long - term psychiatric treatment . An interlocutory appeal by the applicant was unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . Courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction reviewed and confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention on CARDINAL occasions as follows .", "CARDINAL . DATE and CARDINAL DATE courts at CARDINAL levels dismissed applications by the applicant for release . They relied on a risk of reoffending and took into account new charges that had been brought against him as well as the testimony of various witnesses and victims . In that connection , they referred to evidence that the applicant had been planning his attacks for a long time and in a systematic way . On DATE the domestic courts added new grounds for his detention , namely a risk that he might abscond . That was based on a statement by a witness who had allegedly said that the applicant had declared that he would try to flee if he was arrested . The evidence in the case , in particular the applicant \u2019s computer , suggested that he had \u201c entertained the idea of counterfeiting an ID \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention by DATE ( until DATE ) on the grounds that the investigation was not finished , that further charges had been brought against him since DATE , and that the criminal charges had been reclassified as a crime of terrorism and the acquisition and possession of firearms . The domestic courts concluded that his criminal case was complex owing to the extent and nature of his criminal activity and repeated the grounds for his detention , namely the possibility of his reoffending and absconding . The court also ordered a report by an expert on extremism and terrorism . That decision was upheld on appeal .", "CARDINAL . At the pre - trial stage the applicant was committed to the hospital for charged and convicted persons in LOC on CARDINAL occasions , namely DATE and DATE because , inter alia , he had demonstrated signs of anxiety , made threats of suicide and needed to have his mental state examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted to stand trial on the above charges before ORG .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant applied CARDINAL more times for release to courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction . Given the serious accusations made against him in the meantime ( on DATE ) for crimes including terrorism , the courts upheld both grounds for his continued detention . In addition , they referred to a witness statement that the applicant had written a will where he had expressed the alleged intention to commit a terrorist suicide attack . Furthermore , the courts rejected bail and guarantees of supervision offered by the applicant \u2019s parents since they had been unable to prevent the crimes while the applicant had lived in their house .", "CARDINAL . ORG held CARDINAL hearings in the criminal case against the applicant . It examined oral and documentary evidence , including evidence from several experts . It delivered its judgment on DATE , finding the applicant guilty of the charges and sentencing him to DATE in prison . However , on DATE ORG quashed the judgment following an appeal by the applicant and remitted the case to ORG for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that in the course of the appellate proceedings , on DATE , the applicant had submitted a report by CARDINAL certified experts concluding that he had long been suffering from a mental schizotypal disorder preventing him from understanding the illegal nature of his behaviour and from controlling it ( \u201c the second expert report \u201d ) . Those conclusions were contrary to those in a report by CARDINAL other experts at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings ( \u201c the first expert report \u201d ) , which had concluded that the applicant was not suffering from a mental illness but merely a personality disorder . Resolving that contradiction was imperative in order to establish whether or not the applicant was criminally responsible . ORG therefore instructed ORG to obtain a third opinion from an expert institute . In addition , it ordered the lower court to resolve an issue concerning the legal classification of the applicant \u2019s impugned actions .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , while the criminal proceedings were pending on appeal , ORG decided to keep the applicant in detention on the same grounds as before ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The subsequent course of the trial is described in paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below .", "CARDINAL . After the verdict was quashed on appeal and remitted to ORG for re - examination , the applicant , assisted by his lawyer , applied for release on DATE . He referred to his mental disorder as established in the second expert report of CARDINAL DATE . He added that he had been seeing a psychiatrist since the age of DATE and needed medicine on a DATE basis to prevent suicidal thoughts . He could not live without that medicine , even in detention , as he required treatment and sessions with a psychiatrist . He submitted that there was no risk of him absconding if at large as he had only had a basic education , had no financial means , no job , had never travelled alone outside his home town , and was completely dependent on his parents , emotionally , financially and for DATE care . Moreover , there was no risk he would continue his criminal activity if he was under medication and being properly treated , or , alternatively , if he was committed to a psychiatric institution , as he feared for the future after the charges had been brought against him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s parents supported his application for release and offered to stand as guarantors of his pledge that he would live in accordance with the law . They also supported his request that his detention be replaced by supervision by a parole officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the applicant , his lawyer , and ORG as regards his request for release . According to the transcript of the hearing , the applicant and his counsel reiterated and further developed their arguments made in the application and submitted that his mental condition meant that his absconding was not realistic .", "CARDINAL . The Government \u2019s observations show that on DATE ORG sent a letter to the director of the detention centre in PERSON where the applicant was being held , asking for information about the applicant \u2019s state of health . It enquired whether the applicant was being provided with the drugs he had been prescribed and whether the detention centre was able to provide the applicant with his treatment . The director of the detention centre replied on DATE in the affirmative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application to be released and his supplementary requests , a decision that was upheld by ORG on DATE after an interlocutory appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The courts concluded that there was still a strong suspicion against the applicant , which added to the reasons for keeping him detained . They observed that he had created explosives and contemplated where to plant them over a long time and in a systematic way . He had lived with his parents and a search of the home they shared had shown that they had clearly not been aware of his illegal activities and had been unable to prevent them . The applicant faced a particularly severe potential penalty , had declared openly that he would try and flee in case of arrest and a search of his computer had suggested that he had contemplated counterfeiting an ORG .", "Regarding the nature , scope and seriousness of the alleged offences and the applicant \u2019s character , the courts concluded that the conditions for a restriction of liberty still existed . In addition , they observed that the relevant authorities had proceeded with the case expeditiously and with due diligence .", "Moreover , the courts found that the requirements for alternative measures , such as a parental guarantee , a pledge by the applicant or replacing his detention with supervision had not been met .", "There was no separate consideration of the applicant \u2019s mental condition as such . The correspondence between the district court and the director of the detention centre was not mentioned in the courts\u2019 decisions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently turned to ORG with a complaint under LAW , alleging a violation of his rights , inter alia , LAW QUANTITY CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , or their constitutional equivalents .", "As to the substance , he raised arguments that were similar to those in his application to be released . He added that the courts had failed to take into account the specific nature of his situation , consisting of his mental disorder ; that the length of his detention had been excessive and based on irrelevant and insufficient reasons ; and that the only matter open to debate was whether he was legally insane , which impacted on his criminal liability .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint as manifestly ill - founded . It endorsed the reasons given by the ordinary courts and concluded that they had been relevant and sufficient to keep the applicant detained . It gave no answer to his argument concerning the specific nature of his situation .", "CARDINAL . NORP Following remittal of the case by ORG , ORG asked the expert institute on DATE to produce a report on the applicant \u2019s mental condition . On DATE it also ordered that the applicant be admitted to the psychiatric department of the Tren\u010d\u00edn hospital for charged and convicted persons in order to have his mental health examined . The report was filed on DATE , and ORG heard the case DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again found the applicant guilty . ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant on DATE . He was sentenced to PERCENT imprisonment , QUANTITY months\u2019 protective supervision and payment of damages . No ordinary appeal being available , the judgment became final and binding .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the applicant appealed on points of law and ORG quashed the District and ORG judgments owing to breaches of the law to the applicant \u2019s disadvantage . The matter was remitted to ORG for fresh examination . ORG provided an extensive interpretation of the criminal offence of terrorism and concluded that the lower courts\u2019 legal interpretation of the case had been wrong as the applicant \u2019s motive had not included elements of the crime of terrorism .", "CARDINAL . ORG , the case returned to ORG and the applicant remained detained pending trial as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Taking into account ORG judgment and its legal interpretation of the crime in question , ORG once again found the applicant guilty of , inter alia , the criminal offence of endangering public safety , the illegal acquisition , possession and trafficking of firearms , the making of serious threats , extortion , and attempted bodily harm and sentenced him to DATE and DATE in prison on CARDINAL DATE . It also ordered protective supervision lasting DATE . The applicant appealed and those proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL .
