On DATE ORG for ORG of Croatia and ORG instituted civil proceedings against the ORG and the applicant union , seeking to declare the FAC null and void because it had not been entered into by all the trade unions that had concluded the main ORG , contrary to the law ( for a more detailed description of the course of those proceedings see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government of GPE adopted an instruction whereby it ( a ) instructed the ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG to acknowledge the ORG claim in those proceedings because it was well - founded , with a view to having the FAC declared null and void , and ( b ) instructed ORG to immediately commence negotiations on the conclusion of a new collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector .", "CARDINAL .

It stated that the strike was being organised in order to ( a ) protect the social and economic interests of doctors by insisting that the Government of GPE honour its obligations arising from the ORG , ( b ) have the results of the referendum on the approval of the FAC recognised , and ( c ) , as an subsidiary ground for the strike , address issues specific to doctors and dentists within the healthcare system by demanding that a collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector be concluded . In particular , as regards the last - mentioned ground the applicant union stated as follows :", "\u201c \u2013 addressing issues specific to doctors within the healthcare sector by concluding a collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector .", "As a subsidiary ground for the strike , ORG notes that the [ main ] ORG for ORG does not address issues specific to the medical and dentistry professions . Therefore , on the instruction of ORG and in accordance with the opinion of ORG ... of DATE , the ORG to that ORG addressing issues specific to doctors was concluded at the same time [ as the aforementioned collective agreement ] . In that way , issues specific to doctors within the healthcare and health - insurance sectors were comprehensively addressed . Given that at present the Government of GPE refuse to apply LAW for ORG [ i.e. the ORG ] , and issues specific to the medical and dentistry professions , including a salary increase and other pecuniary rights of doctors , are not addressed in the [ main ] ORG for ORG , a subsidiary ground for the strike is to demand that the ORG address issues specific to jobs and professions of doctors and dentists within the healthcare and health - insurance sectors . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG invited the applicant union to conclude a new collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector in the form of an annex to the main ORG .

On DATE , DATE , the ORG brought an action against the applicant union in ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u GPE ) , asking the court to prohibit the announced strike .

By a judgment of DATE ORG found for the ORG and prohibited the strike . It held that seeking compliance with the obligations arising from a collective agreement or the recognition of the results of a referendum were not permitted grounds for a strike under section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c From the cited provision [ that is , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ] it follows that , by using the formulation \u2018 in order to protect and promote the economic and social ORG , the legislator clearly excluded enforcement of the rights stipulated in a particular collective agreement as a permitted ground for a strike because ... the individual and collective enforcement of rights stipulated in a collective agreement is regulated by sections [ CARDINAL ] and [ CARDINAL ] of LAW .", "...", "As regards the subsidiary ground for the strike ... it has to be noted that the defendant \u2019s representative stated at the main hearing that this ground had been listed as subsidiary in case [ the ORG was in the meantime declared invalid ] in the [ parallel ] proceedings pending before ORG .", "...", "Finally , it has to be concluded that a strike is legally allowed only in industrial disputes on ... matters that are not legally regulated , and not in those which [ are ] . Given that the defendant insists on compliance with the [ Annex ] , it is evident that the matters [ in dispute ] ... are regulated by that ORG and that the procedure for [ its ] entry into force is also legally regulated , for which reason the substantive requirements for organising the strike are not satisfied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant union then appealed against that judgment to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant union held the strike as planned because under the domestic law its appeal prevented ORG judgment from becoming final . According to media reports the applicant union alleged that PERCENT of CARDINAL doctors and dentists had participated in the strike whereas the Minister of Health claimed that PERCENT of them had actually been striking while the others had merely expressed solidarity . The Minister also stated for the media that PERCENT of the services had been rendered and that work stoppages occurred in CARDINAL out of CARDINAL clinical centres , CARDINAL out of CARDINAL university hospitals and in CARDINAL out of CARDINAL general hospitals . The strike lasted until DATE when the applicant union called it off in order to comply with ORG subsequent provisional measure of DATE prohibiting the strike ( see the next paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . Following a request by the ORG , on DATE ORG imposed a provisional measure prohibiting the strike until that court \u2019s judgment of DATE became final , that is , until ORG decided on the applicant union \u2019s appeal against the judgment .

It held that the Annex was invalid because it had not been entered into by all the trade unions that had concluded LAW , contrary to section DATE ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and that therefore any further action based on that agreement , including the strike , was unlawful . The relevant part of ORG judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c Given that the ORG was found to be invalid , that is , unlawful , any further actions by the signatories of such an unlawful collective agreement , such as calling for and holding a referendum ... as well as the two first grounds for the strike , which are also based on the unlawful FAC , are also unlawful .", "The view of the first - instance court that it was not necessary to address the third , subsidiary , ground for the strike is correct .
