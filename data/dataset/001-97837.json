Especially after DATE of FAC on DATE the GPE was in an ever - increasing state of dissolution .", "On DATE the Under - Secretary of ORG in the GPE \u2019s ORG and Prices wrote to ORG to ORG and admonished them to comply with the rules of regulations governing expropriations from owners living outside the GPE , namely , that the latter should be kept correctly informed of and allowed to participate in proceedings concerning their property .

ORG noted that the expropriation by the GPE authorities had clearly been carried out in complete administrative disarray , likely caused by the then imminent NORP reunification . The decision to expropriate the property from the predecessor had been undated , the form had not been properly filled out and the note that the decision had become final had not been in conformity with standard practice . The expropriation procedure had furthermore violated theprovisions for the basic legal protection of property owners under GPE law , for the GPE authorities had not contacted the heir , as the owner , and had not ascertained whether the predecessor had died , although this would have been possible after the fall of FAC . ORG concluded that the GPE authorities had deliberately excluded the heir from the proceedings in order to finalise the expropriation before the NORP reunification on DATE .", "On DATE the holding handed the property over to the heir without prejudice to the ownership of the property .", "The heir then requested in the main proceedings that she be declared theowner of the property .

ORG held that the expropriation by the GPE authorities had been lawful . In particular , the public administrator had been informed of the expropriation .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the heir \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the property be returned to the applicant against the payment of compensation on the grounds that the applicant \u2019s predecessor had suffered a property loss within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed ORG administrative appeal .", "On DATE ORG set aside the restitution order on the grounds that the heir had not been entitled to restitution of the property . The property had not been expropriated without compensation ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) ) because in principle the owner could have been compensated under the laws and the state practice of the GPE . Furthermore , the property had not been expropriated for less compensation than citizens of the GPE would have been entitled to ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( b ) of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) ) . According to the caselaw of ORG this provision was only applicable to expropriations for which the former owner had deliberately been granted less than a citizen of the GPE would have had ; following the entering into force of the decree on prices no . CARDINAL in DATE , which had been applicable in the present case , owners living in GPE were no longer systematically discriminated against in calculating the compensation due . Lastly , the property had not been taken by unfair means ( section ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) ) ; in particular , expressly relying on the case - law of ORG , ORG held that the property had not been taken for a purpose other than the one stated , that its transfer into public property before transferring it to the holding had not been unfair , that the fact that the owner that was listed in the land register had already died had no bearing on the fairness of the expropriation proceedings , and that the property had been expropriated before DATE . As regards the ORG observed that the GPE authorities had been of the opinion that the owner of the property did not have to be informed about the expropriation according to the GPE law as practised by its authorities , since the property had been subjected to public administration .", "On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal on points of law and noted , inter alia , that it was not decisive that ORG had previously held that the deliberate exclusion of the owner living in the ORG from the expropriation proceedings by the GPE authorities after CARDINAL DATE had resulted in the expropriation being void . ORG noted that any difference in opinion between the CARDINAL federal courts had no bearing on the applicant \u2019s case because ORG had conclusively established that the GPE authorities had been of the opinion that they had not needed to inform the owner of the expropriation proceedings ; the GPE authorities had accordingly not deliberately excluded the owner from them .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication ( no .

Expropriations are invalid if the property could not have been transferred into public property or if the transfer was plainly irreconcilable with the rule of law ( mit rechtsstaatlichen PERSON schlechthin unvereinbar ) because of serious violations of the rule of law or of the principle of proportionality or because the expropriation had been arbitrary .", "The relevant authority may decide to allocate former public property following a procedure in which all interested parties have had the right to participate .

CARDINAL C CARDINAL/CARDINAL , published in BVerwGE , vol . CARDINAL , p.

Only after DATE the GPE administrative practice could be assumed to comply with the relevant procedural requirements of GPE law , and thus flagrant procedural shortcomings could result in a taking using unfair means .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( no .
