{"ITEMID": "001-76933", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "SAPUNARESCU v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lived in GPE , GPE . When lodging his application he was detained in GPE , GPE .", "The applicant , who described himself as a \u201c NORP \u201d , was working as an informer for ORG and ORG ( ORG ) .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE a. M. in the presence of \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d , an informer working for ORG who had pretended wanting to buy ecstasy tablets . The applicant was taken into detention on remand on suspicion of having trafficked in drugs .", "On DATE the trial on charges of drug trafficking was opened against the applicant and CARDINAL co - defendants .", "The informer \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d could not be heard as a witness in person as ORG for the ORG had made a declaration refusing the informer permission to testify in court ( GPE ) . ORG had argued that it was necessary to keep secret the identity of the informer in order to protect his life and limb as the applicant had threatened the informer with reprisals if something went wrong in the course of the drug deal .", "Therefore , the statements \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d had made to ORG were read out in the hearing . \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d submitted that he had travelled to GPE twice , not on the police \u2019s instruction , but merely in order to visit his friend \u201c X \u201d . In GPE he had met various persons , acquaintances of \u201c X \u201d , who had proposed to sell drugs to him . He did not wish to disclose the identity of \u201c X \u201d for fear of reprisals by the organizers of the drug deal . In GPE a. M. he had then met the applicant who had offered him CARDINAL ecstasy tablets which had been delivered by the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL accomplices DATE .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer requested the court to interrogate the informer \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d or to have him interrogated as to the identity and address of \u201c X \u201d . He wished to question \u201c X \u201d as a witness in order to prove that \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d had willingly and illegally provoked the drug deal in GPE on the instructions of the NORP police . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion , arguing that it was not necessary to investigate the identity of \u201c X \u201d . However , a catalogue of other questions were submitted to the police officer PERSON , who was supervising \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d , by the court on the applicant \u2019s request and the answers given by \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d were subsequently read out in court .", "On DATE the GPE a. ORG convicted the applicant of joint drug trafficking and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It based its findings of fact on the applicant \u2019s confession and that of his CARDINAL co - defendants as well as on the evidence given by CARDINAL eye - witnesses , the informer \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d and another informer ( who had also been refused permission to testify in court ) whose statements had been read out in the hearing . It found that , despite the caution necessary when a witness could not be questioned personally in court and his statements were merely read out , the informers had to be considered as credible . In assessing their credibility , the court took into account the oral statements made by the police officer S. supervising them . S. had stated , in particular , that he knew \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d already for a long time , had checked the trustworthiness of his statements on several occasions and had also observed him on CARDINAL occasion when he met the applicant in GPE .", "In its judgment , the GPE a. ORG dismissed a further motion of the applicant to have \u201c X \u201d questioned . Because of the declaration made by ORG for the ORG refusing \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d permission to testify , the court had been unable to question him . Both the questioning of \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d on the identity of \u201c X \u201d and that of \u201c X \u201d would lead to the disclosure of the identity of \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d , which would be detrimental to the welfare of GPE or ORG .", "In fixing the applicant \u2019s sentence , the GPE a. ORG took into consideration as a mitigating factor that the drug deal had been monitored by the police from the outset so that it was not very likely that the drugs could ever be circulated .", "On DATE ( decision served on DATE ) ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . He argued that his rights under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with the rule of law , which enshrined the rights protected by LAW , were violated by the decision of ORG . He argued that ORG refusal to have the informer \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d and \u201c X \u201d questioned violated his right to have witnesses against him examined and restricted his defence rights . The illegal provocation of the drugs deal by \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d on instructions of the NORP police , which would have been proved on examination of these witnesses , would at least have led to a significant reduction of his sentence .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . It held that the complaint had no prospects of success as it was ill - founded .", "ORG found that the applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial in accordance with the rule of law under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW had not been violated in the proceedings at issue . It argued that in cases in which a witness was refused permission to testify the defendant \u2019s rights could adequately be protected by submitting questions to the witness in writing which the latter had to answer in an adequate manner . In so far as the responses to the questions could not lead to the disclosure of the witness \u2019s identity , a court was not authorised generally to refuse the defendant or his defence counsel questioning the witness in this way .", "However , ORG found that in the present case the rejection of the motion to take evidence was justified . The witness \u201c VP CARDINAL \u201d , when interrogated by the police , had already stated that he would not disclose the identity of \u201c X \u201d . Due to the refusal to give the witness permission to testify ORG had no means to force him , if necessary by the imposition of a fine or by arrest for disobedience to a court order pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , to disclose what he knew . In practice , a renewed police interrogation of the informer would therefore not have caused him to make further statements as to the identity of \u201c X \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
