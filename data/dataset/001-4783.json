THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE , and resides in PERSON .", "On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) of PERSON ordered the applicant to remove a garden house and a QUANTITY high garden fence , which the applicant had built without a construction permit as required under LAW ) , or to reduce the height of the fence to QUANTITY . He was further informed that , in accordance with LAW ( PERSON ) , failure to comply with this order would entail a penalty of ORG . CARDINAL per week for the garden house and ORG . CARDINAL per week for the fence , not exceeding a total amount of ORG . CARDINAL .", "The applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) against the decision of DATE was rejected by ORG on DATE . As regards the garden fence , ORG noted that , under LAW ( j ) of LAW , a construction permit is required for fences QUANTITY . Although the applicable rules did allow exemptions , no exemption could be granted in the applicant \u2019s case given the local urban development situation , the dominant character of the fence and the fact that , according to ORG ( GPE ) , the fence did not comply with the reasonable requirements of external appearances of buildings ( \u201c redelijke eisen van welstand \u201d ) . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal to ORG of ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE was rejected on DATE .", "By letter of DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG . In this letter the applicant informed ORG that , in the meantime , the garden house had been moved to a different - for the municipal authorities acceptable - place on his LOC . As regards the decision concerning the fence the applicant invoked , inter alia , LAW and in this context argued that this fence had been built on his property in order to protect the privacy of his family . He explained that the aim of the fence was to protect his pets , plants and bushes from footballs of soccer playing children landing in his garden , and to block the irritating lights from cars passing by and the strong light from the central hall of the nearby home for the elderly .", "In its decision of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It noted that , according to LAW , no construction permit is required for a fence built outside the building line ( rooilijn ) if its height does not exceed QUANTITY . As the applicant \u2019s LOC lie on a corner of CARDINAL streets and as the fence , which was QUANTITY , had been built outside the front building line , ORG was competent to issue the order for removal . It further held that it had not been established that the fence qualified for legalisation .", "ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s argument under LAW , holding that the submitted aim of the fence , namely to prevent children \u2019s footballs from ending up on the applicant \u2019s premises , was insufficient for a finding that the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his private life or home came into play .", ""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
