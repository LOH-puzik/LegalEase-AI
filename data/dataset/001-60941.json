On CARDINAL DATE the applicant , who had qualified as a doctor in GPE in DATE after graduating in medicine from ORG , applied to ORG of the ordre des m\u00e9decins ( ORG ) for registration as a member of the ordre .", "CARDINAL . The d\u00e9partement council refused her application on the ground that , although she was NORP , she did not have a NORP medical qualification . The applicant subsequently made CARDINAL unsuccessful applications to the Minister for Health for authorisation under LAW CARDINAL , point ( CARDINAL ) , third paragraph , of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again applied to the d\u00e9partement council , relying on the Government Declarations of CARDINAL DATE on GPE , known as the \u201c LOC \u201d , and in particular on LAW between GPE and GPE ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) , of which LAW I provides :", "\u201c Academic diplomas and qualifications obtained in GPE and GPE under the same conditions as regards curriculum , attendance and examinations shall be automatically valid in both countries . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Her application was rejected on DATE by ORG of the ordre des m\u00e9decins , which refused to register her .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision to FAC Corse regional council of the ordre des m\u00e9decins . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the regional council upheld the decision to refuse her registration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the disciplinary section of ORG ordre des m\u00e9decins . In a decision of DATE the disciplinary section refused her application on the ground , inter alia , that the terms of LAW Declarations could not by themselves confer the right to practise medicine in GPE on all those who had obtained medical qualifications in GPE after that date , and therefore could not be used in support of an application for registration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the ORG d'Etat for judicial review of that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the ORG d'Etat , ORG of ORG submitted observations on the applicant 's application . It stated :", "\u201c This application calls for the following observations on my part , which , as you requested , concern the provisions of LAW between GPE and GPE , CARDINAL of the declarations making up the ' PERSON . ...", "CARDINAL . Nature of the provisions", "The PERSON d'Etat , acting in its judicial capacity , has already had occasion to rule on the nature of the provisions of the ' PERSON . Agreeing with the ORG 's position , it held that the ORG constituted an international treaty ( see the PERSON d'Etat 's PERSON judgment of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON du ORG d'Etat [ Reports of the judgments of the PERSON d'Etat ] , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Applicability of the provisions", "The Government Declarations of DATE were approved in a referendum held on DATE and were subsequently published in ORG on DATE . They came into force on DATE following an exchange of letters between the President of GPE and the Chairman of the Provisional Executive of ORG .", "Since no measures have been taken to suspend their application or to revise their content , the provisions in question must be regarded as having been in force on DATE and DATE , when the impugned decisions ... were taken .", "However , the reciprocity requirement in LAW can not be regarded as having been satisfied at that time , since those provisions had not been applied by the NORP authorities in respect of applications by NORP nationals with qualifications obtained in GPE . Consequently , they can not be applied to the facts of the present case .", "CARDINAL . In the alternative , the scope of the provisions", "LAW ... lays down the principle that NORP and NORP qualifications are automatically equivalent , without there being any need for implementing regulations , provided that the curricula followed are similar .", "Regard being had , in particular , to the precision of their content and the lack of any reference to implementing measures , the provisions in issue appear to be directly effective .", "However , they can not be regarded as establishing an unconditional right for anyone having obtained medical qualifications in GPE to be registered as a member of the NORP ordre des m\u00e9decins . In assessing candidates for registration as a member of the national ordre , reference should be made to the domestic legislation in force , in particular Articles L. CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , the requirements of which , in the case of foreign nationals , go beyond the production of a NORP medical degree or a recognised equivalent qualification , as candidates must also undergo professional aptitude tests . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After being apprised of those observations , the applicant produced to the ORG d'Etat declarations from various NORP authorities certifying that qualifications obtained in GPE by NORP practitioners were recognised as being automatically valid in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG d'Etat , acting in its judicial capacity , did not follow the submissions of the Government Commissioner , PERSON , and dismissed the application in the following terms :", "\u201c ...", "As regards the argument based on LAW between GPE and GPE :", "...", "LAW DATE provides : ' Treaties or agreements that have been lawfully ratified or approved shall , upon publication , prevail over Acts of ORG , subject , in respect of each agreement or treaty , to its application by the other party . ' It is not for the administrative courts to determine whether and to what extent the manner in which a treaty or agreement is applied by the other party is capable of depriving the instrument 's provisions of the authority conferred on them by LAW . In observations produced on DATE the Minister for ORG stated that the aforementioned provisions of LAW between GPE and GPE could not be regarded as having been in force on the date of the decision complained of , seeing that on that date the reciprocity requirement laid down in LAW had not been satisfied . [ The applicant ] is accordingly not entitled to rely on those provisions .", "As regards the other arguments :", "...", "Although [ the applicant ] submits that the disciplinary section of ORG ordre des m\u00e9decins infringed ORG DATE on the recognition of diplomas , she has not produced any information from which it may be ascertained whether that argument is well - founded . ORG DATE does not impose on the member GPE any obligations on which [ the applicant ] could rely .", "As [ the applicant ] was unable to show either that she had obtained the NORP qualification for practising as a doctor or any of the qualifications listed in LAW CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW or that she had been granted the special ministerial authorisation provided for in LAW ... for persons with foreign qualifications , she could not expect to be registered . Consequently , her argument that the disciplinary section did not take into account her ability and her clinical and academic experience is irrelevant .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a ministerial order of CARDINAL DATE , published in the NORP ORG on DATE , the applicant was authorised to practise as a doctor in GPE with effect from DATE , LAW L. CARDINAL , point ( CARDINAL ) , third paragraph , of LAW . On the basis of that order , in a decision of DATE , the FAC d\u00e9partement council of the ordre des m\u00e9decins registered the applicant as a member of the ordre . On DATE it recognised the applicant 's abilities as an orthopaedic surgeon by designating her as a doctor specialising in orthopaedic surgery , on the basis of her qualifications and professional experience .", "LAW provides :", "\u201c Treaties or agreements that have been lawfully ratified or approved shall , upon publication , prevail over Acts of ORG , subject , in respect of each agreement or treaty , to its application by the other party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Anyone wishing to practise as a doctor in GPE must satisfy certain conditions laid down in Articles L. CARDINAL , PERSON and PERSON of LAW . The CARDINAL fundamental requirements are possession of certain qualifications referred to in Article PERSON or of a special status ( LAW CARDINAL , point ( CARDINAL ) , first and second paragraphs ) , and nationality ( Article L. CARDINAL , point ( CARDINAL ) , second paragraph ) . A third condition is registration as a member of the ordre des m\u00e9decins ( Article L. CARDINAL , point ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . It follows from those provisions that anyone who has a \u201c diploma , certificate or other qualification referred to in Article PERSON \u201d and is a \u201c NORP national or a national of CARDINAL of the member GPE of ORG , of CARDINAL of the other GPE Parties to the Agreement on ORG , of GPE or of GPE ... \u201d automatically qualifies for registration as a member of the ordre .

NORP The Minister for Health may also , after obtaining the opinion of a committee , authorise other persons on an individual basis to practise medicine ( Article L.

The maximum number of persons who may be granted such authorisation is set every year \u201c by order of the Minister for Health , with the agreement of the aforementioned committee , regard being had to the arrangement under which they intend to practise \u201d .", "CARDINAL . For a long time the ORG d'Etat regarded the interpretation of an international treaty containing ambiguous or unclear provisions as a matter outside its jurisdiction because it deemed such interpretation to be a prerogative act that could not be dissociated from international relations and was not open to challenge in the courts ( a position maintained since PERSON , ORG , judgment of DATE , PERSON du ORG d'Etat , p. CARDINAL ) . When confronted with provisions that it considered insufficiently clear , it relied on the official interpretation given by the Minister for ORG ( see also PERSON , judgment of DATE , PERSON , III , p. CARDINAL , together with the submissions of Mr ORG and the commentary by Mr PERSON ) . Since the PERSON d'Etat 's judgment of DATE in ORG , the practice of referring a preliminary question to the minister has been discontinued and the PERSON d'Etat now interprets international agreements itself ; if it seeks the opinion of the executive , it does not regard itself as bound by it ( see ORG , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG arr\u00eats du ORG d'Etat , p. CARDINAL , and the ORG 's judgment in GPE v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B ) concerning a ruling given before the ORG d'Etat had altered its position ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the Government Declarations of DATE , the ORG d'Etat ruled in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG PERSON , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) that they should be regarded as constituting an international treaty . It so held after referring a preliminary question to the Minister for ORG as to the interpretation of the Declarations ' scope . The PERSON d'Etat maintained that position even after discontinuing the practice of referring preliminary questions on the interpretation of an international treaty ( see , for example , ORG , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , case no . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the change in position resulting from ORG has not been transposed to the context of applying the reciprocity clause in LAW . The PERSON d'Etat has taken the view that it is not its task to assess whether and to what extent the manner in which a treaty or agreement is applied by the other party is capable of depriving the instrument 's provisions of the authority conferred on them by LAW ( see PERSON and ministre du Budget contre PERSON , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , p. CARDINAL , judgments of the full court , and ministre du Budget contre PERSON , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . Those judgments and the one in the instant case are the only ones in which the ORG d'Etat has ruled on the manner in which the reciprocity clause is to be applied and on the continuation of the practice of referring preliminary questions to the Minister for ORG .", "CARDINAL . When dealing with issues relating to reciprocity , ORG initially adopted the same solution as that advocated by the ORG d'Etat ( Court of Cassation , ORG , DATE , Males , ORG no . CARDINAL ) . It subsequently held that in the absence of any measures by the government to denounce a treaty or suspend its application ( such as publication in ORG of a memorandum by the Minister for ORG ) , it was not for the courts to review compliance with the condition of reciprocity in inter - State relations as laid down in LAW ( PERSON . civ . ) I , DATE , PERSON , \u00e9pouse ORG international public DATE , p.
