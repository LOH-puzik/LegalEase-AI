The applicant \u2019s request for summoning waitresses from the restaurant in which he had been dining on TIME DATE was dismissed on grounds of their incorrect identification and the unclear description of facts the defence intended to prove .

There was no proof that such report existed . The court also dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to re - examine some experts given that their testimonies would not disclose any new facts other than the ones that had been testified before the trial court .
