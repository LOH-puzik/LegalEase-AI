FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON U.V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a professional race horse trainer who participates in trotting races with his own horses and/or horses trained by him . On DATE a horse called PERSON , which was trained by the applicant , tested positive in a doping - test at ORG .", "On DATE ORG of Hippos ( Suomen Hippos r.y . , LOC r.f ; ORG for NORP Horse Racing and Breeding . ) suspended the applicant and PERSON from racing for DATE ( from DATE until DATE ) . The suspension order included racing , training a horse as its official trainer and enrolment of a horse in a race . The prize money of CARDINAL NORP Marks ( ORG ) won by PERSON in PERSON was withdrawn and the prize money of CARDINAL ORG won by the same horse in the Vermo Race earlier was ordered to be refunded to the race organiser . The applicant \u2019s request to be heard before ORG and to hold an oral hearing was refused .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the ORG of ORG decision to ORG ( ravituomioistuin , travdomstolen ) , requesting an oral hearing . The applicant insisted that it would have been important to hear witnesses about the circumstances in which the doping - test was taken and the methods used .", "On DATE ( i.e. DATE before the suspension order ended ) ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal without holding an oral hearing .", "The applicant has not instituted any proceedings before ordinary courts .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "Horse racing ( in the present case , in particular , trotting ) is administered in GPE by ORG , a registered association to which LAW ( yhdistyslaki , f\u00f6reningslag ; CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) is applied . ORG of Hippos ratifies the trotting regulations to be followed in the trotting races in GPE . Rule CARDINAL of the above - mentioned regulations deals with questions concerning doping , medical substances and punishment for breaching the rule . According to Rule CARDINAL , the punishment for a breach of the said rule is determined by ORG of Hippos . If the length of such a punishment exceeds DATE , the decision may be appealed against to ORG . The Members of ORG are appointed by ORG .", "According to LAW , an association must have rules which fulfil all the conditions given in the LAW . The lawfulness of the rules of an association are examined by ORG ( yhdistysrekisteri , f\u00f6reningsregistret ) at the time of the registration of the association . According to LAW , a member of an association may institute proceedings against the association before ordinary courts if he considers a decision of the association to be unlawful .", "Hippos only allows other associations as it members . Private persons are members of such associations instead of being members of ORG itself and have , thus , no right to institute proceedings against ORG .", "In its decision of DATE ORG ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) observed that a manifest and sufficient need for legal protection constitutes a ground for bringing a case concerning a suspension order given by a sports association before a court to obtain a decision on merits . ORG further reasoned that such a need for legal protection arises when the suspension order has \u201c such significant financial and other effects as are usually not involved in the membership of an association \u201d . In the said case ORG had issued its decision on CARDINAL DATE and ORG on DATE .", "The decision of DATE of ORG ( ORG ) did not concern the legitimacy of a suspension order but a request to have enforcement of a suspension order repealed as an interim measure in the ordinary court . ORG found that the repealing of the enforcement of a suspension order fell within the scope of application of LAW , LAW on Judicial Procedure , providing for interim measures . In the said case ORG had issued its decision on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
