SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic and Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , born in DATE , is a businessman living in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner of CARDINAL properties , of QUANTITY m. and QUANTITY CARDINAL respectively,\uf020in the municipality of GPE . CARDINAL of the second property is tied up with a joint ownership of part of a path . In DATE an area zoning plan was prepared , although no general settlement regarding the applicant 's properties was achieved . The applicant also unsuccessfully requested the GPE municipality on a number of occasions to take over the CARDINAL properties and to compensate him accordingly .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was also involved in other building proceedings in the GPE municipality in which the opposing party , a cantonal insurance pension office , was represented by a lawyer , Mr W.", "CARDINAL . The applicant was furthermore involved in building proceedings against the CARDINAL municipality in which that municipality was represented by a lawyer , PERSON These proceedings were conducted before ORG of the GPE of GPE and in last resort before ORG , its decision having been given on DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON and Mr W. are practising lawyers ( PERSON ) who at that time shared office premises in GPE together with Mr L. Lawyers R. and PERSON also acted as part - time administrative court judges at ORG of the GPE of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings concerning the applicant 's properties in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant filed on DATE an action with ORG of the GPE of GPE , requesting an order that the GPE municipality take over the CARDINAL properties , including the joint ownership , for the sum of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant 's case , the bench of ORG was then composed of CARDINAL judges , namely the Vice - President , CARDINAL administrative court judges and CARDINAL substitute judge . Among the administrative court judges were NORP and PERSON , who were part - time judges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected the applicant 's action . The ORG found that it was not competent to deal with the matter which appertained to the jurisdiction of ORG Sch\u00e4tzungskommission ) . However , the court declined to transmit the case to ORG as the applicant had forfeited his right to claim compensation . Thus , if he had disagreed with the area zoning plan , in particular with the settlement of accounts of DATE , he should have requested the institution of assessment proceedings at the relevant time . The ORG found that the claim for compensation would in any event be unfounded as it had to be directed against other proprietors in the area covered by the zoning plan , rather than the municipality .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a public - law appeal with ORG in which he complained , on the one hand , about the outcome of the proceedings , on the other , that judge NORP had shortly before acted in separate appeal proceedings , instituted by the applicant , as the legal representative of the opposing party , namely the GPE . Moreover , judge NORP shared office premises with judge PERSON , and also with PERSON who , in separate proceedings instituted by the applicant , had represented the opposing party .", "CARDINAL . The public - law appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE , the decision being served on DATE . In its decision , the court dealt with the applicant 's complaint that certain judges of ORG had not been impartial as follows :", "\u201c The interrelations mentioned may raise certain doubts in view of LAW which requires the impartiality of judges . However , the applicant does not claim that NORP or another member of ORG was in fact biased when giving the contested decision . ORG has already previously held that the fact that legal representatives in the GPE of GPE also acted as part - time administrative court judges could under certain circumstances result in an interrelation of interests . The ORG found , however , that it could be expected from a part - time judge that he could distinguish between his official function and his private professional activities . A part - time judge was not , therefore , obliged to stand down merely because he had represented legal interests in other proceedings which were opposed to those of the applicant ... In view of these principles it can equally not be assumed in the present case that ORG was composed of judges who could be regarded as biased when giving the contested decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG furthermore did not consider it arbitrary that ORG had found that the applicant 's claims were forfeited as he had failed duly to raise them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request to reopen the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG of the GPE of GPE consists of both full - time and part - time judges , the latter also acting as practising lawyers on a part - time basis .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG ( Verwaltungsrechtspflegegesetz ) of the GPE of GPE of DATE concerns \u201c incompatibility \u201d ( GPE ) and stated in the version in force at the relevant time :", "\u201c CARDINAL . NORP The office of a full - time judge of ORG is incompatible with any other full - time professional activity [ hauptberufliche ORG ] . Full - time judges may not be members of ORG nor members or registrars of a municipal or district council . They are not allowed legally to represent third persons before courts and administrative bodies . An authorisation of the cantonal parliament is required if they wish to belong to the administration or management of a commercial company or cooperative acting for commercial purposes .", "CARDINAL . NORP Part - time judges may not be employed full - time by an administrative authority or a court , and may not be members or registrars of a municipal or district council . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Administrative Judiciary Procedure Act was revised in DATE and section CARDINAL now states :", "\u201c CARDINAL . NORP The office of a full - time member of ORG is incompatible both with any other full - time professional activity and with the professional representation of third persons before courts or administrative authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP The office of a part - time member of ORG is incompatible with the professional representation of third persons before ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In GPE no particular magistrate 's training is required to enter the judicial profession . This explains , inter alia , the comparatively high number of practising lawyers ( legal representatives ) acting as part - time or substitute judges .", "CARDINAL . The ORG consists of CARDINAL full - time and CARDINAL part - time judges , and ORG consists of CARDINAL full - time and CARDINAL part - time judges . Part - time judges may exercise the profession of practising lawyer . According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( Organisationsgesetz ) , judges shall stand down if , in a particular case , they have participated in another capacity , inter alia as legal adviser or as practising lawyer . ORG of ORG furthermore avoids appointing as part - time judges persons resident in the canton in which the case originates .", "CARDINAL . In various federal appeals commissions ( PERSON ) provision is made for full - time and part - time judges . Whatever other functions the latter exercise , these functions may not compromise the accomplishment of their tasks or the independence and reputation of the appeals commission .", "CARDINAL . In various cantons , no particular regulations exist as to part - time judges acting as practising lawyers , for example for certain judges of the Cantons of Appenzell Inner Rhodes , Graub\u00fcnden and GPE . Other cantons have specific legislation on the matter .", "CARDINAL . For instance , certain cantonal courts are composed exclusively of full - time judges who exercise no other legal profession , for instance ORG and of GPE ; ORG and GPE ; ORG of the GPE of ORG ; and ORG and ORG of the Canton of GPE . In the GPE of Graub\u00fcnden , as from DATE , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL presidents of the first - instance courts will act as full - time judges .", "CARDINAL . In some cantons , certain part - time judges are prohibited from acting as practising lawyers , for instance in the GPE of GPE ( part - time judges of ORG in criminal cases ) and in the GPE of GPE ( part - time judges of ORG and the specialised administrative courts and the presidents of the district courts ) . In the GPE of GPE a new law has been proposed which , as from DATE , intends to prohibit part - time judges from acting as practising lawyers , although this function will continue to be possible for substitute judges . In the GPE of PERSON , part - time district court judges may not act as practising lawyers in the district in question .", "CARDINAL . In various cantons part - time judges of a court may not appear before that court as practising lawyers , for instance in GPE , GPE ( in respect of ORG ) , ORG ( in respect of the regular judge at ORG in administrative matters ) , PERSON ( in respect of part - time judges who are otherwise employed for PERCENT of their time ) , PERSON ( in respect of judges of the administrative courts and their respective divisions and , as from DATE , in respect of district and regional court presidents and their deputies ) . The GPE of GPE is currently revising its relevant legal norms along these lines .", "CARDINAL . Certain cantonal courts envisage the possibility for substitute judges to act as practising lawyers , for instance in the Cantons of Aargau ( labour courts ) , ORG ) , GPE , GPE , ORG ) , GPE , GPE and GPE ( ORG and ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has pronounced on various occasions on the question of the impartiality of lawyers acting as judges , in particular the danger of a link of dependency between the judge and one of the parties . For instance , a lawyer may not act as judge in a case where he or she is representing CARDINAL of the parties to the case , or where in separate pending proceedings he or she is representing the opposing party . On the other hand , as a rule no issue will arise where the lawyer once represented a party and the mandate has been completed . The mere fact that the lawyer generally advises in building matters does not imply that as a judge he will necessarily favour a plaintiff who is involved in the construction of a house ( see judgment of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON Staats- PERSON CARDINAL , DATE , DATE ; and the judgment of DATE , ORG f\u00e9d\u00e9ral suisse ( ORG ) , vol .
