The applicant was born in DATE in GPE and currently lives in sheltered accommodation ( betreutes PERSON ) in PERSON ( Land of GPE , GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant married in GPE and converted to her husband \u2019s faith , that of the NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her husband moved to GPE in DATE . The husband was granted refugee status but the applicant \u2019s own application for asylum was refused . As the spouse of a refugee , she received a temporary residence permit on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave birth to her son . In DATE the applicant and her husband separated . The son stayed with the applicant . From then on the applicant worked as a cleaner in different companies . On DATE she was awarded a permanent residence permit .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant became unemployed due to behavioural issues that appeared to be caused by psychological problems . In DATE she and her spouse divorced . In DATE the domestic family court transferred custody rights over her son to her husband and her son was living with him from then on .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant killed a neighbour by strangling her and pushing her down a staircase . Subsequently , she was detained and held in pre - trial detention . Following an attempt to harm herself , a domestic court ordered her committal to a psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG established that the applicant had committed manslaughter in a state of mental incapacity . At the time of the act she had been in a state of acute psychosis . A medical expert noted that she suffered from symptoms of schizophrenia and had diminished intelligence . She did not acknowledge her own psychological condition . The domestic court therefore concluded that she remained a danger for the general public and a continuous stay in a psychiatric hospital had to be ordered . The applicant was also appointed a legal guardian .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the administrative authority PERSON ordered the applicant \u2019s expulsion . Relying on LAW of the LAW on the Residence , Economic Activity and Integration of Foreigners in the Federal Territory ( hereafter \u201c the Residence Act \u201d , Aufenthaltsgesetz , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the authority referred to the offence which had led to the applicant \u2019s committal to the psychiatric hospital and her mental condition in general . The authority concluded that she posed a danger to public safety . In such a case her personal circumstances , namely her long stay in GPE and her residence status , were secondary . She was neither economically integrated nor sufficiently able to communicate in NORP , which was an obstacle to her therapy . She only had limited contacts with her former husband and her son and she was still familiar with the NORP culture . Adequate medical care was available in GPE and the applicant \u2019s family there could assist her .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was granted privileges in the hospital , for example she was granted DATE of leave , which had not led to any complaints . She also started working DATE in the laundry department of the clinic . This was possible due to her improved mental health . In proceedings concerning a provisional stay on the expulsion , the authorities committed themselves not to execute the expulsion decision before a court ruling on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s action against the expulsion order . It upheld the decision that the applicant could be deported , on the grounds of the serious offence committed by her , lack of awareness of her own condition and given that a high probability of reoffending therefore existed . Moreover , she was not integrated into NORP society , especially due to her lack of NORP language skills . LAW was not applicable as the applicant had no significant family relationships . The domestic court noted that , in principle , in GPE basic medical care for psychiatric patients existed in big cities like GPE and that the applicant could afford treatment , including medication , as she would be receiving a small pension in the amount of QUANTITY ( ORG ) . The domestic court recognised that family members in GPE had explicitly ruled out that they would take her in , when asked by ORG . However , the domestic court thought it conceivable that the applicant \u2019s relatives would help her with organising the required treatment if she were to provide them with small sums in CARDINAL in return . Furthermore , the applicant did not hold a visible position within the NORP religion , so there would be no specific danger for her in that regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application for leave to appeal . It noted that the administrative court had taken into account all relevant facts of the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained in vain of the breach of her right to be heard ( FAC ) . She argued that her submissions on her improved state of health , the death of her sister in GPE and the expected living conditions there had not been given proper consideration . Moreover , she claimed that she had close contact with her son who visited her on a regular basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lifted the hospital treatment order on the recommendation of a medical report and released the applicant on probation , ordering a DATE probation period . It ordered the applicant to remain in regular contact with the medical personnel of the clinic and to continue to take the prescribed medication . The domestic court held that , due to the treatment , the danger of the applicant \u2019s re - offending had diminished to such an extent that a residual risk had to be tolerated .", "CARDINAL . The medical report in question further indicated that , after having overcome some initial difficulties , she was reachable , while deficits in her cognitive performance remained . The language barrier caused problems during some therapy sessions and due to cognitive deficiencies difficulties remained , even with the assistance of an interpreter . She continued to work in the laundry , took her medication regularly and ultimately showed balanced behaviour . Her son visited her on a regular basis and wished to be more involved in her care . Such involvement , however , would have to be limited due to his situation as a young adult beginning his studies . She was compliant with all requirements and embraced the stable environment in which she was settled . Her prognosis could be considered positive .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was transferred to sheltered accommodation close to the clinic , where the required structure would be ensured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the deportation order was not admitted for review by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was notified on DATE that a petition to the parliament of ORG in this matter had not been successful .", "CARDINAL . So far , no date for the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE has been set ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
