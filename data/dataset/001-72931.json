[ the proceedings ] , given the manner in which they were conducted , can not be deemed particularly complex . That said , it should be pointed out that the proceedings gave rise to many hearings , some of which were mere adjournments , and as such unnecessary . With regard to the conduct of the parties , the adjournments they requested or at least agreed to must be attributed to them . They must therefore be deemed responsible for the adjournments requested by CARDINAL party and which the other parties did not oppose or which were accepted and therefore allowed by the court . ... The fact that the court allowed the parties to exercise ... [ through those adjournments ] their right to a defence can not be blamed a posteriori on the public organisation of the service .", "The remaining period does have to be attributed to the conduct of the judicial authorities , however , both regarding the intervals relating to the adjournments of the court \u2019s own motion and the adjournments for reasons relating to investigation measures which took longer than a reasonable time to carry out .", "Indeed , when the situation is analysed in accordance with Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL [ Pinto ] , the time that elapsed between the beginning of the proceedings and the end is a central factor : in this sense , the fact that the length of the proceedings , which is not attributable to the parties\u2019 conduct , is otherwise determined \u2013 in the sphere of the organisation of the court service and , in general , the services managed by the authorities involved in giving a decision or contributing to the disposal of the proceedings \u2013 by personal or structural factors , such as the shortage of staff when compared with the demands of the workload , does not change the conclusion that this time must be attributed to the ORG , which has not assigned the resources necessary to dispose of a trial speedily .", "Accordingly , on the basis of that analysis the delays attributable to the parties can be quantified at DATE at first instance . The proceedings are still pending on appeal but the case has already been referred to the appropriate Chamber for the hearing of final submissions on DATE and , given that the first hearing was held on DATE , the period can be regarded as falling within the reasonable time - span of DATE .", "On that basis , the delays attributable to the organisation of the courts , less the delays attributable to the parties , amount to DATE and DATE .", "Moreover , taking the main thrust of the case - law of ORG as a basis , a reasonable time for the average timescale for the conduct of a case at first instance can prima facie properly be fixed at DATE . For proceedings dealt with also on appeal the reasonable length can be fixed at DATE for proceedings whose subject - matter is nothing out of the ordinary .", "In the instant case , therefore , the surplus time must be deemed to be DATE .", "The reasonable time must accordingly be deemed to have been exceeded in so far as the case was not particularly complex and the delays attributable to the parties have already been taken into account .", "For the rest , the claim for compensation of MONEY appears totally disproportionate and unsupported by evidence . Accordingly , the award must be significantly less .", "Consequently , having taken into consideration the parties\u2019 interest in having the proceedings disposed of , as their conduct has shown , the lack of complexity of the case , in the absence of evidence supplied by the parties , and the limited impact of the non - pecuniary damage , the court considers it equitable to award Mr Musci CARDINAL,CARDINAL euros in damages . \u201d", "ORG awarded the applicant ORG CARDINAL on an equitable basis in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .

CARDINAL , for failure to comply with the reasonable time referred to in DATE , paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW . \u201d In other words , PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of ORG . This Convention instituted a ORG ( ORG , with its seat in GPE ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein ( Article CARDINAL ) . Accordingly , the competence of the said court to determine , and therefore to interpret , the significance of the said provisions must be recognised .", "As the fact constituting the right conferred by PERSON no . ORG consists of a violation of LAW , it is for ORG to determine all the elements of such a legal fact , which thus ends by being \u201c brought into conformity \u201d by ORG , whose case - law is binding on the NORP courts in so far as the application of PERSON no . PERSON is concerned .", "It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between LAW and the internal judicial system , which ORG ( Procuratore Generale ) has amply discussed in court . Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of LAW in the context of the sources of domestic law , it is certain that the direct implementation in the NORP judicial system of a provision of LAW , established by PERSON no . PERSON ( that is , by LAW in the part relating to \u201c reasonable time \u201d ) , can not diverge from the interpretation which ORG gives of the same provision .", "The opposite argument , which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL in the national system and the interpretation given by ORG to the right to reasonable length of proceedings , would deprive the said PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of any justification and cause the NORP ORG to violate LAW , according to which \u2018 The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in LAW ( including the said LAW , which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable length of time ) .", "The reason behind the enactment of PERSON no . PERSON was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings , so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of ORG , expressly provided for by LAW CARDINAL : \u201c the ORG may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted \u201d ) . The NORP system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity . From it derives the duty of the GPE which have ratified LAW to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by LAW , above all in their own internal order and vis - \u00e0 - vis the organs of the national judicial system . And this protection must be \u201c effective \u201d ( LAW ) , that is , of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to ORG .", "The domestic remedy introduced by Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL did not previously exist in the NORP system , with the consequence that appeals against GPE in respect of a violation of LAW had \u201c clogged \u201d ( the term used by rapporteur PERSON in the sitting of the ORG of DATE ) ORG . ORG observed , prior to LAW no . PERSON , that the said failures to comply on the part of GPE \u201c reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy . This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention \u201d ( see the CARDINAL judgments of the ORG delivered on DATE in the cases of PERSON , PERSON , ORG and PERSON ) .", "Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL constitutes the domestic remedy to which a \u201c victim of a violation \u201d ( as defined by LAW CARDINAL ( failure to comply with the reasonable - time requirement ) must have recourse before applying to ORG to claim the \u201c just satisfaction \u201d provided for in LAW , which , when the violation exists , is only awarded by the ORG \u201c if the internal law of ORG concerned allows only partial reparation to be made \u201d . Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL has therefore allowed ORG to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it ( including before the LAW was passed ) and aimed at obtaining just satisfaction provided for in LAW for the excessive length of proceedings ( ORG v. GPE , decision of DATE ) .", "This mechanism for implementation of LAW and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of ORG of GPE does not operate , however , in cases in which the ORG holds that the consequences of the established violation of LAW have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only \u201c partially \u201d , because in such an event the said LAW provides for the intervention of ORG to protect the \u201c victim of the violation \u201d . In such cases an individual application to ORG on the basis of LAW is admissible ( Scordino and Others v. GPE , decision of DATE ) and the ORG acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law .", "The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is , obviously , ORG , whose duty it is to apply Article CARDINAL of ORG to ascertain whether , in the presence of a violation of a provision of LAW , the internal law has been able to fully redress the consequences of this violation .", "The argument whereby , in applying PERSON no . PERSON , the NORP court may follow a different interpretation from that which ORG has given to the provisions of LAW ( violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law ) implies that the victim of the violation , if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by ORG , must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in LAW from the latter Court . This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in NORP law by PERSON no . PERSON and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of ORG .", "It is therefore necessary to concur with ORG , which , in the above - mentioned decision on the PERSON application ( concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the NORP courts in implementing PERSON no . ORG ) , affirmed that \u201c it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must , where possible , interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention \u201d .", "... The preparatory documents of PERSON no . PERSON are even more explicit . In the report concerning the bill of Senator PERSON ( proceedings of the ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE ) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative ( and then adopted by the LAW ) secures for the applicant \u201c a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court \u201d , as the direct reference to LAW makes it possible to transfer to domestic level \u201c the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level , limits which depend essentially on the ORG and on the development of the case - law of the GPE authorities , especially that of ORG , whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits \u201d .", "... CARDINAL . \u2013 The considerations expounded in sections CARDINAL of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of ORG on the implementation of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL with regard to reparation for non - pecuniary damage .", "In this particular instance , however , any possibility for the national court to exclude non - pecuniary damage ( despite having found a violation of LAW of ORG ) must be considered as non - existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of ORG which , with reference to the same proceedings , had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non - pecuniary damage for the applicant , which the ORG itself redressed for a limited period . From such a decision of ORG it follows that , once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision , the applicant has continued to suffer non - pecuniary damage , which must be compensated for in application of PERSON no . PERSON .", "It can not therefore be maintained DATE as ORG has done DATE that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question . Such a reason , apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that ORG has already ruled that non - pecuniary damage had been sustained because of delay in the same action , is in any case incorrect , because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non - compliance with reasonable time - limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non - pecuniary damage , given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small ; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it .", "DATE In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to ORG , which , in a different composition , will order payment to the applicant of the non - pecuniary damages payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable - time requirement for the period following DATE alone , taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by ORG , from which it may diverge , but only to a reasonable extent ( ORG , DATE , PERSON GPE ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG held as follows :", "\u201c ... Where the victim of unreasonably lengthy proceedings dies prior to the entry into force of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE [ known as the \u201c Pinto Act \u201d ] this shall preclude a right [ to just satisfaction ] from arising and passing to the heirs , in accordance with the general rule that a person who has died can not become entitled to a right conferred by an Act that is passed after their death ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG judges noted that the right to compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time derived from LAW . The mechanism set in place by the NORP standard did not give applicants a cause of action before the domestic courts . Accordingly , the right to \u201c just satisfaction \u201d could neither be acquired nor transferred by a person who had already died by the time the Pinto Act came into force . The fact that the deceased had , while alive , lodged an application with ORG was not decisive . LAW did not constitute , as the applicants had maintained , a procedural standard bringing about a transfer of powers from ORG to the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . In this case , which concerned the possibility or otherwise of transferring to heirs the right to compensation deriving from a breach of LAW on account of the length of the proceedings , ORG referred the case to the full court indicating that there was a conflict between the case - law authorities , that is , between the restrictive approach taken by ORG in the earlier judgments regarding heirs and LAW and the CARDINAL judgments delivered by ORG , sitting as a full court , on DATE to the extent that a less strict interpretation would lead to the conclusion that this right to compensation has existed since GPE ratified LAW on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In that respect the LAW provisions are confirmatory and illustrative . ...", "( ii ) It is necessary to reiterate the principle that the act giving rise to the right to reparation conferred by domestic law corresponds to a breach of the provision in LAW , which is immediately applicable in domestic law .", "The distinction between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time , introduced by LAW ( or even pre - existing as a constitutionally protected value ) , and the right to equitable reparation , which was allegedly introduced only by LAW , can not be allowed in so far as the protection provided by the domestic courts does not depart from that previously offered by ORG , the domestic courts being bound to comply with the case - law of ORG . ...", "( iii ) Accordingly , the right to equitable reparation for loss sustained as a result of the unreasonable length of proceedings prior to the entry into force of Law no .
