The President granted the applicants\u2019 requests for their identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . They are represented before the ORG by Mr H. Graupner , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG conducted police investigations in respect of the first applicant on suspicion of his having committed homosexual acts with consenting male persons within the age bracket of DATE , an offence under the former Article CARDINAL ( Gleichgeschlechtliche Unzucht mit CARDINAL unter CARDINAL Jahren ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG charged the first applicant with these offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted him of the charge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a request with ORG for the deletion of both the electronically processed data and of the data manually processed in paper files concerning the proceedings in his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the first applicant that it had deleted the electronically processed data but rejected the request concerning the data processed in paper files . Thereupon the first applicant filed a complaint concerning this decision with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly allowed the first applicant \u2019s complaint , ordering ORG to modify the filing cards ( PERSON ) and filing registers ( PERSON ) by noting the acquittal while maintaining the reference to LAW . It dismissed the first applicant \u2019s complaint as regards the data processed in ordinary paper files DATE known as \u201c copy files \u201d ( Kopieakte ) DATE which contained copies of all the reports and communications generated by the authority and sent to other authorities , such as the public prosecutor , because data processed in paper files did not fall under the definition of filing systems ( Dateien ) within the meaning of LAW . The right of deletion set forth in that LAW was therefore not applicable .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , information held in such information research tools could not be completely deleted or scrambled . In accordance with the relevant provisions of LAW , all administrative actions by administrative authorities \u2013 including police authorities \u2013 had to be documented and archived . Only by doing so was it possible to review the lawfulness of the actions of the authorities , which was necessary in a ORG governed by the rule of law . This was required by the rules regulating the authority \u2019s internal mode of operation ( GPE ) . However , such data had to be complete and correct , which meant that subsequent developments \u2013 in particular if the person concerned by the investigations had been acquitted DATE also had to be recorded . The question of whether or not the authority could use such data in its work was distinct from the issue of the archiving and recording of data and required that separate rules on the use of such data be applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a complaint with ORG and with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court quashed ORG decision . In ORG view ORG had misinterpreted the applicable law when it had held that only the provisions on the archiving and storage of data for the authority \u2019s internal use were applicable because the filing cards at issue did not only contain information of a general character but details about an individual person , such as that person \u2019s name and address . Therefore , they recorded not only internal matters of the authority but also sensitive personal data . The authority should therefore have applied the rules for the use and processing of individual data under LAW ( Sicherheitspolizeigesetz ) and should have weighed up the private and public interests accordingly . Since ORG had failed to do so , ORG quashed its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings because ORG had already quashed the decision .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the police authorities , taking into account the legal opinion in ORG decision , blanked out entries in the filing register by superimposing black bars over the first applicant \u2019s name , date of birth , address and the respective file number and reference to LAW on the filing cards . This having been done , the applicant maintained his complaint of DATE in respect of the data processed in the copy files only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again decided on the first applicant \u2019s appeal and rejected his request to delete the data concerning him that had been manually processed in ordinary paper files , the \u201c copy files \u201d . Referring to ORG case - law , it found that the right to deletion of data under LAW and LAW was not applicable to data manually processed in paper files because such files were unstructured compilations of information and did not qualify as filing systems ( ORG ) under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant again lodged complaints with ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the complaint on DATE . It rejected the first applicant \u2019s argument that LAW and the case - law of ORG established a right to deletion of personal data in an ordinary paper file . The cases relied on by the first applicant , namely PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALII ) and PERSON ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALV ) , had to be distinguished from the present case as they concerned completely different sets of facts . In ORG view , LAW did not impose a wider right to deletion of data than already contained in LAW which transformed into domestic law ORG Directive CARDINAL of DATE on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ( ORG , CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Also ORG with regard to ORG of DATE only concerned automatically processed data and did not extend to personal data in a conventional copy file or paper file .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , it was apparent and not disputed by the first applicant that , following the blackening out of his name , date of birth and address in the file register and of the reference to the paper files in the index card , the paper files at issue were no longer traceable via these information tools . This reduced the accessibility of his personal data to such an extent that there was no longer any interference with his rights under LAW . That being so , ORG concluded that there had been no breach of the first applicant \u2019s rights under LAW either .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s complaint for the same reasons as those relied on by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG conducted investigations in respect of the second applicant on suspicion of his having committed homosexual acts with consenting male persons within the age bracket of DATE , an offence under former LAW , and on suspicion of having committed sexual acts with persons under DATE , an offence under LAW ( PERSON ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG charged the applicant with those offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted him of these charges .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG conducted investigations in respect of the second applicant on suspicion of his having committed offences under LAW and QUANTITY of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG charged the second applicant with those offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted him of having committed homosexual acts with consenting male persons within the age bracket of CARDINAL under former LAW and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . He was acquitted of the other charges .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG conducted investigations in respect of the second applicant on suspicion of his having produced pornographic pictures of persons under the age of DATE , an offence under LAW ( Pornographische Darstellungen Minderj\u00e4hriger ) , and of having committed an offence under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG charged the second applicant with an offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted him as charged and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant lodged a request with ORG for the deletion of the electronically processed data and the data manually processed in files , and held by the police authorities , concerning these CARDINAL sets of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed him that no electronically processed data relating to the above proceedings existed any longer and rejected the request concerning the data processed in paper files .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the second applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint . It found that , as regards the non - electronically processed data stored in ordinary paper files , LAW and the right to request a deletion was not applicable as such paper files constituted an unstructured compilation of information but not a filing system ( ORG ) within the meaning of LAW . As regards the filing cards and filing registers the Commission noted that on DATE the police authorities , after having been invited to comment on the applicant \u2019s complaint , had informed the ORG that all references in these research tools to the issues under LAW had been rendered illegible ( unkenntlich gemacht ) . In the filing registers , the name and address of the applicant had also been deleted . Under the storage and deletion rules for ORG ( ORG ) copy files were deleted DATE following DATE of recording , while index cards and filing registers were destroyed after DATE . In such circumstances the ordinary paper files ( \u201c copy files \u201d ) relating to investigations in respect of the applicant essentially served the purpose of documenting the activities of the authority and no longer allowed the tracking of sensitive information on the applicant in relation to Article CARDINAL of LAW . The applicant \u2019s complaint was therefore ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for legal aid in order to lodge a complaint with ORG . In addition , he proposed that the case be referred to ORG of ORG for a preliminary ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , referring to its case - law in similar cases , dismissed the request for legal aid for lack of prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , referring to its previous case - law ( in particular its decision of DATE in the first applicant \u2019s case DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , declined to deal with the case because it lacked any prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , in force until DATE , concerned consensual homosexual acts and read :", "\u201c A male person who after attaining DATE fornicates with a person of the same sex who has attained DATE but not DATE shall be sentenced to a period of imprisonment of DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , responding to a request for review made by ORG , ORG found that LAW of LAW was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following ORG judgment , ORG repealed LAW . It also introduced LAW , which penalises sexual relations with persons DATE under specific conditions and which is formulated in a gender - neutral way .
