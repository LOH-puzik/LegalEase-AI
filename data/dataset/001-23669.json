THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP citizens , born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . They live near GPE aerodrome , GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE . The Government were represented by their agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "GPE aerodrome is a privately owned and operated aerodrome , most of which lies within FAC . CARDINAL full - time and CARDINAL part - time employees , of various companies , work there . Current activity at GPE comprises flights by fixed wing aircraft and helicopters , maintenance and testing , pilot training and aerobatics . The most common aircraft are the Piper CARDINAL and Cessna CARDINAL , which are QUANTITY light propeller aircraft with fixed undercarriages . The most common helicopters are ORG .", "An Air Traffic Zone ( ORG ) is set aside exclusively for the safe operation of aircraft using the aerodrome . It extends for a radius of QUANTITY around the aerodrome , and it is only within the ORG that the aerodrome operator has supervision of the airspace and the aircraft within it . Pilots must advise the aerodrome of their entry into the ORG . Because of its proximity to ORG and FAC airports , the circuit height at GPE is limited to QUANTITY .", "The aerodrome currently has CARDINAL runways , a QUANTITY asphalt runway which runs north - east / south - west , and a QUANTITY grass runway which runs north - west / south - east .", "Helicopters have used the aerodrome since DATE . Most ( PERCENT ) of the large helicopter activities are commercial , and include training , maintenance and testing .", "Aircraft flights are divided roughly equally between commercial and leisure purposes ; many flights in each category involve pilot training , with basic training most often carried out in fine weather .", "Aerobatic flying takes place on average once a fortnight during DATE .", "On DATE , the applicants\u2019 lawyer wrote to the Secretary of ORG on behalf of ORG ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , an association with CARDINAL members . The lawyer formally requested that the Minister should exercise the powers given to him under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) to specify ORG for the purposes of that section , and then have ORG re - licence the airfield taking into consideration the need to minimise so far as reasonably practicable any adverse effects on the environment and disturbance to the public .", "On DATE , PERSON of ORG of ORG and the Regions ( \u201c DETR \u201d ) replied to the lawyer that he was not satisfied that specification or designation of GPE under either LAW ( for the purposes of LAW ) of LAW would be appropriate . He indicated that in reaching this view he had taken into account the aerodrome \u2019s procedures for noise mitigation including their implementation , and he indicated that the aerodrome had also been visited by officers from ORG of the DETR .", "Mr PERSON further stated that he was not persuaded that there was significant or serious weakness in the environmental policies of the aerodrome or in their implementation . He concluded that the disturbance from aircraft at the aerodrome was not such as to justify specification under LAW . Mr Grindrod indicated that designation of GPE aerodrome under LAW of LAW for the purposes of LAW would not accord with ORG general policy that noise issues should so far as possible be resolved at local level . He stated that , given that he had seen no evidence to persuade him that GPE aerodrome was not being managed in an environmentally responsible manner , he did not consider that there was evidence of particular circumstances at GPE such as would justify the Secretary of ORG intervening to stipulate noise mitigation measures there as an exception to this general policy .", "PERSON and PERSON : PERSON and PERSON moved to the current address in GPE , GPE , in DATE . Mr LOC died on DATE .", "The Ashworths\u2019 house is QUANTITY from the airfield perimeter fence , and the end of their garden is QUANTITY from the airfield . The part of the airfield which is closest to the Ashworths\u2019 property was , until DATE , the area where most of the airfield - based helicopter activity , and all of the helicopter testing , including compass testing , took place . ORG testing involves a helicopter hovering QUANTITY above the ground for TIME . It was not unusual for a single helicopter to be operating continuously within the area of the airfield closest to the Ashworths\u2019 property for TIME . Occasionally , CARDINAL helicopter is involved simultaneously .", "PERSON and PERSON found that the noise generated by the operation of the airfield at GPE was not merely intrusive , but after a short time became absolutely intolerable . The applicants have submitted a report which includes the result of tests carried out by ORG in which they recorded the noise levels in the garden of the Ashworths\u2019 house from DATE . The report indicates that TIME background noise levels without aviation activity are CARDINAL dB(A ) , which is a level typically found in a semi - rural location such as the area in which the property is located . It notes that it is generally accepted that noise excursions which give an PERSON reading of CARDINALdB(A ) or more above background may generate justifiable complaints , and states that this situation was frequently recorded at the Ashworths\u2019 house . Further , the report states that individual GPE max . levels generated by both fixed - wing and helicopter aircraft were unexpectedly high , with typical GPE max . values of CARDINAL to CARDINAL dB(A ) for aircraft and helicopters were recorded , with some excursions in excess of CARDINAL dB(A ) . Finally , the report indicates that the audio recording revealed that helicopter activities lasted for TIME at a time , compared with fixed - wing flights which usually passed overhead in TIME .", "The applicants contend that the level of noise in DATE is much greater than that recorded in DATE , which is DATE . Nevertheless , they contend that the results of the tests indicate that the level of noise experienced by the PERSON is such as to amount to a nuisance , and that it is only by virtue of the operation of the relevant legislation , and in particular LAW ) of LAW , that it is not actionable .", "It is estimated that the value of the Ashworths\u2019 property has been reduced by CARDINAL as a result of the existence of the airfield and activity at current levels .", "Mr PERSON : Mr PERSON lives in ORG , GPE . He has lived at his present address since DATE . He lives with his wife .", "Mr PERSON \u2019s property is QUANTITY from GPE . He estimates that on average , CARDINAL aircraft passes his property TIME . The maximum height of the aircraft is QUANTITY due to the proximity of GPE aerodrome . If the wind is blowing towards Mr PERSON \u2019s property , he finds the noise from take - off makes conversation in the garden , and therefore social use of the garden , impossible .", "Aircraft on circuit usually pass slightly to the airfield side of Mr ORG \u2019s property , causing a serious and repetitive intrusion into their home and family life .", "PERSON : PERSON has lived with her husband at her present address in GPE , GPE , since DATE .", "PERSON property is QUANTITY to the east of GPE . She complains that the noise from the aircraft engines is very intrusive and intimidating . PERSON and her husband noted the frequency of flights on DATE and DATE . Their notes indicate that they were often able to read the numbers on the aircraft with the naked eye . The notes show that during certain periods at DATE the frequency of flights close to the house reached CARDINAL every minute to CARDINAL - and - a - half minutes . PERSON states that during DATE , flights are less frequent . She complains that the aircraft fly low over her house and garden , and that they do not keep to the circuit prescribed by the aerodrome when taking off or landing , or practising approaches to landing .", "PERSON works from home , and she is therefore adversely affected by the noise from the airfield during DATE as well as at DATE .", "Mr Holyoake : PERSON Holyoake has lived with his wife and son at his present address in ORG , GPE , since DATE .", "PERSON Holyoake complains of \u201c incredible \u201d noise resulting from low flying aircraft completing circuits of CARDINAL minutes\u2019 duration on a regular basis . He states that often at DATE this results in an aircraft every CARDINAL or two minutes flying over his house and garden , which creates an impossible situation outside the house and can be heard inside the house . The maximum height of the aircraft flying from ORG and the circuit which they may take is limited by the proximity of GPE airfield . Aircraft flying from GPE often take a low flight path , which increases the noise at ground level . Mr Holyoake states that aircraft from ORG regularly fly well below QUANTITY ) and sometimes at CARDINAL this height . He complains that the position is exacerbated by the fact that aircraft use CARDINAL large oak trees in the grounds of his house , which is positioned on the top of a hill , as markers when they come in to land , and therefore continuously take this route when landing . Helicopters use the same circuit , and fly at lower heights . Mr Holyoake states that the resultant high noise and resonance levels have caused earaches and headaches , particularly after regular exposure when circuits are carried out .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( LAW ) provides for designation of aerodromes by the Secretary of ORG . Where an aerodrome has been designated under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , the management of the aerodrome is required to consult organisations representing the interests of local people ( amongst others ) \u201c with respect to any matter concerning the management or administration of the aerodrome which affects their interest ... \u201d . ORG , published in DATE , state that the aim of consultation is \u201c to provide an effective forum for the discussion of all matters concerning the development or operation of the aerodrome , which have an impact on ... people living and working in the surrounding area \u201d , and to \u201c provid[e ] an opportunity to reconcile any differences of view that may arise , and [ to resolve ] difficulties through agreed voluntary action \u201d .", "GPE aerodrome has been designated under LAW .", "Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW specific noise and/or use control measures .", "Where an aerodrome has been specified under LAW , ORG is under a duty \u201c to have regard to the need to minimise so far as reasonably practicable - ( a ) any adverse effects on the environment , and ( b ) any disturbance to the public , from noise , vibration , atmospheric pollution or any other cause attributable to the use of aircraft for the purpose of civil aviation \u201d .", "No aerodromes have been specified under LAW , although the Secretary of ORG has indicated to FAC that he is \u201c minded \u201d to specify it .", "Where the Secretary of ORG has designated aerodromes under Section CARDINAL of LAW , the operator of the aerodrome is required to comply with requirements set out in the notice relating to noise and vibration connected with the taking off or landing of aircraft .", "Only the major GPE airports ( FAC , GPE and GPE ) have been designated under LAW .", "Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act permits the Secretary of ORG to make grants towards the cost of sound - proofing buildings near an aerodrome which has been designated under that section .", "Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act excludes civil liability in trespass or nuisance in respect of flights of aircraft over property provided that the provisions of ORG have been complied with .", "The Rules of the Air Regulations CARDINAL made under LAW ( No . CARDINAL ) Order DATE apply to all pilots . They prohibit low flying ( generally , flying below a height of QUANTITY ( QUANTITY ) above the highest fixed object within QUANTITY of the aircraft or helicopter ( Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ) , or QUANTITY ) to any person , vessel , vehicle or structure : Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) ) . However , the prohibition in Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) does not apply to aircraft which are taking off or landing ( Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) ) ; nor does it apply to practising approaches to landing at aerodromes ( Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ) , as long as this is \u201c confined to the airspace customarily used by aircraft when landing or taking off in accordance with normal aviation practice at the aerodrome concerned \u201d ( Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) ) .", "The general planning legislation in ORG DATE ( as amended ) is applicable to airports . Where planning consent is necessary , the local authority ( in the first place ) must determine the application in the light of Planning Policy Guidance issued by central Government . PERSON relates to Planning and Noise . Certain operational developments are excluded by ORG Order DATE from the need for planning permission , although even in those cases the local authority must be consulted . For certain types of development , such as applications to construct airports with a basic runway length of QUANTITY or more , environmental impact assessments must be submitted ( Town and Country Planning ( Environmental Impact Assessment)(England and GPE ( SI CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "In a ORG published in DATE , the ORG asked for comments on a number of proposals connected with the control of aircraft noise , including proposals to give aerodromes power to establish noise control arrangements , and proposals to compel aerodromes to prepare noise amelioration schemes . The conclusions drawn from the consultation paper , together with procedures arising from a proposed ORG Directive Com DATE ( CARDINAL ) , will be included in , or published with , a ORG which is expected to be published at DATE .", "The current aerodrome rules at GPE date from DATE , and are set out in a document entitled \u201c ORG and Procedures \u201d , and in the \u201c GPE Rules \u201d .", "The circuit applied at GPE follows a rectangular path around the aerodrome measuring QUANTITY . The height of circuit flying is QUANTITY , which is lower than some aerodromes , but enables aircraft to fly a smaller circuit than if they had to fly higher . The circuit is designed to be as small as practically possible to avoid flying over sensitive residential areas . CARDINAL aircraft are permitted to fly circuits at any CARDINAL time .", "In connection with engine failure practice ( which involves throttling the engine back in the circuit and returning it to full power TIME ) , the rules draw attention to the fact that pilots can not be prosecuted for low flying whilst landing or taking off in according with normal aviation practice , but that they may commit an offence if they deliberately go QUANTITY to a person or structure .", "Runways are available for use TIME in DATE , and TIME and TIME in DATE . Twin - engined aircraft are not permitted to carry out circuit training after TIME at DATE .", "Helicopters are not allowed to carry out hover training or circuit training on DATE or after TIME on DATE , and are restricted to TIME hovering followed by a circuit .", "The Government state that alleged breaches of the rules are investigated by the aerodrome management , and the pilot is asked to explain his or her actions . The disciplinary regime includes written warnings , fines , requests for further training to be undertaken , and banning from using the aerodrome . CARDINAL pilot has been banned in DATE .", "The applicants complain under LAW that the noise caused by low flying aircraft including aerobatic activity , and helicopters , particularly training and maintenance , amounts to an interference with their right to respect for their private and family lives , and their homes , and that it can not be justified under LAW because ORG does not serve important national economic interests .", "The applicants identify a legitimate aim which might be put forward in the case of a small , privately owned and operated aerodrome such as GPE , that of allowing \u201c innocent passage \u201d for aircraft across people \u2019s property . They contend that a balance should be struck between this and the interference with the rights guaranteed under LAW . They complain that the fact that a bar on actions for nuisance is imposed by LAW , and in particular by LAW ) thereof , that the bar applies regardless of the time of DATE or night when the noise is made , and regardless of the level or type of noise made , and that there are no effective alternative mechanisms in place to prevent noise nuisance , means that no balance has been struck , in breach of LAW .", "The applicants further contend that the fact that the DATE LAW prevents them from bringing an action in nuisance , together with the fact that there is no other remedy available to them for breach of LAW , amounts to a violation of LAW .", "Finally , the applicants contend that the level of noise generated by ORG has serious potential effects on the value of their properties .
