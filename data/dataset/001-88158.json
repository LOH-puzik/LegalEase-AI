He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested on the charge of , inter alia , money laundering and attempted value added tax fraud .", "On DATE the decision on presenting charges against the applicant was served on him and he was heard as a suspect . An interrogation report was prepared . On DATE the grounds for the decision were given . The prosecutor listed documents and other evidence , which supported the charges brought against the applicant . They were served on the applicant and his defence counsel on CARDINAL and DATE respectively .", "On DATE the ORG held a hearing during which the applicant was questioned and a detention order was issued against him . In addition to such factors as the strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences he was charged with and the severity of the anticipated penalty , the court underlined that there were significant discrepancies in testimonies given by the applicant and CARDINAL other suspects . These differences were found in particular in those on the manner in which the company \u2019s transactions had been carried out . The court stressed that the detention of all co - accused was necessary to prevent them agreeing on CARDINAL version of the events , which could have impeded the investigation .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s defence counsel appealed . He challenged conclusions reached by the court and prosecutor and submitted several documents supporting the applicant \u2019s plea of innocence .", "On DATE dates the applicant was again summoned to testify , inter alia , on DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and DATE and DATE . He refused however to answer any of the prosecutor \u2019s questions .", "On DATE the ORG held a hearing concerning the applicant \u2019s detention during judicial proceedings , at which his defence counsel was present . The court upheld the detention order of DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s detention was subsequently extended by orders of , inter alia , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , each time after a hearing at which the applicant \u2019s defence counsel was present . In the ORG reasoned grounds the courts referred to the strong probability that the applicant had committed the offences and to a risk of a severe sentence being imposed on him , in particular in view of the serious financial damage caused by the offences concerned . The courts further stressed contradictions in the testimonies of co - suspects .", "The applicant \u2019s lawyer tried to challenge the applicant \u2019s detention by using different legal avenues . He lodged appeals against the detention orders on , inter alia , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . In addition , on DATE he lodged a request for release from detention . All his applications were unsuccessful . He also requested the application of another preventive measure in place of detention ( on DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , and DATE ) . His requests were all refused .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer allegedly requested the ORG to give him access to the case file . He further requested a copy of the report of the applicant \u2019s and CARDINAL other PERSON interrogations . The ORG submitted that such requests had never been lodged with the prosecutor \u2019s office . The applicant failed to submit any evidence thereof ; neither had he submitted observations in this respect .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s defence counsel ( by a letter dated DATE ) lodged requests for access to the case file and the copy of the record of interviews with the applicant . He further alleged that his request of DATE had never been examined and he had been denied contact with his client .", "On DATE the ORG denied that the request for access to the case file of DATE had ever been lodged and called the defence counsel to provide the relevant copy . Further , he failed to answer requests dated DATE , since the prosecutor examined only the defence counsel \u2019s complaints that his previous request had not been replied to and that his contacts with his client had been impeded . Counsel was served with replies to his requests on CARDINAL and DATE respectively ( see below ) .", "On DATE the ORG refused counsel \u2019s request of DATE for access to the case file , without referring to his other request for a copy of the interrogation report ( the prosecutor replied to the latter on DATE see below ) . He justified his decision by reference to the \u201c important interests of the investigation \u201d and referred to the need to carry out certain actions at the current stage of the proceedings , which made it impossible to grant the request .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged an appeal dated DATE against the decision of DATE , arguing , inter alia , that the legal provision under which the authorities in charge of investigation authorised access to the case file , namely LAW , should not be interpreted in a way which allows for refusal of access to the case file , in particular with temporal restrictions .", "On DATE the appeal was dismissed by ORG . He emphasised the need to secure the important interests of the investigation , in view of its \u201c character \u201d and \u201c the links between the suspects \u201d .", "On DATE the counsel was informed by ORG , in reply to his request of DATE , that his request for a copy of the record of interview could not be satisfied as the case file had been transferred to the appellate court , together with the appeal . He was also informed that a requested copy would be sent to him as soon as the case file was returned by the court .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s defence counsel repeated his request for access to the case file and the copy of the applicant \u2019s record of interview . He relied on LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Proceedings .", "On DATE the ORG informed the defence counsel that his requests could not be examined as the case file had been transferred to ORG .", "On DATE ORG having examined the counsel \u2019s request for access to the case file , dismissed it , relying on LAW . The decision was justified by reference to the \u201c important interests of the investigation \u201d . It was further stressed that since evidence proceedings were still pending it was not possible to grant the request .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s defence counsel appealed , arguing that he had been requesting access to the case file for a long time and it was indispensible for the defence rights of the applicant .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the ground that if the suspects were given access to the case file the proper conduct of the investigation could be influenced , especially since the collection of the evidence had not been completed .", "On DATE ORG supplemented the charges against the applicant : he was also charged with acting in an organised criminal group .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s defence counsel was acquainted with the case file .", "On DATE certified copies of the applicant \u2019s record of interview were sent to his defence counsel .", "On DATE the investigation was closed .", "On DATE ORG lodged a bill of indictment numbering CARDINAL pages with the LOC . The applicant was charged on CARDINAL counts , inter alia , money laundering , including participation in an organised criminal group . The bill listed CARDINAL witnesses to be summoned and CARDINAL pieces of documentary evidence collected in the investigation .", "On DATE a hearing was held by the ORG in respect of the prosecutor \u2019s request for a further extension of the applicant \u2019s detention . In response , the applicant \u2019s defence counsel requested a decision on bail . He proposed to make a deposit of MONEY ( ORG ) . The court decided that the applicant could be released if he put up bail of ORG MONEY by DATE .", "On DATE the ORG ordered the release of the applicant from detention and the application of another preventive measure in its place ( bail ) . The court considered , inter alia , that there was no longer a risk that the applicant would tamper with evidence .", "The proceedings are currently pending before ORG .", "Access to the file in the course of investigation is governed by Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , which provides , in so far as relevant , that leave to consult the file and to make copies of the documents in the file is granted only with the consent of the authority conducting the investigation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
