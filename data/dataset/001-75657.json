This LAW of the Decisions of the Commission for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees in Article LAW contains a mechanism that allows the court seized with the dispute about the validity of the exchange contract to decide whether , in the specific case before it , the general aim of expeditious repossession of pre - war homes should prevail over the rights asserted on the basis of the exchange contract or not ...", "CARDINAL . The law appears to envision that the competent court , once it has been requested to issue an order provisionally halting the enforcement of the administrative repossession proceedings , will make a decision on the basis of the case file before it . The court will examine the prima facie strength of the arguments made and evidence presented by the CARDINAL parties , the CARDINAL asserting the validity of the exchange contract and the CARDINAL claiming that it was concluded under duress . In this respect the court will require the side asserting the validity of the exchange to , as a minimum , \u201c show evidence of a written contract \u201d on the exchange . The court will then take into account whether the party seeking suspension of the eviction can make credible that the deprivation of the possession of the home until the dispute about the contract is solved will cause irreparable harm to it . The ORG is of the opinion that the mechanism envisaged by the law may be seen to strike a fair balance between the CARDINAL parties to the dispute .", "CARDINAL .

As a result , the balance crafted by the legislator is overthrown and the applicant de facto deprived of all procedural safeguards .

In the present case , although the applicant has requested that ORG in PERSON issue an order for provisional measures to prevent her eviction pending court proceedings on the validity of the exchange contract as provided for in LAW , due to the silence of the first instance court , the applicant is left without any other remedy to seek suspension of her eviction . ORG has the power under LAW to order suspension , but it has failed to reply to the applicant \u2019s request for an interim measure . As of DATE the ORG has not given any decision on the request for provisional measures . The respondent ORG has confirmed the applicant \u2019s allegation that her case is just an instance of a general practice not to decide requests for provisional measures in cases like hers .
