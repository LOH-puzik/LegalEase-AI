GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "Following his conviction he was erving his sentence . As from DATE , he was continuously contacted by CARDINAL Y. , an undercover agent acting with the authorisation of the GPE police , who passed himself off as a potential purchaser of a larger amount of cocaine .", "At the applicant 's request , the undercover agent contacted the applicant 's counsel with a view to applying for the reopening of the criminal proceedings . The undercover agent met the counsel several times accompanied by other persons , however at CARDINAL occasion DATE contrary to the instructions given by the GPE police \u2013 on his own initiative in the absence of other persons . The last visit took place on DATE .", "Thereafter the applicant informed the undercover agent that his former cell - mate T. could arrange for the delivery of a large quantity of cocaine for a price of MONEY ( DEM ) per kilogram . After consulting the applicant , T. met the undercover agent in his flat on DATE in order to hand over QUANTITY of cocaine . While carrying out the transaction , he was arrested by the police .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against this judgment . He complained in particular that ORG had not discontinued the proceedings having regard to the circumstances in which the undercover agent had contacted his lawyer .", "On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) rejected the applicant 's appeal on points of law . It expressed serious concern about the involvement of the undercover agent in the relationship between the defence counsel and the applicant , but found that in the present case there was nothing to show that during these meetings evidence had been obtained to the applicant 's detriment . Moreover , ORG had sufficiently taken into account the intervention of the undercover agent when fixing the sentence .", "By a decision of DATE , notified to the applicant 's counsel on DATE , ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting in a panel of CARDINAL judges , declined to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint . It found that it did not raise any fundamental constitutional issues . Furthermore it was not relevant for the protection of the applicant 's basic rights since it had no prospects of success . The constitutional complaint was inadmissible as the applicant failed to substantiate the alleged violation of his constitutional rights and , consequently , did not meet the formal requirements under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz ) . Moreover , ORG found that there was nothing to suggest that the applicant 's basic or similar rights had been breached . The undercover agent had met the applicant 's lawyer for the last time on DATE in connection with the request for a retrial . On CARDINAL DATE the drug deal had been carried out . There was no indication and it had not been alleged that after that date the undercover agent had performed further activities , in particular contacted the applicant 's lawyer . Therefore at no time the applicant 's right to an effective exercise of his defence rights had been infringed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
