De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant political party has its registered seat in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a referendum related to ORG migrant relocation plan was held in GPE . The referendum was initiated by the Government and posed the following question : \u201c Do you want ORG to be entitled to order the mandatory settlement of non - NORP citizens in GPE without ORG \u2019s consent ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the course of the campaign several opposition parties called on voters to boycott the referendum or to cast invalid ballots that would not count in the final tally but could still be interpreted as rejecting the idea of the referendum . On DATE the applicant political party made available a mobile telephone application to voters ( \u201c the cast - an - invalid - vote app \u201d ) where they could upload , and share with the public , photographs taken of their ballots . It also enabled voters to comment on the reasons for how they cast their ballot . The posting and sharing of photographs were anonymous . The application was reported in major online journals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a private individual lodged a complaint with ORG ( ORG ) about the application .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that the application infringed the principles of fairness of elections , voting secrecy , and the proper exercise of rights ( rendeltet\u00e9sszer\u0171 joggyakorl\u00e1s ) , and ordered the applicant organisation to refrain from further breaches of section CARDINAL ) and ( e ) of Act no . ORG of DATE on Electoral Procedure and Article CARDINAL ) of LAW . Relying on a previous resolution issued in DATE , it held that voters could not treat ballot papers as their own [ property ] , and therefore could neither take them out of the voting booths nor take a photograph of them . It held that taking photographs of ballot papers could lead to electoral fraud . Furthermore , although the principle of secrecy did not create any obligation on the voters\u2019 side , it nevertheless did not entitle them to abuse their situation , bearing in mind that voting secrecy could only be maintained with their cooperation . ORG concluded that the phone application was capable of discrediting the work of election bodies and tallying systems in the eyes of the public .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought judicial review of this decision before the GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the GPE upheld the ORG \u2019s decision as to its finding regarding the infringement of the principle of the proper exercise of rights . The GPE held that the purpose of the ballots had been to enable voters to express their opinion on the referendum question , and that taking photographs of ballots and subsequently publishing them had not been in line with this purpose . A ban on photographs and on publication had not infringed voters\u2019 freedom of expression , since they had been free to express their opinions by casting their ballots and to share with others how they had voted . The PERSON overturned the remainder of the Commission \u2019s decision on the infringement of the secrecy of the electoral process and on the discrediting of the work of the electoral bodies . It found that there was no regulation prohibiting voters from taking photographs of their ballot papers in the voters\u2019 booths and that their identity could not have been revealed through the mobile telephone application .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the same private individual lodged a new complaint with ORG , in the light of the fact that the applicant political party had activated the \u201c cast - an - invalid - vote app \u201d on DATE , DATE of the referendum . The complainant maintained that by operating the mobile telephone application and by encouraging voters to make use of it , the applicant political party had infringed the principles governing the bona fide and proper exercise of rights , and also the principles of fairness and secrecy of elections .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG reiterated its previous finding that taking photographs of ballot papers had infringed the principle of the secrecy of voters\u2019 ballots , the fairness of elections , and the proper exercise of rights , and fined the political party MONEY ( ORG \u2013 CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) . ORG supplemented its previous reasoning by noting that the mobile telephone application calling on voters to cast an invalid ballot could have influenced voters and had thus constituted unlawful campaigning .", "CARDINAL . The applicant political party sought judicial review of this decision as well .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the GPE upheld the ORG \u2019s decision as to the finding of an infringement of the principle of the proper exercise of rights . It explained that the purpose of the ballot papers had been for voters to express their opinion on the referendum question , and any other use of them had constituted a violation of the principle of the proper exercise of rights . The GPE overturned the remainder of the Commission \u2019s decision as to a violation of the fairness and voting secrecy and the principle of the bona fide exercise of rights . It reiterated its previous finding that the identity of the individual voters had not been revealed , and emphasised that the conduct of the applicant political party had had no impact on the fairness of the referendum . It reduced the fine to ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant organisation lodged a constitutional complaint against the decisions of both CARDINAL and DATE . In both complaints the applicant requested ORG to \u201c establish that the GPE \u2019s decision infringed its right recognised in LAW . It argued that \u201c under LAW on ORG an organisation personally concerned by an unconstitutional judicial decision , after having exhausted all other remedies , may lodge a complaint with ORG if the decision on the merits infringed its right ensured by LAW . The decision of the GPE declared the applicant \u2019s conduct unlawful and obliged it to pay a fine , it was the applicant who lodged the petition for review with the GPE , thus it was individually concerned in the present case ... By making the mobile phone application available the applicant reacted to the spreading of social media communication . ORG regularly share events , thoughts and opinions on internet websites through photos taken with their mobile phones . In the context of elections , this led to the fact that all over the world , voters take photos of their ballot papers and share it through social media . By developing the mobile phone application the applicant wanted to enable voters to share photos of ballot papers ( or in case of those who absented from the referendum photos of the activities undertaken instead of voting ) and other messages in an anonymous way and exercise their right to freedom of expression in a way that the content of the vote could not be linked to the voter . ... In the applicant \u2019s view the impugned decision , its legal interpretation and the consequences applied by the PERSON infringe its right under LAW . The conduct of voters taking photos of ballot papers and sharing it with others is an expression of an opinion in public matters and constitutes a conduct falling under the freedom of expression of opinions , and in particular , the most protected aspect of it , a discussion on matters of public interest . Thus , the applicant \u2019s activity , providing a forum for voters to express an opinion is also protected by LAW In the applicant \u2019s opinion , the decision of the the GPE , by invoking voters\u2019 right to freedom of expression , restrained in fact , the applicant \u2019s own conduct of exercising its right to freedom of expression without any constitutional reason . \u201d The applicant further submitted that , as established by the GPE , the mobile phone application had not infringed the secrecy and fairness of the voting procedure and it had also not been capable of doing so , since the content of the ballot papers could not be linked to the voters . Thus , it argued that these aims could not serve as a legitimate basis for restricting the right to freedom of expression . In any event , even if the application could have infringed the secrecy of voting , the ban on the application had been disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . ORG declared the complaints inadmissible on DATE , with identical reasoning , on the grounds that the cases did not concern the applicant organisation \u2019s right to freedom of expression . It reiterated the GPE \u2019s finding that although the case related to the freedom of expression of voters , this had not been infringed by the decision of ORG , which had only found that the method used \u2013 that is to say uploading photographs to a mobile application \u2013 had not been in compliance with the obligation to exercise voting rights in accordance with their purpose . In ORG view the applicant political party had merely provided a forum for voters to share photographs of their ballot papers or their intention to abstain from voting , it had did not itself expressed an opinion . Since the applicant political party had only complained about the restriction of voters\u2019 right to freedom of expression , it had not been personally concerned by the decision of the GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
