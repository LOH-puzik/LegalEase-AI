Paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL of LAW states that the mere allegation that a person subject to military law has committed an offence does not , of itself , necessarily warrant placing that person under arrest of any description . If the offence is trivial , the offender is to be informed of the charge and required to report to the unit orderly room at a specific date and time . If arrest is necessary , the category of arrest is to be determined in the interests of the service and by the nature of the alleged offence . Generally , a person is to be placed under close arrest only when confinement is necessary to ensure his safe custody or to maintain discipline .", "CARDINAL . The circumstances which would warrant placing an accused under close arrest include those where the accused is deliberately trying to undermine discipline , is likely to injure himself or others or is likely to suborn witnesses ; where he has not surrendered but has been apprehended as an illegal absentee or has habitually absented himself ; and where , having regard to the nature or prevalence of the alleged offence which is under investigation , it is undesirable in the interests of discipline that he should be at large or allowed to consort with his comrades ( also paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL provides that ( subject to , inter alia , the general principle that the accused is not to be unnecessarily held under arrest ) commanding officers are responsible for ensuring that in each case the need to keep an accused under arrest , together with the form of that arrest , is kept under constant review . As necessary , the form of arrest may be changed or the accused released .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL ) provides that the person into whose custody the accused is committed is to inform the accused of the rank , name and unit of the person by whom he is alleged to have committed the offence and the nature of the allegation . Paragraph CARDINAL provides that a charge preferred against an officer or soldier is to be dealt with at the earliest opportunity . Accordingly , it is provided , inter alia , that on the receipt of every delay report the convening officer is to satisfy himself ( if the accused is in detention ) as to the necessity of the ongoing detention ( subsections ( a ) and ( b ) ) . On receipt of the fourth delay report , or , in any event , after CARDINAL days\u2019 detention , the convening officer is to make a special report to his / her superior officer outlining the reasons for the delay , when it is expected the accused will be brought to trial and the reasons for the continued detention ( subsection ( c ) ) . If an accused is not brought to trial by DATE , the latter superior officer must , in turn , make a special report to the Commander in Chief by DATE ( subsection ( d ) ) . On receipt of such special reports , the superior officer and Commander in Chief mentioned are to take all practical steps to expedite the trial of the accused ( subsection ( e ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Where an accused has been in detention for DATE without a court martial being convened , a direction in accordance with Rule CARDINAL of the DATE Rules not to release the accused can only be given with the prior approval of the Commander in Chief .

The scope of this review will depend on the context of the particular case and , where appropriate , the terms of the relevant statute under which the power of detention is exercised .

Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] Appeal Cases at p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Legal aid is not available from the military authorities for applications to the civilian courts , including applications for writs of habeas corpus .

Such an application for legal aid will only be approved after all the questions of fact or law arising in the action , cause or matter to which the application relates , and all the circumstances in which the application was made , have been considered ( ORG ( General ) Regulations DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . An application for an emergency legal aid certificate can be made pursuant to ORG DATE . The information furnished must be such as to allow the area director to decide the nature of the relevant proceedings , the circumstances in which it is required , whether the application is likely to fulfil the conditions under which legal aid may be granted and whether it is in the interests of justice that the applicant should as a matter of urgency be granted legal aid .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the DATE Act relating to general courts martial are set out in the above - mentioned GPE judgment ( at pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . These provisions ( summarised at paragraph CARDINAL below ) apply equally to a district court martial with certain relevant differences . A district court martial comprises a president and a minimum of CARDINAL other officers and the minimum rank of those members is lower than for a general court martial .", "CARDINAL . Central to the court - martial system under LAW was the role of the \u201c convening officer \u201d . This officer ( who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving ) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court martial . That officer had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court martial required , and was responsible for convening the court martial .", "The convening officer would draw up a convening order , which would specify , inter alia , the date , place and time of the trial , the name of the president and the details of the other members , all of whom he could appoint . Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General \u2019s Office , the convening officer could appoint CARDINAL . He also appointed , or directed a commanding officer to appoint , the prosecuting officer .", "Prior to the hearing , the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate , and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible . He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution . When charges were withdrawn , the convening officer \u2019s consent was normally obtained , although it was not necessary in all cases , and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it . He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence , legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses , and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \u201c reasonably requested \u201d by the defence .", "The convening officer could dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial , when required in the interests of the administration of justice . In addition , he could comment on the proceedings of a court martial . Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court , although in an exceptional case , where a more public instruction was required in the interests of discipline , they could be made known in the orders of the command .", "The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also . The findings of a court martial were not effective until confirmed by the confirming officer , who was empowered to withhold confirmation or substitute , postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "5-5", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
