The applicants , Mr Romulus PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr R\u0103zvan - Hora\u0163iu Radu , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicants lived in an apartment rented from the ORG in a nationalised building . On DATE , under PERSON no . LANGUAGE on the legal status of certain residential property , the applicants bought their apartment from the ORG , represented by the mayor of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , the former owner 's heir , took action against the ORG and the applicants for recovery of possession of the flat , seeking also to have the DATE sale declared null and void .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the NORP ORG found in favour of ORG and ordered the applicants to surrender possession of the apartment . It considered that the ORG 's initial title deed had been null and void and therefore gave preference to ORG 's title , which had come from the apartment 's real owner .", "The court refused however to declare the sale contract null and void , as no cause of nullity was identified and the applicants had acted in good faith .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the presence of a bailiff , ORG took possession of the apartment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants asked for the mayor of GPE to be joined to the proceedings for restitution of property lodged against them ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Under the Civil Code guarantee concerning responsibility for eviction , the applicants sought to recover the apartment 's market value from the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG considered that the applicants ' request had been made out of time and decided to separate it from the main file .", "CARDINAL . Several hearings took place before ORG . On DATE , at ORG 's request , the case was suspended pending the outcome of the action for recovery of possession .", "CARDINAL . A new hearing was scheduled for DATE , but none of the parties attended . On that date ORG noted the parties ' unjustified absence and suspended the proceedings once again .", "CARDINAL . ORG summonsed the parties to a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested that the case be postponed until after DATE , as they were going to be absent from the country from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted the parties ' absence and set a new hearing date for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG noted that the case had been suspended since DATE and that the parties had not manifested any interest in it since then . It therefore concluded that the action had become extinct ( perimat\u0103 ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not appeal against that judgment , which became final .", "CARDINAL . Under NORP law , an action for recovery of possession is one of the principal remedies for the protection of a right of property . Such action is not governed by statute per se but has emerged from case - law . An action for recovery of possession can be defined as the bringing of proceedings to enforce a right in rem in which a dispossessed owner claims back his or her property from the person currently in possession of it . When both the plaintiff and the defendant have a title deed , the court must compare the CARDINAL deeds and decide which one is preferred . The main outcome of such an action , if successful , is the acknowledgment by the court of the claimant 's title to the property , with retrospective effect , thus obliging the defendant to return the property . If physical restitution is no longer possible , that obligation is replaced by an obligation to pay compensation on the basis of an equivalent sum ( see PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . MONEY , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ) .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL of the Civil Code institute the seller 's responsibility for eviction . They provide for the evicted buyer to claim reimbursement of the price and also the payment of costs and damages , regardless of the seller 's good or bad faith . The buyer can either join the seller to the proceedings instituted against him by the third party or lodge a new action against the seller after having been evicted . In the latter case , if the seller proves that he could have won the case against the third party had he been joined to the proceedings , he will be exempted from compensating the buyer ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "A bona fide buyer continues to enjoy the benefits of the property until he is no longer considered bona fide , that is at the latest when the action for eviction is lodged against him , at which time enjoyment of the property reverts to the rightful owner . However , the buyer may still claim compensation for his loss from the seller .", "CARDINAL . The constant practice of the domestic courts DATE , as available to the ORG , indicates that the Civil Code guarantee in the event of eviction is applied in cases similar to the one at hand , and the interested parties are awarded the indexed purchase price and , in most cases , damages and any costs reasonably incurred for the upkeep of the house . Most of the domestic courts consider that PERSON no . CARDINAL on the rules governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the ORG DATE and DATE ( \u201c Law no . CARDINAL \u201d ) is not applicable to actions for recovery of possession when the sale contract is not declared null and void in such proceedings .", "CARDINAL . If the sale contract is cancelled , however , the courts consistently apply PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and only award the buyer the indexed purchase price .", "CARDINAL . NORP In decision no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG found in favour of the buyer in an action for recovery of possession lodged by the former owner of a nationalised apartment against the person who in good faith had bought the apartment from the ORG in DATE . The court decided that the restitution of the apartment to the former owner was no longer possible and , based on the ORG 's case - law on LAW CARDINAL ( in particular : PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON CARDINALVIII , ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE , and ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXII ( extracts ) ) , it compelled the ORG to pay the market value of the apartment in compensation to the former owner . In the court'tary award was the only solution to the action for recovery of possession .", "CARDINAL . In a similar decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG found in favour of the buyer in an action for recovery of possession lodged by the former owner . ORG took account of the fact that the buyer 's title had been confirmed by the courts in an action in nullity of the sale contract lodged against him by the former owner whereas the former owner 's title had not been upheld by a court . It further considered that dispossessing the buyer regardless of the circumstances , in order to restore the property to the former owner , would create disproportionate new wrongs in the attempt to attenuate old injuries . It also considered , in a general statement , that reimbursement of the indexed purchase price under PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL could not compensate the buyer as it did not reflect the property 's market value .", "CARDINAL . In decision no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG declared LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL unconstitutional in so far as it breached the buyer 's property title . Under the provision concerned , persons whose actions based on LAW had been dismissed before the entry into force of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL could use this PERSON in order once again to seek the restitution of their property . ORG considered that persons whose title to property had been confirmed by a court decision could not be compelled to surrender that property where there was no serious justification for such a measure , based on public order , under LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
