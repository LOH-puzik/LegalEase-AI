The applicant , who was born in DATE , is serving a DATE prison sentence imposed on DATE by the Meurthe - et - ORG for murder , attempted murder and assault involving the use or threatened use of a weapon . He has been imprisoned since DATE and will become eligible for release on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while he was in prison in PERSON , the applicant fell QUANTITY during an attempted escape and suffered a fractured spine . He spent DATE at the PERSON rehabilitation clinic before being transferred to FAC , where he encountered substantial difficulties ( particularly on account of the staircases , which made it impossible for him to move about unaided ) , and FAC , where his cell was not equipped for wheelchair use . He was subsequently transferred back to PERSON from DATE until DATE . From that date until DATE he was held in FAC , before being transferred to FAC , where he is currently detained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the Tulle judge responsible for the execution of sentences to have his sentence suspended on medical grounds , under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He explained that as a wheelchair user with paraplegia , he was not being detained in appropriate conditions since the premises were not designed for wheelchair use , and he was unable to receive the care he required . He noted that access to the toilet in his cell was undignified , that he could not reach all parts of the prison premises unaided , and that the provision of medical and paramedical care was inadequate , particularly as regards physiotherapy . He pointed out that he was unable to go to the showers autonomously and that the prison had assigned a prisoner to assist him for a payment of CARDINAL per month . This prison orderly was responsible for cleaning the applicant \u2019s cell and accompanying him to the showers and washroom .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE the judge appointed CARDINAL doctors as experts . They submitted their reports on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report by PERSON , drawn up on DATE , concluded :", "\u201c ... Mr PERSON has incomplete paraplegia with total effective urinary incontinence requiring self - catheterisation and round - the - clock use of a nappy . He also has major haemorrhoidal irregularities , for which he has refused any treatment .", "Mr PERSON currently has active muscle relaxation in the CARDINAL lower limbs , for which physiotherapy is required several times a week on a regular , long - term basis .", "That being so , Mr PERSON \u2019s state of health is not incompatible with imprisonment , subject to the express condition of being detained in a facility catering for his disability , where he can undergo regular physiotherapy and have appropriate access to a gym . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report by PERSON was drawn up on DATE and read as follows :", "\u201c ... On DATE ... PERSON stated : ... \u2018 his condition requires treatment by a physiotherapist in a specialist environment and DATE pressure - sore ORG . ...", "The most recent assessment at ORG , where the patient stayed from DATE , confirms that there has been a good sensorimotor recovery in the lower limbs and that mobility is possible with CARDINAL walking sticks and a frame , whereas at present the patient mainly moves about in a wheelchair .", "Appropriate physiotherapy focusing on both the joints and the muscles would clearly enable the prisoner to perform his own transfers with technical support , which would also have the benefit of easing the complications at the pressure points . At the same time , alongside the favourable progress in this post - traumatic condition , the patient has an anal disorder as a result of haemorrhoid surgery , and this essentially causes discomfort on a functional level .", "Conclusion", "...", "- The prisoner displays sensorimotor damage resulting from a thoracolumbar spine fracture ;", "- The damage is stable with clear evidence of motor recovery in the lower limbs ;", "- Daily physiotherapy would be justified to improve motor skills in the lower limbs and the quality of transfers , but this is not possible at ORG as there is no on - site physiotherapist ;", "- There is permanent sensory damage in the ORG region requiring self - catheterisation , which is being adequately managed on a day - to - DATE basis by the prisoner ;", "- All of these spinal conditions are currently stable and unlikely to worsen , but could improve with proper treatment ;", "- The various disorders observed , in terms of both traumatic spinal cord injuries and anal damage , are not life - endangering for the prisoner ;", "- The prisoner \u2019s state of health is in my opinion not incompatible in the long term with continued detention ;", "- The disorders currently observed are stable and will continue to develop on a chronic basis , justifying palliative care . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the application for suspension of the applicant \u2019s sentence . It took into account the CARDINAL concurring medical opinions in finding that the applicant \u2019s state of health was compatible in the long term with his imprisonment . However , the court observed that \u201c ORG manifestly fails to satisfy the criteria for ensuring a suitable detention regime for the applicant , in terms of both the LOC and the availability of paramedical care , despite the undisputed efforts by the prison \u2019s management and staff to ease the prisoner \u2019s living conditions as far as possible \u201d . It then noted that there were custodial facilities that were equipped to cater for the applicant \u2019s condition , such as ORG or PERSON , \u201c which is designed and organised in a manner compatible with accommodating disabled prisoners , and where [ he ] will be able to have the regular physiotherapy sessions that he rightly demands , since a masseur / physiotherapist comes to the prison DATE \u201d . The court concluded as follows :", "\u201c It therefore appears from all of the above considerations , both from a medical perspective and in terms of the prospect of arranging suitable conditions of detention , that the prisoner does not satisfy the requirements for having his sentence suspended on medical grounds . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . He reiterated that besides the structural inadequacy of ORG , he had not been offered any special arrangements in terms of medical and paramedical care ( physiotherapy and access to the gym ) . He also submitted that PERSON was no more suitable than FAC as it did not have a rehabilitation facility .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG upheld the judgment of DATE , holding :", "\u201c The CARDINAL experts concurred in concluding that [ the applicant \u2019s ] condition was not incompatible in the long term with detention provided that he was given physiotherapy and access to a gym . While it is indeed not possible for these requirements to be fulfilled at ORG , where [ the applicant ] has been transferred at his own request to be closer to his family , it has not been shown that he can not be accommodated in conditions catering for his disorders at FAC , and therefore the criteria for suspending the execution of his sentence have not been satisfied , particularly since [ the applicant ] continues to deny \u2013 as stated in his letter of CARDINAL DATE the serious criminal acts that led to his conviction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , the applicant contended that he was not undergoing any physical rehabilitation , there being no physiotherapist at ORG , and that he had no access to the gym . He wrote that his health was deteriorating on a DATE basis and that he was being mistreated through the lack of provision of care .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the applicant has received the following medical assistance :", "( a ) twelve occasions of escorted leave between CARDINAL DATE and DATE for specialist consultations and medical imaging tests at ORG and ORG ;", "( b ) CARDINAL medical appointments with a doctor from the prison medical unit , consisting of a medical examination on CARDINAL DATE followed by consultations spread across his time at the prison ( CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE ) ;", "( c ) three stays in hospital for DATE in DATE , DATE and DATE ;", "( d ) technical assistance from nurses on CARDINAL occasions DATE , plus DATE meetings with the prison nurse ;", "( e ) NORP eight psychiatric consultations and CARDINAL meetings with a psychiatric nurse ;", "( f ) provision of medical equipment to alleviate or offset disabilities , including a walking frame ( DATE ) , an anti - pressure - sore cushion ( DATE ) , spectacles ( DATE ) , a new wheelchair ( DATE ) , and an electrostimulation device ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the treatment described above , the Government informed the ORG that from DATE the applicant had attended physiotherapy sessions at ORG . The physiotherapist \u2019s services had been engaged following CARDINAL letters dated DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE in which the interregional director of ORG had alerted the Director General of ORG to the detrimental effects of the lack of physiotherapy on the care provided to prisoners .", "CARDINAL . The Government added that the applicant had been offered the opportunity to attend yoga classes but had been removed from the list of those enrolled for the classes because of his non - attendance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant confirmed the occasions of escorted leave mentioned by the Government but pointed out that on each occasion he had been transferred by ambulance \u2013 with his wrists and ankles handcuffed DATE and had had to undergo a full body search beforehand and a rub - down search afterwards . He added that the full body searches carried out whenever he received visits and when he was escorted outside the prison were deeply humiliating ; he was obliged to have his nappy inspected , and in order to proceed more quickly , several warders carried out this task together . During CARDINAL inspection , a senior warder had said in front of everyone that \u201c the boss had given instructions to inspect his nappy \u201d . The applicant maintained that as a result of these practices , he had asked his sister to visit him less frequently .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaints about the instances of escorted leave and the body searches , the Government pointed out that the physical damage he had suffered could not be regarded as having eradicated any security risk , since his health had no bearing on his potential connections on the outside and the risk of his escaping . To that end , they produced copies of CARDINAL decisions dated DATE ( month illegible ) and DATE ordering individual ( full body ) searches in connection with escorted leave for medical reasons . They noted that in DATE the applicant had been sent to a punishment cell for DATE following an assault on a fellow prisoner and the discovery of a mobile telephone in his cell . They stated that searches in the prison were not carried out systematically but on the basis of incidents noted during visits or in the cells . They produced CARDINAL decisions ordering individual searches , dated DATE and DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( involving searches of the applicant \u2019s cell ) , and CARDINAL decisions ordering a CARDINAL - off search of a specific sector of the prison after the visits received on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to physiotherapy , the applicant pointed out that he had only started receiving it in DATE and that it was limited to a DATE TIME session . He produced a medical certificate issued on DATE by a doctor from ORG ( unit\u00e9 de consultation et de soins ambulatoires \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) stating that his \u201c condition requires DATE rehabilitation , which ORG is unable to provide , both on account of the lack of qualified staff and because the premises are not suitably equipped . As a result , the patient can not remain in this facility without his health suffering . He must be given the possibility of admission to a specialised facility . \u201d The applicant submitted that the doctor was repeating what his colleagues had already noted on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and DATE ; he produced a medical certificate signed on the latter date by a doctor from the ORG who stated that the applicant could not remain in the facility without his health suffering and added that \u201c his paraplegia must be treated in a rehabilitation centre \u201d .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the electrostimulation device , the applicant submitted that his doctor had obtained the funds needed to purchase it but that the prison authorities had not allowed him to do so . As to the possibility of attending yoga classes , the applicant pointed out that he had been urged to go no more than once DATE in order to avoid \u201c monopolising \u201d the lift leading to where the classes were held .", "CARDINAL . The applicant again stressed that he was dependent on the prison orderly responsible for assisting him in his DATE activities . The prisoner currently \u201c assigned \u201d to that duty was the third since his admission to the prison , and the applicant was dependent on him for supplying incontinence products , accompanying him to the showers ( there was a step preventing unassisted wheelchair access ) and cleaning his cell . This level of dependency and the problems associated with his incontinence complicated his relationship with the orderly . Going to the shower was a stressful time because the structure did not shield him from the view of others and his incontinence exposed him to extremely humiliating situations , causing irritation or even hostility on the part of his fellow inmates , who were unwilling to put up with such inconvenience in the course of their personal hygiene activities .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant informed the ORG that he had been temporarily transferred to a cell in the secure unit , further to a decision by the classification board , after a mobile phone had been found in his cell . Under the resulting regime , he had access to TIME exercise in TIME in the TIME , despite the fact that a doctor had issued a certificate on DATE stating that his condition required access to CARDINAL ORG exercise a day . The Government stated that the applicant had been transferred back to his cell on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that although the prison management had indeed encouraged him to request a transfer to PERSON , their approach had been guided by purely administrative considerations unconnected to his care - related needs . The management had refused to give the slightest undertaking about the conditions in which he would be accommodated in GPE and the care he could be given there . They had been unable to provide any guarantees as to care arrangements as there were CARDINAL cells for disabled prisoners at that facility and they were all occupied , and a single physiotherapist came to the prison for DATE a week to provide services for CARDINAL prisoners . The applicant contended that he had not applied for a transfer on the grounds that the prison in question did not offer appropriate care facilities and would simply have represented a further upheaval and ordeal for him following his repeated moves from CARDINAL prison to another ( CARDINAL transfers DATE ) . He referred to information obtained from ORG ( Observatoire international des prisons DATE ) by his sister and his lawyer and produced a copy of an email sent by ORG to his lawyer on DATE , reading as follows :", "\u201c I do not think that PERSON and PERSON are particularly well equipped although , like all recent establishments , they do have disabled cells . I attach a decision in which ORG found , in relation to another wheelchair user , that \u2018 no custodial facility is equipped to cater for the applicant \u2019s condition\u2019 and accordingly suspended the execution of his sentence . ... Nevertheless , I consider it important to stress the consequences of a change of prison , not only in terms of family ties but also as regards the procedure for requesting a suspension of the sentence , since that procedure would then have to be started over again . ... \u201d", "The applicant emphasised in any event that the medical unit at ORG had not recommended his transfer to PERSON but rather the provision of treatment in a specialist facility .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicant \u2019s transfer to PERSON had been envisaged by the health - care professionals at ORG but observed that he had never actually requested such a transfer ; after mentioning a transfer request , he had indicated DATE ( CARDINAL DATE ) that he did not intend to pursue it , for reasons that were unclear . The ORG also produced a note drawn up on DATE , which in their submission suggested that \u201c the applicant \u2019s main motivation related to the previous decisions of the judicial authorities on requests for suspension of sentences , rather than to the treatment he might receive \u201d . They rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments about the inability of PERSON to accommodate him and submitted , in their additional observations , that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL cells reserved for people with reduced mobility were occupied . They produced a copy of an email sent by ORG in DATE indicating the availability of such cells . They also pointed out that an agreement had been signed in DATE between PERSON , the ORG and a non - governmental organisation with a view to providing appropriate care for dependent prisoners with specialist professional assistance ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
