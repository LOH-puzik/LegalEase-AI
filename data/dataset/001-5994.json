He is currently serving a prison sentence in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr J. Wadham , a solicitor working with ORG , a non - governmental organisation based in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "At TIME on DATE an individual carrying a bunch of flowers forced his way through the front door of the home of a DATE woman as she was about to leave her house . He stole QUANTITY in cash from her as well as jewellery and ornaments valued at QUANTITY . During the robbery the victim sustained a broken finger and cuts and bruises to her head and body .", "The victim provided a detailed description of the robber \u2019s physical appearance and attire . This description broadly matched that given by a postman who had spotted a man carrying a bunch of flowers in the vicinity on TIME in question . Although the victim and the postman noted some resemblance DATE and the robber at a police identification parade organised on DATE , neither was able to make a positive identification .", "At TIME on DATE of the robbery the applicant surrendered to his bail at a GPE police station in respect of a separate offence . He was found to be in possession of QUANTITY and MONEY . He had no other items of property on him . Some of his clothing matched the description of the clothes worn by the robber . On DATE he was granted bail in relation to the separate offence but was soon afterwards re - arrested on another matter and remanded in custody .", "On DATE police officers investigating the robbery searched the applicant \u2019s home and seized the clothes and shoes which he was wearing when he surrendered himself to the police on DATE . Nothing else relevant to the robbery was recovered .", "On DATE the applicant was twice interviewed under caution by the police in connection with the robbery . He had a private consultation with his solicitor before the first interview began . The police had informed the applicant \u2019s solicitor that finger and palm prints had been found inside the victim \u2019s house but refused to say where . The applicant was then interviewed for the first time under caution . He was told by police :", "\u201c You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court . Anything you say may be given in evidence \u201d .", "The applicant declined to answer any of the questions put to him during interview . The interview was stopped in order to allow the applicant to have a further private consultation with his solicitor , as he had requested . The applicant gave samples of his finger and palm prints to the police . The police informed the applicant DATE that analysis had shown that his prints matched those found inside the victim \u2019s front door . The second interview then began . The applicant was again cautioned and was reminded that he was entitled to free legal advice at any time . The applicant confirmed that he understood what had been said to him . The applicant \u2019s solicitor then confirmed that his role was to protect the applicant \u2019s interests and legal rights and that the applicant could take legal advice at any stage during the interview . The solicitor added that if any questions were put to the applicant which he considered improper or if any questions concerned matters that had not been disclosed to the applicant in advance , he would indicate to the applicant the need to take advice . Finally , the solicitor added that the applicant intended to make no comment to any questions put to him by the police but that he wanted to participate in an identification parade .", "The applicant was then asked a number of questions about his connection with the victim \u2019s house and his involvement in the robbery . It was specifically suggested to him that he had committed the robbery and that the finger and palm prints pointed to this . He was also asked about his alibi . The applicant continued to make no comment and was again warned of the risk of adverse inferences being drawn from his silence . The applicant stated that he had been advised by his solicitor to make no comment and would not make any comment .", "The applicant was charged with the robbery shortly after the second interview . He then repeated his request to participate in an identification parade .", "For DATE from CARDINAL DATE the applicant was tried before a jury at ORG , GPE , on charges of robbery and handling stolen goods .", "At the trial the prosecution adduced forensic evidence in the form of a footprint found on the victim \u2019s carpet which matched the thread pattern of the shoes worn by the applicant on DATE of the robbery , as well as fibres found on the applicant \u2019s shoes , seized at his home on DATE , which matched those on the victim \u2019s carpet . The prosecution conceded that neither element was conclusive of guilt . Of greater importance to the prosecution case was the fact that finger and palm prints found on the victim \u2019s front door were consistent with the applicant having been inside the house and having shut the door from the inside .", "The applicant testified at the trial that he had not been anywhere near the area where the victim lived on DATE in question . A defence witness testified that he was with the applicant at the time of the robbery in another part of GPE . The applicant stated in his defence that he had called at the victim \u2019s house as well as other houses in her street in DATE seeking help in connection with his car which had broken down . The victim \u2019s front door was ajar and he went into the hall and called out to see if anyone was in . There was no reply . The applicant submitted that he must have left his fingerprints on the front door on that occasion . The applicant called CARDINAL witnesses in support of his account of having been in the street and having called at houses looking for jump leads for his car . The victim told the jury that she never left the front door open and that her cleaning lady wiped it regularly . The cleaning lady testified that she cleaned the inside of the front door every DATE .", "In the course of the trial the applicant \u2019s counsel made an application in the absence of the jury that the trial judge hear evidence and submissions as to the admissibility of the fact that the applicant had , generally , made no comment when interviewed by the police , and had not disclosed the fact that he had an alibi and an explanation for the presence of the fingerprints , on the advice of his solicitor . It was also submitted on the applicant \u2019s behalf that , as a matter of law , there was no material on which the jury could be properly invited to draw inferences adverse to the applicant from his silence in interview . The trial judge gave an indication that adverse inferences might be drawn if the solicitor , who could give evidence as to the advice he gave to the applicant and the reasons for it , did not do so before the jury . The judge declined to hear evidence in the absence of the jury . He ruled :", "The jury has to decide whether the [ applicant ] has good reason for making no comment , not to decide whether the solicitor had good reason for giving the advice that he gave . \u201d", "The judge then assured counsel for the prosecution and the defence that he would later give them an opportunity to make submissions to him as to how he should direct the jury .", "The applicant did not call his solicitor to testify . In the course of his evidence the applicant waived legal professional privilege and was cross - examined on his admitted failure to tell his solicitor on DATE of his arrest about his alibi or his explanation for his fingerprints being found on the front door of the victim \u2019s house . As to why he had made no comment to the questions put to him during interview , the applicant said that this was because his solicitor had so advised him , and added that his solicitor had given him this advice as the police would not disclose to the defence where in the victim \u2019s house the finger and palm prints had been found .", "As to the applicant \u2019s silence during the QUANTITY police interviews , the trial judge directed the jury in the following terms :", "\u201c The prosecution case is that in the circumstances when he was questioned or charged he could reasonably have been expected then to mention those facts . The law is that you may draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to mention those facts when he was questioned or charged . You do not have to hold it against him , it is for you to decide whether it is proper to do so . Failure to mention such facts at the time can not on its own prove guilt . But depending on the circumstances , you may hold that failure against him when deciding whether he is guilty . You must decide whether , in the circumstances which existed at the time , the earlier innocent visit and the alibi were facts that the [ applicant ] could reasonably have been expected to mention when he was questioned under caution before being charged with the offence or when he was charged with the offence .", "The applicant was not obliged to answer to questions , he was entitled to remain silent . That was his right and his choice . I remind you that the burden of proof remains on the prosecution throughout . The [ applicant ] has to prove nothing . Any inference from his failure to mention those facts when he was questioned under caution or charged or when he was charged can not of its own prove guilt . You must be satisfied that the prosecution has established a case to answer before drawing any inferences from the failure to mention those facts . That means you must be satisfied that the [ applicant \u2019s ] finger and palm prints were on the inside of the [ victim \u2019s ] front door and that any physical description of the robber did not exclude the [ applicant ] . If , despite any evidence relied on to explain his failure to mention those facts when he was questioned under caution before being charged or when he was charged , you conclude that his failure to mention those facts can only sensibly be attributed to those facts not being true , you might draw an adverse inference . \u201d", "Later the judge reminded the jury :", "\u201c The [ applicant ] was interviewed on DATE . Towards the end of the second interview he said that he was advised by his solicitor to make no comment , that is , to refuse to answer questions . The prosecution say that the [ the applicant ] could reasonably have been expected to mention certain facts . \u201d", "Shortly afterwards the judge added :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] tells you that he did not answer questions because he had been advised not to because he had not been told whereabouts his fingerprints had been found in [ the victim \u2019s house ] . Does that mean that he could not reasonably be expected to mention his whereabouts on DATE ? Does that mean that he could not reasonably have been expected to mention his innocent visit to [ the victim \u2019s house ] ? The prosecution say this : until a man knows whereabouts in the house his prints have been found , he can not even think about a story to explain them away . You have been told , you have heard the evidence , that the solicitor advised the [ applicant ] to make no comment . \u201d", "Finally , the judge recited the applicant \u2019s evidence on the solicitor \u2019s advice :", "\u201c I [ the applicant ] spoke to a solicitor before the interview . I was advised to make no comment in the interview from the outset . The police would n\u2019t say where my fingerprints had been found . I accepted that advice . \u201d", "The jury returned a verdict of guilty by a majority of CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for the robbery offence and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment concurrently for handling stolen goods .", "The applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence to ORG with the leave of the Single Judge . Before ORG , the applicant contended inter alia that the trial judge had erred in law by permitting the police interviews to be admitted in evidence and by directing the jury that it was open to them to draw inferences from the failure of the applicant to mention during the interviews the matters which he later relied on in evidence at his trial .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against conviction while reducing his prison sentence from DATE .", "Delivering the judgment of ORG , Lord Justice PERSON stated that the court was not persuaded that the trial judge was wrong to decline to hear submissions in the absence of the jury on the exclusion of evidence . Lord Justice PERSON considered that , even if evidence had been heard by the judge on the voir dire , it was inevitable that the judge would have ruled that the evidence sought to be excluded could be heard by the jury . ORG concluded :", "\u201c In our judgment , therefore , it follows that there can be no adverse impact upon the safety of this conviction by the course of events followed in relation to the submissions made in relation to section DATE [ of ORG DATE ] . \u201d", "As to the question whether the trial judge had given a proper direction to the jury on the drawing of inferences from the applicant \u2019s silence at the police interviews , Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c ... the learned judge directed the jury impeccably , in accordance with the CARDINAL points to which Lord PERSON drew attention in PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL Cr .

In our judgment , when the whole of the summing up is read ... there is no sustainable argument that the judge \u2019s direction in relation to inferences were other than appropriate and adequate ... What is of significance , for consideration by the jury , is whether and when , in the sequence of events , as between arrest , charge and trial , the [ applicant ] mentions , if he does mention , matters relevant to his defence . It is for the judge to tailor his summing - up to the circumstances of the particular case , in order to deal with those matters . We see no ground for criticising the judge \u2019s summing up in this respect . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE provides that :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
