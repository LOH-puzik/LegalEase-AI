In his everyday life the applicant uses the compound name LOC . The application was originally filed by his parents , PERSON and PERSON PERSON ORG . Having reached legal age , the applicant informed ORG in DATE that he wished to pursue the application himself . He is represented by his father , PERSON .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "According to the initial regulation of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) of CARDINAL DATE , a child born in wedlock would obtain the surname of the father , which was also the common family name . With the introduction of the LAW on the Reform of the Marital and Family Law ( Erstes Gesetz zur Reform des Ehe- und GPE ) of DATE , a married couple could choose any of the spouses\u2019 surnames as the family name . Their children would then obtain the same family name . If the parents were unable to choose a family name , the husband \u2019s name would automatically become the family name according to the then applicable version of LAW of LAW . That provision was held to be unconstitutional and incompatible with the prohibition of discrimination ( LAW of LAW ) by ORG on DATE . ORG ordered that , until the legislator had formulated a new regulation , couples who married after DATE of the delivery of the judgment and who were unable to agree on the choice of a common family name would provisionally keep their surnames . In such an instance , their children were provisionally able to obtain a compound name composed of both surnames of the parents , in order to leave to the legislator the option to introduce the possibility to obtain such names .", "On DATE , the Act on the Regulation of the Law of Family Names ( Gesetz zur Neuordnung des Familiennamensrechts ) came into force which corrected the above constitutional flaws . Article CARDINAL of LAW was amended by giving both spouses the possibility to keep their surnames . According to the henceforth relevant LAW ( replaced in DATE by CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) of LAW , a child would either obtain the surname of the father or the mother . A compound name for the child was not provided for by LAW .", "The applicant \u2019s parents married in DATE . While the applicant \u2019s father kept his surname , \u201c PERSON \u201d , the applicant \u2019s mother adopted the compound name \u201c Heidecker - Tiemann \u201d . The applicant was born in DATE in GPE where he was subsequently registered by ORG as \u201c PERSON \u201d , bearing a surname composed of both his GPE original surnames ( \u201c Heidecker \u201d and \u201c PERSON \u201d ) . The applicant was registered under the surname \u201c PERSON \u201d in ORG ) at ORG , where the family resided at the time . The applicant \u2019s birth was not registered within the meaning of ORG , Deaths and Marriages Act ( Personenstandsgesetz ) .", "After the LAW on the Regulation of the Law of Family Names entered into force on DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother changed her surname back to her original maiden name ( \u201c Heidecker \u201d ) in DATE . Subsequently , the applicant \u2019s parents declared before ORG that the applicant \u2019s surname should be \u201c Heidecker - Tiemann \u201d . When the Registry officer refused the registration because compound names were not permitted by LAW , the parents opted for the registration of the name \u201c Heidecker \u201d and instituted proceedings in order to be able to register a compound name .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the GPE claim and found that ORG was not compelled to authenticate ( \u00f6ffentliche GPE ) the applicant \u2019s GPE declaration and register the applicant with a compound name .", "The appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The court found that the claimants had not demanded the authentication and the certification of their declaration , but the registration of the requested surname of the applicant .", "Upon the applicant \u2019s immediate appeal , that decision was quashed by ORG on DATE . The latter ordered ORG to authenticate the declaration of the applicant \u2019s parents . It also found that ORG was not competent to register the applicant \u2019s surname . As the applicant had been born abroad , the competent authority was ORG . The application had been given the file number \u201c III CARDINAL \u201d by ORG , which was subsequently quoted by ORG and ORG .", "On DATE , ORG authenticated the declaration of the applicant \u2019s parents ( that is , that the applicant \u2019s last name should be \u201c LOC ) of CARDINAL DATE and forwarded a verified copy to ORG which received it on DATE . ORG did however not receive the original .", "On DATE , ORG refused to certify the validity of the declaration . It found that the application was ill - founded for formal reasons , because section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act on the Regulation of the Law of Family Names provided that a declaration had to be issued within DATE after CARDINAL parent changed his or her last name . Thus , the time - limit had already expired with the receipt of the declaration in DATE .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the motion of the applicant \u2019s parents to register the applicant under a compound name . The court found that , irrespective of formal requirements , the applicable law did not provide for the possibility to obtain compound names .", "The GPE appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG ( GPE ) dismissed the GPE further appeal ( PERSON ) . The application had been given the file number \u201c QUANTITY CARDINAL \u201d by ORG , which was subsequently quoted by ORG and ORG .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant and his GPE constitutional complaint against the above decisions because the complaint was inadmissible .", "The applicant \u2019s parents subsequently obtained a required permit of their declaration of CARDINAL DATE by the guardianship court ( vormundschaftliche GPE ) by order of ORG of DATE . The original copy of the declaration was subsequently sent to ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG issued a statement to the applicant to the effect that he was registered under the last name \u201c Heidecker \u201d as from DATE . The applicant \u2019s parents argued that the above - mentioned permit would satisfy the procedural requirements for the registration of the applicant \u2019s surname as \u201c Heidecker - Tiemann \u201d . ORG however refused to register the compound name .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant and his GPE motion against the refusal because the applicable law did not provide for compound names and did not violate fundamental rights . The court found it therefore unnecessary to rule whether or not the certified declaration of DATE was introduced out of time .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant and his GPE appeal . On DATE , their further appeal was dismissed by ORG ( GPE ) . The application had been given the file number \u201c QUANTITY \u201d by ORG , which was subsequently quoted by ORG and ORG .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant and his GPE constitutional complaint against the decision by ORG ( GPE ) of DATE by referring to a leading judgment of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) in which the constitutionality of LAW had been confirmed .", "Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL Spouses should designate a common family name ( marital name ) . The spouses shall use the marital name which they have designated . If the spouses do not designate a family name , they will continue to bear those surnames after the marriage which they bore at the time when entering into the marriage .", "\u00a7 CARDINAL By declaration to the registrar , the spouses may designate , as their marital name , the birth name of the husband or the wife or the name he or she has at the time of the designation of the marital name .

This shall not apply if the marital name consists of CARDINAL name . If the name of CARDINAL of the spouses consists of CARDINAL name , CARDINAL of these names may be attached . ( ... ) \u201d", "DATE of the Civil Code provides :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL If the parents do not have a marital name but if they have joint parental responsibility , they shall , by declaration to the registrar , designate the surname that the father or the mother has at the time of the declaration as the birth name of the child . ( ... )", "\u00a7 CARDINAL If parents make no designation within DATE of the birth of the child , the family court shall transfer the right of designation to CARDINAL of the parents . Subsection ( CARDINAL ) applies mutatis mutandis . The court may impose a time - limit on the parent for the exercise of the right of designation . If , after the time - limit has expired , the right of designation had not been exercised , the child shall be given the name of the parent to whom the right of designation was transferred . \u201d", "Under NORP law , authentic compound names are permitted only in very specific circumstances . For example , compound names may be retained if they were used prior to ORG regulation of the law governing names . Moreover , pursuant to LAW PERSON , compound names may come into being when persons with surnames which are highly common in GPE such as \u201c PERSON \u201d or \u201c PERSON \u201d ( so - called PERSON ) add another name to render their family name easier to distinguish . Compound names created in this way may be passed on to children .", "Under LAW of LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz zum PERSON ) , a person \u2019s name falls to be decided by the law of the State of his or her nationality .", "In a leading judgment of DATE , ORG held , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , the former version of LAW of LAW ( which is identical to LAW of the current version of LAW ) to be constitutional . In particular , ORG found that the provision neither constituted a violation of the right to a family ( LAW ) , the right to educate one \u2019s own children ( LAW ) nor the children \u2019s right to protection of their personality rights as guaranteed by LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "ORG considered that , once children would be allowed to obtain compound names , the number of surnames could exponentiate with each future generation . The next generation would already be able to obtain a last name comprised of CARDINAL names . Such growing \u201c chains of surnames \u201d would not only be impracticable , they would also be to the detriment of future generations whose last names would be at risk of losing their function as a means of identification . LAW would not prohibit the legislator from reducing the number of possible last names to avoid such \u201c name chains \u201d in order to secure the function of the surnames of future generations .", "ORG considered that a different way of avoiding \u201c name chains \u201d would have been to allow compound names , but to restrict the number of last names to CARDINAL . This method , however , would prevent parents who already bore a compound name from giving their children a compound name comprised of both GPE last names , ORG or obtaining such a last name themselves . A person with a compound name could no longer keep his or her last name after marriage and add the last name of his or her partner , as currently provided for by LAW . Therefore , the introduction of an option to let one \u2019s children obtain compound names would at the same time reduce the choice of last names for those who already bore a compound name . Such a situation , in which CARDINAL fundamental right restricted another , would consequently require a balancing of interests , which the legislator had done when introducing the former version of LAW of LAW ( now LAW ) . ORG stated that the legislator had had several options to balance the above interests . The option which the legislator chose was thereby neither required nor prohibited by LAW .", "Lastly , ORG found that the former version of LAW of LAW did not violate the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex as guaranteed in LAW . If each spouse kept his or her last name after marriage , married couples could choose CARDINAL of their last names as the surname for their children . LAW CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code reduced the possible options to give their children a last name , but this concerned spouses of both sexes alike . The fact that married couples with different last names were in practice more likely to choose the husband \u2019s last name for their children was not considered to suggest a different finding . Even though this could possibly indicate a widespread affirmation of traditional marriage patterns , LAW could not be interpreted as containing a positive obligation on the ORG to introduce the GPE right to choose a compound name for their children . In any case , such a regulation had only minor effects on the ORG \u2019s positive obligation to secure equality of the sexes as contained in the second sentence of LAW of LAW .", "That children could still obtain a compound name in cases in which CARDINAL parent already bore a compound name was not regarded as a violation of the prohibition of discrimination against those children who could not obtain a compound name . In both instances , children were only allowed to obtain either the last name of the mother or the father .", "In the case of PERSON v. PERSON , Dorothee PERSON ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ORG of ORG of DATE ) , ORG made a reference for a preliminary ruling under LAW regarding the interpretation of LAW ( \u201c EGBGB \u201d , see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d above ) in the light of LAW ( prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality ) and LAW ( freedom of movement ) . That case concerned a married couple of NORP origin who had kept their surnames and whose son ( who also had NORP citizenship ) was born in GPE , where he was subsequently registered with a compound name composed of the surnames of his parents in the NORP birth register . The NORP authorities refused to recognise the compound name because of section CARDINAL ) of the Law Introducing LAW , according to which a person \u2019s name falls to be decided by the law of the State of his or her nationality . Under NORP law , the son was not entitled to bear a compound name composed of the surnames of his parents . The GPE appeal against that decision and their subsequent constitutional complaint with ORG were to no avail .", "When the parents , who in the meantime divorced , refused to make a declaration before the Registry Officer regarding the surname of their child , ORG had to refer the right to determination to CARDINAL parent pursuant to LAW and CARDINAL of LAW . ORG subsequently referred the matter to ORG pursuant to LAW with the following question : \u201c In light of the prohibition on discrimination set out in LAW ORG and having regard to the right to the freedom of movement for every citizen of the Union laid down in LAW ORG , is the provision on the conflict of laws contained in LAW valid , in so far as it provides that the right to bear a name is governed by nationality alone ? \u201d . ORG ( ORG ) decided on DATE that it had no jurisdiction to answer the question referred by ORG because the latter , when making a decision pursuant to LAW and CARDINAL of LAW , exercised administrative authority , without at the same time being called on to decide a dispute . Therefore , ORG could not be regarded as exercising judicial function .", "On DATE the parents lodged a fresh request to register the compound surname . Following ORG refusal to grant the request , the parents lodged a complaint with ORG which referred the matter with the same question to ORG . The case is currently pending before the latter court ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
