They gave the prosecutor their eyewitness accounts of the events DATE which are summarised above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) \u2013 leading up to the killing of the CARDINAL men .", "CARDINAL . Also DATE the ORG prosecutor decided that he lacked jurisdiction to investigate the killings because , although it had been stated by his opposite number in Cizre in DATE that the killings had been carried out by members of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it was now being alleged by the applicants that their relatives had been killed on account of their refusals to become village guards . The CARDINAL confessors and \u201c their accomplices whose identities could not be determined \u201d were referred to in this document as the \u201c accused \u201d .

It also ordered that ORG be photographed with a view to showing his photographs to the eyewitnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was arrested and questioned by the ORG pursuant to the letters rogatory mentioned above . He denied the accusations and maintained that he had been performing his military service at the time of the killings . He was released DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer for the applicants sent a letter to the \u015e\u0131rnak court , requesting permission for his clients to join the proceedings as interveners . This request was accepted on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The PERSON court had to postpone a number of its hearings to wait for the photographs of Abdulhakim G\u00fcven .", "CARDINAL . After having sent a number of reminders , on DATE the PERSON court was finally provided with the photographs of ORG taken on DATE .

At the same hearing the prosecutor asked the PERSON court to acquit the defendants . The PERSON court accepted that request and acquitted the defendants for lack of sufficient evidence . It considered , in particular , that although Mr A.M. had been in a minibus with a number of other persons , he had been the only person to witness the alleged abduction of the CARDINAL men . In any event , the defendants had been working as informers and helping the security forces . Such informers were not well regarded by the residents of the region and , as such , the testimony of Mr A.M. implicating the confessors in the killings was disregarded . According to the PERSON court , the fact that Abdulhakim G\u00fcven was not in prison at the time of the killings did not prove that he had taken part in them . He had been helping the security forces with their operations and , as such , it was not logical that he would be involved in a killing . The PERSON court also decided to inform the relevant prosecutor to continue with the search for the perpetrators .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . In their appeal petition they referred to the obligations under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention to carry out effective investigations into incidents of killings , and alleged that the investigation into the killing of their relatives had been flawed . They maintained that the eyewitnesses had been consistent throughout the criminal investigation . The confessor PERSON had lied to the investigating authorities when he said that he had been in prison on DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The PERSON court had contented itself with showing the photographs of CARDINAL of the defendants to an eyewitness and had not summoned the defendants to the trial . Furthermore , the investigating authorities had failed to follow up leads concerning the involvement of the gendarmerie and the security services and had only prosecuted the CARDINAL confessors . They argued that the trial court had also failed to ensure an identity parade so that the eyewitnesses could have seen and identified the CARDINAL confessors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal and upheld the CARDINAL GPE acquittals .", "CARDINAL . In their letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicants informed the ORG that the same CARDINAL confessors ( that is , Mr Abdulhakim G\u00fcven and Mr PERSON ) , a high - ranking army official and CARDINAL intelligence officers working for the gendarmerie had been indicted in DATE and put on trial for the killing of their CARDINAL relatives as well as the killing of a number of other persons at around the same time .", "DATE .

On DATE the \u015e\u0131rnak Governor \u2019s office partially accepted the compensation claims made by the CARDINAL applicants in respect of the killings of their relatives \u201c by members of the ORG \u201d .
