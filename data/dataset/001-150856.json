NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is detained pending trial in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , of ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was indicted in GPE as a co - conspirator in respect of a conspiracy to establish a jihad training camp in GPE , GPE . ORG consequently requested his extradition under LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , along with Mr PERSON , lodged a first application against GPE and GPE with ORG under LAW ( \u201c the LAW ) on DATE ( see application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . He alleged that if extradited and convicted he would be at real risk of ill - treatment either as a result of conditions at ORG ( a \u201c supermax \u201d prison ) or by the length of his possible sentence . The proceedings in the case of the applicant and Mr PERSON were originally conducted simultaneously with the cases of Mr PERSON ( application no . CARDINAL ) and PERSON ( application no . ORG ) . Interim measures under LAW were granted on DATE and on DATE the applications were granted priority status under LAW . On DATE the President of the ORG decided under LAW ( b ) of ORG to give notice of the applications lodged by Mr PERSON ( application no . CARDINAL ) and Mr PERSON ( application no . MONEY ) to the Government of GPE . Both of these applications raised the same issues regarding extradition to GPE , namely conditions of detention at ORG and the length of possible sentences . The ORG therefore decided to deal with the CARDINAL applications together .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered its judgment in the case of PERSON and Others v. the GPE , nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL . However , as the applicant suffered from mental health problems of sufficient severity to require his transfer from ORG to ORG , the ORG considered that it was not in a position to rule on the merits of his complaints without further submissions from the parties . It therefore decided to disjoin and adjourn the examination of the applicant \u2019s complaints .", "CARDINAL . The ORG delivered its judgment in PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL on DATE wherein it held , unanimously , that there would be a violation of LAW in the event of the applicant \u2019s extradition on account of the current severity of his mental condition ( see in particular LAW CARDINAL ) . In particular the ORG noted that there was a lack of certainty as to the where the applicant would be detained , either before or after trial ; it was unclear how long the applicant might expect to remain on remand pending trial ; it was unclear whether the applicant \u2019s legal representatives would be entitled to challenge his competency to stand trial in GPE on account of his mental disorder ; there was no information before the ORG concerning the potential length of a competency assessment or any subsequent appeals procedure ; there was a complete absence of any information about the consequences for the applicant if the District Judge were to find that he was not fit to stand trial ; and there was no guarantee that if tried and convicted the applicant would not be detained in ORG , where he would be exposed to a \u201c highly restrictive \u201d regime with long periods of social isolation .", "CARDINAL . A request for a referral to ORG made by ORG was refused on DATE . The ORG \u2019s decision therefore became final and the Rule CARDINAL measure previously in place lapsed .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the Secretary of ORG received a letter from ORG , a copy of which has not been provided to this ORG . It would appear that this letter stated that on the basis of the trial of other individuals in situations similar to that of the applicant , he would be held in pre - trial detention for DATE ; that if his competency was at issue , he would be hospitalised for treatment for a maximum period of DATE for assessment ; that if deemed unfit , he would be committed to the custody of the Attorney General and thereafter referred to a psychiatric referral centre ; that the exact timing of the process was difficult to estimate in advance owing to the fact - specific nature of any assessment ; that it was not suggested that the applicant , in his current state , was unfit to plead ; and that it was highly likely that he would only become incompetent if , as a result of the conditions in which he was detained , he relapsed into an acute psychotic state . In terms of his likely treatment postconviction , the DATE letter also stated that if \u201c it is determined that he is unable to manage his activities or DATE living by himself ( including his taking of prescribed medication ) it is highly unlikely that he would be placed at the ORG , but rather , at a medical centre . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG advised the applicant of her decision to proceed with his extradition to GPE as the information obtained from ORG on DATE had led her to be entirely satisfied that extradition could take place without infringing LAW . The Secretary of ORG did not invite the applicant or his legal representatives to make submissions before she made her decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision . He relied on CARDINAL principal grounds , namely : ( i ) that the Secretary of ORG had been obliged , but had failed , to afford him the opportunity to make representations before making her decision on extradition ; and ( ii ) that the further information provided by ORG was not materially different from that previously placed before ORG . Therefore it would be impermissible to depart from its conclusion that there would be an LAW violation in the event of his extradition . A ORG report , dated DATE , by PERSON , a ORG and the applicant \u2019s responsible clinician at ORG , was prepared and placed before the domestic court .", "CARDINAL . The High Court heard oral arguments on CARDINAL and DATE and promulgated its judgment on DATE . The court stated that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The contentious and determinative issue is : what will happen to the claimant if he is extradited .", "CARDINAL . Approaching that issue in the same manner as did ORG , as it is common ground we should the starting point must be its clearly stated reason for holding that there would be a violation of LAW :", "\u2018 There would be a violation of LAW ... in the event of the applicant \u2019s extradition solely on account of the current severity of his mental PERSON", "It is the likely impact of extradition and all that it entails on that condition which was central to ORG decision and must be to ours . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court found , on the basis of the evidence before it , that the information provided on DATE by ORG ( the content of which has been outlined above ) had addressed the uncertainties referred to by ORG in paragraph CARDINAL of its DATE judgment both in terms of pre - trial and post - conviction detention . In particular , the court noted that the applicant would be admitted to ORG ( \u201c MCC \u201d ) , a remand prison in GPE , upon arrival and his mental health condition would be assessed immediately ; that if his condition could be met within the ORG , his detention would continue in that facility ; that in the ORG , he would have access to mental health services and would be provided with appropriate , but different , medication from that prescribed at ORG ; that if assessed as being \u201c acutely mentally ill \u201d , he would likely be housed in a psychiatric referral centre managed by ORG ( \u201c BOP \u201d ) ; and that if \u201c it is determined that he is unable to manage his activities or DATE living by himself ( including his taking of prescribed medication ) it is highly unlikely that he would be placed at the ORG , but rather , at a medical centre . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant \u2019s legal representative and PERSON , a criminologist who had visited and reported upon numerous federal prisons DATE , provided a bleak picture of the conditions at the ORG . The court found that their reporting of conditions was controversial and that in any event , it was not necessary to reach a final decision in that regard . The ORG was a prison , the primary purpose of which was to detain those awaiting trial on serious charges . It was not an institution whose primary function was to treat and care for those with serious mental health problems . However the court also observed that there remained some detailed gaps as to the precise circumstances in which the applicant would be detained in the ORG . Particular reference was made to whether the applicant would be housed in a single cell ; and what opportunities he would have for contact with others and for undertaking the types of educational and recreational facilities such as those available to him at ORG .", "CARDINAL . Assessing the medical evidence and referring to the previous approach by this ORG , the court held that the applicant \u2019s mental health problems were well controlled by the regime as applied at ORG ; and that it was established , at a minimum , that removal from ORG ( or an equivalent hospital with a similar regime ) to a prison , even one with significant mental health provision , would put the applicant at risk of relapse into an acute psychotic state .", "CARDINAL . In light of its findings , ORG set out what it considered necessary to ensure that the applicant \u2019s extradition would not be in breach of GPE obligations under LAW . It noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL The only means which I can see by which the basic concerns of ORG can be answered are that GPE offers an assurance to the Secretary of ORG that , upon arrival in GPE , the claimant will immediately be transferred to a ORG and kept there unless and until the equivalent of his treating clinician , Dr. PERSON , determines that he could be transferred to another institution without compromising his health and safety ; and if not , that he will be kept at a ORG until trial . His extradition would have to be preceded by detailed discussions and the exchange of information between Dr. PERSON and the receiving psychiatrist . By those means , the real risk of relapse into an acute psychotic state which formed the basis of ORG decision would be removed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the court found that the Secretary of ORG was not duty - bound to have given the applicant the opportunity to make submissions before she made her decision to proceed with his extradition . The applicant had , in any event , been afforded full opportunity to present his case on that issue in the current proceedings and the court had to consider for itself whether or not his extradition would infringe LAW . Moreover , the court adjourned the final decision in the matter for DATE for the Government of GPE to consider whether or not it wished to give the assurances outlined above .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by way of ORG , submitted a number of assurances in which it undertook as follows : that the applicant would be transported to GPE on a flight that would enable him to be processed by ORG ( ORG ) and promptly produced before a judge for purposes of his initial appearance and a detention determination ( on DATE of arrival if possible ) ; that while awaiting court during business hours , the applicant would be kept in a ORG cellblock and that he would be transported to the hospital for emergency care should such a need arise ; that should TIME detention be required , the applicant would be held either at a contract jail facility or at the local ORG ( BOP ) facility and that he would have access to emergency medical care if required ; that the applicant would be advised of the charges against him and represented by counsel at his initial appearance ( either self - funded or court- appointed ) ; that the applicant could , without objection , immediately request an assessment as to his competency ; that if the evaluation was granted , the applicant would be transported to a ORG psychiatric referral centre for assessment ; that should the applicant not make an application for a competency assessment , he would in any event , with the approval of LOC , be detained at an undisclosed private detention healthcare facility for a determination of his health needs ; that the District Judge \u2019s consent was required to house the applicant outside of GPE state ( where any trial would take place ) ; that assuming the defense consented , the prosecution believed that judicial consent would be forthcoming on the basis of the current undertakings ; that prior to extradition , a psychiatrist would undertake to receive from PERSON , the applicant \u2019s treating clinician in GPE , all relevant medical information ; and that whether the applicant was housed at a psychiatric referral centre or in the unspecified private facility , he would be kept in such a facility unless and until his treating clinician determined that he could be transferred to another institution without compromising his health and safety .", "CARDINAL . Additional information was provided by ORG on DATE . This included details of the treating clinician who would take responsibility for the applicant \u2019s case postextradition . Furthermore , it was noted that CARDINAL of the medications used to treat the applicant was not available in GPE ; that other medications were available to treat the same symptoms ; and that discussions between physicians in the respective jurisdictions could take place . In addition , ORG advised that federal law made provision for an individual to participate in pre - trial proceedings via videolink ; that any trial would take place in GPE city ; and that during trial , the applicant would be housed in a local jail facility close to the court house , where he would have access to any necessary medical treatment , including at hospitals within GPE city . Finally an estimate of DATE was given with respect to the applicant \u2019s trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , satisfied with the assurances given by ORG , held that there was no risk of an LAW violation in the event of the applicant \u2019s extradition . That judgment was made final on DATE . Although an official transcript has not yet been made available , Counsel for both the applicant and the Government took notes during oral delivery of the judgment . Counsel for the ORG \u2019s note indicated that it had been accepted on the part of the applicant that there was no live issue as to his being unfit to plead and therefore he would be detained pre - trial in a specified private medical facility . Otherwise , it is recorded that the court accepted that the assurances given were sufficient and that the process would not imperil the applicant \u2019s mental health condition ; that in considering the placement of the applicant outside of GPE state , the District Judge would not deliberately put at risk the applicant \u2019s mental health ; that arrangements were in place for discussions to take place between treating clinicians ; that during the applicant \u2019s trial in GPE , there were facilities available which provided for mental health care and treatment ; that the concerns raised by this ORG and the domestic court in DATE had been eliminated ; and that there was no risk of an LAW breach . Nothing in the Counsel for the applicant \u2019s note of the hearing contradicted those comments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a request for an interim measure under Rule CARDINAL of ORG to prevent his extradition to GPE . On DATE the President of the Section to which the case had been allocated decided to apply Rule CARDINAL until the ORG had been afforded the opportunity to consider the request made . The following questions were asked of ORG : ( i ) Do the undertakings as provided by ORG by way of ORG , dated DATE , adequately respond to the concerns raised by this ORG in its judgment of DATE regarding the extradition of the applicant ? ; and ( ii ) Would the extradition of the applicant to GPE be in breach of GPE obligations under LAW ?", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted its response . It stated that since the GPE judgment of DATE , there had been further domestic decisions which demonstrated that the concerns that had given rise to that decision had been comprehensively addressed . Moreover , the Government asserted that those concerns could be summarised as follows : a lack of information concerning the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s detention pre - trial ; a lack of clarity as to how long the period of pre - trial detention might last ; the implications of a finding in GPE that the applicant was unfit to stand trial ; and an on - going concern that the applicant might be subjected to prolonged periods of social isolation in detention at ORG following a conviction . The culmination of the information and assurances received by ORG had addressed those concerns . Specifically , the applicant would be detained at a private detention medical facility for an approximate period of DATE ; if a competency assessment was requested and the applicant was found to be unfit to plead , he would be placed in the custody of the Attorney General and detained at a psychiatric referral centre ; and if found to be unable to manage his DATE activities , including his taking of prescribed medication , it was unlikely that the applicant be detained at ORG , rather he would be detained at a medical centre . The Government concluded that the extradition of the applicant would not be in breach of GPE obligations under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , having considered the applicant \u2019s case based on the new factual information before it , decided to lift the interim measure previously indicated .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was extradited to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
