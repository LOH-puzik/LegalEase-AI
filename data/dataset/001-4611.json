ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , born in DATE and currently residing in GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "", "The applicant is a member of ORG ( \u201c Cassa di previdenza e assistenza dei dipendenti della ORG ) . On DATE this fund was incorporated in the Mutual Fund W. ( \u201c ORG pensione dei dipendenti del FAC \u201d ) .", "On DATE the applicant introduced a claim before ORG . Assuming that the decision taken on DATE was invalid , he requested the investigating judge to declare the stay of its execution .", "In an order of CARDINAL DATE the GPE investigating judge accepted the applicant \u2019s claim .", "On DATE the Mutual Fund I. challenged this order before ORG . It alleged , inter alia , that as Rule CARDINAL of the Fund \u2019s internal Rules contained an arbitration clause , the matter fell outside the ordinary courts\u2019 jurisdiction .", "The applicant contested the ORG \u2019s action , alleging that the latter \u2019s conclusion was contrary to ORG , DATE and DATE of the NORP LAW - guaranteeing the ORG fundamental rights , the principle of equality between citizens and the right to defend oneself in trial - and to LAW .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG revoked the order of CARDINAL DATE . It recalled that a distinction should be drawn between \u201c ordinary \u201d and \u201c extraordinary \u201d arbitration clause ( \u201c clausola di arbitrato rituale o irrituale \u201d ) . The first one was a substitute for the ORG \u2019s jurisdiction , aimed at obtaining a decision replacing a judgment , while the latter was a private agreement by which the parties conferred to an arbitrator the power to settle a litigation between them . An interim measure , such as the stay of execution , could be adopted only when an \u201c ordinary \u201d arbitration clause was at issue . Having found that the clause contained in LAW of the ORG \u2019s internal Rules was an \u201c extraordinary \u201d one , ORG declared that the action introduced by the applicant fell outside its jurisdiction ratione materiae . As the internal Rules had been freely accepted by the parties , the court considered that there was no appearance of a violation of the provisions invoked by the applicant .", "This decision was final and not subject to any appeal . However , the Mutual Fund I. decided to convene a ORG assembly in order to take a new decision on the incorporation . According to the applicant , this was tantamount to an implicit acceptance of his complaints concerning the lawfulness of the decision of CARDINAL DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
