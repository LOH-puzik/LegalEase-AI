Moreover , as the NORP authorities do not tolerate any forms of opposition , there is a high risk of attributing membership of such religious organisations to people who have been noticed for their opposition views or who are perceived by the authorities as supporters of opposition groups . Therefore , there is a great risk that people involved in the activities of such religious organisations , or to whom such an involvement is attributed by the authorities , can be persecuted for the reasons enumerated in the DATE Convention relating to the status of refugees which was ratified by GPE in DATE , especially taking into account the lack of an effective mechanism of legal guarantees in [ GPE ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The conclusion that the applicants did not run any risk of ill - treatment if returned to GPE had been hypothetical and had not been supported by evidence .

The applicants were charged with capital offences and there was a risk of their being sentenced to death following an unfair trial .

The court rejected the suggestion that the applicants would be subjected to inhuman treatment and that their rights would be violated in GPE . It further held that the issue of the applicants ' guilt or innocence was not within the scope of the review by the extraditing authorities .

The combination of a lack of respect for the principle of presumption of innocence despite being guaranteed by the LAW ( article CARDINAL ) and [ LAW ] ( article CARDINAL ) , the discretionary powers of the investigators and procurators with respect to access to detainees by legal counsel and relatives , as well as the lack of independence of the judiciary and allegedly rampant corruption in the judiciary and law enforcement agencies , are believed to be conducive to the use of illegal methods of investigation . The excessive powers in the overall criminal proceedings of procurators , who are supposed at the same time to conduct and supervise preliminary criminal investigations , to bring charges and to monitor respect for existing legal safeguards against torture during criminal investigations and in places of detention , make investigations into complaints overly dependent on their goodwill .", "CARDINAL .

Even though only a small number of torture cases can be proved with absolute certainty , the copious testimonies gathered are so consistent in their description of torture techniques and the places and circumstances in which torture is perpetrated that the pervasive and persistent nature of torture throughout the investigative process can not be denied . The Special Rapporteur also observes that torture and other forms of ill - treatment appear to be used indiscriminately against persons charged for activities qualified as serious crimes such as acts against ORG interests , as well as petty criminals and others . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Individuals , who have been detained and subsequently released , claimed that the detainees were being subjected to various forms of torture and other ill - treatment including beatings , beating of the heels with rubber truncheons , and the insertion of needles into gums and under fingernails . Torture and other ill - treatment have reportedly been used to force detainees to ' confess ' to being involved in religious extremism .

ORG is also concerned that the DATE announcement may come too late to protect those people who have been charged with capital crimes \u2013 premeditated aggravated murder and terrorism \u2013 in connection with the events in GPE . ORG considers that these individuals are at great risk of suffering a violation of their right to life as a result of the likely imposition of the death penalty following what would likely be an unfair trial .

In his interim report submitted in accordance with ORG resolution CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( ORG . : ORG , DATE ) , the Special Rapporteur of ORG on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , PERSON , reached the following conclusions :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is the view of the Special Rapporteur that diplomatic assurances are unreliable and ineffective in the protection against torture and ill - treatment : such assurances are sought usually from GPE where the practice of torture is systematic ; post - return monitoring mechanisms have proven to be no guarantee against torture ; diplomatic assurances are not legally binding , therefore they carry no legal effect and no accountability if breached ; and the person whom the assurances aim to protect has no recourse if the assurances are violated . The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that GPE can not resort to diplomatic assurances as a safeguard against torture and ill - treatment where there are substantial grounds for believing that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture or ill - treatment upon return .", "CARDINAL . The Special Rapporteur calls on Governments to observe the principle of non - refoulement scrupulously and not expel any person to frontiers or territories where they might run the risk of human rights violations , regardless of whether they have officially been recognized as refugees . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Specifically referring to the situation of torture in GPE and returns to torture effected in reliance upon diplomatic assurances from the NORP authorities , the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture PERSON has stated to the CARDINALnd Session of the UN Human Rights Council on DATE :", "\u201c The practice of torture in GPE is systematic , as indicated in the report of my predecessor PERSON visit to the country in DATE . Lending support to this finding , my mandate continues to receive serious allegations of torture by NORP law enforcement officials ... Moreover , with respect to the events in DATE in GPE , the ORG High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that there is strong , consistent and credible testimony to the effect that NORP military and security forces committed grave human rights violations there . The fact that the Government has rejected an international inquiry into the LOC events , independent scrutiny of the related proceedings , and that there is no internationally accepted account of the events , is deeply worrying . Against such significant , serious and credible evidence of systematic torture by law enforcement officials in GPE , I continue to find myself appealing to ORG to refrain from transferring persons to GPE . The prohibition of torture is absolute , and GPE risk violating this prohibition - their obligations under international law - by transferring persons to countries where they may be at risk of torture . I reiterate that diplomatic assurances are not legally binding , undermine existing obligations of GPE to prohibit torture , are ineffective and unreliable in ensuring the protection of returned persons , and therefore shall not be resorted to by GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ' Note on ORG and ORG published on DATE reads as follows :", "CARDINAL . In general , assessing the suitability of diplomatic assurances is relatively straightforward where they are intended to ensure that the individual concerned will not be subjected to capital punishment or certain violations of fair trial rights as a consequence of extradition . In such cases , the wanted person is transferred to a formal process , and the requesting ORG 's compliance with the assurances can be monitored . While there is no effective remedy for the requested ORG or the surrendered person if the assurances are not observed , non - compliance can be readily identified and would need to be taken into account when evaluating the reliability of such assurances in any future cases .", "CARDINAL . The situation is different where the individual concerned risks being subjected to torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment in the receiving ORG upon removal . It has been noted that ' unlike assurances on the use of the death penalty or trial by a military court , which are readily verifiable , assurances against torture and other abuse require constant vigilance by competent and independent personnel ' . ORG addressed the issue in its decision in GPE v. GPE ( Minister of ORG ) , contrasting assurances in cases of a risk of torture with those given where the person extradited may face the death penalty , and signalling", "' ... the difficulty in relying too heavily on assurances by a state that it will refrain from torture in the future when it has engaged in illegal torture or allowed others to do so on its territory in the past . This difficulty becomes acute in cases where torture is inflicted not only with the collusion but through the impotence of the state in controlling the behaviour of its officials . Hence the need to distinguish between assurances regarding the death penalty and assurances regarding torture . The former are easier to monitor and generally more reliable than the latter . '", "CARDINAL . In his report to ORG of DATE , the special Rapporteur of ORG Human Rights on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment examined the question of diplomatic assurances in light of the non - refoulement obligations inherent in the absolute and nonderogable prohibition of torture and other forms of ill - treatment . Noting that in determining whether there are substantial grounds for believing that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture , all relevant considerations must be taken into account , the Special Rapporteur expressed the view that :", "' in circumstances where there is a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights , or of systematic practice of torture , the principle of nonrefoulement must be strictly observed and diplomatic assurances should not be resorted to . ' \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG for the Prevention of Torture 's ( the CPT ) CARDINALth ORG of DATE on their activities covering the period from DATE to DATE expressed concern about reliance on diplomatic assurances in light of the absolute prohibition against torture :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Reference was made in the Preface to the potential tension between a ORG 's obligation to protect its citizens against terrorist acts and the need to uphold fundamental values . This is well illustrated by the current controversy over the use of ' diplomatic assurances ' in the context of deportation procedures . The prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment encompasses the obligation not to send a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would run a real risk of being subjected to such methods . In order to avoid such a risk in given cases , certain ORG have chosen the route of seeking assurances from the country of destination that the person concerned will not be ill - treated . This practice is far from new , but has come under the spotlight in DATE as GPE have increasingly sought to remove from their territory persons deemed to endanger national security . Fears are growing that the use of diplomatic assurances is in fact circumventing the prohibition of torture and ill - treatment .", "DATE . The seeking of diplomatic assurances from countries with a poor overall record in relation to torture and ill - treatment is giving rise to particular concern . It does not necessarily follow from such a record that someone whose deportation is envisaged personally runs a real risk of being ill - treated in the country concerned ; the specific circumstances of each case have to be taken into account when making that assessment . However , if in fact there would appear to be a risk of ill - treatment , can diplomatic assurances received from the authorities of a country where torture and ill - treatment is widely practised ever offer sufficient protection against that risk ? It has been advanced with some cogency that even assuming those authorities do exercise effective control over the agencies that might take the person concerned into their custody ( which may not always be the case ) , there can be no guarantee that assurances given will be respected in practice . If these countries fail to respect their obligations under international human rights treaties ratified by them , so the argument runs , why should one be confident that they will respect assurances given on a bilateral basis in a particular case ?", "CARDINAL . In response , it has been argued that mechanisms can be devised for the post - return monitoring of the treatment of a person deported , in the event of his / her being detained . While the ORG retains an open mind on this subject , it has yet to see convincing proposals for an effective and workable mechanism . To have any chance of being effective , such a mechanism would certainly need to incorporate some key guarantees , including the right of independent and suitably qualified persons to visit the individual concerned at any time , without prior notice , and to interview him / her in private in a place of their choosing . The mechanism would also have to offer means of ensuring that immediate remedial action is taken , in the event of it coming to light that assurances given were not being respected . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4", "6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
