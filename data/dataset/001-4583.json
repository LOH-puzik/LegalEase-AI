The political unrest about refugee questions continued , especially about refugees ' possibilities of family reunification and the public criticism was increasingly directed against the applicant personally .", "On several occasions members of ORG attempted to induce the ORG to invite a specially commissioned court of inquiry with public court sessions to investigate the applicant 's conduct in connection with the NORP refugees ' applications for family reunification . Whereas the applicant had no objections thereto the Government resisted and such a proposal was not adopted .", "On DATE ORG transmitted a programme in which the applicant 's conduct and the discharge of his official duties were severely criticised . In the following DATE the television programme resulted in an extensive public debate in all NORP media . This caused the Prime Minister to issue a press release on DATE in which it appeared that the Government and the political parties , which together with the Government comprised a parliamentary majority , now agreed that the question of the administration of the NORP refugees ' family reunification should be investigated . From the press release it also appeared that the ORG would propose a change in ORG ( Retsplejeloven ) aiming especially at such an investigation .", "The PERSON was proposed by the Minister of Justice on DATE and adopted on CARDINAL DATE .", "Following the adoption of the Bill the Prime Minister addressed a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the President of ORG which read as follows :", "( Translation )", "\" According to Section CARDINALa of ORG has decided , on behalf of ORG , to request a ORG judge to conduct an investigation of the decision - making process and the administration connected with the handling of cases concerning the family reunification of refugees from GPE .

The applicant testified on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE DATE as well as on DATE , DATE and DATE . Before his testimonies he was informed that he had the right to remain silent and that , in case he chose to give testimony , this would not be under oath .", "On DATE ORG ended its examination of witnesses and the presiding judge stated , with regard to the submission of written statements , as follows :", "( Translation )", "\u201c ... ORG is not going to pronounce a judgment - which would presuppose legal arguments from counsel - but issue a report - i.e. a recommendation to others - with regard to the issues which have been examined during the investigation . If anybody wishes to make written submissions to the court it can not at the outset be expected that the court will take the initiative to arrange an adversarial procedure , requesting replies , rebuttal and counter - rebuttal from everybody who has made statements . As can be ascertained from the court \u2019s work , everybody who has given testimony without being under oath has had an opportunity - with legal assistance - to obtain knowledge of the evidence which ORG has obtained in order to prepare the report . Some - many - have made use of this opportunity , others have not . Everybody has had an opportunity to raise questions and to suggest that further evidence be produced and this opportunity has also been used by witnesses who have not wished legal assistance . ORG has complied with these wishes without exception , and nobody has been prevented from stating - also in a more general way - his views on the issues of the case during the hearings . If anybody despite this intends to make submissions to the court they are not prevented from doing so , but the preparation of the report has - as I said - commenced and ought obviously to be finished as swiftly as possible . \u201d", "The final date for the submission of written statements was fixed by ORG as DATE , but on appeal to ORG the time - limit was extended to DATE . ORG - sitting with CARDINAL judges , CARDINAL of whom participated in the subsequent proceedings in ORG - stated in its decision of CARDINAL DATE that ORG would not be obliged to take into consideration observations submitted later than that date . Furthermore , it stated that having regard , inter alia , to the purpose of ORG it would not be obliged to initiate an adversarial procedure and forward received written statements to other witnesses .", "On DATE and DATE ORG granted the witnesses the right to read through the court transcripts of the testimonies given by other witnesses at the offices of the legal assistants to the extent which the legal assistants considered it necessary in order to assist their clients properly . It was thus presupposed that witnesses were not given access to testimonies of other witnesses which the assistants considered irrelevant in relation to their clients . On DATE the decision was upheld by ORG , which also this time was composed of CARDINAL judges CARDINAL of whom subsequently participated in the proceedings in ORG .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG notified , inter alia , the applicant that it did not find sufficient reason to give him permission to go through the court transcripts of testimonies which were given by other witnesses during the public sessions of the ORG as he was not assisted by a legal assistant .", "On DATE ORG report was finished and it was published on DATE . The report itself comprised a total of CARDINAL pages and the transcripts from the hearings comprised a total of CARDINAL pages . The report contained , inter alia , serious criticism of the applicant 's discharge of his official duties in his capacity as Minister of Justice in respect of the handling of the NORP refugees ' family reunification cases . It also contained criticism of the actions of other persons , including the Prime Minister at the time . On DATE the ORG resigned .", "On the basis of the report ORG decided on DATE to institute proceedings against the applicant before ORG ) pursuant to the provisions of ORG ( PERSON ) . By indictment of DATE the prosecutors , appointed by ORG , charged the applicant with a violation of LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of Act no . CARDINAL of DATE concerning ORG responsibilities whilst in office ( lov nr . CARDINAL af CARDINAL . DATE om ministres ansvarlighed - the DATE Act ) . According to this provision a minister is liable to punishment if he wilfully or by gross negligence disregards the duties which fall on him under LAW , or under other laws , or due to the nature of his office .", "The applicant was charged with having disregarded his duties under LAW ( GPE ) to the extent that a number of aliens could not obtain a family reunification although they had , under LAW , a right thereto .", "The case commenced in ORG on DATE . Whereas no one challenged the impartiality and independence of the individual judges the applicant challenged the impartiality and independence of the court as such , referred , inter alia , to LAW and requested the court to dismiss ( afvise ) the case . In order to substantiate the allegations the applicant furthermore requested the hearing of ORG judge who had presided over ORG , as well as a lawyer who had participated in that inquiry .", "As regards the hearing of the CARDINAL witnesses the court rejected the request by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL on DATE stating the following :", "( Translation )", "\" It appears from the public report which has been made by ORG in the NORP case how that court 's work was planned and carried out . To hear evidence in this respect must accordingly be regarded as superfluous .", "The defence has not challenged the impartiality of any of the participating ORG judges but has in the preliminary submissions regarding the dismissal of the case in particular referred to the fact that ORG was chaired by ORG judge and that its meetings were held in ORG offices to the extent that the public at large was left with the impression that ORG as such has in advance been involved in the case . When considering this objection the question of what communications ORG judge H might have had with colleagues in ORG about the NORP case or related questions can not be considered to be of any importance .", "Since the evidence concerning the connection advocate N might have had with the media during the period of time ORG was sitting can not be considered of importance for the question of dismissing the case either , these judges vote in favour of rejecting the request of calling ORG judge H and advocate N to submit evidence . \"", "The minority of CARDINAL judges did not find sufficient reason to reject the request .", "Following further oral arguments ORG decided on the question of dismissing the case on DATE . In rejecting the request for dismissal the unanimous court stated as follows :", "( Translation )", "\" The composition of ORG is set out in LAW . The provision that the court shall consist of an equal number of ORG judges and judges elected by ORG must be based on the assumption that the special cases which fall under the court 's competence ought to be delivered by a group of judges which comprises not only persons trained in law but also persons with special knowledge of political matters . Having regard to the fact that charges are brought by ORG it has been decided that members of ORG can not be elected to or act as members of ORG . The provision according to which members and the substitutes are elected for DATE in a proportionate way secures that members are not elected in order to participate in a particular case and that the elections reflect the ( political parties ' ) number of seats in ORG . It must be considered natural and legitimate that the persons , who are elected as members of the court , are associated with the political parties , but this does not mean , of course , that when deciding a case before the court they should be considered as \u2018 party men\u2019 who will rely more or less on what their political basis might think about the case . Against this background there is no substantiation in counsel 's submissions that the election by ORG of CARDINAL of the judges makes ORG \u2018 a delicate legal ORG and \u2018 which in advance makes it difficult for the court to appear independent and impartial in this ORG", "As regards the participating ORG judges counsel for the defence has submitted , among other things , that ORG in the NORP case was chaired by ORG judge who sat in the offices of ORG and that , therefore , the view was formed by the public at large that ORG as such was involved in the work of ORG . This view has no basis in fact , something [ the applicant ] must be aware of . Even assuming that this view might appear among the public this can not constitute a reason for finding that there can be any legitimate doubts as to the impartiality of the participating ORG judges . Nor does the fact that ORG , pursuant to LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG , examined certain appeals against decisions of a procedural character taken by ORG , or the fact that ORG was chaired by a colleague to the participating ORG judges , give any reasonable grounds for such doubts .", "The facts of the cases decided by ORG , which have been referred to by counsel for the defence , are in the court 's view quite different from those of the present case . Therefore , these decisions can not support counsel 's view either . It is noted in this respect that the requirement that a court shall appear to be impartial implies , according to the case - law of ORG , that there ought not to be any legitimate doubt as to the impartiality of the judges .", "The objections of a general character which counsel for the defence has raised against both the judges elected by ORG and the participating ORG judges can not in the circumstances , either as such or as a whole , constitute the basis for any legitimate doubts as to whether ORG fulfils the requirements of impartiality which a court is obliged to comply with according to LAW .", "ORG shall in its evaluation of whether [ the applicant ] is guilty of the charges brought against him only consider the evidence which is brought to the attention of the court . As a starting point it is accordingly of no importance for this case on what grounds ORG decided to press charges . The submissions of counsel for the defence , however , give the court reason to make the following remarks about ORG and its competence .", "According to its assignment ORG , inter alia , had to consider whether \u2018 anybody in public service or duty in connection with the proceedings has committed such faults or negligence which may result in an attempt to place legal responsibility.\u2019 Thus , ORG made an evaluation of evidence as well as legal evaluations , but ORG had no mandate to decide - and did not decide - whether [ the applicant ] committed a punishable offence . Accordingly , it did not have , and did not exercise , a judicial function in the sense provided for in LAW of the LAW . The assignment of ORG was accordingly not contrary to the prohibition in this provision against creating special courts with the power to exercise judicial functions . The reasons which have been decisive for ORG 's decision to press charges are of no importance for ORG decisions in this case . What has been submitted by counsel for the defence about the correlation between the legislative , the executive and the judicial powers in connection with the setting - up of ORG , or the criticism of a general character which has been directed against special courts or courts of inquiry ... are not of any importance in respect of the question of dismissing the present impeachment case either .", "As regards the inquiry 's importance as to the proceedings in this case , counsel for the defence has submitted that the possibility of a direct taking of evidence through the hearing of witnesses in ORG is lost or at least considerably reduced due to the fact that most of those persons who shall give evidence have done so previously in ORG . It is normal , however , and not contrary to the principle of direct evidence that a witness in a criminal case at an earlier stage has made statements to the police or in court . Like in other criminal cases , ORG must consider the weaknesses which may follow from this as an element in the evaluation of evidence .", "Counsel for the defence has , furthermore , submitted that the case has for DATE been mentioned and commented upon in the media to quite an extraordinary extent and in a way which was solely detrimental to [ the applicant ] so that he now appears to be convicted in advance . Even if the description of the media coverage is more or less correct there is no legitimate reason to believe that ORG can not disregard this and decide solely on the basis of the evidence before it .", "Accordingly , in respect of the objection related to other matters than the question of the impartiality of the court there is no legitimate reason either to doubt that [ the applicant ] will have a fair trial within the meaning of LAW .", "Finally , it is considered that counsel 's submissions that the case has not advanced within a reasonable time , cf . LAW , can not constitute the basis for dismissing the case .", "Consequently , the court finds no reason to accept the request for dismissal . \"", "Following the above decision the court resumed its examination of the case . On DATE a dispute arose between the prosecution and the defence as to the use of the transcripts from ORG when hearing witnesses in order to confront these witnesses , if necessary , with their previous statements .", "On DATE the court decided by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL to allow the use of these transcripts . In its decision the majority stated as follows :", "( Translation )", "\" The dispute concerns only whether the transcripts from ORG should be submitted and whether these transcripts may be used to confront ( witnesses with their previous statements ) . The transcripts do not contain ORG evaluations or conclusions but recall the statements [ the applicant ] and witnesses made before ORG as taken down by the judge and accepted by the witness . Permission to confront ( witnesses with these statements ) means only that [ the applicant ] and witnesses may be questioned about the differences should their statements during the trial deviate from their previous statements .", "According to normal practice in criminal cases both court transcripts containing statements from the accused and witnesses as well as police reports containing statements to the police are submitted . The submission is made pursuant to LAW which corresponds to LAW of LAW , and the submission is made despite the fact that these documents can not as a main rule be used as independent LAW evidence during the trial cf . LAW , subsection CARDINAL . CARDINAL and CARDINAL and subsection CARDINAL , of ORG . Thus , it is in accordance with normal practice in criminal cases that the transcripts from ORG are submitted during the trial in ORG DATE , second sentence , of LAW can not lead to any other result . Furthermore , it is noted that ORG transcripts are public . We do not find reason in these circumstances to accept the protests made by counsel for the defence .", "Sections CARDINAL and DATE , second sentence , of the Impeachment Act deal only with court transcripts concerning preliminary examinations arranged by ORG , but resemble otherwise mainly LAW , subsection CARDINAL . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of ORG . The question how ORG transcripts may be used during the trial in ORG shall thus be decided according to the rules contained in LAW and case - law related thereto , cf . the general reference to ORG in LAW of LAW .", "In accordance with normal practice in criminal cases both court transcripts and police reports may be used , where necessary , by the prosecution and the defence to confront ( witnesses with their previous statements ) . Such a use is not contrary to the principle that the case shall be determined only on the basis of the evidence which has been submitted during the trial . This is so since these confrontations do not replace the accused 's or the witness ' statements during the trial , but aim at giving the court a better basis upon which to evaluate the evidence in question . We consider , therefore , that ORG transcripts may be used in accordance with this practice .", "There is no reason to believe that the submission of the transcripts or their use for confrontation purposes would be contrary to the principles contained in the LAW . ... \"", "CARDINAL judges were against the use of the transcripts , stating as follows :", "( Translation )", "\" We find that it would be more in conformity with the principle of direct evidence that ORG transcripts are not submitted and that they are not in any way used during the trial in ORG . Thereby it will be secured that the statements will be made regardless of what happened in ORG , and that ORG thus appears - in accordance with the principles found in LAW to be wholly unbound of the work performed by ORG . Thus , we vote in favour of accepting the protest of counsel for the defence . \"", "The trial hereafter continued , written evidence was produced and the applicant and a total of CARDINAL witnesses - several of whom appear to have been called by the defence - were heard . On DATE the applicant suffered a stroke and the trial was adjourned . In order to evaluate the effect thereof several medical opinions as well as an opinion from ORG ( PERSON ) were obtained . On DATE the trial was adjourned until further notice . Following further medical examinations the prosecution requested , on DATE , that the case be resumed whereas counsel for the defence requested a further adjournment due to the applicant 's state of health .", "On DATE ORG decided to continue the case . A majority of CARDINAL judges stated as follows :", "( Translation )", "\" ...", "We find that [ the applicant 's ] physical state of health does not prevent him from being present during continuing proceedings .", "According to the explanations of the doctors there is no scientific basis for believing that his continuing presence increases the risk of a deterioration of his health .", "Hereafter , it must be examined whether his mental state excludes that the case continue ...", "As set out in ORG statement of CARDINAL DATE [ the applicant 's ] intellect is still to be considered as being reduced considerably although a certain improvement has occurred as regards acknowledging the illness and the function of speech . ORG has not , however , been willing to decide whether he is incapable of participating at a qualified level in a trial since the answer would depend on a legal evaluation of the medical information .", "According to practice in normal criminal cases a deterioration of mental functions does not exclude the conclusion of a criminal case and the imposition of a normal penalty on persons with an illness equivalent to that of [ the applicant ] . Being unaccountable for one 's actions due to a mental illness which has occurred subsequent to the criminal act but before judgment is pronounced does not as such exclude that a case may be concluded and a penalty imposed , cf . LAW of LAW .", "From LAW or its travaux pr\u00e9paratoires ... it does not appear that the legislature wished to deviate from this practice in cases concerning Ministers ' responsibilities whilst in office to the extent that such cases could not proceed unless the accused could participate at a ' qualified level ' .", "Before [ the applicant ] was hospitalised on DATE due to a stroke the major part of the taking of evidence had been concluded and he had been present during all court sessions . Thus , he had been heard during CARDINAL court sessions and he had attended all hearings of witnesses and all documentation of written material . The remaining taking of evidence consists , following the ORG request of the defence , of a re - examination of CARDINAL witnesses and of [ the applicant ] . This part of the trial may be conducted in a way that the necessary considerations are taken to his state of health .", "In these circumstances we find that in the existing medical information , compared with the other available information about [ the applicant 's ] situation following the stroke on DATE , there is no reason to believe that it will be impossible for him to take a stand as to the charges , to make rational statements as well as to follow the rest of the proceedings , and he can not be considered as being incapable of examining all relevant witness statements together with counsel prior to making statements . Furthermore , there is no reason to believe that a continuation of the trial would entail a breach of the guarantees LAW and LAW contain in order to secure an accused 's defence .", "...", "Since what counsel for the defence has submitted concerning LAW can not lead to any other result we vote in favour of the prosecution 's request to continue the case . \"", "A minority of CARDINAL judges voted in favour of rejecting the request stating as follows :", "", "( Translation )", "\" According to LAW of LAW , cf . LAW , an accused has a right to be present personally during the entire trial . The provision expresses that the accused has a right to defend himself , including putting questions to witnesses , express himself on the result of the taking of evidence , on legal questions and to have the last word in the case . These considerations are of particular importance in an impeachment case - cf . , inter alia , the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to LAW . [ The applicant 's ] counsel has maintained that a continuation of the trial requires his personal presence and since none of the circumstances mentioned in LAW , subsection CARDINAL , ... are at hand , this case may not be pursued if the accused has a valid excuse for being absent , cf . LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG . Under this falls - in addition to physical illness - in certain circumstances also mental illness in the form of a mental deterioration .", "...", "Since DATE a considerable number of court sessions have been held during which a considerable number of witnesses have been heard . During the continuing trial it remains to hear , once more , CARDINAL central witnesses and - not least - [ the applicant ] , and it must be considered to be of decisive importance to his possibilities of defending himself , that he is capable , during the reexaminations and during the oral pleadings , to understand and express himself about the charges and the substantial amount of evidence . According to the existing medical information [ the applicant 's ] intellect is permanently impaired to a considerable extent , caused by vascular related dementia with the result that , in our opinion , he would be unable to participate in the proceedings at a qualified level , having regard to the special character and dimension of the case and , thus , the requirements to his intellectual level which concluding the case in a responsible manner demands . A continuing adjournment of the trial would not entail that [ the applicant ] is better placed than other accused , including accused who are covered by the rules in Sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Penal Code covering sanctions against mentally deviating offenders . ... Also these accused are protected by the guarantee of a fair trial which Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL express .", "Therefore , we find that what the prosecution has submitted concerning the continuation of the case does not constitute a basis for setting aside the court 's previous decision to adjourn the case until further notice , since [ the applicant 's ] state of health still entails that he has a valid excuse for being absent .
