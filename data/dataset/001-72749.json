During the preliminary investigation , the CARDINAL co - defendants gave statements to the public prosecutor to the effect that the applicant , who at the time had been the manager of a private company , had ordered and funded ORG 's murder for reasons of personal revenge . According to ORG , the applicant had first given him MONEY ( ORG ) as payment for carrying out the murder and later comparable sums to enable him to flee the country . On DATE ORG 's girlfriend , who was questioned as a witness , said that she had overheard a conversation between her boyfriend and ORG in which both men had referred to GPE as having perpetrated the murder .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the prosecutor in charge of the case requested ORG to extend the applicant 's detention on remand until DATE on the ground that a number of investigative measures , specified by the prosecutor , still needed to be carried out . The measures involved preparing expert reports on the physical evidence gathered at the applicant 's home and office and on her state of health , organising CARDINAL confrontations with the defendants , questioning CARDINAL further witnesses and requesting relevant information from ORG 's ORG .

However , the fields for the date , the judge 's name and the lawyer 's name had been left blank , and the relevant information ( given in italics above ) had been added by hand .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the order before ORG . In her memorial she submitted that the first - instance judge had omitted to conduct a thorough examination of all the evidence in the file before issuing the order . The applicant further argued that the seriousness of the offence was not sufficient in itself to warrant extending her detention and that there was nothing in the case file to suggest that she intended to evade investigation or commit further offences . In that connection she stressed that she had left the country several times since the murder and had always returned to GPE ; this proved that she had no intention of absconding or obstructing the investigation .", "CARDINAL . By an order dated DATE , issued following a hearing attended by the applicant and her lawyer , ORG dismissed the appeal in the following terms :", "\u201c ... Having taken cognisance of the evidence in the case file and heard evidence from the parties , the ORG concludes that there are plausible reasons to believe that , if PERSON remains at liberty , there is a danger that she will evade investigation and trial and hinder the determination of the truth in this case .

In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant provided the public prosecutor 's office with detailed information concerning the sums of money she had paid to ORG since DATE . On DATE she sent further information to ORG , stating that PERSON had harassed her and extorted large sums of money from her ; accordingly , she requested that a separate criminal investigation be opened into the alleged extortion and that she be acquitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor 's office requested ORG to extend the applicant 's detention on remand until DATE . In support of its request , it referred to the need to organise CARDINAL further confrontations , question CARDINAL further witnesses , study the new statements made by the applicant alleging that ORG had extorted funds from her , examine and analyse the evidence obtained from abroad as a result of international judicial cooperation , examine certain items of physical evidence and order a psychologist 's expert report on the defendants ORG", "CARDINAL . By an order dated DATE , the relevant judge granted the public prosecutor 's request . The wording and layout ( font , positioning of the text and line spacing ) exactly matched those of the order of DATE . Only the date , the judge 's name , his signature and the length of detention were different . The field for the lawyer 's name , meanwhile , had been left blank .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this order before ORG which , in an order issued on DATE following inter partes proceedings , dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the applicant \u201c [ was ] accused of a particularly serious crime [ and ] ha[d ] pleaded not guilty ; that the crime in question [ had been ] committed by an organised group ; that there [ were ] good grounds for suspecting that she might attempt to hinder the determination of the truth in the case \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG alleging that the public prosecutor \u201c ha[d ] , without any justification , disregarded the comments and oral suggestions from the defence concerning the procedural aspects of the case \u201d . According to the applicant , her lawyer had made oral requests for permission to consult the investigation file . ORG did not reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor requested a further extension of the applicant 's detention , this time until DATE . The reasons given were essentially the same as those cited in the request of CARDINAL September CARDINAL , the only differences were the number of witnesses to be questioned ( CARDINAL ) , and a reference to the need to carry out biological tests , in particular DNA tests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge ordered the applicant 's continued detention until DATE . This order was drawn up in the same manner as those of DATE and DATE , with the date and the lawyer 's name having been added by hand . The judge 's name had first been typed but had then been crossed out with a ballpoint pen , and the stamp of another judge had been added beside it ; the order had been signed by the second judge .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged a fresh appeal with ORG . In her memorial she submitted that the proceedings leading to adoption of the document in question had constituted a serious breach of the former LAW kodekss \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , which was in force at the time . In that connection the applicant observed that all the orders issued by the court of first instance , by CARDINAL different judges , had been absolutely identical , even in the way they were worded . She inferred from this that the judges had merely signed the draft orders prepared in advance by the prosecutor . In the applicant 's view , this theory was borne out by the fact that the most recent decision had been taken in camera in the judge 's office ; the judge had allowed the applicant 's lawyer into the room only after he had spent TIME alone with the prosecutor . Consequently , the lawyer had not even been able to hear the prosecutor 's observations , the defence having been present only when the judge had signed the draft decision , which had been prepared in advance . The applicant also reiterated her previous arguments against her continued detention .", "CARDINAL . By an order made on DATE after inter partes proceedings , similar to the order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal and upheld the impugned order , observing that the murder in question had been committed by a group of persons and that the applicant had pleaded not guilty . In court , the applicant 's lawyer was invited to speak first . However , despite repeated requests on his part , the judge did not permit him to reply to the prosecutor 's observations . ORG also did not reply to the applicant 's arguments based on LAW as interpreted by certain judgments of ORG , declining to take cognisance of the copies of the relevant judgments or to add them to the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a second complaint with ORG , alleging a series of procedural irregularities , in particular the refusal of the relevant prosecutor to grant defence counsel access to the file . In a letter dated DATE , ORG rejected this complaint on the ground that the requests supposedly made by the defence did not feature in any official record ; the letter added that a copy of the entire file would be sent to the applicant once the investigation had been completed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor 's office attempted to obtain information concerning the transfers of funds between the applicant and the murder victim . To that end it made enquiries of CARDINAL NORP banks ; none had accounts under the names in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor 's office applied for a further extension of the applicant 's detention on the ground that she had made further statements in the meantime to the effect that ORG , one of the suspected perpetrators of the murder , had raped her and then subjected her to pressure . The prosecution further cited the need to carry out the same investigative measures referred to in its previous requests , the only difference being the number of witnesses to be questioned ( CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE , ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . Again , the order was virtually identical to the previous orders issued by the same court , apart from a few details concerning the names of the judge , the prosecutors and the lawyer . This time the whole order had been typed and no additions or corrections had been made by hand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , complaining in particular of the refusal of the public prosecutor 's office and the court to allow her lawyer access to the documents in the investigation file on which her continued detention had been based . On DATE the court dismissed her appeal in an order which was to all intents and purposes identical to those of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL October CARDINAL . In addition to the seriousness of the crime , this order also cited as a reason the risk that the applicant might abscond or evade justice .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG , CARDINAL of the applicant 's co - defendants , had been released and placed under police surveillance ( nodo\u0161ana policijas uzraudz\u012bb\u0101 ) . In addition , on DATE , the public prosecutor 's office drew up a fresh charge against the applicant , charging her with commercial corruption within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL orders dated DATE and DATE , ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE and DATE respectively . In both cases the court was ruling on requests from the public prosecutor 's office based on the necessity of carrying out a number of additional investigative measures . As in its previous requests , the prosecutor 's office cited the need to question further witnesses ( CARDINAL ) . However , it laid particular emphasis on the need to send the documents in the file to the applicant , her co - defendants and their lawyers , to prepare the final indictment and to prepare the case for trial .", "The layout of the CARDINAL orders was again identical to all the previous orders given by the same court in the instant case . Although the order of DATE , having been typed entirely on a computer , differed in appearance from the other orders , it was identical to them in content .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged appeals with ORG , complaining in particular of the refusal by the public prosecutor 's office and the court to allow her lawyer access to the documents in the investigation file on which her continued detention had been based .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeals and upheld the impugned orders . All the decisions of ORG were drafted in terms virtually identical to the orders of DATE and DATE . Only the decision of CARDINAL DATE specified that the applicant 's continued detention was justified on account of her personality and that the first - instance court had had legitimate grounds to fear a risk of collusion , since the applicant had made the arrangements for her co - defendants to flee the country .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor 's office concluded the investigation and sent copies of the documents in the file to the applicant . On DATE the applicant began studying the file , which comprised CARDINAL volumes .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant complained to ORG about the attitude of the prosecutor handling her case , who had sent her only a few documents at a time and at long intervals . In letters of DATE and DATE , ORG rejected her complaints without giving any reasons .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the latest order for the applicant 's detention expired . However , as she had begun studying the documents in the investigation file , her release was \u201c suspended \u201d in accordance with the fifth paragraph of LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She therefore remained in detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant finished studying the documents in the file . On DATE she requested the public prosecutor 's office to question a number of persons who had allegedly seen her in a GPE hotel DATE after PERSON 's murder . The request was rejected for failure to give reasons ; the prosecutor 's office took the view that the defence had not made sufficiently clear how the evidence of the persons concerned could establish the applicant 's innocence or contribute any new evidence to her file .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's co - defendants , ORG , GPE and ORG , finished studying the file on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . On DATE the prosecutor dealing with the case informed the applicant that all the parties had now taken cognisance of the file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor signed the final indictment ( aps\u016bdz\u012bbas raksts ) against the applicant and her CARDINAL co - defendants . The file was subsequently sent to the trial court , in this case ORG . On DATE the relevant judge of ORG found that there was sufficient evidence in the file and decided to commit the applicant for trial ( l\u0113mums par aps\u016bdz\u0113t\u0101s nodo\u0161anu tiesai ) . As to the preventive measure applied to the applicant , the judge decided to extend it , without , however , giving any reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the same judge requesting that she be released . She asked him to convene , if necessary , a preparatory hearing ( r\u012bc\u012bbas s\u0113de ) to examine whether her detention was justified . In a letter of DATE , the judge rejected the request , reminding the applicant that she stood accused of a crime punishable by life imprisonment , and that the preventive measure reflected the seriousness of the offence and her personality . The judge further stated that there were \u201c no grounds \u201d for convening a preparatory hearing . Lastly , he observed that the applicant would have an opportunity to reiterate her request for release at the hearing on the merits of her case , and informed her that the hearing had been set down for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the President of ORG to review the merits of her detention and to take steps to expedite the consideration of her case , arguing in particular that a prolonged term of detention was in breach of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW . In a letter of DATE , the President replied that ORG did not have jurisdiction to review procedural decisions taken by the lower court in charge of a case . As to the timetable for consideration of the case , the President said that it was impossible to speed it up . He observed that \u201c [ c]riticism of , or requests made to , the court concerning its hearing of the case ' within a reasonable time ' [ were ] of no relevance whatsoever , as the court work[ed ] with the resources allocated to it by the ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the date initially set for the first hearing , consideration of the merits of the case began on DATE . The applicant pleaded not guilty in court .", "On DATE the prosecution addressed the court . On DATE , it was the turn of the defence .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty of organising the murder . However , it considered that no intention to kill on the part of the applicant and CARDINAL of her co - defendants had been established ; accordingly , they were found guilty of manslaughter .", "GPE , meanwhile , was found guilty of murder and illegally possessing a knife . The court also found it established that , after GPE and GPE had been arrested , the applicant had paid the other CARDINAL co - defendants substantial sums to enable them to flee the country . Finally , the court considered that the applicant 's guilt on the charge of commercial corruption had been sufficiently established .", "Consequently , ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment . Her co - defendants also received long prison sentences : DATE in the case of GPE , DATE in the case of ORG and DATE in the case of ORG received a suspended sentence of DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her co - defendants lodged an appeal against this judgment with ORG . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the applicant 's conviction for manslaughter . However , it acquitted her on the charge of commercial corruption and reduced her overall sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law with the ORG of ORG . In a final judgment of DATE , the ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal and those of her co - defendants .", "...", "CARDINAL . The former Code of Criminal Procedure ( ORG ) , a legacy of the NORP era which was amended on numerous occasions , was applicable at the material time . It remained in force until DATE , when it was replaced by the new LAW ( GPE likums ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of LAW of the ORG , a preventive measure could be applied where plausible reasons existed to suspect that the accused would seek to evade investigation or hinder the determination of the truth in the case . CARDINAL types of preventive measure existed : an undertaking not to change one 's residence , personal guarantees , financial guarantees , police surveillance , house arrest , detention in prison and CARDINAL measures specifically applicable to minors and members of the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the ORG , a preventive measure had to be chosen and implemented on the basis of the following criteria : the seriousness of the alleged offence ; the personality of the accused ; the likelihood that he or she would seek to evade investigation and hinder the determination of the truth in the case ; and the accused 's occupation , age , domestic circumstances and health and other relevant criteria . Any preventive measure had to be applied on the basis of an order giving sufficient reasons .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of LAW of the ORG , a period of detention on remand could be ordered only by a judge and only in respect of a person accused of an offence punishable by imprisonment . The detention order was to be issued following adversarial examination of the evidence submitted by the prosecution service or the police ; the presence of the accused was in principle compulsory .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the principles governing the length of detention on remand and the system of appeal were fundamentally different for the preliminary investigation stage ( pirmstiesas izmekl\u0113\u0161ana ) and the judicial stage ( izties\u0101\u0161ana ) of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . At the preliminary investigation stage ( comprising the police investigation and preparation of the case file ) , the initial period of detention on remand could not exceed DATE ( LAW . However , where it was not possible to complete the preliminary investigation and commit the accused for trial within that time , and where \u201c there [ were ] no grounds for amending the preventive measure \u201d , the prosecutor could request the judge to extend the term of detention . In such cases , evidence was heard from the accused and his or her lawyer \u201c if necessary \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Law of DATE ( in force since DATE ) amended the second paragraph of LAW by setting a DATE limit on each successive extension of the term of detention . The detained person could appeal against an order extending his or her detention by means of an appeal before a higher court , which had to consider the appeal within DATE of receiving it . After hearing evidence from the detained person and the public prosecutor 's office , the higher court took a decision by means of a final order ( LAW ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . At this stage in the proceedings , the total length of detention on remand could in no circumstances exceed DATE . If , after DATE had elapsed , the case had still not been sent for trial , the accused person had to be released .", "CARDINAL . The fifth paragraph of LAW ORG read as follows :", "\u201c On completion of the investigation , and before the maximum statutory period has elapsed , the documents in the file must be sent immediately to the accused and his or her counsel so that they may familiarise themselves with it . The time spent by all the accused in familiarising themselves with the documents in the file shall not be taken into account in calculating the period of detention on remand ... \u201d", "In practice , the prosecuting authorities and the courts interpreted the second sentence of this provision as authorising the continued detention of the accused person throughout the time during which he or she and any co - accused were studying the file , even if the validity of the last detention order given by the judge had expired .", "CARDINAL . After drawing up and signing the final indictment , the public prosecutor 's office had to forward the file to the trial court ( Articles CARDINAL of the ORG ) . Within DATE of receiving the file , the trial court , without ruling on the accused 's guilt , had to decide whether the file provided a sufficient basis for committing the accused for trial , or whether the case should be referred back for further information or no further action should be taken .", "As a rule , the order committing the accused for trial ( l\u0113mums par aps\u016bdz\u0113t\u0101 nodo\u0161anu tiesai ) was given by a single judge ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , who also had to rule on whether the preventive measure in place should be extended , amended or lifted . Where the judge considered that the preventive measure was justified , he confirmed it by means of a final decision . If , on the other hand , he had doubts as to the lawfulness of the measure or its justification , he convened a preparatory hearing ( r\u012bc\u012bbas s\u0113de ) to examine the issue . The order given following the preparatory hearing was amenable to appeal before a higher court .", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of LAW ORG , \u201c consideration of the case at a hearing [ had to ] begin not DATE or , in exceptional cases , DATE from the date on which the court receive[d ] the file \u201d . However , this provision , which was a legacy from the NORP era and had never been amended , was very rarely complied with by the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . In principle , once the order for the accused person 's continued detention had been given , the decision remained in force throughout the proceedings at first instance . In other words , before DATE , there was no limit on the length of detention on remand at this stage in the proceedings . The PERSON of DATE , which came into force on DATE and amended LAW ORG , set a limit of DATE and DATE on the period of detention , which ran from the time the trial court received the investigation file until delivery of the judgment at first instance . Once this time - limit had been exceeded , the detained person had to be released immediately .", "Originally , however , if the case concerned \u201c particularly serious crimes involving violence or the threat of violence \u201d , the ORG of ORG could extend the term of detention beyond the maximum period . Following a Constitutional Court judgment of DATE which found part of this provision to be in breach of the LAW , ORG amended it by means of a LAW DATE which guaranteed the person concerned the right to submit his or her observations on an exceptional extension of this kind , and set out the individual 's procedural rights .", "CARDINAL . In practice , although the legislation contained no express provision enabling accused persons to appeal against detention at this stage , the courts considered all applications for release made by detainees . The response generally took the form of a simple letter , against which no appeal was possible . However , in more complex cases the court gave its decision in the form of an order ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . A Law amending Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG , which came into force on DATE , introduced a right of appeal against orders imposing preventive measures at the judicial stage of the proceedings . However , the PERSON related only to the period after adversarial examination of the case had begun . Moreover , the right to appeal was subject to the condition that examination of the case had been adjourned for a minimum period of DATE . The appeal had to be lodged within DATE of the order being served and the court was required to consider it within DATE of receiving it .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the third paragraph in fine of Article CARDINAL stipulated that the accused could reiterate his or her request for release at the hearing on the merits .", "CARDINAL .
