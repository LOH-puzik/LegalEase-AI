The witness was deputy governor of the province of \u015e\u0131rnak at the material time . On behalf of the governor , he had chaired ORG , which on DATE had issued a decision not to prosecute the security police officers .", "CARDINAL", "DATE . The witness was a detective sergeant in the police 's investigation department , and was the investigating officer in the instant case . He acknowledged that the governor 's letter of CARDINAL DATE setting out the allegations made by PERSON and a member of ORG had been the main document relied on in the investigation . While conducting the investigation , he had had no knowledge of the complaint lodged by PERSON with the public prosecutor 's office on DATE , which mentioned the names of the people who had said that they had seen PERSON while in police custody . The witness said that he had not been informed that CARDINAL of the witnesses , PERSON , had previously told the PERSON provincial governor that he had seen PERSON while he had been detained in custody at the police headquarters . He acknowledged that if he had been given that information , he would have held a further hearing in order to clarify the facts , in view of the discrepancies between the various statements .", "CARDINAL . The witness stated that , in letters sent to the \u015e\u0131rnak police on CARDINAL and DATE and DATE , he had requested a warrant to interview PERSON . According to a report drawn up by the \u015e\u0131rnak police and signed by CARDINAL officers , including PERSON and the local councillor PERSON , PERSON had moved to Silopi and the authorities had been unable to find his address . The investigating officer had not asked the other witnesses with the same surname whether they knew where PERSON now lived . The witness emphasised that he might have been assisted in his inquiries if he had been able to interview the complainant at the start of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The witness said that he had visited the scene of the incidents and had interviewed the witnesses in a room at \u015e\u0131rnak police headquarters . The local police had collected the witnesses from their homes and taken them to him ; they had given evidence on oath . He explained that he had not contacted the public prosecutor during the investigation , which he had carried out solely on the basis of the file which had been forwarded to him .", "CARDINAL . The following witnesses were also summoned by ORG but did not appear : PERSON , the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor , who issued the order of DATE ruling that he did not have jurisdiction ratione materiae ; and PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who lived in the same district as the applicant and had told him that they had seen PERSON while they were in police custody .", "CARDINAL . The Commission approached its task in the absence of any findings of fact made by domestic courts and of any thorough judicial examination or other independent investigation of the events in question . In so proceeding , it assessed the written and oral evidence before it , having regard , inter alia , to the conduct of the witnesses who were heard by the delegates at the hearing in GPE and to the need to take into account when reaching its conclusions the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . Its findings may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that it was not disputed that clashes had taken place in \u015e\u0131rnak DATE . It noted in that connection that PERSON , head of the police anti - terrorist branch 's interrogation and intelligence squad , had stated that the incidents had begun on DATE . The evidence adduced from the documents and oral testimony was mostly consistent as regards the operations conducted in response to the incidents that had occurred during that period . After the incidents , the security forces \u2013 comprising police officers and gendarmes \u2013 carried out a search in the town , arresting CARDINAL people , including LOC , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , GPE Olcan , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . Some of those arrested were taken to the gendarmerie station , while others were detained at the police headquarters . Identity checks were carried out at the entrance to the town , and persons suspected of terrorist acts were taken directly to the police headquarters by the \u201c rapid intervention force \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON arrest , the ORG found that the oral evidence given to the delegates by PERSON was consistent with the applicant 's allegations . It noted in that connection that PERSON had confirmed that at the checkpoint police officers in blue uniforms had stopped the taxi in which he and the others had been sitting and , after checking their identity papers , had taken PERSON away with them . Having examined the investigation file and the oral testimony given by the investigating officer PERSON to its delegates , the Commission found that PERSON , in his statement of CARDINAL DATE to the investigating officer , had said that the police officers had returned the men 's identity papers after checking them and that PERSON had gone off to the shops . PERSON made a statement to the same effect on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that it was clear from the documents in the file prepared by the investigating officer that PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON had been summoned by the police to \u015e\u0131rnak police headquarters and had made statements to the investigating officer in the presence of a police officer , who had taken down the statements in writing . In that connection , the Commission was struck by the fact that the statements by PERSON and PERSON were drafted in a stereotypical form and were generally very similar in content . It noted that the police officers interviewed by the delegates had stated that checks had been carried out by the security forces at the checkpoint , as PERSON had related . With regard to the colour of the police officers ' uniform , PERSON had stated that officers from the \u201c rapid intervention force \u201d had been posted at the checkpoint , and had emphasised that at the material time they had worn green uniforms . Without mentioning an exact date , he had added that those officers now wore blue uniforms .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that the police officers who gave evidence to the delegates had acknowledged that , following incidents in which CARDINAL police officers and QUANTITY soldiers had been killed , several teams of security forces personnel had made arrests in the town . CARDINAL people had been taken into police custody , and the atmosphere had been chaotic . PERSON had stated that officers from the \u201c rapid intervention force \u201d carried out checks at the entrance to the town and did not take suspects directly to the police headquarters . He had added that separate registers were kept at the police headquarters . However , the Commission observed that later in his statement PERSON had admitted that people arrested during identity checks by the officers in question had been taken directly to the police headquarters .", "CARDINAL . As for the way the custody registers were kept , they did not include PERSON name and PERSON was unable to offer any explanation as to why not . The Commission observed that that witness 's statements on the matter had lacked precision and clarity . It also noted that the Government had not produced copies of the registers kept by the squad and the regional gendarmerie , despite being expressly requested to do so .", "CARDINAL . NORP PERSON had said that on DATE or DATE had been taken into the same detention room in which he himself was being held and that he had spent DATE in his company . PERSON had given a detailed description of the circumstances in which they had been held at the police headquarters and the conversation he had had with PERSON . The details given by PERSON \u2013 particularly the fact that the detainees had been blindfolded during their time in custody , and his account of the detention room and its location DATE were consistent with the version of the facts given by PERSON . Abdurrahim PERSON 's statement corroborated the evidence given to the delegates by the applicant and his son PERSON . ORG also noted that PERSON had emphasised that he had given evidence to the public prosecutor , to whom he had set out the same version of the facts as given to the delegates , and that he had signed his statement . It regretted that the statement had not been among the documents in the file prepared by the investigating officer .", "CARDINAL . The \u015e\u0131rnak provincial governor at the material time , PERSON , had acknowledged in his oral statement that the applicant had come to see him several times with allegations that his son PERSON had disappeared after being taken into police custody , and that he had heard an eyewitness confirm that he had seen PERSON at the police headquarters . The Commission noted that PERSON statement , obtained by the investigating officer , contradicted the applicant 's version of events and the evidence he had given to the provincial governor . Pointing out that the governor , believing the eyewitness 's evidence to be sufficiently credible , had requested inquiries to be carried out into the matter , it favoured the version given to the delegates by the applicant and PERSON with regard to PERSON allegations . It concluded that the fact that PERSON name did not appear in the police headquarters ' custody register did not in itself prove that he had not been taken into police custody , and accepted the evidence given by PERSON , the applicant , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , which the delegates had found to be credible and convincing .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that a lawyer , PERSON , named as an eyewitness in the complaint lodged by the applicant with the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor 's office on DATE , had stated in his oral testimony to the delegates that on CARDINAL or DATE PERSON had been brought into the room in which he himself was being held . PERSON had mentioned the names of several other people detained in the room . The names were listed in the custody registers kept by the anti - terrorist branch of the security police . PERSON had given a detailed description of the circumstances in which he and others had been arrested , and of the conditions during their time in custody . He had pointed out that , further to the criminal complaint lodged by PERSON , he himself had been interviewed by the ORG public prosecutor and , in his statement , had mentioned the names of some of those detained at the same location . With regard to the conditions in which they had been detained , he had given a detailed description of the treatment which they had allegedly suffered while being interrogated : they had been stripped , hung up , severely beaten and sprayed with cold water . He had stated that , on CARDINAL occasion , he and CARDINAL or CARDINAL other detainees had been taken to the \u201c torture room \u201d together . CARDINAL of them had been PERSON , who , like him , had been stripped and hung up . As far as PERSON could tell , his own ill - treatment had lasted for TIME , while PERSON had not been brought back until TIME . PERSON had made the following statement : \u201c When PERSON was brought back to the cell he was unable to speak ; he was dead \u2013 that is to say , he had become stiff . I am PERCENT certain that he was dead . TIME they dragged him out by the legs . CARDINAL of his shoes was left behind in the cell . We never saw him again . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Commission regretted that the Government had not produced the file of the investigation opened by the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor 's office further to the applicant 's criminal complaint of CARDINAL DATE and that the public prosecutor PERSON had not appeared before the delegates . It was clear from the material in the file prepared by the investigating officer PERSON that the latter had not interviewed PERSON as an eyewitness .", "CARDINAL . The Commission observed that all PERSON descriptions of where the detainees were held and interrogated corroborated the version given by PERSON , who had also admitted that there had been a chaotic atmosphere around the time of the incidents of DATE and that CARDINAL of people had been taken into police custody . The ORG further noted that when interviewed by the delegates the \u015e\u0131rnak provincial governor had acknowledged that he had met in his office persons who had alleged that they had seen PERSON while in police custody . In particular , he admitted that he had interviewed an eyewitness .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that PERSON had given precise , detailed replies to all the questions put by the delegates and the representatives of the parties , particularly with regard to the ill - treatment suffered during the interrogation sessions , and that he had stated categorically on several occasions that PERSON had been dead when he was \u201c thrown \u201d into the cell . It accordingly found his statement that he had seen PERSON \u201c dead \u201d at the police headquarters to be plausible .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that the applicant had made representations and put questions to the \u015e\u0131rnak public prosecutor and provincial governor in connection with PERSON disappearance . Regarding the independence of the bodies which , following the PERSON provincial governor 's written request of CARDINAL DATE to the national police headquarters , carried out the preliminary inquiries culminating in a decision not to prosecute , the ORG observed that they had comprised an investigating officer and members of ORG . The investigating officer had been a detective sergeant belonging to the same administrative hierarchy as the members of the security forces in respect of whom he was carrying out his investigation . ORG , which , on a proposal from the investigating officer , had decided to discontinue the proceedings , had been chaired by the deputy provincial governor and made up of senior provincial officials DATE that is to say , the directors or deputy directors of the central authorities ' various departments . The senior officials had been under the authority of the provincial governor , who had at the same time been liable , from a legal standpoint , for the acts committed by the security forces personnel implicated in the case . The detective sergeant appointed as investigating officer and the members of ORG had therefore not provided the outward signs of independence , the guarantees of irremoveability and the legal safeguards that might have protected them against pressure from their superiors .", "CARDINAL . The Commission observed that the investigating officer had questioned CARDINAL witnesses in a room at \u015e\u0131rnak police headquarters . It noted in that connection that the local police had collected the witnesses from their homes and taken them to the police headquarters . In the statements thus obtained , the witnesses had completely denied the applicant 's allegations . ORG also found that the statements were drafted in a stereotypical form and were generally very similar in content . It noted that the investigating officer had not interviewed the applicant and observed in that connection that the police had drawn up a memorandum stating that PERSON had left his home and had probably gone to Silopi . It was clear from the facts that the eyewitnesses who might have been able to provide relevant information for the investigation had been referred to in the complaint which the applicant had lodged with the public prosecutor 's office on DATE . However , the administrative bodies responsible for the investigation had not made any request to interview those witnesses , even though the testimony of CARDINAL of them \u2013 PERSON \u2013 had been in complete contradiction to the statements he had made to the provincial governor , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Government have not submitted in their memorial any details on domestic legal provisions which have a bearing on the circumstances of this case . The ORG accordingly refers to the overview of domestic law set out in other judgments , in particular the PERSON v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL , pp .

This provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war . The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration , whose liability is of an absolute , objective nature , based on the theory of \u201c social risk \u201d . Thus , the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the ORG may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety , or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts , whose proceedings are in writing .", "CARDINAL .
