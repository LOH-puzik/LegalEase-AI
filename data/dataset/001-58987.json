The PERSON public prosecutors PERSON and PERSON gave evidence in relation to their investigation of the applicant \u2019s allegations , which respective accounts ORG considered credible . The Delegates were , however , not convinced by their evidence that they had never , or only once , been confronted with allegations that security forces had damaged private property .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the oral evidence , the ORG was aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters . It therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements made by witnesses appearing before its delegates .", "In a case where there were contradictory and conflicting factual accounts of events , the Commission particularly regretted the absence of a thorough domestic judicial examination . It was aware of its own limitations as a first - instance tribunal of fact . In addition to the problem of language adverted to above , there was also an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the conditions pertaining in the region . The Commission \u2019s findings may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , gendarme forces regularly patrolled ORG and its hamlets . On CARDINAL and DATE and on DATE , more important gendarme operations took place in GPE and/or GPE . Although \u2013 apart from the gendarme operation carried out on DATE the documents submitted in relation to activities by the gendarmes of the ORG station did not explicitly mention GPE , the ORG considered it likely , on the basis of the testimony given by the witnesses , that when an important gendarme operation took place in the main village of ORG involving gendarmes from other stations than ORG , such an operation also embraced the GPE hamlet attached to ORG .", "DATE . The Commission accepted that the inconsistencies in the evidence submitted as to the date or dates on which the belongings of the applicant and other villagers had allegedly been damaged by security forces could be explained by the regularity of gendarme village patrols and more important operations during the relevant period and by witnesses\u2019 problems in recalling events having taken place DATE . Noting the Delegates\u2019 impressions of the witnesses heard , it did not find that this materially undermined the credibility and reliability of the applicant and the other villager witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the evidence submitted , the ORG found it established that on DATE gendarme forces from ORG and PERSON had apprehended a number of persons from GPE and GPE and that , on or around that date , gendarme forces from ORG and PERSON had damaged the fittings , furniture and household goods in the applicant \u2019s home , including a refrigerator , television , cassette player , washing machine , kitchenware , stove , household goods , furniture , bedding , curtains , doors and windows . It further accepted that on or around CARDINAL DATE , and in any event in DATE , the applicant \u2019s tobacco produce had been burned by gendarmes .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the evidence before it , the ORG further found no grounds for doubting the veracity of the evidence given that on or around DATE , and in any event in the DATE , gendarme forces from ORG and PERSON were responsible for the deliberate burning of the applicant \u2019s house , thus forcing him and his family to leave GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government submitted a number of further documents not submitted previously . These included various judgments of NORP administrative courts in unrelated cases in which compensation was granted to individuals for damage incurred as a result of acts of terrorism .
