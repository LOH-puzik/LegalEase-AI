A number of ministerial orders were issued on DATE allocating reference quantities for milk purchases ( i.e. the quantities in excess of which an additional levy would be payable ) to the CARDINAL milk purchasers in LOC , that is to say the dairies purchasing milk from producers - including the applicant association ; the quantities were based on the figures for milk collected in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant association and CARDINAL other milk purchasers appealed to ORG of the ORG d'Etat against the decisions fixing the reference quantities . In accordance with LAW establishing ORG ( \" the ORG treaty \" ) , that court referred a number of questions to ORG of ORG ( \" the Court of Justice \" ) for a preliminary ruling , which was given in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the light of the answers given by ORG , the PERSON d'Etat held , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , that the choice of DATE as DATE had led to discrimination between purchasers , contrary to Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the ORG treaty . The impugned decisions were accordingly set aside and the case was referred to the Minister of ORG for a fairer apportionment of the reference quantities among the CARDINAL dairies in GPE by means of a grand - ducal regulation .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the Minister of ORG submitted a new draft grand - ducal regulation under which the reference quantities were to be allocated to the CARDINAL milk purchasers on the basis of the milk deliveries made to them in DATE . In order to meet GPE 's obligations under Community law , it was proposed in the draft regulation to make the new reference quantity system applicable not only in the future but also retrospectively to previous milk - production years , with effect from DATE . The draft regulation was submitted to the ORG d'Etat for an opinion .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the President of the ORG d'Etat drew the Prime Minister 's attention to the fact that such rules could be given retrospective effect only through legislation and not by means of a regulation .", "CARDINAL .

ORG On DATE CARDINAL PERSON applied to ORG of the ORG d'Etat for judicial review of each of those CARDINAL orders on the grounds that they adversely affected the association and its suppliers because its reference quantities for the milk - production years in question were too low . In its pleadings , in addition to raising a number of grounds of appeal alleging the unlawfulness of the Grand - Ducal Regulation of DATE and breaches of several of its provisions , the applicant association criticised its retrospective application to milk - production years before the CARDINAL which had begun on DATE . In the alternative , it asked ORG to refer a number of questions to ORG for preliminary rulings , including CARDINAL concerning the principle of non - retrospective application .", "CARDINAL . ORG In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applications in the following terms :", "\" While it is true that as a general rule a statute makes provision only for the future , it is open to the legislature to give retrospective effect to a statute , in so far as this is not prohibited under LAW . GPE was required to fill the legal vacuum created by ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE quashing the regulation , otherwise it would have been in breach of its binding obligations under LAW .", "Under LAW of that treaty , Community regulations are directly applicable . Consequently , GPE was obliged to legislate on the matter of milk levies for the periods from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , and only ORG , which had the approval of the ORG authorities , had the power to do so .", "At all events , the penalties attaching to any failure on the part of purchasers to comply with the quantities during the first , second and third periods are no higher than those which would have been payable under the previous legislation . The difference , amounting to MONEY ] , is to be borne by the ORG , with the agreement of the ORG authorities , so that the retrospective effect of the milk quantities , far from causing the applicant association prejudice , is in fact beneficial to it .", "A plea of unlawfulness can not succeed against a statute and this ground must accordingly fail ... \"", "CARDINAL of the CARDINAL members of ORG had previously taken part in drawing up the PERSON d'Etat 's opinion on the draft regulation and in framing the bill in issue .", "CARDINAL .
