NORP The report reviewed the evidence in the file . It stated that an autopsy had been performed on the body exhumed on DATE and an autopsy report issued on DATE . That report indicated that the body was in an advanced state of putrefaction . The soft tissue in the head area had entirely disappeared ; the radioscopy did not reveal any particular features in the skeletal system or any foreign metal objects ; no lesions were found on the skull ; QUANTITY lesions were observed from the previous autopsy ; the facial bones and teeth were intact ; despite the putrefied and shrunken appearance of the heart , it could be seen that the ventricles had not been opened ; advanced putrefaction made it impossible to assess the main veins or coronary arteries ; no particular features could be distinguished in the lungs or abdomen ; examination of the cervical organs revealed that the standard dissection had not been performed ; the toxicological analysis disclosed no substances for which tests were done .", "CARDINAL . It was concluded as follows : The information given was that an autopsy including the opening of the CARDINAL cavities was performed , that clotted blood was found in the heart and internal clotting in the anterior part of the coronary arteries and that death was caused by sudden heart failure due to an embolism in the cardiac vessels . However , as the autopsy after the exhumation showed , the organs had not been removed , sectioned and examined and that the heart ventricles had not been opened . The changes described therefore were of no scientific value . In cases of torture , traumatic changes might not be visible on external examination . The skin and deep muscle tissue had to be sectioned and examined to investigate deceptive traumatic changes . As regarded possible electric shocks , samples of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue had to be taken from the usual places \u2013 the inside of the mouth , nose and ears and genital area had to be examined and samples taken from the organs for histopathological analysis . None of these tests , included in the LOC model autopsy protocol published by ORG , were performed at the time . Therefore the judicial procedure had been left incomplete .", "CARDINAL .

It noted that the public prosecutor had given his opinion that there was no concrete evidence to support the allegation that the defendants had caused the death of PERSON . The testimonies of the witnesses who appeared before the court did not make it possible to reach the conclusion that the defendants tortured or ill - treated the deceased .", "According to the documents in the file and the on - site report , the deceased was apprehended by the gendarmerie on DATE on suspicion of being a ORG militant and was handed to the police DATE in order to be questioned . He had not been questioned DATE because they had other things to do and , when they started to question him DATE , he fell ill and subsequently died despite the first aid attempts .", "According to the corpse examination and autopsy report of DATE , a copy of which is in the case file , there were no signs of ill - treatment or lesions on the head ; there was a cut under his right collar bone , measuring CARDINAL cm , which had formed a scab and which probably had been caused DATE previously . There were no signs of ill - treatment on the back of the body , hands or arms . On the left side of the buttocks there were superficial cuts , measuring QUANTITY , which had formed scabs and which had possibly been caused DATE previously . There were no signs of ill - treatment on the legs or the feet . A full autopsy was also carried out on the deceased \u2019s body . There were no signs of ill - treatment on the chest . The collar - bones and the rib cage were intact . There were no bruises on the neck . There was no accumulation of blood in the thoracic cavity . The examination of the heart revealed an ecchymotic area on the apex cordis , near the pallor . On the front sides of the coronary arteries there were blood clots . There was also clotted blood in the heart and occasional pigment spots in the lungs . There was no blood accumulation in the thoracic or abdominal cavities . The stomach and intestines were normal . There were no signs of ill - treatment on the scalp or on the bones . No broken bones or oedema were observed . The brains were intact and there was no bleeding or discoloration on the tissue covering the brains . The cause of death was given as emboli in the blood vessels of the heart which caused the heart to stop .", "ORG was contacted and their opinion was requested . ORG in their report of CARDINAL DATE stated that the autopsy conducted locally on the body was inadequate . They also stated that the autopsy conducted on the remains of the body after the exhumation was not sufficient to determine conclusively whether he had been killed as a result of torture or ill - treatment , or to determine conclusively the cause of death , because the soft tissues of the body and the internal organs had seriously decomposed .", "According to the summary of the documents above , and the autopsy reports , it had not been possible to determine the cause of death . The GPE denials had also not been disproved . It was therefore not possible to determine conclusively that the defendants had committed this crime . The cause of death had not been established and therefore there was no conclusive evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendants had committed the crime with which they have been charged . It was therefore decided , unanimously , to acquit all the defendants .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that on DATE the applicant had appealed against the decision of acquittal . However , as he had not applied to join the proceedings as an intervenor , ORG had refused leave to appeal . He appealed against this refusal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court decided , unanimously , that the decision of ORG not to grant leave to appeal , as the applicant was not a party , was correct . The applicant \u2019s appeal was therefore rejected .", "CARDINAL . This report was issued on behalf of the applicant by PERSON , a Reader in Forensic Pathology at ORG and consultant pathologist to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The report recounted the findings of the autopsy . It noted that no organ weights were recorded or any indication of any material being retained for toxicology or histology . Though the cause of death was alleged to be heart failure as a result of emboli in the heart veins , there was no description of any such finding in the section on the chest organs . The further post mortem examination in DATE found that the heart had not been opened or dissected in an appropriate manner , that dissection to detect traumatic changes due to torture had not been carried out and that the neck area had not been dissected in the classical manner at the first examination ( the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage were firm ) . The black and white photocopies of the photographs of the body taken by the applicant were of no assistance in determining the presence of injuries .", "CARDINAL . The opinion was given that the post mortem examination after the death of PERSON was wholly inadequate . The conclusion of death due to heart failure appeared to have no pathological basis . It is said that there were emboli in the coronary veins but there is no description of any source for these emboli and no disorder of any organs was described . If the heart was dissected at all , and this appeared unlikely from the second examination , the so - called emboli would appear to be post mortem clotting of blood and not an event that had occurred in life to account for death . In any event emboli , or thrombosis , in a DATE man would be exceptional and , if present , would be expected to be present in coronary arteries not veins . The cause of death given at the first post mortem examination could be dismissed as incorrect , based on observations of doctors who had no pathological training or as , frankly , made up as the heart did not appear to have been dissected .", "CARDINAL . While no fresh injuries were identified by the doctors at the first examination , in view of the incompetent nature of the examination , it had to be questioned whether subtle changes would have been detected . If such injuries were present on the skin , they would not have been visible to the pathologists carrying out the second examination DATE .", "CARDINAL . The possibility that PERSON met his death as the result of torture had to be strongly considered . Techniques such as neck holds leave subtle signs in the neck which require detailed and appropriate dissection which was not carried out . The absence of injury to the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage were not conclusive as the structures were cartilaginous and less liable to fracture than in an older person . Another possibility was some form of restraint asphyxia or positional asphyxia where significant pathological findings were absent or minimal and needed careful consideration . Post mortem techniques existed for that but were not used . Another possibility was the application of electrical current , which left subtle skin changes that required careful examination for detection . The autopsy was inadequate for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . It was concluded that the autopsy findings did not support a natural cause of death and no other natural cause of death was identified . In the absence of a natural cause of death , unnatural causes had to be strongly considered . However , the first autopsy was inadequate to identify specifically subtle forms of torture or ill - treatment that could lead to death .", "CARDINAL . The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW all forms of homicide ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) constitute criminal offences . It is also an offence for a government employee to subject someone to torture or ill - treatment ( Article CARDINAL in respect of torture and Article CARDINAL in respect of ill - treatment ) .

In the case of alleged terrorist offences , the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of ORG prosecutors and courts established throughout GPE .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by the Law of DATE on the prosecution of civil servants , which restricts the public prosecutor \u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect \u2019s status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the ORG .
