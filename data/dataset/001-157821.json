Although the present case primarily relates to the anti - riot operation of CARDINAL DATE , that operation in fact constituted the climax of a series of long - standing conflicts between the Ulucanlar prison staff and some of the CARDINAL male and female prisoners convicted of belonging to illegal extreme left - wing organisations ( \u201c the leftist prisoners \u201d ) .", "It transpires from old classified documents exchanged among the office of the prosecutor attached to FAC ( \u201c the prosecutor \u2019s office \u201d ) , the Governor of GPE ( \u201c the Governor \u201d ) and the various regional gendarmerie commands , including ORG ( \u201c the CDGA \u201d ) , that the hostilities between the prison authorities and the prisoners dated back to DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Since that time the authorities had been aware of the problems , particularly relating to overcrowding and the age and inadequate facilities of the Ulucanlar complex , which , moreover , had been intended as a short - term prison and should never have housed convicted prisoners .

CARDINAL \u201d . The authorities in question were convinced that the leftist prisoners were planning a mass break - out , that they would therefore probably engineer an internal clash among the various extreme left - wing fractions in the prison and would dig tunnels , knock down walls , occupy the roofs , start fires and , finally , trigger an insurrection against the prison authorities . The authorities considered that as the ORG lacked the operational capacities to deal with such eventualities , they had to work together in order to identify the ringleaders and ensure durable security in the prison .", "On DATE the Governor ratified the plan , under which the ORG would be backed up by auxiliary forces , that is to say CARDINAL senior officers and QUANTITY gendarmes , to be seconded from other commands , accompanied by the local police .", "CARDINAL .

In the light of the foregoing considerations , it is important to reiterate the following statements made to ORG by Colonel PERSON , the commanding officer of the PERSON :", "\u201c ... We drew up our plan and arrived at Ulucanlar on TIME of CARDINAL DATE ; the prisoners riposted with firearms and flame throwers , and we were attacked with knives ; so we also used our arms in accordance with the powers conferred by Act No . CARDINAL [ on the organisation of ORG ] . My men were injured , and unfortunately on the other side prisoners were also injured or lost their lives . Their deaths have greatly saddened me . I am sad because there should not have been any weapons there . If there had been no weapons there would have been no confrontation and these people would not have died , and my men would not have been injured ... After those events ORG issued the directive of CARDINAL DATE . Prior to that date , we ( gendarmes ) were not empowered to search prison guards entering the prison ; the prison guards were searched by other prison guards . Imagine CARDINAL prison guards who have links with the ... prisoners . What sort of links might these be ? They might be material , pecuniary or ideological , or be based on fear . Therefore , if the \u2018 ORG organisation told those CARDINAL guards that someone would be bringing a gun from outside and that they had to hand it over to [ a given prisoner ] , they would be certain to obey . The prison guard goes into the prison and [ CARDINAL of his colleagues ] searches him , not a gendarme . A lawyer arrives and no one searches him . He has a private conversation with the detainee or prisoner and leaves , after which the detainee or prisoner is taken back to his cell , still without any body searches . Normally no such items should have been brought into the prison ... The prison in question has CARDINAL more special feature : it is next to the open prison section , where individuals come and go , stroll around and do whatever they want , and they could easily throw whatever objects they wish over the wall . There have been lots of incidents of this kind . We drew up a report and informed the prison authorities that a package had been thrown inside ; [ the guards ] searched the LOC but found nothing . After all , we could never have interfered in the running of the prison ! ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lieutenant - Colonel GPE . , the commanding officer of the task force , had stated the following :", "\u201c No search had been carried out in the section housing prisoners convicted of terrorist offences for DATE ... No request to that effect was ever submitted , and we did not act because the public prosecutor had never called on our services . As you know ... we can only act inside the prison if the prosecutor or Prison Director so requests ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The statement by Captain PERSON , commander of the ORG , on that matter can be summarised as follows :", "\u201c This affair did not begin on DATE ] ; its origins go back into the distant past . In GPE , but also in all the other prisons housing \u2018 ORG , the prison authorities had no control over the sections reserved for such prisoners ; this is a well - known fact . In those sections ... the \u2018 ORG ruled the roost ... ; TV and the other media covered this : the State Prosecutor sitting down with the prisoners and negotiating with them , and the latter then taking hostages and obtaining everything they had been demanding . Despite all the denials , whole pages of such agreements have been published in the newspapers ... ; it was obvious that a lot of weapons and mobile phones were circulating in the prison ; during ordinary body searches , even where prison guards felt a weapon , they were all too scared to confiscate it ... An incident was sure to occur if gendarmes raided the \u2018 terrorists \u2019\u2019 dormitories ... because no gendarme had ever entered those premises to conduct a search for CARDINAL or DATE ... Many staff have been caught red - handed smuggling weapons and drugs into the prison ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the gendarmes discovered a QUANTITY , CARDINAL - CARDINAL-cm deep hole in the middle of the concrete floor of dormitory no . CARDINAL , at a distance of QUANTITY from the wall , which the gendarmes identified as the entrance to a future tunnel . The hole was filled with pieces of wood and blankets .", "On DATE the gendarmes inspected the floor of dormitory no . CARDINAL . In the kitchenette , underneath the worktop , they noted that an CARDINAL x CARDINAL area had been bricked up and replastered to merge in with the colour of the walls . The gendarmes broke through the bricks and found that the floor had been dug up to a depth of QUANTITY . They deduced that what they had found was the beginnings of a tunnel .", "On DATE the floor of the dormitory no . CARDINAL living area was inspected . The gendarmes dug into the ground around CARDINAL poplar trees , and discovered a QUANTITY plywood trapdoor covering QUANTITY tunnel entrance . The entrance led to an approximately CARDINAL-m long tunnel running towards the aforementioned hole inside dormitory no . CARDINAL . The tunnel was found to contain CARDINAL home - made iron picks , a bag containing QUANTITY of dug - out rubble and a bag with QUANTITY of gravel .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the ministerial authorities submitted that the occupation of dormitory no . CARDINAL had been solely aimed at facilitating the preparation of a mass break - out ; that had also been the aim pursued by the rioters in hitherto blocking the access of prison guards to the dormitories and preventing presence checks , as allegedly proved by the incipient tunnel discovered after the operation . According to those authorities , CARDINAL and DATE the prison authorities had unsuccessfully attempted to put an end to the said occupation of the dormitory . In view of the failure of these attempts and the increasing number of leaks concerning an imminent prison break - out , an anti - riot operation had become inevitable .", "Although ORG accepted that the leaks concerning the tunnelling activities had played a major role in the decision to raid the LOC in question , it considered that there was some doubt as to the real nature of the sites identified in the area of dormitories CARDINAL . CARDINAL and CARDINAL as incipient tunnels . ORG pointed out that the first alleged tunnel , which was QUANTITY , began in the living area of dormitory no . CARDINAL and ended inside that dormitory . It took the view that it was implausible that the prisoners had ventured to dig a tunnel in an open yard which was overlooked by watch towers . Furthermore , ORG considered that the second digging site found behind the worktop in the dormitory no . CARDINAL kitchen did not really match the profile of an attempted escape tunnel .", "CARDINAL . Between DATE and DATE ORG was sent to Ulucanlar , where it held talks with a number of prisoners \u2013 including some of the applicants \u2013 prison staff , officers and other governmental and non - governmental officials . ORG report covered CARDINAL pages , CARDINAL of which concerned the impugned operation , and comprised a plethora of damning observations .", "CARDINAL . ORG began by enumerating the obstacles encountered during the investigations . ORG responsible for investigating the case had failed to attend the scheduled meeting , and , furthermore , the forensic medical team and the prison authorities had refused to hand over specific items of physical evidence such as the video recordings made during the operation and the photographs taken during the autopsies . It noted that although the gendarmerie authorities DATE which merely presented a few photographs taken long after the events \u2013 had denied the existence of such audiovisual material , several of the individuals questioned had affirmed that the operation had indeed been filmed and that , in fact , \u201c the junior officer responsible for the video recording had sustained an injury to his hand \u201d .", "According to ORG , this situation had reinforced the suspicions of concealment of evidence , particularly since the authorities had refused to grant the ORG lawyers leave to attend the autopsies , which refusal they alleged was in breach of the requirement to reassure the general public in such a sensitive case .", "CARDINAL . The report included several specific chapters , converging on an overall assessment of the impugned situation based on witness statements and other relevant evidence .", "CARDINAL . According to prisoners who did not actively participate in the riot , the occupation of dormitory no . CARDINAL was intended , in particular , as a protest against overcrowding in the dormitories after the failed attempts to negotiate that issue with the prison authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the prisoners in dormitories nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL had certainly violated the law , infringed the rights of their cellmates in dormitory no . CARDINAL and contributed to the escalating tensions by refusing to terminate their actions . However , ORG pointed out that of the CARDINAL dormitories available in GPE , CARDINAL were exclusively earmarked for leftist prisoners , and that there was a real overcrowding problem liable to goad those concerned into action .", "ORG considered that if dormitory no . CARDINAL had been raided on DATE , it was inexplicable why the authorities had waited for TIME before instigating an operation on that scale , with attempting beforehand to act in CARDINAL way or another . It added that there was also no explanation for the fact that , at the height of the tension , the prison prosecutor had gone on leave or that the operation had been launched on DATE of the Prime Minister \u2019s departure on an official visit to GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the official version , before entering the dormitories the gendarmes had duly ordered the rioters to surrender , but the latter had riposted with guns , home - made bombs , gas cylinders transformed into flame - throwers and various sharp tools . The non - rioting prisoners explained that there had indeed been shouted orders such as \u201c surrender ! If you surrender you will be well treated ! \u201d , but that those orders had been drowned out by the noise of the gunfire . The security forces said that they had attempted to contain the attacks with tear - gas canisters and high - pressure foam sprays , but that that had not stopped the prisoners , who were wearing home - made gas masks .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , and contrary to the official version , the incidents of DATE could not just be put down to the resistance of prisoners occupying a dormitory to prison officers assisted by the security forces . Similarly , the CARDINAL deaths which had occurred could not have been the result of an improvised reaction by the gendarmes .", "ORG explained that a plan had been drawn up DATE beforehand , that the LOC had been inspected on a number of occasions and that the situation had been discussed in detail with the prison guards and the administrative staff . ORG held that the operation had even been prepared in such a way as to include special strike forces . In the light of the number of dead and injured , it should have been obvious that , owing to the absence of prior measures to protect the lives of the prisoners , who were incarcerated under the ORG \u2019s responsibility , that operation had been a serious failure .", "CARDINAL . ORG took the view that the real reasons for the operation lay elsewhere ; there had been a serious longstanding problem of mutual confidence between the prisoners and those responsible for FAC at all levels , including with the gendarmes on duty at the prison . Accordingly , all the officials questioned had begun by acknowledging that \u201c the ORG was no longer in control of the prisons \u201d .", "Nevertheless , ORG noted that the meaning of the word \u201c control \u201d was unclear . \u201c Control \u201d could not mean preventing escapes \u2013 such cases being extremely rare \u2013 or carrying out regular searches and presence checks ; nor could control be aimed at preventing freedom of movement by the prisoners between dormitories , monitoring the prison activities of members of the \u201c terrorist \u201d organisations , undermining the authority of their leaders or preventing large quantities of foodstuffs from being smuggled into the prison .", "All such aims could have highlighted only the structural inadequacy of the prisons , the shortage of public funds and a deficient prison regime , and not any legitimate need for control of prison life .", "CARDINAL . On that subject , ORG reported that the prisoners interviewed had complained of the denial of their rights under a \u201c protocol of understanding \u201d which they claimed to have signed with the officials of the prison and ORG .", "It pointed out that , whereas that ORG had officially denied the existence of any such document , many of the prisoners and the prison administrators had confirmed its existence , explaining that before the operation the said protocol , which comprised CARDINAL articles , had been deposited with the public prosecutor \u2019s office , but that the document had been missing since the operation .", "According to ORG , in view of the difficulties encountered in effectively applying the prison rules , which situation would in fact have been difficult to reconcile with current human rights requirements , it was clear that the officials , who had already been under media pressure , had concluded agreements with the leaders of the leftist prisoners in order to define the terms and conditions of prison life . ORG took the view that even though such agreements could be seen as useful for protecting ORG rights , in the instant case it was precisely the issue of implementing the agreement in question which triggered the events at GPE . ORG explained that when there had been changes in the management of a given prison or when government policy had changed , the rights afforded to prisoners under such agreements had been denied , with the successive authorities proclaiming the unlawfulness of such privileges and the prisoners refusing to give up rights which they now took for granted .", "CARDINAL . It added that CARDINAL illustration of the feeling of powerlessness experienced by the prison staff ( many of whom had a rather low standard of education ) on this matter was their interpretation , for example , of the signs and tags which had been observed in the dormitories inspected following the operation as showing the ORG belonging to an illegal organisation . The prisoners interviewed had firmly denied that the LOC had ever been used as \u201c terrorist \u201d cells ; they had said that in the dormitories they had considered themselves entitled to conduct activities of a strictly cultural and intellectual nature . ORG considered that the reaction of the authority \u2019s vis - \u00e0 - vis the nature of those activities and the fact that they had sought to ban them as illegal had only exacerbated the situation .", "Furthermore , ORG highlighted the statement by ORG . , who had directed the operation , to the effect that the men had acted to \u201c restore the ORG \u2019s authority \u201d , and emphasised that the PERSON had on several occasions invited the Ministers of Justice and of the Interior to take action to \u201c restore the ORG \u2019s authority and prevent ORG from becoming a \u2018 terrorist\u2019 training centre ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , however , those facts alone were insufficient to explain the above - mentioned feeling of powerlessness ; behind the \u201c desire to control persons \u201d above and beyond their physical confinement there also lurked a wish to stigmatise prisoners convicted of political or terrorist acts vis - \u00e0 - vis the other inmates .", "CARDINAL . The Sub - Commission took the view that although it was incontrovertible that in cases of absolute necessity the security forces could resort to firearms within the limits of the law , inflicting death out of frustration at a loss of authority was clearly inadmissible . The deaths and injuries in FAC had revealed an intention to kill , rather than an intention to put an end to the occupation of dormitories or to break down resistance . It analysed the existence of mutual resentment powerful enough to induce individuals to take the risk of killing or being killed as a sign that the prisoners and gendarmes had viewed each other as enemies .", "In that regard , it emphasised that the military - style training given to members of the gendarmerie had been inappropriate for such an operation because , to a \u201c soldier \u201d , any \u201c adversary \u201d would have become an \u201c enemy \u201d whom he had a mission to destroy . That was why , according to ORG , no ordinary gendarmes should have been involved in situations such as that pertaining in the present case , unless the personnel to be sent in had received appropriate training for such missions , in the knowledge that their duty was not solely to prevent the prisoners from escaping , but also to protect their lives and ensure respect for human rights .", "ORG observed , however , that , in the present case the gendarmes had behaved as if they were facing a group of terrorists who had taken to the mountains , \u201c whereas there were CARDINAL prisoners suffering from the effects of gas and foam and confined to an area of QUANTITY , who could neither escape nor remain barricaded in for ever \u201d .", "CARDINAL . It explained that it had asked a number of officers whether any methods other than firearms could have been used and why the forces involved had not concentrated more on the use of tear gas and carbon dioxide foam in order to bring the situation under control .", "The officers had allegedly replied that they had begun by using all possible non - lethal methods , in particular tear gas , until the gendarmes wearing military gas masks had themselves been affected by the gas , as had all the persons inspecting the dormitories DATE after the incident . Moreover , according to CARDINAL colonel , it would have been pointless to wait or to fire off more tear - gas canisters because the rioters had protected themselves with masks .", "According to ORG , the only possible conclusion was that the tear - gas canisters in question had proved their efficacy in terms of their quantity and power . But since they had been insufficient to contain the rioters , should it not have been accepted that the prisoners , with their home - made masks , had been better protected from the gas than the gendarmes with their professional masks ?", "CARDINAL . The Sub - Commission further recounted the explanations given by another captain , to the effect that \u201c since we already had CARDINAL wounded gendarmes and were facing violent resistance , we could no longer decide to retreat , to halt the combat ; we had no say in the matter \u201d . ORG pointed out that Lieutenant - Colonel A.\u00d6z . ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had also acknowledged that he could not have called off an operation without undermining the morale of the troops and allowing the \u201c adversary \u201d to regain confidence . It quoted that officer \u2019s words as follows :", "\u201c ... In my view , it was impossible to restrain [ the rioters ] by any other means because they had larges stores of food in the dormitories . Furthermore , we had no \u2018 paralysing\u2019 gas , and to my knowledge there is no such gas . We have tear - gas canisters ... We could not opt to \u2018 wait and DATE because that would have raised the problem that a long period of waiting would have enabled the other side to prepare better and step up their resistance ... Once the armed confrontation has begun it can no longer be stopped . I am glad that my next - in - command and my lieutenant survived , thanks be to God , but if CARDINAL of them had been martyred , how could we have explained that to people ? ... In the past , when we came here on an operation , we only searched the ordinary ORG dormitories , not those of the prisoners convicted of terrorism . When the operation was instigated the latter prisoners resisted to the death . Firearms were the last resort , and we held back until our personnel began to sustain injuries ... That is when you have to react ; the longer you hold off the worse the eventual losses [ in your own ranks ] will be ... ; if you wait too long before riposting you will allow the \u2018 ORG to adjust their aim and erect barricades ... They even began killing each other ; there were burst of gunfire inside the dormitory ... I shouted down from the first floor \u2018 but that \u2019s automatic gunfire!\u2019 and the reply came \u2018 we know , sir ... we have no hunting rifles , we do n\u2019t use them ... \u201d", "Finally , ORG quoted Captain PERSON on that specific issue ( cf . paragraph DATE above ) , who had considered it unfair to ask them how they could have avoided \u201c killing CARDINAL individuals \u201d :", "\u201c ... We did n\u2019t kill them ... Honestly , if I had wanted to kill someone , why would I have chosen ordinary guys like GPE or PERSON , instead of shooting the group leaders ? Those CARDINAL were about to be released ... and pulled no weight in the organisation . Those were the kind of people who were killed . Did n\u2019t you notice that [ the first persons who died ] did not include any of the leaders ? It was because to begin with the other guys had wanted to surrender that many of them were executed by those [ leaders ] ... We do not deny that we used firearms , but it was n\u2019t us who killed those CARDINAL individuals ; it should be realised that if we had intended to shoot to kill we would have targeted the group leaders , or else we would already have eliminated them in the past , during quieter times ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Sub - Commission considered that those arguments were strictly military in nature and had , moreover , highlighted a lack of authority on the ORG part over the actions of the men under their command .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that more information was required on the nature of the \u201c violent resistance \u201d which had to be \u201c broken \u201d by the security forces .", "According to the official version , a PERSON , CARDINAL pistols and a hunting rifle had been found in the dormitories . Of the QUANTITY fatalities , CARDINAL had been the result of shots from that hunting rifle : in short , according to the gendarmes previous quarrels had induced the \u201c terrorists \u201d to kill each other .", "ORG observed that the prisoners questioned had admitted having seen some of their comrades using guns , but that none of them had seen any PERSON - type automatic weapon or a hunting rifle . No such PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL in limine above ) had ever been mentioned before or discovered during the initial search , but it had been found later on , after a prisoner had told the prosecutor that \u201c the first shot had been fired from an automatic weapon \u201d . And the hunting rifle , which had also never been previously mentioned , had also only emerged after the operation .", "Given that the only injuries noted by the gendarmes had been caused by gunshots , ORG wondered why , if the rioters had indeed been in possession of such a powerful weapon as a PERSON , they had not used it against the gendarmes , and also why , if they had actually used a hunting rifle to kill CARDINAL of their comrades , they had not also turned it against the gendarmes .", "DATE . Nevertheless , ORG held that the main question was how so many firearms had been smuggled into GPE . They considered the official line that they had been hidden in food packages or thrown over the prison wall unconvincing in view of the existence of electronic alarm systems and the guards keeping watch on the towers .", "Nor did ORG consider it conceivable that the firearms could have been supplied with the assistance of a number of corrupt officers ; only a major organisation could have managed such a feat by infiltrating the prison , which would have involved huge sums of money .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG noted that since CARDINAL cartridges had been found in the dormitories , the shooting attributed to the rioters could not have been as intense as had been claimed ; it therefore considered that the account of a violent exchange of fire in the dormitories could not be taken at face value and that consequently there was no proof that the force used by the gendarmes in response had been strictly proportionate to the danger , especially since the bullet impacts on the inside walls of the dormitories suggested that the shots fired by the gendarmes had been directly aimed at individuals .", "CARDINAL . The Sub - Commission also stated that the other argument , to the effect that the rioters had used gas cylinders as flame - throwers to prevent the gendarmes from entering the dormitories , could not be described as very convincing : the doors to the LOC in question had not displayed any scorch marks and none of the gendarmes had sustained any serious burns .", "CARDINAL . The Sub - Commission further pointed out that according to the officers involved , the gendarmes had also been attacked with sharp instruments ; still according to the officers , it was only to be expected that the deceased prisoners had displayed traces of blows and injuries because there had been \u201c clashes and confrontations with the prisoners , who had attacked the gendarmes with iron bars and stilettos , and the latter had had to riposte with truncheons \u201d .", "Nevertheless , ORG observed that it was unclear whether any knife wounds had been found on the gendarmes , nor was there any evidence that any such hand - to - hand fighting had ever taken place , never mind a confrontation lasting for TIME .", "On the other hand , ORG noted that many of the prisoners had claimed to have been beaten up , dragged along the floor and stamped on for no reason . It added that those allegations had been confirmed by forensic reports and that the forensic experts had established that some of the traces of violence observed on the injured prisoners and the corpses had indeed only been explicable by blows from blunt instruments and bodies being dragged across a hard floor ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine above ) .", "Moreover , the doctors responsible for providing first aid in the shower room prior to the transfer of the injured to hospital had also reported that the prisoners had begged them not to leave them alone , explaining that as soon as there were no witnesses , the gendarmes tortured them by exerting pressure on their wounds .", "CARDINAL . The Sub - Commission considered that the traces of blows and the injuries noted on the bodies of the prisoners and the corpses did not appear to have resulted from clashes and confrontations , and that the most likely scenario was that during and after the operation the security forces had resorted to excessive force and beaten the rioters . Furthermore , as regards the burns found on the bodies of the injured and dead prisoners , it pointed out that according to the forensic experts which it had appointed , they might have been caused by nitric or sulfuric acid , the presence of which chemicals it deemed unexplained .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to all the foregoing observations , ORG issued the following opinion .", "In the absence of a constructive attitude on the part of the Ulucanlar and ORG officials , the impugned operation had ultimately been characterised by a level of violence surpassing its original aim , the commanding officers concerned having discharged the mission without preventing deaths and widespread injuries .", "Clearly , sole responsibility for all those incidents could not be attributed to the gendarmes , the prison staff or the Ministry in question . However , the ORG \u2019s differentiated policy depending on prison type and the prison staff \u2019s excessive zeal in \u201c controlling \u201d the prisoners convicted of political offences by inflicting penalties in addition to the sentences which they were already serving had certainly been the main factor in the escalating tension and the lack of trust between both sides .", "Beyond the arguments put forward by the authorities , the real reason for such violence had boiled down to a longstanding dispute between the prison administration , which had been determined to impose its authority , and the prisoners , who had been demanding rights which they considered wholly legitimate .", "The officials involved in that dispute had ended up calling in the gendarmerie , who had proved unsuited to managing that kind of situation and who , in the absence of appropriate instructions , had inflicted ill - treatment on the prisoners and used disproportionate force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of ORG , inspectors initiated an administrative investigation against R.Cin . , ORG , and his CARDINAL deputies , PERSON \u00c7el . , U.Sal . , PERSON . and T.Y\u0131l . , on the grounds , inter alia , of the discovery of weapons and various prohibited objects and substances on the prison LOC ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "The CARDINAL officials were charged with failing in their obligation to control and supervise the prisoners under their responsibility .", "CARDINAL . They argued in their defence that it was impossible to identify the prison guards involved in smuggling weapons and ammunition into the prison . They added that even though visitors passed through metal detectors , the prison regulations prohibited body searches , and that the old and dilapidated state of ORG made it easy to hide prohibited items , which were sometimes even thrown over the prison wall from the outside .", "The officials further submitted that in practice it was impossible to impose disciplinary sanctions on prisoners for such offences since the deputy directors were not on ORG and , moreover , the impugned occupation of dormitory no . CARDINAL had in fact been brought to the attention of ORG and the public prosecutor \u2019s office , but no action had been taken before the date on which the risk of a break - out had become imminent .", "DATE . After the investigations , the inspectors had agreed on the need for sanctions . They stated that the officers in question should be declared responsible for :", "\u2013 bringing prohibited items into the prison through the intermediary of certain officials who had acted unsupervised and with complete impunity ;", "\u2013 the failure to conduct body searches of detainees and convicted prisoners being transferred between Ulucanlar Prison and hospital ;", "\u2013 the absence of X - ray checks on lawyers and their personal effects ;", "\u2013 the absence of targeted or general searches throughout the prison LOC in order to seize prohibited items ;", "\u2013 the failure to impose deterrent disciplinary sanctions on prisoners ;", "\u2013 the de facto tolerance , DATE and DATE , of the ORG unlawful actions , including their occupation of certain LOC ;", "\u2013 the absence of presence checks in dormitories nos . CARDINAL and DATE and the female dormitory ; and", "\u2013 the inability to block the access between those dormitories opened up by the prisoners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , departing from the aforementioned opinion , the Director General of Prisons decided that no sanctions were required , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c ... for DATE the prisons housing persons detained and convicted for acts of terrorism have been CARDINAL of the main problems facing our country , and the incidents which have occurred in them has attracted a high level of public interest . We can not overlook the fact that in prisons of this category searches are never properly carried out , presence checks raise problems and there are periods when no presence checks are carried out for DATE on end ; the detainees and convicted prisoners control the opening and closing of the doors to the dormitories , and when groups of them take over the corridors it is impossible to intervene ; even visits by and interviews with lawyers are arranged and controlled by the organisation leaders ; the net result is that the prison staff are overwhelmed and struggling , or even failing , to discharge their duties .", "Consequently , as regards such incidents , which stem from a number of issues which have been building up for DATE into a problem facing all the \u2018 anti - terrorist\u2019 prisons in our country , not just [ Ulucanlar ] , it would be unfair to say that the [ Ulucanlar ] staff , who are under pressure ... from the detainees and prisoners convicted of terrorism and are in a way being forced to work in breach of the regulations and instructions , were at fault or acted intentionally ; in other words , it is unfair to attribute sole responsibility for these incidents to the [ Ulucanlar ] prison staff on the grounds that they acted negligently .", "Moreover , even the investigation report of DATE [ sic \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ] accepted that the staff had not been guilty of negligence , wrongdoing or intentional mischief , because , despite all their efforts , it would have been impossible to prevent the situation from reaching such a pitch ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG concluded that no professional negligence was imputable to the Ulucanlar administrative staff .", "CARDINAL . At an unspecified date , a mandatory criminal investigation was instigated against head prison officers ORG and prison officers GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE . , GPE , GPE . and GPE , who were stationed at the Ulucanlar security checkpoint , for negligence in the exercise of their duties . In view of the number and type of weapons and ammunition discovered after the operation , those officers had been suspected of having internationally or accidently failed to carry out the requisite checks and searches on persons passing through the checkpoint , on DATE , in particular .", "The suspects contested the accusations on the grounds that the gendarmes had received the same orders as the prison officers in terms of checking individuals entering the building , including ensuring security at the checkpoint . They submitted that although , occasionally , no checks had been carried out , that fact alone did not warrant any presumption of guilt .", "CARDINAL . By order of DATE the prosecution discontinued the proceedings for lack of evidence . In support of that decision , the prosecution pointed out that it had been impossible to determine the dates or periods of time when the prohibited items in question had been smuggled into FAC . They added that in the light of the architecture and organisation of the building , \u201c light weapons \u201d could quite easily have been thrown over the outside walls or else from the open area of the prison , or that they might have been brought in by other means or with the assistance of officers other than those who had been charged .", "CARDINAL .

In the present case , it is clear that the authorities must account for official shortcomings as regards the events in question and the consequent loss of life ; because the reason why prisoners were able to obtain the stones , iron bars , cudgels and firearms with which they attacked the security forces and were able so easily to organise a riot was that inadequate measures had been taken [ to prevent such eventualities ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

As regards the applicant LOC ( List B ) , his case was dismissed at first instance by the CARDINALth Chamber of ORG on the grounds of his presumed involvement in the impugned incidents .
