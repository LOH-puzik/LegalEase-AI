During her pregnancy she had regular check - ups with a doctor and attended ante - natal classes at ORG . Prior to giving birth she had expressed , among other things , her wish to leave the maternity ward as soon as possible provided that there were no complications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant contacted a pediatrician , PERSON , who agreed to take charge of her future child and to come and see them both at their home as soon as they were discharged from the maternity ward . She informed the first applicant that she would , however , be away DATE . The applicant then told her that she intended to leave the hospital \u201c earlier \u201d , without enlarging on that statement . S. subsequently stated that it had not been her understanding that the applicant wanted to leave the hospital TIME after the birth .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was born on DATE at ORG . It was a natural and spontaneous delivery with no complications . The applicants were found to have no health problems , the Apgar score for newborns ( recording the pulse rate , respiration , complexion , muscular activity and reflex irritability ) was the highest possible , according to the medical team \u2019s assessment . In these circumstances , the first applicant decided to leave the hospital DATE , which she did at TIME despite meeting opposition from the medical team .", "CARDINAL . According to a statement issued by the hospital on DATE following extensive media coverage of the case , the hospital staff had suggested that the applicants remain at the hospital for TIME and had warned the first applicant of the possible risks to the child \u2019s health , but the first applicant had indicated that a pediatrician would be taking charge of the child . After the applicants had left , the hospital staff informed the police , which was standard practice in situations where a patient left hospital prematurely without the doctor \u2019s consent and this could have repercussions on his or her health . The social welfare authority was not informed until after the pediatrician PERSON had contacted the hospital ( see below ) . The hospital found it regrettable that the first applicant had not expressed her wish to leave the hospital TIME after the birth during the ante - natal classes . Had she done so , the staff would have recommended that she obtain a personal care plan for the newborn baby and secure written agreement from the pediatrician ( who would thus have had proper advance notice ) , whereupon her decision would have been accepted . The first applicant had accepted , moreover , that the events in question might have arisen as a result of a misunderstanding regarding the care arrangements for her newborn baby .", "CARDINAL . According to the explanations given by the pediatrician PERSON , on DATE at TIME she had been informed by the nurse from her surgery , who had received a call from the first applicant , that the latter had given birth that very TIME and returned home . As it was an unusual situation , the pediatrician , who had been preparing to leave for DATE and could not visit the applicants until TIME , informed the staff at ORG accordingly . NORP , the hospital doctor , decided to contact the social welfare authority , namely , the ORG municipal office . In the meantime PERSON had informed the first applicant by telephone that she would be able to see her and her child until TIME , which the applicant had accepted . Shortly afterwards the pediatrician was contacted by a social worker . She told her about the situation and gave her the first applicant \u2019s telephone number .", "CARDINAL . According to the note sent by ORG to ORG ( hereafter \u201c the social welfare authority \u201d ) , on DATE the first applicant had left the hospital at TIME on DATE without informing the doctors ; she had not been living at the address she had given the hospital for DATE and the village where she was staying and her telephone number had been provided by the pediatrician contacted by the ORG authority . The social worker had succeeded in contacting the child \u2019s father on that number . Although he had been informed that an interim measure under Article PERSON of LAW might be applied , he had stated that the applicants would not return to the hospital and had refused to provide the family \u2019s exact address .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the social welfare authority , Dr NORP drew up a note observing that \u201c given the short period of time since the birth , the health and potentially the actual life of the child [ would ] be at risk if he [ were ] deprived of hospital care \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Also on CARDINAL DATE the social welfare authority requested ORG to apply an interim measure pursuant to Article PERSON of LAW , with a view to entrusting the second applicant to the care of the gynaecology - obstetrics department of ORG . The above - mentioned notes drawn up by ORG and Dr D. were annexed to the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court granted the request , reiterating the terms of the note drawn up by Dr D. The decision stated that any interim measure was served on the parties at the time of execution , which had to be immediate .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE a court bailiff and a social worker , accompanied by police officers , went to the applicants\u2019 house . Although they explained to the child \u2019s father that the first applicant could go to the hospital with the second applicant , he refused to take them to there of his own free will . An emergency medical team was therefore summoned . After examining the newborn baby , the doctor present observed that he had no health problems but agreed with the others that for the purposes of implementing the interim measure the mother and child would be taken back to the hospital in the ambulance . The father , police officers , social worker and court bailiff followed the ambulance . Once at the hospital , the second applicant was examined again and found not to have any health problems .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were made to remain at the hospital for DATE and allege that no medical act was carried out during that time . According to the hospital report , the first applicant had refused neonatal screening and vaccination of the second applicant . At the express request of the first applicant , who accordingly signed the form refusing further medical treatment ( negativn\u00ed revers ) , the applicants were discharged from the hospital on DATE , TIME after the birth .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
