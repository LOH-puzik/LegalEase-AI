The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the chairman of ORG ( ORG ) , which represents its members in numerous companies .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was an employee of the security company PERSON As the chairman of the trade union , he had constant arguments with the company . In DATE his employment was terminated , which measure was declared illegal by the competent courts in DATE . The applicant alleged that , since then , company PERSON has not allowed him to enter its LOC , even on official trade union business .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged a private motion ( mag\u00e1nind\u00edtv\u00e1ny ) with ORG against PERSON , the managing director of company PERSON , alleging that the latter had committed defamation by saying at a company meeting that the applicant \u201c had taken under his wing criminals who had worked in the company \u201d . In DATE ORG , acting as a second - instance court , ultimately found PERSON guilty of defamation and fined him MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the trade union became active in company NORP In DATE , the trade union was informed of an intention to sell company NORP and that CARDINAL of the possible buyers was company PERSON The employees of company NORP opposed the project and , in order to express their opinion , requested the trade union to organise a protest demonstration . This it did in front of the ORG building . The applicant , as chairman of the trade union , gave interviews to several newspapers concerning the events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a DATE newspaper ORG published an article which reported the planned sale of company NORP and described the demonstration , analysing the background to the events . It interviewed the applicant , who made the following statements .", "\u201c ... the other reason [ for which we are holding a demonstration ] is that CARDINAL employees should not lose their livelihood and that such a company [ i.e. company PERSON ] which tramples constitutional and labour rights should not be the successor of company NORP ( ... ) Because of the inhuman conduct of the management [ of company PERSON ] [ the employees ] should not have to stay in a place where they were called \u201bcriminals\u2019 . We initiated court proceedings in CARDINAL cases because of that . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON brought an action against the applicant before ORG , asking the court to establish that the applicant \u2019s statements had infringed his good reputation , to order the applicant to refrain from such acts in the future and to arrange for a rectification to be published .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , finding that it was impossible to identify PERSON directly from the impugned article , dismissed his action . The plaintiff appealed .", "CARDINAL . The Pest County Regional Court was of the view that the ORG decision had only been a partial decision determining the applicability of the law on defamation . On DATE , it amended the first - instance decision and established that the plaintiff could be identified from the article in question . Thus he , as an affected person , might lawfully claim the protection of his privacy rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP In fresh proceedings ORG found , on DATE , that the applicant had tarnished the plaintiff \u2019s good reputation by the impugned statements and ordered him to publish a rectification and pay the plaintiff \u2019s court fees in the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) . It established that the applicant \u2019s assertions were statements of fact rather than value judgments . It also noted that , although it was true that numerous civil and labour proceedings had been instituted against company PERSON , this fact could not justify defamatory statements .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request to obtain the decisions adopted in those other proceedings , or to hear witnesses who might be able to prove the veracity of his assertions . It was of the view that this evidence could not possibly render lawful his statements , which in any event were exaggerated and offensive .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE the ORG upheld the first - instance decision . It held that the applicant \u2019s assertions were value judgments based on factual allegations expressed in a wholly unlawful manner , since he had articulated his views in a \u201c gratuitously insulting , offensive and harsh way . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also referred to a decision of ORG which had come to the same conclusion in another defamation case instituted directly by company PERSON against the applicant . It established that the protection of the rights of others constituted a legitimate restriction on freedom of expression even in cases of public interest . However , it established that the present case did not deal with such matters of general concern , even if company NORP had many employees .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a petition for review with ORG . He pointed out that the final decision had erroneously found his assertions to be statements of fact , since they were the expression of an opinion based on true facts . The applicant also stressed that his aim had been to inform the public about an important matter . Lastly , he was of the view that in expressing his opinion he could not have harmed anyone \u2019s reputation , even if he had used harsh terms , and that he had acted in compliance with relevant domestic law , the well - established case - law of ORG and ORG , as well as with NORP standards .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a single judge of ORG declared the applicant \u2019s petition inadmissible . It found that the final decision had been correct and in accordance with law , particularly in view of the nature of the applicant \u2019s assertions , which had been gratuitously insulting , offensive and harsh , and violated the plaintiff \u2019s privacy irrespective of their value judgment content . ORG also pointed out that the right to freedom of expression was not unlimited and should not violate the personality rights of others .", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The protection of personality rights shall also include the protection of the good reputation of others .", "( CARDINAL ) In particular , the statement or dissemination of an injurious and untrue fact concerning another person DATE or the presentation , with untrue implications , of a true fact relating to another person \u2013 shall constitute defamation . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person whose personality rights have been infringed may bring the following civil-", "a ) a claim that the court establish that an infringement has taken place ;", "b ) a claim that the infringement be discontinued and the perpetrator be forbidden from further infringements ;", "c ) a claim that the perpetrator be ordered to give satisfaction by making a declaration or in any other appropriate manner and , if necessary , this be made adequately public by , or at the expense of , the perpetrator ;", "d ) a claim that the prejudicial situation be terminated , and that the situation prior to the infringement be restored by , or at the expense of , the perpetrator ... ;", "e ) a claim for damages under the rules of civil law liability . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
