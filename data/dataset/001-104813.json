She was represented by PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr R\u0103zvan - Hora\u0163iu Radu .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant lodged a civil action against the T\u00e2rgu ORG , company ORG and third parties NORP , PERSON ( private individuals ) , who were seeking to become the owners of CARDINAL sheds constructed by company ORG on her land . The sheds were occupied by the above - mentioned individuals on the basis of a lease contract concluded with ORG . She based her action on LAW and maintained that the competent authority for the application of PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL had issued ownership title to the said land in her favour on DATE . She underlined that her ownership right to the land had been confirmed by a final and enforceable decision of the T\u00e2rgu ORG , rendered on DATE . She also submitted that taking into account that company ORG had acted in good faith when it constructed the sheds on her land , she required the recognition of a property right over the sheds to accompany her obligation to pay compensation to the builder . She based her claim on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The T\u00e2rgu ORG ordered an expert report which would assess the land and the structures on it and establish their value . The expert concluded that the sheds had been erected on the applicant \u2019s land DATE before , as a temporary annexe to a building site ; he revealed that their condition had seriously deteriorated and that the period for which they had been intended to be used had long ago expired , and thus concluded that they were worth no more than the raw material used for their construction .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the court of first instance allowed the action and held that the applicant had a property right over the land , whose value greatly exceeded the value of the structures erected on it . It also held that on the basis of LAW the applicant had become the owner of the structures in her capacity as owner of the land , and that the builder of the structures had the right to obtain their value from the applicant . Moreover , the court noted that the lease contracts concluded by the T\u00e2rgu ORG with NORP , S. , C. , P. , PERSON were not opposable to the applicant , as neither the company ORG which had built the structures , nor the T\u00e2rgu ORG which was responsible for them , were owners of the land .", "CARDINAL . The Gorj County Court dismissed the appeal lodged by the T\u00e2rgu ORG and company H. as unfounded . It noted that the structures were in an advanced state of disrepair which made them unfit to be used as dwellings by private individuals .", "CARDINAL . By a final decision of DATE , ORG allowed an appeal on points of law by the T\u00e2rgu ORG and company ORG and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . Admitting that the applicant was the owner of the land on which the disputed sheds had been built , the court of last resort held that the applicant had not proved her right of property over the sheds . It noted that the sheds had been erected in a period when the owner of the land was the ORG and company ORG had the authorisation of the ORG to build . It noted that the structures had been transferred to the T\u00e2rgu ORG , becoming part of the private sector of the city of PERSON by a decision of the local council of CARDINAL DATE . Therefore , the court reversed the presumption that the owner of the land was the owner of all structures on the land , and recognised the right of the local council over the structures and implicitly the right to use the applicant \u2019s land on which the structures had been built .", "CARDINAL . The relevant law and case - law and doctrine regarding the right of superficies and real estate accession are described in PERSON and Palade v. GPE , ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) , and ORG v. GPE , ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Civil Code does not contain any specific provision concerning enrichment without just cause . However , it is unanimously considered in doctrine and case - law that the provisions that should be indicated when referring to it are Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW . Enrichment without just cause is defined by doctrine as the legal instrument by which a person obtains any property , service or other benefit from another person without legal cause ; the beneficiary shall indemnify the person at whose expense he has enriched himself to the extent to which he has benefited from his property or work ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
