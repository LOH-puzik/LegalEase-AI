The applicant , a NORP national , was born in DATE and is currently being held in LOC .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case DATE were presented by ORG in the \u00d6calan v. GPE judgment ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIV ) . They may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by members of the NORP security forces in an aircraft in the international area of GPE airport . The applicant was returned to GPE from GPE and taken into custody at FAC on DATE . The inmates at this prison had meanwhile been transferred to other prisons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appeared before a judge of ORG , who ordered that he should be detained pending trial .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty of carrying out acts designed to bring about the secession of part of GPE \u2019s territory and of training and leading a gang of armed terrorists for that purpose , and sentenced him to death under LAW . It found that the applicant was the founder and principal leader of an illegal organisation , namely the ORG ( ORG hereafter \u201c the NORP \u201d ) . ORG found that it had been established that , following decisions taken by the applicant and on his orders and instructions , the ORG had carried out several armed attacks , bomb attacks , acts of sabotage and armed robberies , and that in the course of those acts of violence CARDINAL of civilians , soldiers , police officers , village guards and public servants had been killed . The court reiterated that the applicant had acknowledged that ORG estimate of the number of those killed ( CARDINAL ) or wounded as a result of the ORG \u2019s activities was fairly accurate , that the actual number might even be higher , and that he had ordered the attacks as part of the armed struggle being waged by the ORG . The court did not accept that there were mitigating circumstances allowing the death penalty to be commuted to life imprisonment , having regard , among other things , to the very large number and the seriousness of the acts of violence and the major , pressing threat to the country that those acts posed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment adopted on CARDINAL DATE and delivered on DATE , ORG upheld the judgment of DATE in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Article CARDINAL of the LAW was amended so that the death penalty could no longer be ordered or implemented other than in time of war or of imminent threat of war , or for acts of terrorism .", "By PERSON no . CARDINAL , published on DATE , ORG resolved , inter alia , to abolish the death penalty in peacetime ( that is to say except in time of war or of imminent threat of war ) and to make the necessary amendments to the relevant legislation , including LAW . As a result of the amendments , a prisoner whose death sentence for an act of terrorism has been commuted to life imprisonment must spend the rest of his life in prison .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG commuted the applicant \u2019s death sentence to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE ratified LAW No . CARDINAL concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s conditions of detention in ORG before CARDINAL DATE are described in the judgment of the same date ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the applicant was the sole inmate of ORG until DATE , when CARDINAL further individuals were transferred to it ; all the prisoners , including the applicant , were then housed in a new block which had just been built .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE , that is to say after the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE , delegations from ORG for ORG Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c CPT \u201d ) visited PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Before CARDINAL DATE the cell which the applicant occupied alone measured QUANTITY m , and was equipped with a bed , a table , a chair and a shelf . The cell was air - conditioned and had a partially partitioned sanitary annex . There was a window overlooking an enclosed yard and the cell had adequate access to natural light and adequate artificial lighting . In DATE the walls had been reinforced with chipboard panels to protect them against the damp .", "CARDINAL . The time granted to the applicant to leave his cell and use the exercise yard ( measuring QUANTITY . m ) , which is walled in and covered with mesh , was limited to TIME DATE ( divided into CARDINAL QUANTITY periods , CARDINAL in the morning and the other in the TIME ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not in sensory isolation or solitary confinement . As he was the only inmate of the prison , his only contacts were with the members of staff working there , who were only allowed to talk to him about subjects falling within the scope of their duties and relating to everyday life in the prison .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had access to books and a radio which could only receive ORG broadcasts . He was not allowed to have a television set in his cell on the grounds that he was a dangerous prisoner and a member of an illegal organisation , and was prone to commit recurrent disciplinary offences . Nor was he given access to a telephone , for the same reasons .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , who had restricted access to daily and DATE newspapers , was allowed a maximum of CARDINAL papers in his cell at any CARDINAL time . The newspapers were often DATE . In fact , he received them once DATE , from his family or his lawyers . In the absence of visits from family members and lawyers ( owing to the inaccessibility of the island ) , the applicant often spent long periods without access to recent newspapers . Those papers which he did receive had always been extensively censored .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was allowed to correspond with the outside world under the supervision of the prison authorities . The mail which he received was verified and censored . Correspondence with the outside was occasionally interrupted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant remained in the same cell from the date of his transfer to PERSON DATE after his arrest on DATE \u2013 until DATE , that is to say for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to comply with the requests put forward by the ORG and put an end to the applicant \u2019s relative social isolation , the governmental authorities built a number of new blocks inside the grounds of FAC . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant and CARDINAL other inmates transferred from other prisons were moved to these new facilities .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since that date the applicant has been on his own in a cell with an area of QUANTITY m ( living space ) , with a further QUANTITY . m of sanitary facilities , comprising a bed , a small table , CARDINAL chairs , a metal cupboard and a kitchenette with a washbasin . The building containing the cells is properly damp - proofed . According to the ORG , although the applicant \u2019s cell has a MONEY QUANTITY window and a partly glazed door , both opening on to an enclosed yard , it has insufficient direct sunlight because of the CARDINAL-m - high wall surrounding the yard . The ORG \u2019s proposal to lower the wall has not yet been accepted by the Government , whose experts have certified that the cell receives enough natural light .", "CARDINAL . The prison is equipped with a sports room with a pingpong table and CARDINAL other rooms with chairs and tables , all CARDINAL rooms enjoying plentiful natural daylight . Every inmate , including the applicant , has TIME of outdoors exercise DATE alone in the exercise yard reserved for each cell . Moreover , all the prisoners can spend TIME alone in a recreation room ( where no specific activities are on offer ) and TIME per month alone in the prison library . Furthermore , every prisoner takes part in collective activities , including TIME conversation per week with the other prisoners .", "CARDINAL . Following its visit in DATE the ORG observed that the prison regime applied to the applicant was only a very modest step in the right direction , particularly as compared to the regime applied in the other F - type prisons for the same category of convicted prisoners , who could engage in outdoor activities DATE , with non - supervised collective activities with the other prisoners for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the light of these observations , the authorities responsible for ORG undertook to relax the regime in question , so that the NORP inmates , including the applicant , can now engage alone in out - of - cell activities for TIME per day , receive newspapers twice ( instead of once ) DATE and spend TIME ( instead of CARDINAL ) per week together to talk to each other . All the ORG inmates can engage , for TIME , in any of the following collective activities : painting and handicraft activities , table tennis , chess , volleyball and basketball . According to the prison registers , the applicant in fact plays volleyball and basketball but does not take part in the other activities . The prison authorities also informed the ORG that they were considering providing inmates with TIME of additional collective activities ( painting / handicraft , board games and sport ) . The applicant therefore apparently spends a great deal of time outside his cell , that is to say , depending on his choice of collective activity , up to a maximum of TIME per week , including a maximum of TIME in the company of the other prisoners .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , in the wake of new technical arrangements , the applicant , like the other ORG inmates , has been allowed QUANTITY minutes\u2019 telephone calls to the outside DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its report of CARDINAL DATE the ORG recommended that the Government should ensure that the applicant could accompany the other inmates for outdoor activities , and that he and the other prisoners could spend a reasonable part of DATE ( TIME or more ) outside their cells , engaged in purposeful activities of a varied nature . The ORG also recommended allowing the applicant to have a television set in his cell , like all other persons held in high - security prisons . The prison authorities did not act on these latter recommendations on the grounds that the applicant still held dangerous prisoner status and failed to comply with the prison rules , particularly during visits by his lawyers . On DATE the applicant was supplied with a television set .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has received many visits from his lawyers and relatives , but not as many as he and his visitors would have liked , mainly because of \u201c poor weather conditions \u201d , \u201c maintenance work on the ferry boats between the island and the mainland \u201d and \u201c the inability of the boats to cope with prevailing weather conditions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In fact , the old ferry boat PERSON was still in service but could only sail when there was little wind . The larger ferry boat , ORG , which the ORG had promised when the previous \u00d6calan case was pending before FAC of the ORG , began operating in DATE . The ORG , being better suited than the \u0130mral\u0131 CARDINAL to difficult weather conditions , provides more frequent crossings between LOC and the mainland . It sometimes suffers technical breakdowns , entailing repairs which sometimes take DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards visits , DATE , for example , CARDINAL out of CARDINAL requests for visits were refused . These refusals continued into DATE , with CARDINAL out of CARDINAL requests being refused , and DATE , with CARDINAL out of CARDINAL requests refused . After a brief improvement in DATE ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL requests refused ) , DATE ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL requests refused ) and DATE ( all CARDINAL requests granted ) , visit frequency once again dropped off in DATE ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL requests refused ) and DATE ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL requests refused ) , picking up again in DATE ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL requests refused ) and DATE ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL requests refused ) . The number of family visits totalled CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE and CARDINAL in DATE . In fact , between DATE and DATE , the applicant received CARDINAL visits from his brothers and sisters and CARDINAL from his lawyers or advisers .", "CARDINAL . For the remainder of DATE and in DATE , DATE and , broadly speaking , DATE , the frequency of visits by lawyers and members of the applicant \u2019s family regularly increased . In DATE , for example , CARDINAL visits out of the CARDINAL requested took place on the scheduled date or DATE after ( because of unfavourable weather conditions ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE the ratio of refusals to requests increased significantly . In DATE , for example , the applicant only received CARDINAL family visits out of the CARDINAL requested . Again in DATE , he only received CARDINAL of the CARDINAL requested visits by his lawyers . CARDINAL lawyers\u2019 visits took place in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE and CARDINAL in DATE . DATE the applicant received no visits apart from CARDINAL family visit on DATE , with CARDINAL refusals . The prison authorities explained their refusals by poor weather conditions and ferry breakdowns .", "In DATE the applicant received a few visits from his brother , and none from his lawyers .", "CARDINAL . As a general rule , persons in prison in GPE can talk to their lawyers on DATE , during TIME , without any restrictions as regards frequency over any given period . Since LOC is only accessible by means of the shuttle boat provided by the ORG administration , the applicant \u2019s lawyers\u2019 visits , in practice , always took place on a DATE , DATE of the crossing .", "CARDINAL . As a general rule , prisoners can communicate with their lawyers completely confidentially , without supervision . On DATE , however , PERSON no . DATE on the enforcement of sentences and preventive measures came into force , replacing the previous legislation on this matter . Under LAW of the new PERSON , if it emerges from documents and other evidence that visits by lawyers to a person convicted of organised crime are serving as a means of communication within the criminal organisation in question , the post - sentencing judge may , at the request of the prosecution , impose the following measures : presence of an official when the convicted prisoner is talking to his lawyers , verification of documents exchanged between the prisoner and his lawyers during such visits , and/or confiscation of all or some of these documents by the judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was visited by his lawyers . Just before the interview the prison authorities communicated to the applicant and his lawyers a decision by the ORG post - sentencing judge applying section CARDINAL of Law no . DATE to that visit . An officer was therefore present during the interview , the conversation between the applicant and his lawyers was tape - recorded and the documents supplied by the lawyers were submitted to the judge for examination .", "CARDINAL . In order to protest against the new procedure , the applicant interrupted the interview after CARDINAL of an hour and asked his lawyers to pay no further visits to him until the said procedure had been revoked . He informed the prison authorities that the procedure infringed the confidentiality of the interview between the lawyers and their client and \u201c rendered the visit and the interview pointless in terms of preparing his defence \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP During subsequent visits an official was in attendance during interviews . Moreover , the conversation between the applicant and his lawyers was again tape - recorded and submitted to the post - sentencing judge for examination .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyers also lodged an appeal with ORG against the ORG post - sentencing judge \u2019s decision ordering attendance by an officer during interviews and the recording of the conversations . By decisions of DATE and DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the impugned measures were geared to preventing the transmission of orders within a terrorist organisation , that they did not affect the applicant \u2019s defence rights and that in any case the transcription of the conversations showed that they had not concerned the applicant \u2019s defence in any set of proceedings but the internal functioning of the ORG and the strategy to be adopted by this illegal organisation .", "CARDINAL . During the lawyers\u2019 visit on DATE , CARDINAL of the officers present in the room in which the interview was taking place interrupted the conversation on the ground that it was not confined to preparing the applicant \u2019s defence before a judicial authority . The applicant \u2019s lawyers filed a complaint against the officer in question for abuse of office . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor \u2019s office issued a decision not to prosecute .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the records of the lawyers\u2019 visits that the conversations very often began with a statement by the lawyers on recent developments concerning the ORG . The applicant consulted his lawyers on changes of persons at the different structural levels of the organisation , the various activities and meetings organised by the ORG bodies ( at regional and national levels , and also abroad ) , the political line adopted by the party leaders , competition among the leaders and losses sustained by armed militants in combating the security forces . The applicant , who presented himself as \u201c the leader of the NORP people \u201d , commentated all the information provided by his lawyers and mandated them to transmit his ideas and instructions with a view to reshaping the ORG \u2019s policies in GPE ( he broadly advocated recognising the rights of the NORP minority in a completely democratic GPE ) or in other countries . Moreover , he approved or rejected executive appointments to the various NORP bodies and advised on the party \u2019s internal organisation . He also recommended that the ORG lay down its weapons when the Government had ended hostilities and the ORG \u2019s demands had been met .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the ORG public prosecutor , the ORG post - sentencing judge several times refused to hand over copies of the records to the applicant and his lawyers on the grounds that they contained direct or indirect instructions by the applicant to the ORG , which used them to reshape its strategy and tactics .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant had remained actively involved in the political debate in GPE on the ORG armed separatist movement , which identified him as its main representative , and his instructions as transmitted through his lawyers had been closely monitored by the general public , prompting a variety of reactions , some of which had been very extreme . A section of the NORP population considered him as the most dangerous terrorist in the country , who was still active even in prison . His supporters saw him as their leader and the ultimate head of the separatist movement .", "The applicant also stated that he had taken part in negotiations with certain ORG officials with an eye to resolving the problems posed by the armed separatist movement , but that most of his calls for the discontinuation of the armed conflict had been heard neither by the Government nor by his armed movement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was placed in solitary confinement on the ground that he had transmitted instructions to the organisation of which he was the leader during his lawyers\u2019 visits on the following dates : CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE , and DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , according to the tape recording of the conversation of CARDINAL DATE between the applicant and his lawyers , the applicant told his legal representatives how he considered that ORG members could invite citizens of NORP origin to demonstrate in order to demand the right to education in the NORP language .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG disciplinary board , considering that the applicant \u2019s words corresponded to \u201c training and propaganda activities within a criminal organisation \u201d , sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL days\u2019 solitary confinement . Pursuant to this sanction , the prison administration removed all the applicant \u2019s books and newspapers for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this disciplinary measure was dismissed on DATE by the ORG post - sentencing judge on the grounds that the applicant had incited women and children to organise illegal demonstrations , thus carrying out what might be described as training and propaganda activities within a criminal organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant \u2019s lawyers against the decision of DATE . ORG considered that the impugned decision was in conformity with the law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subjected to a further sanction of CARDINAL days\u2019 solitary confinement on the ground of a conversation with his lawyers which had taken place on DATE . His appeals against this decision having been dismissed , he served this sentence from CARDINAL DATE to DATE . The applicant \u2019s lawyers were not apprised of this sanction until DATE , when a request for a visit to the applicant was rejected .", "CARDINAL . Visits by relatives of the applicant ( in practice , his brothers and sisters ) are limited to TIME every fortnight . These visits originally took place in a visiting room comprising a barrier to separate the prisoner from his visitors , as the visiting areas where the prisoner and his visitors could sit together at a table were reserved for relatives of the first degree under LAW on visits to prisoners and detainees . On DATE ORG annulled this provision . Without waiting for this decision to become final , ORG granted the applicant the right to see his brothers and sisters unseparated by any barrier . On DATE , therefore , the applicant was able to meet his brother \u201c around a table \u201d for the first time .", "CARDINAL . Where a visit is cancelled owing to weather conditions , the authorities can organise another visit DATE , at the family \u2019s request . In practice , DATE visits which are cancelled are not replaced because the visitors have never requested such replacement .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , visits by family members have not been as frequent as the applicant and his relatives would have wished because of the inadequacy of the available means of transport under unfavourable weather conditions . CARDINAL of all the visits requested have been rejected owing to shuttle boat breakdowns or poor weather conditions .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the new version of LAW , which came into force on DATE , provides that lawyers who have been prosecuted for crimes linked to terrorism may be banned from representing persons convicted of terrorist activities . This provision is intended to prevent leaders of terrorist organisations who have been convicted from continuing to lead their organisations from their place of incarceration through the intermediary of their lawyers .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the GPE prosecutor \u2019s office invited ORG to apply this measure to some of the applicant \u2019s lawyers .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the CARDINALth ORG deprived CARDINAL lawyers of their status as counsel to the applicant for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the CARDINALth ORG of GPE dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on instructions from the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office , the law enforcement agencies arrested and took into custody CARDINAL lawyers representing the applicant in CARDINAL NORP departments ( including CARDINAL lawyers representing the applicant before ORG ) , searched their offices and seized all the documents relating to the applicant . The prosecution suspected the lawyers in question of having acted as messengers between the applicant and the other NORP leaders .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives informed the ORG that they had asked a GPE medical laboratory to analyse CARDINAL hairs which they considered to be from the applicant and that the analyses carried out on DATE demonstrated the presence of abnormally high doses of chromium and strontium .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , analyses of samples taken directly from the applicant at the prison failed to disclose any trace of toxic elements or elements endangering health .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "7", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["7-1", "8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
