He had recognised the applicants and had seen them enter a car that was later reported stolen . When the witness gave evidence it appeared that there might have been other police officers in the area . The witness refused to answer some questions about his whereabouts when observing the applicants and also declined to confirm whether there had been other officers in the area , since he had been assigned to another operation not related to the applicants\u2019 actions .

The applicants appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tt ) of PERSON , arguing that they should not have been convicted on the basis of the testimony of CARDINAL eyewitness , since it would have been possible to hear the police officers who had been in the area at the same time . The applicants demanded a chance to hear those police officers as witnesses , requesting an oral hearing to be held before ORG or that the case be referred back to ORG for a re - hearing . They stressed that the names of those police officers had not been known until the public prosecutor gave his answer to the applicants\u2019 appeal to ORG .

The first applicant asserted , inter alia , that he must be afforded a right to obtain answers from ORG to the questions he had put to him , and a right to hear the above - mentioned CARDINAL police officers as witnesses . The second applicant argued that the public prosecutor \u2019s statement about his conversations with the police officers in question was not comparable to their being heard as witnesses before a court .
