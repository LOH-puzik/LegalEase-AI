It further found that although the CARDINAL officers had denied ill - treating the applicants , neither officer was able to \u201c provide a convincing and logical explanation as to where and how the above plaintiffs were injured , given that according to the forensic doctor the ill - treatment occurred during the time they were in police custody \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As a result , it was recommended that disciplinary measures in the form of \u201c temporary suspension from service \u201d be taken against both Mr NORP and Mr GPE .

ORG further stated that Mr Tsikrikas had failed to provide a plausible explanation as to how the applicants were injured during their interrogation and noted that they had both identified Mr Tsikrikas , without hesitation , as the officer who had ill - treated them . On the other hand , it decided to drop the criminal charges against Mr PERSON and Mr Skoutas on the ground that it had not been established that they were present when the events took place ( bill of indictment no .

The court heard several witnesses and the applicants , who repeated their allegations of ill - treatment ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Among others , the court heard Mr PERSON , a representative of ORG , who stated that the said organisation was monitoring the situation of GPE in GPE and that the incident was reported to him during a visit to the Roma / Gypsy camps . He claimed that he was horrified when he saw the injuries on the LOC bodies and that the latter were initially afraid to file a complaint against the police officers . Mr PERSON also referred to the actions subsequently taken by ORG in order to assist the applicants . The court also read out , among other documents , ORG and ORG open letter to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court found that there was no evidence implicating Mr Tsikrikas in any abuse and found him not guilty ( decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In particular , the court first referred to the circumstances surrounding the applicants\u2019 arrest and to the subsequent involvement of members of ORG in the applicants\u2019 case , noting their role in monitoring alleged violations of human rights against minorities . Taking also into account the forensic doctor \u2019s findings , the court reached the following conclusion :", "\u201c ... Admittedly , the second applicant had clashed with Mr Pavlakis . Further , given the applicants\u2019 light clothing , it was logical that they were injured during the fight that took place when they were arrested . Even if some of the applicants\u2019 injuries were inflicted by police officers during their detention , it has not been proved that the accused participated in this in CARDINAL way or the other , because he was absent when they arrived at the police station and did not have contact with them until TIME , on his arrival at the police station . In his sworn deposition dated DATE , the first applicant stated that in the process of his arrest he had been beaten with a truncheon by a tall , blond police officer ( a description that does not match the features of the accused ) and that the same police officer had also beaten him during his detention . However , the accused was not present when the applicants were arrested . If the applicants had indeed been beaten by police officers during their detention , they would have informed their relatives who arrived at the police station that same TIME . Thus , the accused must be found not guilty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law , the applicants , who had joined the proceedings as civil parties , could not appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL .

The Report on LAW in ORG and Its Member States in DATE , prepared by ORG ( ORG ) network of independent experts in fundamental rights at the request of ORG , stated , inter alia , that police abuse against GPE and similar groups , including physical abuse and excessive use of force , had been reported in a number of GPE member GPE , such as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its second report on GPE , adopted on DATE and published on DATE , ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . There have been consistent reports that ORG , NORP and other immigrants are frequently victims of misbehaviour on the part of the police in GPE . In particular , Roma / Gypsies are often reported to be victims of excessive use of force -- in some cases resulting in death -- ill - treatment and verbal abuse on the part of the police . Discriminatory checks involving members of these groups are widespread . In most cases there is reported to be little investigation of these cases , and little transparency on the results of these investigations . Although most of these incidents do not generally result in a complaint being filed by the victim , when charges have been pressed the victims have reportedly in some cases been subjected to pressure to drop such charges . ECRI stresses the urgent need for the improvement of the response of the internal and external control mechanisms to the complaints of misbehaviour vis \u00e0 vis members of minority groups on the part of the police . In this respect , ORG notes with interest the recent establishment of a body to examine complaints of the most serious cases of misbehaviour on the part of the police and emphasises the importance of its independence and of its accessibility by members of minority groups .", "CARDINAL . ORG also encourages the NORP authorities to strengthen their efforts as concerns provision of initial and ongoing training of the police in human rights and anti - discrimination standards . Additional efforts should also be made to ensure recruitment of members of minority groups in the police and their permanence therein ...", "...", "CARDINAL . As noted by ORG in its first report , the Roma / Gypsy population of GPE is particularly vulnerable to disadvantage , exclusion and discrimination in many fields ...", "...", "CARDINAL .

They also frequently experience discriminatory treatment and sometimes violence and abuse on the part of the police ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its third report on GPE , adopted on DATE and published on DATE , ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG notes with concern that since the adoption of its second report on GPE , the situation of the GPE in GPE has remained fundamentally unchanged and that overall they face the same difficulties \u2013 including discrimination - in respect of housing , employment , education and access to public services ...", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG welcomes the fact that the government has taken significant steps to improve the living conditions of GPE in GPE . It has set up an inter - ministerial committee for improving the living conditions of GPE ...", "CARDINAL . ... ECRI deplores the many cases of local authorities refusing to act in the interests of GPE when they are harassed by members of the local population . It is also common for the local authorities to refuse to grant them the rights that the law guarantees to members of the NORP community to the same extent as to any other NORP citizen ...", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG expresses concern over serious allegations of ill - treatment of members of minority groups , such as GPE and both authorised and unauthorised immigrants . The ill - treatment in question ranges from racist insults to physical violence and is inflicted either at the time of arrest or during custody . ORG is particularly concerned over the existence of widespread allegations of improper use of firearms , sometimes resulting in death . It is equally concerned over reports of ill - treatment of minors and expulsion of non - citizens outside of legal procedures .", "CARDINAL . The NORP authorities have indicated that they are closely monitoring the situation and that mechanisms are in place to effectively sanction such abuses . For example , ORG of ORG was established in DATE and is responsible for conducting investigations , particularly into acts of torture and violation of human dignity . The police \u2013specifically police officers working in another sector than that of the person under suspicion - and the prosecution equally have competence over such matters and must inform the above - mentioned body when dealing with a case in which a police officer is implicated . ORG is also competent for investigating , either on request or ex officio , allegations of misbehaviour by a police officer , but he is only entitled to recommend that appropriate measures be taken . ORG welcomes the fact that the chief state prosecutor recently reminded his subordinates of the need for cases of police ill - treatment , particularly involving non - citizens , to be prevented and prosecuted with the appropriate degree of severity . The authorities have pointed out that instances of ill - treatment were primarily due to difficult conditions of detention . ORG notes with satisfaction cases of law enforcement officials having been prosecuted , and in some cases penalised , for acts of ill - treatment . However , human rights NGOs draw attention to other cases where impunity is allegedly enjoyed by officials responsible for acts of violence , whose prosecution has not lead to results or even been initiated . ECRI deplores such a situation and hopes that it will no longer be tolerated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In their joint report published in DATE ( \u201c Cleaning Operations \u2013 Excluding GPE in GPE \u201d ) , ORG and ORG , which represent the applicants in the instant case , stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ORG / GHM monitoring of policing in GPE over DATE suggests that ill - treatment , including physical and racist verbal abuse , of GPE in police custody is common . Although NORP authorities deny racial motivation behind the ill - treatment of GPE , NORP victims with whom PERSON / PERSON spoke testified that police officers verbally abused them using racist epithets .", "Anti - Romani sentiment among police officers often leads to instances of harassment , inhuman and degrading treatment , verbal and physical abuse , and arbitrary arrest and detention of GPE at the hands of police . The ORG and ORG regularly document ill - treatment of GPE at the hands of the police , either at the moment of arrest or in police custody . Police ORG use of racial epithets in some cases of police abuse of GPE is indicative that racial prejudice plays a role in the hostile treatment to which officers subject GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
