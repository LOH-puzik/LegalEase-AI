On DATE the applicant was released from custody , but was subjected to another preventive measure in the form of a ban on leaving his place of residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was re - arrested on suspicion of CARDINAL further acts of burglary , CARDINAL of which had been committed DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with CARDINAL counts of burglary and the police investigator requested ORG ( NORP PERSON ) to apply the preventive custody measure until DATE . The investigator noted that the applicant had no fixed residence and considered that he could , if released , continue to commit offences , evade investigation and abscond .", "The applicant stated in writing that he did not wish to participate in the hearing before ORG concerning the investigator 's request and that he did not consider the presence of his lawyer there necessary either .", "On DATE , i.e. , DATE , ORG authorised the applicant 's detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was charged with additional counts of burglary , committed together with CARDINAL minors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator applied for an extension of the applicant 's detention . Having noted that the applicant had been charged with additional crimes , that he had no fixed residence or place of work and that he had CARDINAL prior criminal convictions , the investigator found that the applicant could , while at liberty , re - offend , evade investigation and flee . The investigator also noted that the applicant had confessed to the charges .", "The applicant did not wish to participate in the hearing before ORG , which allowed the investigator 's request and prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE .", "On DATE ORG granted the investigator 's request to prolong the applicant 's detention further until DATE .

The extension was valid until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing on the further prolongation of the applicant 's detention . It heard the applicant and his lawyer as well as the investigator . It rejected the applicant 's request to be released and extended his detention until DATE . The court found that the applicant had no place of residence , family or work . If released , he could continue committing offences in order to support himself , and also evade investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator drew up a final indictment which included an additional charge of inducing minors to participate in a crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing to decide on the investigator 's request to extend the applicant 's detention until DATE having regard to the large volume of the criminal case . The applicant and his lawyer , who both took part in the hearing , objected to the request . ORG decided to allow the request and to extend the applicant 's detention . It noted that the applicant had prior criminal convictions and that he had no place of residence or work . He had been charged with several offences for which he could be sentenced to imprisonment . There was thus reason to believe that he could abscond or commit new offences , if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the applicant and his lawyer on the sixth application by the investigator to extend the applicant 's detention . Noting again that the applicant had no place of residence , work or family to support him , it decided to prolong his detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

DATE the public prosecutor approved the bill of indictment and the case was sent to ORG for trial .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , having reviewed the case - file from the prosecution , committed the applicant for trial . In respect of detention it was ordered in the decision : \u201c To leave unchanged the preventive custody measure chosen with respect to the accused at trial . \u201d The decision did not specify until when the applicant had to be kept in detention .

The applicant did not receive a copy of the court decision , but was notified by the public prosecutor of the renewal of his detention on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that he was dissatisfied with the investigator who had refused to arrange his confrontation with witnesses . He considered that the investigation had been incomplete and asked the court to send the case back to the relevant authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed another complaint with ORG , arguing that his detention after DATE was unlawful and requesting his release from custody . He submitted that under LAW ( LAW ) notification of a prolongation of detention should reach the place of detention before the expiry of the previous order . He , however , received the notification only on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before ORG on DATE the applicant pleaded guilty to the charges of burglary , but denied that he had induced CARDINAL minors , GPE and GPE , to participate in his criminal activity .

On DATE ORG informed the applicant of the date of its preliminary hearing , noting that his presence was mandatory .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a preliminary hearing which the applicant did not attend , ORG quashed the judgment of ORG on procedural grounds and remitted the case to it for a new consideration with a different composition . It found that the lower court judgment was not reasoned and that its hearing records were incomprehensible . Moreover , as the applicant suffered from a mental handicap , it was necessary to have a psychiatric expert opinion on his mental state . Neither the decision nor TIME of the hearing made reference to the applicant 's request for release or dealt with the issue of detention pending final conviction and sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to ORG asking it , without specifying the reasons , to call his witness PERSON also informed ORG that in his view he had the right to be released .", "The following day the applicant filed an appeal against ORG decision of DATE with ORG , submitting that neither ORG nor ORG had indicated on what ground he was being detained .

He also requested his release from custody .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before ORG on DATE , where the applicant was not present , the defence lawyer maintained the applicant 's appeal and submitted , in addition , that the applicant had not been aware of the prolongation of his detention by a decision of ORG of DATE as a copy of the decision had not been sent to him .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It considered that the time - limit of DATE for pre - trial detention under LAW had not been exceeded . The applicant had been taken into custody on DATE and on DATE he was committed for trial and ordered to remain in custody . In response to the defence lawyer 's argument , ORG stated that , according to LAW , a copy of the court decision committing the accused for trial was to be sent to the person only if the court changed a preventive measure \u2013 which was not the applicant 's case . The applicant , however , had the opportunity to consult the decision in his criminal case - file .", "ORG noted that , in remitting the case back to the first instance court , ORG should have indicated , for the sake of clarity , that the preventive custody measure in respect of the applicant remained in force . Nonetheless , the absence of that indication did not render the applicant 's detention unlawful . In sending the case back for a new consideration , ORG restored the procedural stage which came about following the applicant 's committal for trial on DATE .

On DATE ORG held a new hearing on the applicant 's case . It heard CARDINAL witnesses , including GPE and GPE The applicant requested that an additional witness , PERSON , be called to testify . The witness could provide information on the applicant 's place of residence after DATE . The court rejected the request on the ground that the testimony of the proposed witness was irrelevant .

By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , having analysed the evidence in the case , including the testimonies of witnesses , found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment . It left unchanged the preventive custody measure applied to him , without putting forward any specific reasons for that .", "CARDINAL .

He also demanded his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held a hearing , upheld the applicant 's conviction , but reduced his sentence to DATE imprisonment .
