ORG to the United Nations was informed of that opinion by a letter dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant company was informed by ORG that C - Check had been completed and that , on payment of CARDINAL , the aircraft would be released .

The members of ORG also recalled the provisions of paragraph CARDINAL of [ Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) of ORG ] regarding such aircraft , under which the aircraft in question should have already been impounded by the NORP authorities . ORG , therefore , would be extremely grateful for being apprised of any action on behalf of Your Excellency 's Government to that effect . \u201d", "By a letter dated DATE , ORG informed ORG that the aircraft had been detained on CARDINAL DATE and formally impounded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to ORG , the applicant company challenged the impoundment , arguing that the purpose of Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was not to deal simply with legal ownership , but rather with operational control . On DATE the ORG replied :", "\u201c The Minister is advised that the intention and effect of the ORG resolution as implemented through [ Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] is to impose sanctions by impounding the types of commercial asset mentioned in DATE , including aircraft , in any case where a person or undertaking in or operating from the [ FRY ] has any ownership interest of the kind mentioned . As this view of the scope and effect of the original resolution has been confirmed by ORG ] , the Minister does not feel entitled to apply [ Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] in a manner which would depart from that approach . ... the aircraft must remain impounded . ... the Minister appreciates the difficulty that [ the applicant company ] finds itself in and would be anxious to find any solution that was available to him under [ Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] which would permit the release of the aircraft . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the NORP embassy in GPE repeated its request for the release of the aircraft , stating that the NORP government would ensure impoundment in accordance with the sanctions . The NORP government indicated to ORG , by a letter of DATE , that it would be favourably disposed to grant that request . On CARDINAL August DATE ORG ruled that the aircraft had to remain in GPE , since the relevant resolutions required ORG to withhold all services from the aircraft , including services that would enable it to fly .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company applied for leave to seek judicial review of the Minister 's decision to impound the aircraft . Amended grounds were later lodged taking issue with ORG 's role in the impoundment . On DATE the High Court struck out TEAM as a respondent in the proceedings , the applicant company 's dispute with ORG being a private - law matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company 's managing director explained in evidence that rental payments due to ORG had been set off against the deposits initially paid to ORG and that future rental payments were to be paid into a blocked bank account supervised by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON delivered the judgment of ORG . The issue before him could , he believed , be simply defined as the question of whether ORG was bound by LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL to impound the applicant company 's aircraft . He considered ORG letter of DATE to the applicant company to be the most helpful explanation of the Minister 's reasoning . He found that :", "\u201c ... it is common case that the transaction between ORG and [ the applicant company ] was entirely bona fide . There is no question of ORG having any interest direct or indirect in [ the applicant company ] or in the management , supervision or direction of the business of that company . ...", "It is , however , common case that [ resolutions of ORG ] do not form part of NORP domestic law and , accordingly , would not of themselves justify the Minister in impounding the aircraft . The real significance of the [ resolutions of ORG ] , in so far as they relate to the present proceedings , is that [ Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) of ORG ] ... provided the genesis for DATE Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In interpreting Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL , Mr Justice PERSON had regard to its purpose . He found the aircraft not to be one to which Article CARDINAL applied , as it was not an aircraft in which a majority or controlling interest was held by a person or undertaking in or operating from the former NORP , and that the decision of the Minister to impound was therefore ultra vires . However , the aircraft was , at that stage , the subject of an injunction obtained ( in DATE ) by a creditor of ORG ( ORG ) preventing it from leaving the country . That injunction was later discharged on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having indicated to the applicant company that the Minister for Transport was investigating a further impoundment based on Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL(e ) of Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG informed the applicant company by a letter of CARDINAL DATE of the following :", "\u201c The Minister has now considered the continuing position of the aircraft in the light of the recent ruling of ORG and the provisions of LAW referred to .", "Arising out of the Minister 's consideration , I am now directed to inform you that the Minister has ... directed that the aircraft ... be detained pursuant to LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] as an aircraft which is suspected of having violated the provisions of that regulation and particularly LAW and [ Regulation ( ORG ) no . ] CARDINAL . The aircraft will remain detained pending completion of the Minister 's investigation of the suspected violation as required under LAW [ ( ORG ) no . ] CARDINAL/CARDINAL . \u201d", "Although not noted in that letter , the Minister 's concern related to the applicant company 's setting off of ORG 's financial obligations ( certain insurance , maintenance and other liabilities ) under the lease against the rental monies already paid by it into the blocked bank account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) . Although it temporarily suspended the sanctions as peace negotiations had begun , it did not apply to aircraft already impounded . It was implemented by Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company was given leave to apply for judicial review of the Minister 's decision to re - impound the aircraft . By a judgment of DATE , the High Court quashed the Minister 's decision to redetain the aircraft . It noted that almost all of the monies which had been paid into the blocked account by the applicant company had by then been used up ( with the consent of the holding bank in GPE ) in order to discharge ORG 's liabilities under the lease . The crucial question before ORG was the Minister 's delay in raising LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL given that the applicant company was an \u201c innocent \u201d party suffering heavy DATE losses . ORG found that the Minister had failed in his duty to investigate and decide such matters within a reasonable period of time , to conduct the investigations in accordance with fair procedures and to have proper regard for the rights of the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP government appealed to ORG and applied for a stay on ORG order . On DATE ORG refused the Minister 's application for a stay . The overriding consideration in deciding to grant the stay or not was to find a balance which did not deny justice to either party . Noting the significant delay of the Minister in raising Article CARDINAL ) and the potentially minor damage to the ORG ( monies owed for the maintenance and parking in FAC ) compared to the applicant company 's huge losses , the justice of the case was overwhelmingly in the latter 's favour .", "CARDINAL . The aircraft was therefore free to leave . By letters dated CARDINAL and DATE , the applicant company , ORG and ORG were informed that the Minister considered that he no longer had any legal responsibility for the aircraft .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for Transport lodged an appeal in ORG against the High Court judgment of DATE . He took issue with ORG interpretation of Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and requested a preliminary reference to the ECJ ( Article CARDINAL , now Article CARDINAL , of the LAW establishing ORG \u2013 \u201c the LAW \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . By an order dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG referred the following question to the ECJ and adjourned the proceedings before it :", "\u201c Is LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] to be construed as applying to an aircraft which is owned by an undertaking the majority or controlling interest in which is held by [ the FRY ] where such aircraft has been leased by the owner for a term of DATE from DATE to an undertaking the majority or controlling interest in which is not held by a person or undertaking in or operating from the said [ FRY ] ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . The parties made submissions to the ECJ . The applicant company noted that it was ironic that , following LAW ( DATE ) of ORG , ORG aircraft could fly whereas its own remained grounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Advocate General PERSON delivered his opinion . Given the majority interest of ORG in the aircraft , LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL applied to it . The Advocate General disagreed with ORG , considering that neither the aims nor the texts of the relevant resolutions of ORG provided any reason to depart from what he considered to be the clear wording of LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . As to the question of the respect shown in that regulation for fundamental rights and proportionality , the Advocate General pointed out :", "\u201c It is well established that respect for fundamental rights forms part of the general principles of Community law , and that in ensuring respect for such rights , the [ ECJ ] takes account of the constitutional traditions of ORG and of international agreements , notably [ the Convention ] , which has a special significance in that respect .", "Article ORG ) of the Treaty on NORP Union ... gives LAW expression to the [ ECJ 's ] case - law . ... In relation to LAW , it confirms and consolidates the [ ECJ 's ] case - law underlining the paramount importance of respect for fundamental rights .", "Respect for fundamental rights is thus a condition of the lawfulness of ORG acts \u2013 in this case , the ORG . Fundamental rights must also , of course , be respected by Member GPE when they implement Community measures . All Member GPE are in any event parties to the [ Convention ] , even though it does not have the status of domestic law in all of them . Although the ORG itself is not a party to the ORG , and can not become a party without amendment both of the LAW and of the LAW , and although the LAW may not be formally binding upon the ORG , nevertheless for practical purposes the LAW can be regarded as part of Community law and can be invoked as such both in the [ ECJ ] and in national courts where Community law is in issue . That is so particularly where , as in this case , it is the implementation of Community law by Member PERSON which is in issue . Community law can not release Member GPE from their obligations under the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Advocate General noted that the applicant company had relied on the right to peaceful enjoyment of property , protected by the ORG , and the right to pursue a commercial activity , recognised as a fundamental right by the ECJ . Having considered PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , he defined the essential question as being whether the interference with the applicant company 's possession of the aircraft was a proportionate measure in the light of the aims of general interest Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL sought to achieve . He had regard to the application of this test in ORG v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and ORG v. GPE ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) and to a \u201c similar approach \u201d adopted by the ECJ in cases concerning the right to property or the right to pursue a commercial activity ( including PERSON v. PERSON , Case DATE ] ORG Reports ( ECR ) CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . While there had been a severe interference with the applicant company 's interest in the lease , it was difficult to identify a stronger type of public interest than that of stopping a devastating civil war . While some property loss was inevitable for any sanctions to be effective , if it were demonstrated that the interference in question was wholly unreasonable in the light of the aims sought to be achieved , then the ECJ would intervene . However , the Advocate General felt that neither the initial decision to impound nor the continued retention of the aircraft could be regarded as unreasonable .", "CARDINAL . Whether or not the financial impact of the sanctions were as outlined by the applicant company , a general measure of the kind in question could not be set aside simply because of the financial consequences the measure might have in a particular case . Given the strength of the public interest involved , the proportionality principle would not be infringed by any such losses .", "CARDINAL . The Advocate General concluded that the contested decision did not", "\u201c ... strike an unfair balance between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual 's fundamental rights . That conclusion seems consistent with the case - law of [ this ORG ] in general . Nor has [ the applicant company ] suggested that there is any case - law under [ the LAW ] supporting its own conclusion .", "The position seems to be no different if CARDINAL refers to the fundamental rights as they result from ' the constitutional traditions common to the Member GPE ' referred to in the case - law of [ the ECJ ] and in Article ORG ) of the Treaty on ORG . In the [ above - cited PERSON case , the ECJ ] pointed out ... , referring specifically to ORG , LAW and LAW , that the constitutional rules and practices of the Member GPE permit the legislature to control the use of private property in accordance with the general interest . Again it has not been suggested that there is any case - law supporting the view that the contested decision infringed fundamental rights . The decision of ORG was based , as we have seen , on different grounds . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , TEAM informed ORG that the aircraft was free to leave provided that debts owed to ORG were discharged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ECJ ruled that Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL applied to the type of aircraft referred to in ORG question to it . The ECJ noted that the domestic proceedings showed that the aircraft lease had been entered into \u201c in complete good faith \u201d and was not intended to circumvent the sanctions against the FRY .", "CARDINAL . It did not accept the applicant company 's first argument that Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL did not apply because of the control on a DATE basis of the aircraft by an innocent non - FRY party . Having considered the wording of Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , its context and aims ( including the text and aims of ORG resolutions it implemented ) , it found nothing to support the distinction made by the applicant company . Indeed , the use of DATE operation and control as opposed to ownership as a criterion for applying the regulation would jeopardise the effectiveness of the sanctions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company 's second argument was that the application of Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL would infringe its right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions and its freedom to pursue a commercial activity because it would destroy and obliterate the business of a wholly innocent party when the FRY owners had already been punished by having their bank accounts blocked . The ECJ did not find this persuasive :", "\u201c It is settled case - law that the fundamental rights invoked by [ the applicant company ] are not absolute and their exercise may be subject to restrictions justified by objectives of general interest pursued by ORG ( see [ the above - cited PERSON case ] ; Case DATE , ORG v. GPE fuer GPE und Forstwirtschaft [ DATE ] ECR CARDINAL ; and Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , GPE v. Council [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL ) .", "Any measure imposing sanctions has , by definition , consequences which affect the right to property and the freedom to pursue a trade or business , thereby causing harm to persons who are in no way responsible for the situation which led to the adoption of the sanctions .", "Moreover , the importance of the aims pursued by the regulation at issue is such as to justify negative consequences , even of a substantial nature , for some operators .", "The provisions of [ Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] contribute in particular to the implementation at Community level of the sanctions against the [ FRY ] adopted , and later strengthened , by several resolutions of ORG of ORG . ...", "It is in the light of those circumstances that the aim pursued by the sanctions assumes a special importance , which is , in particular , in terms of [ Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] and more especially the eighth recital in the preamble thereto , to dissuade the [ FRY ] from ' further violating the integrity and security of GPE and to induce NORP party to cooperate in the restoration of peace in this LOC ' .", "As compared with an objective of general interest so fundamental for the international community , which consists in putting an end to the state of war in the region and to the massive violations of human rights and humanitarian international law in GPE , the impounding of the aircraft in question , which is owned by an undertaking based in or operating from the [ FRY ] , can not be regarded as inappropriate or disproportionate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The answer to ORG question was therefore :", "\u201c LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL of DATE concerning trade between ORG and the [ FRY ] applies to an aircraft which is owned by an undertaking based in or operating from the [ FRY ] , even though the owner has leased it for DATE to another undertaking , neither based in nor operating from [ the FRY ] and in which no person or undertaking based in or operating from [ the FRY ] has a majority or controlling interest . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister reinstated the impounding of the aircraft under LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By a notice of motion dated DATE , the applicant company applied to ORG for , inter alia , an order determining the action \u201c in the light of the decision of the [ ECJ ] \u201d and for an order providing for the costs of ORG and ECJ proceedings . The grounding affidavit of the applicant company of the same date stressed its bona fides , the benefit of having had the ECJ examine the regulation for the first time , the fact that ultimate responsibility for its predicament lay with the FRY authorities and that its operations had been destroyed by the impoundment . It referred to Regulation ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL , noting that it did not allow aircraft already impounded to fly whereas those not previously impounded could do so . Since its aircraft was the only CARDINAL impounded under the sanctions regime , no other lessee could have initiated the action it had in order to clarify the meaning of the relevant regulation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment allowing the appeal of ORG from the order of ORG of DATE . It noted that the sole issue in the case was whether the Minister had been bound by LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL to impound the aircraft . Having noted the answer of the ECJ , ORG simply stated that it was bound by that decision and the Minister 's appeal was allowed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG allowed the appeal from the order of ORG of DATE . Given the intervening rulings of the ECJ and of ORG ( of DATE and DATE , respectively ) , the appeal was moot since , from DATE of the initial order of impoundment , the aircraft had been lawfully detained under LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . There was no order as to costs .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company 's leases on both aircraft had expired by DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Further to the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph DATE above ) and given the relaxation of the sanctions regime ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , PERSON and the Minister for Transport reached an agreement in DATE concerning the latter 's costs .
