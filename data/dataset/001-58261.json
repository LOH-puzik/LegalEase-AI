They argued that there was a contradiction between the finding of the ORG that no physical force had been used and the conclusion of the GMPO , which established that there had been use of physical force , but that it had been legal , and they alleged violations of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL .
