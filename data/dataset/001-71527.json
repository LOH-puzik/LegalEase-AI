She is represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON and PERSON Klaus - Ulrich Ventzke , CARDINAL lawyers practising in GPE .", "The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , ORG , and , subsequently , PERSON PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , ORG - \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a left - wing extremist terrorist movement , was founded in GPE . Its members intended to destroy the public order of GPE by terrorist action , in particular murder , attacks with explosives and the taking of hostages , in order to bring about a radical change of NORP society . Following a series of attacks in DATE , several \u201c ORG \u201d members were arrested . CARDINAL founding members , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , were sentenced to life imprisonment in DATE .", "As early as DATE , the \u201c ORG \u201d had launched terrorist attacks for the liberation of detained members . In DATE , hostages were taken at ORG in GPE . In DATE , ORG ( ORG ) PERSON was shot . In DATE , an attempt to kidnap a member of the management of the ORG ORG , PERSON , failed and he was shot . In DATE , \u201c ORG \u201d members tried to attack the building of ORG .", "On DATE members of the \u201c ORG \u201d kidnapped Dr ORG , a NORP industrialist and President of the NORP ORG , in GPE ; his driver and CARDINAL policemen were killed immediately .", "On CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL members of a \u201c Special Command \u201d ( \u201c PFLPSC \u201d ) of ORG for ORG ( \u201c LOC ) with headquarters first in GPE and later in GPE , hijacked the ORG aircraft Landshut on a flight from GPE to GPE / Main . The hijackers threatened to kill their CARDINAL hostages and to blow up the aircraft if their demands for the liberation of CARDINAL \u201c ORG \u201d members detained in GPE and CARDINAL \u201c NORP \u201d members imprisoned in GPE were not met . They forced the pilot to change destination and the plane subsequently landed in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , where the leader of the hijackers shot the captain of the aircraft for alleged disobedience . The aircraft then left for GPE , GPE , on DATE . On DATE , shortly after TIME , the hostages were liberated by members of a special unit ( \u201c ORG CARDINAL \u201d ) of the NORP ORG . CARDINAL of the hijackers were killed and the fourth , a woman , was seriously injured . The terrorists shot at CARDINAL members of the \u201c ORG CARDINAL \u201d and seriously injured them . CARDINAL hostages were injured by a hijacker . All remaining hostages , who had been subjected to continued threats to their lives throughout the kidnapping , survived .", "Following the failure of the hijacking , Mr Schleyer was killed by \u201c ORG \u201d members . The CARDINAL \u201c ORG \u201d founding members detained in ORG prison committed suicide in TIME of DATE .", "In DATE the \u201c ORG \u201d announced in a written declaration that they would suspend the attacks on representatives of the ORG and the economy .", "In DATE the surviving fourth hijacker was convicted of , inter alia , murder , the taking of hostages , kidnapping , attack on air traffic and attempted murder . She was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "On DATE , the applicant was arrested by the NORP police following an arrest warrant issued by ORG of ORG on DATE . She was suspected , in connection with the DATE hijacking of the ORG aircraft Landshut , of having acted as an accomplice to an attack on air traffic and the taking of hostages . Furthermore , she was suspected of having aided and abetted the kidnapping of ORG . The applicant was taken into detention on remand . She was released on CARDINAL DATE , when the arrest warrant was quashed . Following further investigations , the applicant was again arrested on DATE .", "In the criminal proceedings against her , the applicant was assisted by several defence counsel .", "On DATE , ORG at ORG preferred the indictment against the applicant , charging her , in connection with the Landshut hijacking , of having acted as an accomplice of acts of kidnapping , attack on air traffic , extortion , murder and attempted murder , and , in connection with the kidnapping of ORG , of having aided and abetted kidnapping , extortion and homicide .", "On DATE , the GPE / ORG , following numerous hearings DATE and DATE , convicted the applicant of having aided and abetted an attack on air traffic , the taking of hostages , extortionate kidnapping and attempted murder on CARDINAL counts in connection with the Landshut hijacking . As regards the kidnapping of Mr Schleyer , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s intent to aid and abet this offence had not been proved . She was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "In its long and detailed decision , ORG , having regard to the applicant \u2019s personal background , noted in particular that the applicant had sympathised with the \u201c ORG \u201d and had participated in shooting trainings in CARDINAL of the military training camps of the \u201c NORP \u201d in GPE , GPE . The applicant had confirmed that she was known as \u201c NORP \u201d there , had married a leading \u201c LOC member under NORP law and had lived there DATE , together with their son , born in DATE , and their daughter , born on CARDINAL DATE .", "ORG found that on DATE CARDINAL \u201c ORG \u201d members , witnesses Mr PERSON and Ms M. , had taken a flight to GPE to meet members of the \u201c ORG \u201d in order to prepare the LOC hijacking . They had accepted the offer of the \u201c ORG \u201d to support their terrorist activities for the liberation of \u201c ORG \u201d members by hijacking a NORP aircraft . The leader of the \u201c ORG \u201d had then instructed the applicant and PERSON , a \u201c NORP \u201d member , to bring the weapons and the explosives needed for the hijacking to GPE . The applicant had received the weapons and the explosives in GPE on DATE or shortly before . On DATE , she had taken a plane , together with PERSON and her daughter , to GPE , transporting the weapons and the explosives in her cabin baggage . She had then handed over the material to a NORP called PERSON .", "ORG based its findings as to the applicant \u2019s participation in the offences essentially on the evidence given by PERSON", "The court observed that PERSON could not be questioned at the trial , as he was serving a prison sentence in GPE . The NORP authorities had refused to transfer him to GPE for the purposes of the proceedings , even though the Investigating Judge at ORG had given the assurance of safe conduct ( sicheres PERSON ) .", "ORG therefore relied on the depositions of the witnesses Mr PERSON and Mr S. , officers of ORG . They had been present together with an interpreter when PERSON had been questioned by the NORP police on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE in the course of preliminary investigations of the NORP prosecution authorities against himself and the applicant \u2019s husband .", "According to Mr PERSON and Mr S. , PERSON had initially denied having participated in the Landshut hijacking or having any knowledge thereof , as well as having been engaged in any other terrorist acts of the \u201c NORP \u201d . On DATE of questioning , PERSON had been very nervous and had given the impression that he was not telling the truth . During the second questioning , he had asked for DATE of reflection . At his third interrogation , PERSON , who had appeared relieved and calm , had announced that he would tell the full truth . He had admitted that he had been a member of the \u201c NORP \u201d since DATE . Furthermore , he had stated that in DATE , DATE before the Landshut hijacking , the leader of the \u201c ORG \u201d had instructed him to travel to GPE together with a NORP woman called \u201c Amal \u201d in order to transport weapons from GPE to GPE . In GPE , \u201c NORP \u201d had received weapons and explosives , hidden in a radio and in candy boxes . These weapons had been destined for hijacking an aircraft . DATE before the Landshut hijacking , he had travelled with \u201c NORP \u201d , accompanied by her daughter , from GPE to GPE with an NORP passport issued to \u201c PERSON \u201d . \u201c NORP \u201d had transported the weapons in her cabin baggage . In GPE she had handed this material over to a NORP called \u201c PERSON . They returned by plane to GPE via GPE DATE .", "Regarding the use in evidence of PERSON statements , ORG considered that , on the basis of the clear and concurring statements of witnesses PERSON and PERSON and the letters rogatory issued by ORG , it was established that PERSON had been informed by the NORP police officers about his rights as an accused under NORP law , namely to remain silent and to request the taking of specific evidence for his defence . ORG further found that no unlawful means had been used to obtain PERSON statements . According to witnesses PERSON and PERSON , the NORP authorities had no interest of their own in these investigations , and there had been nothing to suggest that PERSON had been ill - treated or threatened or that promises had been made . Moreover , there was no indication that the statements made by PERSON had been the result of leading questions .", "Recalling that a cautious approach was required in assessing statements of a witness who had not been heard at the trial and to whom the parties to the proceedings could not put any questions , ORG found that PERSON statements as to \u201c PERSON \u2019s \u201d , i.e. the applicant \u2019s , participation in the hijacking were credible . In this respect , ORG took into account that the witnesses PERSON and PERSON had given an account of PERSON . S. \u2019s demeanour during the interrogations under letters rogatory and had been able to put questions to him , and that PERSON was not an anonymous witness .", "Furthermore , ORG found that witness PERSON , when heard again under letters rogatory by ORG in the course of this trial on DATE , had confirmed having travelled from PERSON to PERSON in DATE together with a NORP woman . He had , however , denied that they had transported any weapons . The court considered that the records of his questioning could be read out at the trial as the witness , who was still serving a prison sentence in GPE , was out of reach . The fact that the public prosecutor , the applicant and her defence counsel had had no opportunity to attend the questioning did not exclude the use in evidence of PERSON statements . According to ORG , the foreign procedural rules had to be observed in the first place , which in the instant case did not require the presence of the parties to the present proceedings at the questioning . In its letters rogatory , ORG had informed ORG that under NORP law , the parties to the proceedings were entitled to attend such a questioning and had invited it to notify it of the date of the questioning , should such presence be possible under NORP law . Nevertheless , bearing in mind the limitations on the rights of the defence , ORG decided not to consider these statements as evidence which could stand on its own . It noted , however , that PERSON had no reason wrongfully to incriminate both himself and the applicant .", "ORG argued that the discrepancies between PERSON statements at this hearing as opposed to his submission at his hearing in DATE had occurred because the NORP court had not sufficiently confronted the applicant with his earlier statements . This was attributable to the fact that the parties to the proceedings had not been allowed to attend this questioning . However , a further hearing of PERSON under letters rogatory , as requested by the applicant , or further investigations to obtain evidence as to the circumstances in which PERSON statements had been made were not called for . Only Said S. \u2019s hearing in person at the trial would have been suitable to rebut the evidence already obtained at that stage .", "Furthermore , ORG found that other important evidence confirmed PERSON statements .", "Thus witness P. , a high - ranking official of ORG , had indicated that already on DATE ORG had been notified by an informer that CARDINAL persons using the names \u201c PERSON \u201d , \u201c PERSON \u201d and \u201c PERSON \u201d , born on CARDINAL DATE ( the date of birth of the applicant \u2019s daughter ) , had travelled from GPE to GPE on DATE . The CARDINAL adults were associated with terrorist organisations . P. had refused to disclose the identity of the informer or the documents concerned . ORG noted that its requests addressed to ORG and ORG for the ORG for disclosure of these sources and documents had been refused for good reasons , namely , the necessity to protect life and limb of persons who were not within NORP jurisdiction . It accepted the authorities\u2019 argument that notably the applicant \u2019s husband , a former leading member of the \u201c NORP \u201d whom the applicant had kept informed about the proceedings against her , was still capable of organising assassinations of or acts of revenge against witnesses incriminating the applicant .", "Moreover , witness PERSON , a high - ranking official of ORG , had stated that in DATE a reliable informer had identified the applicant as \u201c NORP \u201d on photographs . Another informer had notified ORG that a woman called \u201c NORP \u201d had travelled with a \u201c LOC member and a baby from GPE to GPE , and had also known the false names and the numbers and origin of the passports used by them . Subsequent investigations had shown that the passport carried by \u201c NORP \u201d , issued to \u201c PERSON , born PERSON \u201d , had been stolen in the GPE and that the passport used by PERSON was a fake of the same type as the passports later used by the hijackers . The informer in question had identified the applicant on photographs as \u201c NORP \u201d and as the person transporting the weapons and explosives . Witness PERSON had stated that he was not entitled to disclose the identity of the informers . ORG requests to ORG and ORG for the ORG for disclosure of the identity of its informers equally remained unsuccessful . Both authorities invoked the need to protect live and limb of their informers for the same reasons as those given with respect to the informer whose statements were reported by witness P.", "ORG noted that the statements made by PERSON and the evidence supplied by anonymous informers were further corroborated by the results of investigations into the passenger lists of the flights from GPE to GPE on DATE and from GPE to GPE - Orly on DATE . These lists contained references to the false names used by PERSON , the applicant and her daughter . ORG equally took into account evidence of the applicant \u2019s and PERSON stay at a hotel in GPE . It had regard to bills bearing the names \u201c PERSON \u201d and \u201c PERSON \u201d , and to explanations given by the managing director of the hotel who had indicated that CARDINAL of his employees had remembered that a man with an NORP name accompanied by a NORP woman and a small child had stayed at the hotel at the relevant time .", "As far as the number and types of weapons and explosives used were concerned , ORG had heard several witnesses and had regard to photographs contained in the file , showing inter alia the radio serving as a hiding place for the weapons , which had been found in the aircraft .", "Moreover , ORG took into account the applicant \u2019s own statement that PERSON had been a member of the \u201c NORP \u201d and had been on GPE DATE prior to the Landshut hijacking together with the surviving hijacker .", "As to the applicant \u2019s defence , ORG found that there was nothing to show that she had not left GPE at the relevant time , in particular that her young child had been seriously ill . Furthermore , witness B. , the \u201c ORG \u201d member who had met \u201c PFLP \u201d members in GPE at DATE and in DATE , had stated that he had seen the applicant in GPE . ORG , in concluding that PERSON \u2019s depositions were credible , had notably regard to the consistency of his statements , the detailed account of his meeting with the applicant and the fact that as a former \u201c ORG \u201d member , he did not have reasons to incriminate the applicant wrongfully . The statements made by PERSON Ms M. , CARDINAL \u201c ORG \u201d members , and by the applicant \u2019s son to the effect that they had not seen the applicant leaving GPE and being in GPE did not refute PERSON \u2019s depositions .", "In ORG view , the applicant had strong motives to participate in the hijacking , especially since her husband had played a leading role in organising it . Moreover , since DATE she had assisted , as a \u201c ORG \u201d sympathiser , the CARDINAL \u201c ORG \u201d members detained in GPE .", "On DATE , ORG , following an oral hearing , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It noted that ORG had found the applicant \u2019s participation in the offences in question to be established by the statements made by PERSON in the course of his interrogation by the NORP police in the presence of NORP police officers . PERSON had confirmed in substance these depositions when he was questioned under letters rogatory by ORG . His statements had been confirmed by numerous other items of evidence , such as material obtained from informers , passenger lists and hotel bills , as well as statements made by the former \u201c ORG \u201d member B.", "As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint about the use in evidence of the oral testimony of witnesses P. and PERSON , ORG found that there was no breach of LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( d ) of the Convention due to the fact that the informers themselves could not be questioned . It considered that ORG had correctly taken a cautious approach in assessing this evidence and had merely considered it as corroborating the statements of witness PERSON and other items of evidence .", "Moreover , referring to the case - law of ORG ( in particular PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE ) , ORG considered that , unlike the said case , the present case did not concern statements made by anonymous police officers . The informers who had remained anonymous were obviously persons operating abroad in cooperation with the NORP authorities to combat international terrorism . These persons and their families were particularly exposed to the risk of acts of revenge by terrorist organisations and would be generally endangered if identified . In any event , their depositions had not been the basis for the applicant \u2019s conviction , but merely corroborating evidence . ORG cautious approach in assessing the evidence obtained from anonymous informers had counterbalanced the limitations on the rights of the defence . In particular , ORG had not only examined whether the authorities\u2019 refusal to disclose the informers\u2019 identities had been arbitrary or obviously erroneous , but had also reached the conclusion that in substance the authorities\u2019 decisions had been reasonable and convincing .", "According to ORG , the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG had examined witness PERSON on oath was well - founded . In this respect , it noted that there was no indication in the trial record or in the reasoning of the judgment that ORG had considered that , on account of his possible participation in the offences concerned , Mr B. should not have been administered an oath ( Section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ; see \u2018 Relevant domestic law and ORG below ) . However , this procedural flaw was irrelevant for the outcome of the proceedings . In its detailed assessment of the evidence , in particular of PERSON \u2019s credibility , ORG had not mentioned that PERSON had been administered an oath . Therefore , it could be excluded that ORG had found the witness more credible due to the fact that he had made his statements on oath .", "On DATE , the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , alleging that the criminal proceedings against her , in particular the taking and assessment of the key evidence for the prosecution , had been unfair .", "On DATE , the GPE / ORG ordered that the remainder of the applicant \u2019s prison sentence be suspended on probation . It found that the applicant , having regard to the length of her detention on remand , had already served CARDINAL of her prison sentence . It fixed a probationary period of DATE .", "On DATE , a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "ORG found that the examination of the complaint was not necessary for the protection of the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights . The impugned decisions could not be objected to from a constitutional point of view , although the application of the procedural rules resulting in the applicant \u2019s conviction might be seen as close to the borderline of what could be accepted under LAW . There was no indication of arbitrariness .", "Referring to its own case - law , to the case - law of ORG and to decisions of ORG , ORG recalled that statements obtained from informers who had not been heard at the trial were , as a rule , not sufficient for a judge to reach a final conclusion as to the truth of this information . That information had to be corroborated by other important aspects and indices . The trial court had to be particularly cautious where , as in the present case , informers of police authorities or intelligence services could not be heard in court for the sole reason that the authorities concerned had refused to disclose their identity or to authorize their officers testifying in court to give evidence in this respect .", "ORG found that in the present case there was an accumulation of hearsay evidence which did not directly relate to the facts to be established , but consisted of circumstantial evidence pointing to such facts . However , the trial court \u2019s assessment and evaluation of evidence had not been confined to the depositions of the police officers PERSON and PERSON concerning the highly incriminating statements made by the accomplice PERSON and to information obtained from police and intelligence service informers operating abroad , as presented by the witnesses PERSON and PERSON Further important circumstantial evidence was the testimony of witness PERSON His statements showed that the applicant \u2019s assertion that she had not been in GPE at the relevant time was wrong , thereby confirming the depositions made by PERSON", "Therefore , ORG view that the criminal proceedings against the applicant , taken as a whole , had not been unfair within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) of the LAW , was unobjectionable , at least from a constitutional point of view .", "The decision was served on DATE .", "Pursuant to the provisions of LAW , a witness shall be examined in person at the main hearing if the proof of a fact in issue is based on that person \u2019s observation . In principle , the witness \u2019s examination may not be replaced by reading out the record of a previous examination or by reading out a written statement ( Section CARDINAL of the said Code ) . According to the constant case - law of ORG , Section CARDINAL permits the hearing of witnesses giving hearsay evidence . In particular , it is possible to hear a police officer on evidence obtained from an informer whose attendance at the hearing can not be secured .", "As an exception to the above - mentioned principle , the examination of a witness or co - accused may be replaced by reading out the written record of his previous examination by a judge . This is permitted if there are insurmountable impediments preventing the witness or co - accused from attending the main hearing for a long or indefinite period of time ( Section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the said Code ) .", "Pursuant to Section CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of the said Code , it is prohibited to administer an oath to a witness who is suspected of having participated in the offence which was the subject - matter of his hearing .", "The public prosecutor , the defendant and defence counsel have the right to be present at the examination of a witness by a judge outside the main hearing ( Section CARDINALc \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) . A defendant who is detained and is represented by counsel is only entitled to be present at hearings of witnesses conducted at the court of the place where he is in custody ( Section CARDINALc \u00a7 CARDINAL of the said Code ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
