The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Pest Central District Court remanded the applicant in custody under LAW ( b ) and ( c ) of LAW , on suspicion of aggravated murder within the meaning of LAW . It summarised the suspicions against him , referred to police reports , an autopsy report , the victim \u2019s medical documents , examinations of various exhibits and witness testimonies , and concluded that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had poisoned the victim on DATE . The court found it established that there was a need for the applicant \u2019s detention , because otherwise he would tamper with evidence by exerting pressure on the witnesses , as evidenced by his previous conduct whereby he had threatened them . It dismissed an argument by the applicant that he had committed the criminal offence DATE before , thus the prosecutor \u2019s office had erred in stating that he could tamper with evidence or influence witnesses . The court also held that the applicant \u2019s \u201c unclear \u201d financial situation and the severity of the possible punishment demonstrated that there was a risk of his absconding . The court gave no consideration to an application by the applicant \u2019s lawyer for the applicant to be placed under house arrest .", "CARDINAL . An appeal against that decision was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Buda Central District Court extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until CARDINAL DATE . It noted again that because of the severity of the possible punishment and the fact that the applicant had neither a permanent address nor a regular income , there were grounds to believe that he would abscond . The court held that there was a risk of his interfering with the investigation if he were to threaten the witnesses or destroy physical evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the conditions for pre - trial detention had not been fulfilled because there was no risk of his absconding or influencing witnesses . He argued that his well - established personal circumstances \u2013 the fact that he lived with his common - law wife and CARDINAL children , his parents , and his brother \u2019s family \u2013 and the fact that he had no criminal record excluded the risk of his absconding . He further submitted that he had cooperated with the investigating authorities . Alternatively , the applicant requested that he be released and placed under house arrest .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE , and the court \u2019s reasoning was that the public interest in the applicant being detained was more important than his interest in his right to liberty being respected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Buda ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court maintained its previous reasons justifying the need for his detention . It emphasised that there was a risk of his absconding , owing to the severity of the possible punishment and the fact that he had no declared employment and had previously not been reachable at his permanent address . It added that , if released , the applicant might influence the witnesses or destroy evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE under LAW ( b ) ( risk of absconding ) and ( c ) ( risk of collusion ) of LAW . As regards the risk of absconding , the court found that although the applicant had previously not been reachable at his permanent address and had only had temporary jobs , his temporary residence had been known and he had no criminal record . However , given the seriousness of the potential punishment and his \u201c unstable \u201d financial circumstances , his presence at the proceedings could only be ensured through the most restrictive measure . As regards the risk of collusion , the court dismissed an argument by the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the prosecution authorities should have questioned all the witnesses by that stage of the proceedings . It held that although the majority of the witnesses had been heard , further questioning could still be necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision under LAW ( b ) and ( c ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was extended on a number of occasions . In particular , on DATE ORG extended his detention until DATE . The court found that he had failed to attach a \u201c hosting declaration \u201d ( befogad\u00f3 nyilatkozat ) and a declaration of his host \u2019s financial capacity to his application to be placed under house arrest . According to the court , although the investigation was about to conclude , based on previous witness testimonies , there was a risk that the applicant would intimidate witnesses . It also held that this last reason could justify the applicant being detained until the closure of the investigation . That decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE . Although by that time the applicant had submitted a hosting declaration , the appeal court objected to his release for the reason that he had not provided a declaration of his host \u2019s financial capacity .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , on CARDINAL DATE ORG held that the unclarified financial situation of the applicant and the seriousness of the crime substantiated the risk of his absconding . It also found , without giving further reasoning , that there were still grounds to believe that at that stage of the proceedings the applicant would influence the witnesses . In an appeal , the applicant argued that the investigating authorities had implemented no procedural measures , the proceedings had been unreasonably lengthy , and previously he had always been reachable at his temporary residence . As regards the risk of his influencing witnesses , the applicant submitted that no such risk could be established DATE after the alleged criminal offence . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , stating that the investigation was being conducted in a timely manner and witness testimonies had previously evidenced that the applicant had tried to exert pressure on the witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was extended by ORG until DATE . The court maintained that , under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW , his detention was still necessary because of the risk of his absconding . It considered that the applicant had no \u201c financial or essential \u201d ties counterbalancing the risk of him escaping an eventual serious punishment . Although he had family ties , a child who was a minor , and a relative willing to give assurances to provide for him if he were released , given the seriousness of the charges , the gravity of the possible punishment and his unstable financial circumstances , there was a real risk that he would abscond . However , the court did not find that the risk of collusion ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of LAW ) was substantiated , since there was no way to influence any of the investigative measures which the prosecution had relied on . In particular , the witness who the investigating authorities still intended to hear was unlikely to testify , given the fact that he was ill and unreachable . The court also considered that although it was likely that the applicant \u2019s acquaintances and relatives had tried to influence witnesses in DATE following the commission of the crime , there was no reliable information that this had actually taken place , and a hypothetical risk of further attempts to do so could not substantiate the risk of collusion .", "CARDINAL . That decision was upheld on appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was extended until DATE . The court agreed with the applicant \u2019s argument that his unsettled personal circumstances could not be relied on to justify his detention after the passing of a lengthy period of time following his arrest . It nonetheless held that , in the absence of any financial ties , his family ties could not counterbalance the risk of his absconding , also having regard to the severity to the potential punishment .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE , and an appeal by the applicant to the effect that less restrictive measures could be applied in his case was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The Budapest High Court extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention on CARDINAL DATE , reiterating the same arguments as before . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s arguments that no investigative measure had been implemented for a considerable period of time . It also found that the hosting declaration of the applicant \u2019s family member , the fact that he was raising a child who was a minor , and the fact that his legal residence had also been clarified were irrelevant , and did not diminish the risk of his absconding . The second - instance court upheld the decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was extended again for DATE under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW . However , ORG expressed doubts as to whether there was enough evidence to conclude that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the crime . It dismissed an argument by the prosecutor \u2019s office that the applicant would hinder the investigation . It considered that , irrespective of the seriousness of the charges , it appeared that there was less risk of his absconding , since he was raising CARDINAL children who were minors and he had no criminal record . On appeal , ORG upheld the first - instance judgment but extended the applicant \u2019s detention by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was extended ; the Budapest High Court again referred to the fact that , at the time of his arrest , the applicant had been unreachable at his permanent address and had been earning a living from temporary jobs , which , taken together with the severity of the potential punishment , substantiated the risk of his absconding . The decision was upheld on appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG released the applicant from pre - trial detention and placed him on bail under house arrest . According to that decision , besides the suspicion against the applicant , the only grounds for restricting his liberty were the risk of his absconding , given the gravity of the offence , and this in itself could not justify his continued pre - trial detention . On appeal , ORG reversed the first - instance decision and placed the applicant in detention on DATE . It noted that , given the seriousness of the offence , there was a danger of his absconding , irrespective of his family ties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG released the applicant from detention upon his giving an undertaking not to leave his place of residence . Relying on the ORG \u2019s case - law , ORG found that pretrial detention could only serve as a measure of last resort , and the applicant \u2019s continued detention would only serve as an anticipated punishment . The decision was overturned by ORG on DATE , and the applicant was placed in detention for the same reasons as those given before .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG preferred a bill of indictment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE first - instance court \u2019s judgment , under LAW b ) of LAW ( risk of absconding ) , for essentially the same reasons as those given before .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for release , but the application was dismissed on DATE by ORG on the grounds that , given the gravity of the offence and the complexity of the case , pretrial detention did not constitute an anticipated punishment . That decision was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE . A further application by the applicant of DATE was dismissed on DATE ( the dismissal was upheld by the second - instance court on DATE ) on the grounds that the applicant had not relied on new circumstances warranting his release .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was reviewed on DATE by ORG . It held that the gravity of the offence , the applicant \u2019s lack of financial resources and essential ties , and the fact that he had only notified the authorities of his place of residence once he had been placed in detention substantiated the risk of his absconding .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , that decision was upheld by the GPE on DATE , which endorsed the reasons given by the lower court . The PERSON also found that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was both necessary and proportionate , and no less restrictive measure would be sufficient to ensure the purpose of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL .
