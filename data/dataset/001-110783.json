The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is the daughter of the second applicant . On an unspecified date , the first applicant issued a cheque in the name of the second applicant . Subsequently , in DATE , alleging that she had lost the cheque , the second applicant applied to ORG to have it cancelled . The cheque was accordingly cancelled by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , a third person , PERSON ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the creditor \u201d ) , who is the niece of the second applicant , presented the cheque in question to the bank for payment ; however , she was informed that the cheque had been cancelled . The creditor then applied to ORG and alleged that the second applicant had endorsed the cheque in her name to pay a debt to her . The amount of the cheque in dispute was MONEY ( TRY ) and the due date was set at CARDINAL DATE . On DATE a payment order was sent to the applicants . On DATE the applicants filed an objection with ORG , stating that they did not have a debt to the creditor and alleging that the creditor had stolen the cheque from their house .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , the creditor initiated proceedings before ORG , requesting the annulment of the objection filed by the applicants . Relying on CARDINAL of LAW ( Law no . DATE ) , she further claimed compensation amounting to PERCENT of the sum due , as the applicants had denied paying their debt in an unjust manner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants initiated another set of proceedings before ORG , seeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that they did not have any debt to the creditor in respect of the cheque in question . They also requested the creditor to pay them compensation amounting to PERCENT of the sum in dispute for acting in bad faith . On DATE ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 case on account of insufficient evidence . In its decision , the court held that the applicants had failed to provide the basis of an arguable claim in support of their allegations . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of the first - instance court , holding that that court should have examined whether the refusal to pay the amount due had caused unjust enrichment to the applicants . The case was accordingly remitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , ORG decided to join the CARDINAL cases . During the hearings held before ORG , the applicants were represented by a lawyer and were able to put forward all their arguments . The court also heard witness statements . In her submissions before the court , the creditor maintained that she had lent TRY CARDINAL to the second applicant and had in return taken a cheque with a due date set for CARDINAL DATE . She further claimed that in order to avoid paying the cheque , the second applicant had applied to the court to have it cancelled . On DATE ORG held that as the creditor was in possession of a cheque , the burden of proof lay on the applicants to prove that they did not have a debt to her . Having regard to the case file as a whole , the court decided that the applicants had failed to prove that they did not have any debt to the creditor . It therefore dismissed the case initiated by the applicants and annulled their objection against the payment order . Pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL , the court further ordered the applicants to pay compensation , amounting to PERCENT of the sum due , for unjustly filing an objection against the payment order . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the first - instance court . A request by the applicants for rectification was subsequently rejected and this final decision was served on the applicants on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Execution and Bankruptcy Act ( Law no . CARDINAL ) provides that the court may order the payment of compensation amounting to PERCENT of the sum in dispute , upon a request by the other party , if at the end of execution proceedings it concludes that the debtor has unjustly filed an objection against the payment order , or that the creditor acted in bad faith in initiating the execution proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
