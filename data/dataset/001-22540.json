NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , ORG ( PERSON the OFS \u201d ) , was established in DATE and is a federation of trade unions for workers of all categories in LOC oil and gas industry . It is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE . The second applicant , Mr FAC was born in DATE and lives in Figgjo ; the third applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . They are both NORP citizens . At the time of the events complained of they worked as roustabouts on oil rigs on the NORP ORG and were members of the OFS .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "DATE , when the ORG became a nation wide federation , and DATE , when the events giving rise to their application under the Convention occurred , claims being negotiated by the organisation , including every collective wage agreement except for CARDINAL in DATE , were referred to compulsory arbitration on CARDINAL occasions .", "In DATE the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry ( PERSON ) and ORG ( PERSON - \u201c the ORG \u201d ) negotiated with the ORG and ORG , Technicians and other Managers ( PERSON -\u201cthe ORG \u201d ) on a new wage agreement to take effect on DATE . The negotiations were conducted with CARDINAL major employee federations , namely the ORG , ORG ( Norsk Olje og PERSON the ORG \u201d ) and ORG ( PERSON the NALF \u201d ) , on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . The main demand made by the ORG was a reduction in the retirement age from DATE , with a possibility of flexible retirement DATE ; this demand entailed a PERCENT increase in costs . In addition a pay rise was requested . The ORG and the ORG agreed to a PERCENT pay rise . The same offer was also made to the ORG , but the negotiations were broken off without any agreement being reached .", "On DATE the ORG issued a collective strike warning with respect to CARDINAL of its members at the GPE platform ( oil rig ) . On DATE the ORG issued a collective strike warning for all members , initially confined to CARDINAL members at the Gullfaks B and ORG platforms . On DATE the ORG issued a warning of a lockout of CARDINAL ORG members at all fixed installations on the NORP continental shelf . On DATE the ORG warned that there would be a lockout of CARDINAL ORG members included in the collective notice but not part of the initial strike group .", "In accordance with the procedures laid down in GPE DATE ( lov om arbeidstvister - Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) for disputes involving a strike or lockout , ORG ( PERSON ) made an order prohibiting any work stoppage prior to compulsory mediation and summoned the parties to mediation . TIME on DATE , DATE was then fixed as the time - limit for resolving the dispute by mediation . As the mediator was unable to broker an agreement between the parties , the mediation was terminated on DATE at TIME and work stopped after TIME .", "The Minister of ORG thereafter summoned the parties to a joint meeting that TIME at TIME The parties briefed the Minister on the situation . The Minister referred to the serious consequences of a complete work stoppage on all fixed installations on the NORP section of LOC , and stated that at a cabinet meeting the following day he would recommend that the ORG should issue a provisional ordinance imposing compulsory arbitration of the disputes .", "In support of his recommendation for the Government to adopt a provisional ordinance , the Minister stated that the industrial action announced would lead to the complete suspension of all NORP oil and gas production , leading to a fall in production of an estimated value of ORG MONEY per week ( close to MONEY ) . This would worsen GPE \u2019s foreign trade balance by a corresponding amount . The ORG \u2019s tax revenues would be reduced by an estimated ORG MONEY per week and its direct oil revenues by ORG MONEY per week . The industrial action would have direct consequences for the ORG \u2019s financial commitment for DATE and would affect the ORG \u2019s financial needs both DATE and DATE . The estimated impact on the balance of trade and the reduction of ORG revenues would be extremely harmful to the NORP economy . An industrial dispute of any length was likely to have very damaging consequences . Oil and gas not produced at that time would nevertheless be exploited at a later stage and that would result in an increase of production after the different oil fields had passed the maximum production level . This production increase would be spread over DATE , until such time as production ceased . Thus the overall societal consequences of the industrial action would also depend inter alia on the evolution in price levels until the possibilities of exploitation of these resources had been exhausted . Since NORP natural gas was being delivered under long - term contracts , a work stoppage over a lengthy period would seriously reduce GPE \u2019s credibility as a reliable supplier of gas . If the technical installations were to be closed down for longer periods , it could entail damage to the installations and negative consequences for safety would follow . The equipment was designed with a view to regular use over long periods . A work stoppage of any length would moreover require the lay off of other categories of employees . At the close of the negotiations the situation was deadlocked with both parties unwilling to compromise . It therefore seemed likely that the conflict would continue for some time . The recommendation concluded :", "\u201c Considering the matter as a whole , the Ministry ... has reached the conclusion that the conflict ... should be resolved without industrial action . In this assessment , great emphasis has been placed on the fact that the complete cessation of production of oil and gas would lead to a considerable loss of income for the country . The industrial conflict will therefore have great consequences for the financing of the ORG and ORG budgets . The ORG has further emphasised the importance of not undermining GPE \u2019s position as a dependable and reliable gas supplier .", "GPE has ratified LAW ILO ) which protect freedom of association ( LAW . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . As interpreted by competent organs , the ORG only allow intervention in the right to strike where the strike jeopardises the life , health or personal security of the entire population or parts of it . LAW , under ORG , contains in DATE , QUANTITY cf . , DATE , corresponding provisions which protect the right to take industrial action .", "In the light of the fact that the NORP authorities have on several occasions imposed compulsory arbitration and prohibited strike action in labour disputes in LOC , the ORG has on CARDINAL occasions lodged complaints against GPE with the ORG , alleging breaches of the LAW on freedom of association . The ORG agencies have in this connection levelled criticism against the NORP authorities\u2019 practice , stating that the legislative interventions in labour disputes in the oil sector are not compatible with the principles of freedom of association .", "ORG has appraised the problems in relation to the ORG and the criticism expressed by the ORG bodies and balanced this against the harmful effects of the strike , and after careful consideration has concluded that it is correct and necessary to intervene in the dispute . In this context great weight has been given to the fact that the situation between the parties upon the expiry of the deadline for mediation was absolute deadlock and that there is therefore reason to believe that the dispute may be long - lasting . \"", "Under LAW , the Government adopted with immediate effect on DATE a provisional ordinance , according to which disputes relating to the revision of the wage - agreement in question were to be settled by ORG ( PERSON ) , the provisions of LAW CARDINAL ( lov om l\u00f8nnsnemnd i LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ) should apply , and work stoppage and picketing were prohibited . Work was duly resumed DATE at TIME", "ORG is a permanent arbitration body composed of CARDINAL members , CARDINAL of whom are appointed by the Government for DATE and the other CARDINAL are appointed by the respective parties to the dispute . The group of CARDINAL includes CARDINAL members who are independent of the Government , the ORG or employees\u2019 organisations and CARDINAL experts representing respectively ORG and employees\u2019 interests , who , unlike the other members , have no voting rights .", "On DATE the ORG brought an action in ORG ( byrett ) demanding that the compulsory arbitration be held invalid . By judgment of DATE ORG found for the ORG , represented by ORG , and ordered the ORG to pay the ORG \u2019s legal costs .", "The ORG appealed to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , invoking an error of law . Concurrently the applicant organisation sought to appeal directly to ORG ( PERSON ) . ORG ( kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) of ORG subsequently granted leave .", "The ORG claimed firstly that the provisional ordinance was unlawful ( ugyldig ) as the ban on strikes ran counter to general principles of constitutional law . Alternatively , the ORG argued that the ban violated GPE \u2019s international legal obligations which , in the event of a dispute , override NORP domestic law . The ORG , represented by ORG , disputed these contentions .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG unanimously rejected the ORG \u2019s appeal and ordered it to pay the ORG \u2019s legal costs in the proceedings . Mr Justice ORG opinion , to which the other ORG justices subscribed , included the following reasons :", "As regards the position under domestic law , it was noted that DATE , CARDINAL Acts of ORG and CARDINAL provisional ordinances had been adopted on compulsory arbitration in labour disputes , including CARDINAL disputes in the oil sector , and CARDINAL royal decrees had been adopted under the legislation on compulsory arbitration . The longstanding practice of using compulsory arbitration to settle labour disputes in pursuance of major societal interests did not contravene general legal principles of constitutional law . Setting aside a statute or a provisional ordinance on the grounds that it conflicted with general principles of constitutional law could only be envisaged in the most extreme cases . Although freedom of association and the right to take strike action were generally accepted in GPE , it was also generally recognised that the right to strike was not unlimited . Since DATE the legislation had contained provisions stating when and on what conditions strike action could be taken in labour disputes . In order to safeguard substantial societal interests , bans on strikes and compulsory arbitration had been imposed by special legislation or provisional ordinances .", "On the question whether the restriction on strikes conflicted with GPE \u2019s international law obligations , it was recalled that work stoppages were not mentioned in the FAC nos . CARDINAL and DATE , nor had they been a theme for negotiation during the ORG labour conferences in DATE . Since those conferences , the stance taken by the ORG bodies had evolved . ORG had already expressed the view in DATE that from LAW , the ORG conference in GPE in DATE and Convention no . DATE , it was implicit that the right to strike and to impose a lockout were fundamental aspects of the right to freedom of association , which view was later accepted by the expert ORG . This evolution in the interpretation advocated by the ORG bodies led to their criticism of the use of compulsory arbitration in GPE . ORG of the ILO Governing Body and , subsequently , ORG had in many instances , including in NORP cases , affirmed that the right to strike must be regarded as a part of trade union freedom of association and the right to bargain , and that it was therefore protected against interference by the authorities .", "However , according to the practice of the ORG bodies , strike action could be forbidden in respect of public servants engaged in the administration of the ORG , if it would affect essential services thereby jeopardising the life , health or personal security of the entire population or parts of it , and the harm was clear and imminent . Harmful economic effects to society , even if deemed substantial , had not been considered a sufficient reason for intervention . ORG work , oil production , education and transport were examples of services that had been regarded as nonessential . Since DATE the use of compulsory arbitration in GPE had been the subject of CARDINAL complaints to ORG agencies . ORG , with the support of the ORG \u2019s ORG , had endorsed the petitioner \u2019s contention that the use of compulsory arbitration did not comply with the principle of freedom of association . CARDINAL of the successful petitions had concerned compulsory arbitration in respect of the OFS . However , the court emphasised that , under the DATE LAW , ORG , ORG and ORG had no competence to determine with binding effect disputes on the interpretation of the ILO Conventions , for which competence was vested in ORG . The court observed that GPE had never accepted that the use of compulsory arbitration required by a substantial societal interest was contrary to the ILO Convention nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL . In its view , the opinions held by the institutions of the ORG on the limits to ORG intervention in labour disputes did not have a basis in the LAW texts as negotiated and adopted .", "As regards the more recent provision in LAW ( d ) of LAW , the court observed that GPE had found it necessary to make a reservation in the light of the use of compulsory arbitration , with possible further exceptions being made to the right to strike .", "Moreover , the court noted that the NORP practice of compulsory arbitration had been criticised by ORG DATE European Social Charter for going further than authorised by Articles DATE and QUANTITY of the LAW . In DATE the ORG had proposed in a draft recommendation that a provisional ordinance on compulsory arbitration of disputes in the oil sector dated DATE be deemed incompatible with the LAW . ORG later rejected the proposal . In these circumstances there was , in the court \u2019s view , no clear practice establishing that the provisional ordinance in issue in the present case was contrary to LAW .", "The court also had regard to ORG PERSON and GPE v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) , and noted that neither the ORG nor the ORG had found an infringement of LAW by virtue of the award of increments to members of non - striking unions , but not to members of striking unions , which included the applicants although they had not actually been on strike themselves .", "In addition , it was noted that in interpreting LAW in PERSON GPE ( case CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG had had regard to the fact that , while the right to strike was expressly included in LAW ( d ) of LAW , it was not mentioned in DATE , indicating that this right fell outside its scope .", "In the light of the above , the court did not find that GPE was required by international law to limit the use of compulsory arbitration in a labour dispute where such intervention was necessary in order to safeguard substantial societal interests . In any event , neither the LAW nor LAW contained any detailed standards limiting State restrictions on the right to strike , such as those derived by the ORG bodies from the FAC nos . CARDINAL and DATE and LAW . Accordingly , it concluded that the provisional ordinance of DATE was not at variance with GPE \u2019s obligations under international law . Thus , it was not necessary to examine the question of any conflict between GPE \u2019s obligations under international law and its domestic law .", "ORG , formerly ORG , in its CARDINALth report ( with reference to DATE ) , observed with respect to the provisional ordinance in issue in the present case that it accepted that the implications of the industrial action would have been serious in terms of the loss of revenue . However , ORG was not satisfied that the situation was so serious that it fell within LAW , that is to say that it was necessary for the protection of the public interest . It noted that the loss of revenue would not necessarily have been of a permanent nature . Accordingly , it concluded that in this case the imposition of compulsory arbitration and the termination of the industrial action did not fall within the terms of LAW ( Conclusions XIV-CARDINAL , GPE . CARDINAL , GPE , LAW , p. CARDINAL ) .", "When the matter was subsequently considered by ORG , which observed :", "\u201c Several delegates thought that they were not in a position to assess the NORP situation since the case law of ORG on the interpretation of LAW is sparse , and it is difficult for them to assess whether , in the case at hand , the action of the Government went beyond what is authorised by LAW . \u201d", "ORG decided to draw the attention of the NORP authorities to the fact that action by ORG or the ORG in the event of compulsory arbitration should not go beyond the limits laid down by LAW ( ORG XIV-CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) . No warning was issued by ORG with respect to the events in DATE .", "During the proceedings before ORG , the Government supplied information according to which if the strike had lasted DATE it would have reduced the value of petroleum extraction by approximately ORG MONEY ( PERCENT of GPE \u2019s Gross Domestic Product ) and central government revenues by ORG MONEY ( PERCENT ) . The calculations did not take into account shutdown and start - up costs , the fact that it would be some time before the production level reached the pre - shutdown level and that a shutdown of any length could result in damage to installations and equipment that was designed to be in continuous operation over a longer period . Since production would normally be maintained at maximum level , recovery of lost production would only take place after peak production levels at the relevant fields had been reached . Notwithstanding the possibility of recovering lost revenues at a later stage , a halt in extraction would inevitably be accompanied by a loss in extraction value , export earnings and central government revenues for DATE in which the halt occurred . The real loss in revenues would thus depend on the prices prevailing at the time of recovery . The net present value of the loss would have amounted to PERCENT . The central government budget deficit was sizeable and had grown from DATE ; as at DATE , it was expected to amount to ORG MONEY ( before loan transactions ) for DATE . A strike would have caused an increase in that deficit .", "The Government further submitted that GPE , together with GPE and GPE , was the main gas exporting country to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . In DATE natural gas covered PERCENT of the primary energy consumption in the ORG countries . NORP gas supply counted for PERCENT of gas imports and PERCENT of gas consumption in the ORG area . The rigidity and inflexibility associated with pipeline delivery of natural gas implied that sources of gas supply were impossible or difficult to replace . Substantial volumes of hydrocarbons passing through FAC and PERSON ( GPE ) landing points were largely irreplaceable in the short and medium term . Industries and households in this region in particular would depend on the NORP gas supply . A storage facility had been built in GPE but would only cover PERCENT of GPE \u2019s obligations for DATE . In the event that the NORP gas supply were to be cut off , the consequences would be substantial for the NORP and NORP industries , which did not have any alternative possibilities and would be faced with complex shutting down and restarting procedures . GPE had therefore undertaken to be a reliable gas supplier , notably under LAW , which took effect in DATE , and involved an investment of over ORG MONEY for platforms , terminals and pipelines and ORG MONEY for a storage facility . Under these agreements suppliers and buyers were bound under unique physical and commercial arrangements forming a complex web of mutually dependent relations , with stability in gas supply being a key element . Any suspension in delivery would be likely to lead to a dramatic fall in both current and future gas prices .", "In response to the above - mentioned information adduced by the Government , the applicants submitted information to the effect that the real price per barrel of crude oil was ORG CARDINAL in DATE , ORG CARDINAL in DATE , ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL in DATE , ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL in DATE , ORG in DATE , ORG FAC in DATE and ORG CARDINAL in DATE . In DATE it was assumed that the average lifetime of oil fields was , in fact , longer than the DATE estimate of DATE , on which the Government apparently relied . A deferment of production from DATE because of a strike could thus have led to far higher real prices than would have been achieved without a delay , and a present value loss that was PERCENT suggested by the Government .", "The applicant further stated that in DATE GPE had an export surplus of ORG MONEY and the public administration had been in the unique position of having significant net receivables ( ORG MONEY in DATE , CARDINAL in DATE , MONEY in DATE and CARDINAL in DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
