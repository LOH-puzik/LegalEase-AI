Her claim amounted to LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in total .", "CARDINAL . In its response to the applicant \u2019s claim , ORG submitted that the applicant \u2019s deposit had been taken over not by the NORP authorities but by the GPE because ORG had never been de facto established as an independent bank and it had not taken over any assets or liabilities of ORG of the GPE . ORG also submitted that the negotiations with the NORP authorities concerning the return of all such expropriated deposits were still ongoing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that the NORP branch of ORG of the GPE had never been de facto restructured as an independent NORP bank because the NORP bank had never transferred its assets , liabilities , funds and reserves to the NORP authorities ; furthermore , ORG had never been registered as an independent bank with ORG , as required by domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , the court held that in DATE the applicant \u2019s inheritance had been transferred to the NORP bank and not to a NORP bank . Relying on the submissions of ORG , the court also held that during its liquidation the NORP bank had not complied with ORG requirement to transfer all the deposits of NORP nationals to ORG , and deposits which had not been transferred were not guaranteed by the NORP budget funds ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court therefore concluded that ORG was not under an obligation to repay to the applicant the full amount of her deposit , nor the interest or the compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The court also observed that the Government had already fulfilled its obligation to partly compensate the applicant for her lost deposit ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment , arguing that ORG had erred in finding that ORG had not been established as an independent bank and that her deposit had not been taken over by the NORP authorities . She submitted that legal instruments adopted by the NORP authorities had unequivocally established that ORG came within the jurisdiction of GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL above ) , and GPE was therefore under an obligation to return the applicant \u2019s deposit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment . The court reiterated that , despite various legal instruments providing for the restructuring of ORG of the GPE as a NORP bank , no such NORP bank had actually been established . The court also observed that until DATE the NORP bank had continued to provide cash withdrawals to its depositors ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) \u2012 including the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The NORP bank subsequently acknowledged that it was indebted to individuals who had deposited their funds with its NORP branch ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and the questions relating to those debts were being addressed in the ongoing negotiations between the NORP and NORP authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court therefore dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that ORG was under an obligation to pay to her the full amount of her deposit , together with interest and compensation for nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted an appeal on points of law , but on DATE ORG dismissed it and upheld the findings of the lower courts in their entirety . It reiterated that , having established that the NORP authorities had not de facto taken over the assets of the NORP bank , no obligation to return to the applicant deposit kept in the latter bank could arise . ORG also observed that the fact that the negotiations between the NORP and NORP authorities had not yet produced a positive result could not constitute grounds for obliging ORG to pay to the applicant the amount she claimed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant initially submitted her claim of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to ORG . In line with domestic law , such a claim was not subject to any court fees ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE a panel of judges specialising in the determination of jurisdictional disputes ruled that the applicant \u2019s case related to a pecuniary claim and should therefore have been brought before a court of general jurisdiction and not before an administrative court ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant \u2019s claim was therefore transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay court fees which , in line with domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , amounted to LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked the court to exempt her from the obligation to pay court fees . She submitted that she had lodged her claim before an administrative court and that the claim had been transferred to a court of general jurisdiction against her will . She also argued that applying different rules concerning court fees in administrative and civil court proceedings was unfair and discriminatory . However , ORG refused to examine the applicant \u2019s request on the grounds of failure to comply with the formal requirements .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently granted ORG - guaranteed legal aid , whereby PERCENT of her legal expenses were covered by the ORG . As a result , on DATE ORG reduced the court fees payable by the applicant by PERCENT and ordered her to pay LTL MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The applicant appealed against that decision , asking to be completely exempted from paying court fees . She raised the same arguments as in her previous request ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and also submitted that the fees were excessively high and restricted her right of access to court , but she did not make any reference to , or provide any details about her financial situation . ORG dismissed her appeal , and the applicant subsequently paid the amount demanded .", "CARDINAL . After ORG had dismissed the applicant \u2019s civil claim , the latter lodged an appeal ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . In line with domestic law , the court fees for the submission of an appeal were calculated in the same way as those for the initial claim ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant was therefore ordered to pay LTL MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant paid CARDINAL of the court fees and asked the court to allow her to defer payment of the remaining half until after examination of her appeal , as provided in LAW ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She submitted that she was retired , that her retirement allowance was her only income , and that the total cost of the court fees was nearly equal to her DATE income . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s request and postponed the payment of CARDINAL of the court fees until after the examination of the appeal . After ORG had adopted its judgment in the civil proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant paid CARDINAL of the court fees .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , she asked to be exempted from the obligation to pay court fees , or to defer payment until after the examination of her appeal on points of law . The applicant argued that court fees constituted an unjustified and discriminatory restriction on her right to access to court . She also submitted that her income was insufficient to afford the court fees demanded of her in the present proceedings . On CARDINAL DATE ORG postponed the payment of the court fees . After dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG noted that the domestic law did not enable it to completely exempt the applicant from paying court fees ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , because of her difficult financial situation , ORG decided to reduce the amount demanded and ordered the applicant to pay LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The applicant paid that amount .", "CARDINAL .
