NORP The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and applied for asylum and a residence permit . During her interviews before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) she claimed that her husband had been taken away from their home by CARDINAL men on DATE and had been found dead DATE by GPE . On DATE CARDINAL men dressed in civilian clothes had broken into her home and had cut her with a knife . She had recognised CARDINAL of her assailants as X. , a member of ORG and her husband \u2019s business partner . She had been hospitalised and , when she had returned home , she had discovered that all her husband \u2019s documents and money had disappeared . On DATE CARDINAL men had again broken into her home and had abducted her . They had raped her and forced her to sign a document without being allowed to see the content of the document . She had managed to escape DATE . Even though she had reported the events to the police and identified X. , the police investigation had come to nothing . Moreover , she alleged that neighbours had thrown stones at her house and had asked her maid threatening questions about her daily routines . Finally , on DATE , her house had burnt down following an explosion . She did not know why all of this had happened to her but she suspected that it might have been related to her husband \u2019s political involvement with the ORG ( ORG pour la D\u00e9fense de la D\u00e9mocratie ) or the ORG ( Forces Nationales pour la ORG ) because she had heard one of her assailants mention this in passing , or because X. had wanted access to her husband \u2019s bank account for the business .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the applicant had not proved her identity but that there were no indications in the case that she was from a country other than GPE . It then considered that the applicant \u2019s story lacked credibility as she had given remarkably vague information about the events and had shown a lack of knowledge of why she and her husband had been the victims of the alleged attacks . Moreover , although it did not question the scars on her body , the ORG observed that the applicant had not been able to substantiate that they were the result of the violence she had described . Furthermore , she had failed to show that her husband had died as she alleged , that he had been involved either with the ORG or the ORG , or that he had had a business with X. and a bank account . In this respect , the ORG observed that the applicant knew nothing at all about her husband \u2019s alleged political involvement or whether he had actually been active for the ORG or the ORG . ORG also noted that the applicant had claimed that X. had wanted to obtain access to her husband \u2019s bank account while at the same time stating that X. had continued to run the business after her husband \u2019s death . Hence , in the ORG \u2019s view , X. already had access to the bank account relating to the business , for which reason the applicant \u2019s statement in this respect did not ring true . In any event , ORG considered that the QUANTITY attacks of which the applicant claimed to have been the victim were criminal acts and for the PERSON authorities to deal with . The circumstance that the authorities had not acted upon her report due to lack of evidence did not imply that they were unwilling or unable to help and protect her . In this respect , it stressed that the applicant had not in any way been able to show that the alleged events had been politically motivated . Thus , it concluded that the applicant was not a refugee or otherwise in need of protection in GPE . Moreover , it considered that there were no other special reasons to grant her exceptional leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) relying on the same grounds as before ORG and adding the following . Her husband had been an important person within \u201c the party \u201d and , before the elections in DATE , he had had an important role in mobilising people . In connection with the election , he had left the party as he had felt that he could not support activities which included eliminating NORP . Since he knew the party \u2019s secrets , he had been seen as a threat and therefore eliminated . No one had investigated his death even though she had sought help from various authorities and it was not possible for her to obtain proof that he had been killed . The applicant further claimed that she believed that she had been attacked in DATE because her assailants had thought that her husband had told her \u201c party secrets \u201d and she had therefore become a threat . Also , her neighbours had thrown stones at her home and harassed her because she was NORP and they were NORP and wanted her to leave . Some of her employees had seen them throw stones and they had also asked her employees questions about her daily routines .", "The applicant further submitted a copy of a search warrant ( ORG ) which stated that the applicant and another person were sought by the judicial police for an attack on the interior security of the ORG ( Atteinte \u00e0 la S\u00fbret\u00e9 Int\u00e9rieure de l\u2019Etat ) . It was dated DATE and issued by an officer at the judicial police station in ORG , of ORG and ORG . The applicant claimed that a NORP man , with whom she had become acquainted in GPE and who had travelled to GPE , had given it to her . He in turn had obtained it from the girl who took care of her CARDINAL children in GPE and whom he had met when he had been there . The applicant also submitted a copy of a hospital bill , dated DATE and addressed to the applicant . It stated that she had arrived at the hospital on DATE and left on DATE and that she had been treated in the surgery section of the \u201c PERSON Regent PERSON in GPE . It also contained the details of the bill and the total amount due .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It noted that the copy of the document called \u201c Avis de Recherche \u201d was of poor quality and that her account of how she had come by it was not credible . Moreover , the court considered that the alleged threats against her were vague and that she had not shown that she would risk persecution upon return to her home country . For the rest , it shared the ORG \u2019s reasoning and conclusion that the applicant was not in need of protection in GPE and that there were no special reasons to grant her leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal , ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected a request from the applicant for reconsideration of her case . ORG found that she had invoked no new reasons for her request and that the preparation for the enforcement of her deportation order should continue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon request by the applicant , the ORG decided to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of the applicant \u2019s deportation to GPE until further notice . Moreover , it invited the applicant to provide some more information surrounding her husband \u2019s activities and his death as well as her kidnapping and , if possible , to submit some evidence in support of these events . In addition , the ORG requested her to furnish some concrete evidence that she was sought by the PERSON authorities , since the copy of the alleged search warrant was of poor quality .", "CARDINAL . By letter received by ORG DATE the applicant submitted a death certificate for her husband which stated that he had died on DATE in GPE as a result of \u201c blows and injuries \u201d ( coups et blessures ) . She further added , inter alia , the following . Her husband was NORP and had been a businessman and a member of the CNDD - FDD ( ORG pour la D\u00e9fense de la ORG ) . He had been responsible for mobilising and recruiting people to the party . During the elections in DATE , he had decided to leave the party as he had discovered that there was a hidden agenda of ethnicity , arbitrary arrests and assassinations . Moreover he had been asked , together with colleagues , to organise the assassination of NORP and certain NORP in opposition , which he had refused . He had instead joined the ORG . However , the CNDD - ORG had won the elections and had then started to persecute and eliminate all persons who had not supported them , including the applicant \u2019s husband , as he knew its secrets and even held certain party documents . Hence , on DATE , CARDINAL persons had come to their home , QUANTITY of whom wore a formal police uniform . They had shown her husband a warrant for his arrest and he had had to go with them . She had not been allowed to accompany them but had gone to the police station to ask for him and also to various detention centres in GPE . She had not managed to obtain any information but DATE he had been found dead by GPE . DATE after the funeral , the applicant had gone to the police station to complain , since CARDINAL of the CARDINAL men had been wearing a police uniform . She had been told that an investigation would be carried out but nothing had been done . Later , when she had insisted , she had been told to stop or she would meet the same fate as her husband , as would the entire family .", "CARDINAL . As to the attacks on her , the applicant stated that she had first been attacked in her home on DATE by CARDINAL persons in civilian clothes . She had heard them enter by force through the main door and she had tried to escape with her children . She had recognised CARDINAL of them as being X. They had caught her and stabbed her in the chest with a knife and she had lost consciousness . She had regained consciousness at the hospital , where she had then spent DATE recovering . She had several injuries to her face and arms and had also broken her left collar bone . When she had returned home she had found the house in disorder , their valuables had been stolen and a suitcase in which her husband had kept documents had also disappeared . The applicant submitted CARDINAL photos showing the scars from her injuries , namely a scar on the right side of her chest , a scar by her left armpit , a scar on her right lower arm and a scar over her left eyebrow . She further produced a copy of a certificate dated DATE , issued by QUANTITY GPE , head of psychosocial care at FAC in GPE . It stated that the centre was specialised in helping victims of sexual violence and that the applicant had been treated there and had received medical , psychological and social care . The author of the certificate had met with her on DATE at the FAC and heard her account of having been the victim of sexual violence and other forms of torture .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant further added that the second attack against her had occurred on DATE because the party had wanted to eliminate her as she knew some of their secrets through her husband . Thus , she had been kidnapped from her home by QUANTITY persons and taken to an unknown place where she had been locked up . She had been guarded by men who had raped her one after the other . She had been told that she would be interrogated and then killed . However , TIME the guard outside her room had left and she had taken the opportunity to jump out of the window and escape . She had broken her front teeth when she had jumped . As she had managed to escape the assassination attempt , someone had come during TIME CARDINAL DATE and had set fire to her house . She had been asleep , but had woken up and she and her children had managed to escape from the fire . All their belongings had been destroyed except for the applicant \u2019s handbag which she had managed to take with her . She and her children had then stayed with a friend of hers and they had received clothes and food from kind people around them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant ended her account to the ORG by claiming that the party ( CNDD - ORG ) remained in power and thus was still looking to eliminate her in order to erase all evidence of their atrocities .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW , of the CARDINAL Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section DATE CARDINAL Act ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien \u2019s health status . In the preparatory works to this provision ( Government Bill CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien \u2019s home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .

ORG , in its DATE Country Reports on ORG ; GPE , dated DATE , noted that the Burundian government \u2019s human rights record remained poor and that the government security forces continued to commit numerous serious human rights abuses . Members of the army , the police , and ORG were responsible for killings , torture and beatings of civilians and detainees , although there had been fewer such reports than in DATE . It further observed that civilian authorities generally maintained effective control of the security forces , although there were instances when elements of the security forces acted independently . Moreover , while government security forces , especially the army , took some steps to prosecute the perpetrators of human rights abuses , most individuals acted with impunity . Security forces also continued to harass members of the opposition . Furthermore , a large number of weapons circulated throughout the general population and many violent incidents and killings were considered the result of vigilante abuse and personal score - settling . Despite the cease - fire , abuses by the ORG against civilians continued , primarily in the FAC traditional strongholds of GPE and the LOC provinces . These abuses included killings , kidnappings , rapes , theft , extortion and the looting and burning of houses .", "CARDINAL .
