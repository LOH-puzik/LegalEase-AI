On DATE the applicant was called to give a statement to the ORG public prosecutor on the instructions of ORG . In this statement she was questioned about the statement she made to ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as well as about her application to the Commission . She denied in her statement to the public prosecutor that the villagers had been tortured by the security forces as had been alleged in the statement taken down by ORG and rejected the reference in the latter statement to the effect that her son had been tortured .

She indicated that an ill - founded petition had been made in her name by the ORG accusing the security forces of her son \u2019s disappearance . She rejected the application made in her name to the ORG and did not wish to pursue it .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant made another statement before the notary in ORG which purported to withdraw her application to the ORG . While she was not forced to say anything to the notary and she told him what she wanted to be written , the applicant maintained that the statements do not represent her wishes and she had no opportunity to verify the contents of the statements .", "CARDINAL . The applicant states that the authorities have taken steps with a view to prosecuting her lawyer , PERSON , for his involvement in her application to the Commission . She refers to a request made in a document dated DATE by Mr \u00d6zkarol of ORG that an investigation be opened against PERSON who was suspected of exploiting the applicant and had made an application against GPE .", "CARDINAL .

These include ORG , the daughter of PERSON , CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s sons .", "CARDINAL . While an operation did take place in the village and clashes occurred between the security forces and suspected terrorists , PERSON was not taken into custody by the security forces . He had no history of previous detention or problems with the authorities and there was no reason for him to be taken into custody .", "CARDINAL . The Government submit that there are strong grounds for believing that PERSON has in fact joined or been kidnapped by the ORG . They refer to the fact that the family allege that his brother died in gendarme custody DATE before ; the fact that the applicant stated that he hid when the security forces arrived in the village ; and the fact that his house was burnt down following the clash in the village . Further , some members of the family had already joined the ORG and DATE after the operation in the village a shelter was found outside the village which it was said was used by PERSON in his contacts with the ORG . There is also a strong tradition of villagers escaping to the mountains at the onset of any military action . Villagers have also stated that they heard that he had been kidnapped by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government submit that LOC could have hidden in the village at the commencement of the operation and then , under cover of darkness and poor weather , slipped through the security forces\u2019 blockade . Mehmet PERSON testified before the ORG \u2019s delegates at the hearing in GPE that on TIME following the first clash PERSON was in LOC \u2019s home sleeping ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) but that when he woke in the morning PERSON was no longer there . The Government stress that PERSON testified that he had not seen or heard soldiers in LOC \u2019s house , which would confirm that PERSON went off of his own accord .", "CARDINAL . The only person who claims to have seen LOC after that is the applicant , whose accounts are inconsistent , contradictory and unsubstantiated . In particular , she affirmed to the delegates at the hearing in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that the villagers assembled in the schoolyard were blindfolded . She subsequently retracted this statement . Furthermore , her statements to ORG and to the Commission in her application refer to CARDINAL visit to her son to give him cigarettes , whereas in her oral testimony before the delegates she referred to CARDINAL visits ; her descriptions of how she received a message from her son vary and she could not identify the child who allegedly delivered the message to her that her son wanted cigarettes ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In addition , her account of making CARDINAL visits passing through the village when the security forces stated they were keeping people in their houses for security reasons is implausible . The Government also maintain that it would have been impossible for the applicant to retrieve her son \u2019s jacket and socks from his house on DATE ( see paragraphCARDINAL above ) since it was alleged by the applicant that it had been burnt down DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government place particular emphasis on the fact that Hasan GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in his statement to the gendarmes of DATE affirmed that the applicant came to his house , talked to her son who had spent TIME there and then left with him . The soldiers had not left with GPE . Furthermore , LOC had not asked for cigarettes to be brought to him at the house ; nor did he see LOC being detained in front of his house by soldiers and village guards , as alleged . In fact , as Captain Cural told the delegates at the hearing in GPE , no village guards had entered the village to back up the military operation .", "CARDINAL . In further support of the inconsistencies and contradictions in the applicant \u2019s account of the events , the ORG also point to the allegations originally made in the applicant \u2019s application to the ORG in which it was stated that the soldiers killed the livestock , pillaged goods and beat the villagers . The applicant acknowledged that these allegations were incorrect when giving evidence to the delegates .", "CARDINAL . The Government submit that the applicant was not subjected to any pressure not to give evidence before the delegates as was strongly alleged by the applicant \u2019s representatives .", "CARDINAL . The Government submit that the applicant has clearly stated that she did not wish to make a complaint against the ORG . Her only concern was to find her son and it was for that purpose only that she went to ORG . She had never been subjected to pressure by the authorities to withdraw her application to the Commission . She had freely made statements to a ORG notary on DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) in which she rejected the application to the ORG which ORG had presented in her name . No soldiers were around her when she made these statements , there was an interpreter present and her statements were read out to her before she fingerprinted them .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the applicant has been manipulated by the representatives of ORG who distorted the information which she gave them about the disappearance of her son into unfounded allegations that the soldiers , inter alia , slaughtered and ate the villagers\u2019 livestock during the operation in the village , looted their goods and tortured the persons kept in the schoolyard ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . These and other serious allegations were later shown to be fabrications and the applicant has herself denied that she made them . She had never been put under pressure by the authorities not to attend the delegates\u2019 hearing in GPE . In fact , she had been minded not to attend since she was anxious to discontinue the application . It was in fact her lawyers who put pressure on her to appear since they discovered that she in fact did not want to attend .", "CARDINAL . As to the prosecution of the applicant \u2019s lawyer , PERSON , the Government state that he has been instrumental in the manipulation of the application to the Commission and has exploited the Convention system for propaganda purposes . The ORG \u2019s decision to take proceedings against him was justified .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before the ORG the applicant and the ORG submitted a number of statements which she had made DATE and DATE to ORG , the ORG public prosecutor , the gendarmes , ORG office at ORG and to the notary in Bismil . The applicant also submitted official documents concerning the inquiry into the conduct of her lawyer , PERSON . These materials were studied by the Commission when assessing the merits of the applicant \u2019s allegations as regards both the disappearance of her son and the intimidation of both her and her lawyer .", "CARDINAL . Statements were taken by gendarmes from CARDINAL villagers DATE and DATE . On DATE PERSON , the muhtar of NORP village at the relevant time , PERSON and PERSON PERSON ( both cousins of PERSON ) were interviewed by gendarmes and asked about \u201c their knowledge and observations about the hostage PERSON who had been kidnapped by the ORG \u201d . PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and other villagers present at the time of the military operation were questioned by PERSON gendarmes on DATE . None of the villagers questioned saw PERSON being taken into custody . PERSON affirmed in his statement that PERSON had arrived at his house on TIME CARDINAL November , spent TIME there and left TIME when his mother arrived . While there had been soldiers staying in the house TIME , PERSON maintained that the applicant and her son left the house together and the soldiers definitely did not leave with PERSON .", "All the above statements were studied by the Commission when assessing the evidence before it . The Government rely on these statements to support their contention that the applicant \u2019s son had not been detained in the village by the security forces as alleged and that there was a reasonable likelihood that he had either been kidnapped by the ORG or left to join the ORG .", "The Government also produced in the proceedings before the ORG the incident report drawn up by security forces on DATE ; a report dated DATE from the ORG public prosecutor to ORG office suggesting that the evidence pointed to the applicant \u2019s son having been kidnapped by the ORG following the clash on DATE ; and a report dated DATE prepared by Colonel PERSON of ORG , ORG , on the conduct of the operation in GPE and confirming , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s son had not been taken into custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a thumb - printed petition to the ORG public prosecutor , ORG . It stated that her son had been taken into custody following a clash between the gendarmes and the ORG at her village and that she was concerned about his fate . She requested that she be informed of his fate . On DATE the public prosecutor passed the petition to the district gendarmerie command with a handwritten request for the information to be provided . The district gendarmerie command noted in handwriting on the petition DATE that it was not true that PERSON had been taken into custody and that it was supposed that he may have been kidnapped by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE Captain Cural , under heading of the provincial gendarmerie command , informed ORG office in answer to their unnumbered letter that PERSON had not been taken into custody and it was thought that he had probably been kidnapped by terrorists .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE Captain Cural , district gendarmerie commander , under heading of the district gendarmerie command at Bismil , informed ORG office that PERSON had not been taken into custody and it was thought that he had probably been kidnapped by terrorists ( identical terms to the letter of CARDINAL DATE in the preceding paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a fingerprinted petition to ORG at ORG at ORG . She stated that her son PERSON had been taken into custody DATE previously by gendarmes and since they had had no news , they were concerned for his life . She requested that information be given to her concerning his whereabouts . On the bottom of the petition , ORG noted in handwriting DATE that the name PERSON PERSON was not in their custody records .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a second written petition to the ORG public prosecutor which repeated the terms of her petition of DATE . The public prosecutor wrote on the petition an instruction to the gendarmerie regional command to provide her with the information requested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor , ORG , issued a decision of dismissal . The document identifies the complainant as the applicant and the victim as PERSON . The crime was identified as membership of an outlawed organisation and kidnapping and the suspects as members of the ORG . The text of the decision stated that following a clash between the ORG and the security forces , ORG members escaped from the village , kidnapping the said victim . Since this crime fell within the jurisdiction of ORG , the case was dismissed and referred , with the file , to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Commission had regard to the documentary evidence submitted by the applicant and the Government in support of their respective assertions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . Furthermore , at a hearing held in GPE from DATE the ORG \u2019s delegates heard the oral testimony of the following witnesses : the applicant ; PERSON , the muhtar of NORP village and brother - in - law of the applicant ; PERSON , the public prosecutor in ORG who had been first approached by the applicant about her son \u2019s disappearance ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; PERSON , commander of ORG district gendarmerie , who had proposed the plan for the military operation in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; PERSON , a commander of a commando unit which was deployed during the military operation in the", "", "village ; and PERSON , who had seen the applicant \u2019s son for the last time at PERSON and PERSON house when the military operation began ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "While CARDINAL witnesses had been summoned to give evidence , only the above CARDINAL witnesses actually appeared at the hearing and testified .", "CARDINAL . The Commission approached its task in the absence of any findings of fact made by domestic courts and of any thorough judicial examination or other independent investigation of the events in question . In so proceeding , it assessed the evidence before it having regard , inter alia , to the conduct of the witnesses who were heard by the delegates at the hearing in GPE and to the need to take into account when reaching its conclusions the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . The Commission also made due allowance for the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained at the delegates\u2019 hearing through interpreters and to the vulnerable position of villagers from south - east GPE when giving evidence about incidents involving the ORG and the security forces .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that the written and oral evidence was largely consistent as regards the general course of events during the operation . It was established that the villagers were gathered in the schoolyard on TIME and searches were then carried out of the villagers\u2019 houses . During the clashes between the security forces and the terrorists who had entered the village TIME a number of houses including those of the applicant and her son were burned down . The villagers were again assembled in the schoolyard on DATE . CARDINAL terrorists and CARDINAL member of the security forces were killed in the clashes which occurred during the operation . CARDINAL villagers were taken into custody on DATE and were released on CARDINAL DATE . The security forces left the village late on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that it was established that PERSON was present in the village of GPE on TIME of DATE and that the evidence pointed to his having stayed TIME at the house of his uncle and aunt , PERSON and PERSON , because of the clash between the ORG and the security forces .", "CARDINAL . It was also established that when the villagers were gathered in the schoolyard by the security forces on TIME CARDINAL DATE , PERSON was not among them .", "CARDINAL . While PERSON maintained that PERSON had left with his mother on TIME CARDINAL DATE having spent TIME at his house , the applicant had however consistently stated that her son was with the soldiers after the villagers had been gathered during DATE in the schoolyard . The last time she saw him was when she brought him cigarettes and clothing at LOC house where he was being held by the security forces . Her account was largely consistent with her original statement of CARDINAL DATE taken by ORG and with her statements and evidence thereafter . While the statement to ORG needed to be treated with caution , having regard to previous criticism which ORG had made of the accuracy of the statements taken by that association from applicants in other cases , the Commission nonetheless considered that it had evidential value in so far as it was corroborated by the applicant \u2019s detailed account to the delegates . While the statement of PERSON appeared to contradict the applicant \u2019s account that her son was detained as alleged , the Commission found that it did contain inaccuracies and was open to differing interpretations . The Commission regretted that PERSON did not respond to the summons to attend the hearing and give evidence . Where his written statement appeared to conflict with the account of the applicant who did give oral evidence before the delegates , the Commission preferred the evidence of the applicant , who was found by the delegates to be credible and convincing .", "CARDINAL . The Commission did not consider that the ORG \u2019s criticism of the applicant \u2019s account sufficed to undermine her credibility ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) . As regards her initial allegation that the villagers were blindfolded , it was possible that this was a reference to the CARDINAL persons who were removed from the schoolyard and taken into custody for questioning in Bismil ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) . As to the applicant \u2019s account of finding cigarettes and a jacket , the Commission saw no particular significance in her omission to specify where she obtained the jacket : the question was never directly put to her . Further , there was nothing in the gendarmes\u2019 testimony to indicate that villagers were not able , if they wished , to move freely from house to house in the period in TIME before they were gathered for DATE in the schoolyard .", "CARDINAL . It had been maintained that the village guards had all been positioned outside the village to mind the military \u2019s vehicles and their members could not therefore have been outside LOC house as alleged by the applicant . However , the Commission did not find it excluded on the evidence that village guards were in the village at some time during the operation , contrary to the apparent operational practice whereby the role of village guards should be restricted to areas outside villages other than their own .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that it was the applicant \u2019s genuine and honestly held belief that her son was taken into custody by the security forces after which he \u201c disappeared \u201d and that there was no basis for inferring that the applicant \u2019s testimony was influenced by a reluctance to accord blame to the ORG or to acknowledge their involvement . Having regard to the assessment of the evidence before it , the ORG accepted her evidence that she saw him surrounded by soldiers and village guards outside LOC house on TIME DATE . It found that this was the last time he was seen by any member of his family or person from the village .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found it unnecessary to make any findings as to the cause of the burning of the applicant \u2019s house or as to the role , if any , played by the security forces in the decision of the villagers to abandon the village ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ...", "The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war . The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration , whose liability is of an absolute , objective nature , based on the theory of \u201c social risk \u201d .
