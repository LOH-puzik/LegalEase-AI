This particularly occurs in situations where the child has social problems in GPE . Moreover , there are examples of parents who consciously choose to let a child remain in his or her country of origin , either together with CARDINAL of the parents or with other family members , until the child is nearly grown up , although the child could have had a residence permit in GPE earlier . The result of this is that the child grows up in accordance with the culture and customs of its country of origin and is not influenced by NORP norms and values during its childhood . In the ORG \u2019s view , under - age aliens who will live in GPE should come to GPE as early as possible and spend the longest period of their childhood in GPE in consideration of the child and for integration reasons . Similarly , children and young aliens who already live in GPE should grow up here , to the extent possible , and not in their GPE country of origin . Against that background , the Government finds that the age limit for under - age children \u2019s entitlement to family reunification should be reduced from DATE . The purpose of such reduction of the age limit for family reunification of children is to counteract both re - education journeys and the cases in which the parents consciously choose to let a child remain in its country of origin until the child is nearly grown up .", "However , a residence permit will still have to be issued to children DATE based on an application for family reunification if a refusal would be contrary to LAW In cases where refusal of family reunification will be contrary to GPE \u2019s treaty obligations , and where section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( ii ) , of LAW does not allow for family reunification , a residence permit will thus have to be issued under section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ...", "In cases where the child has spent by far the largest part of his or her childhood in GPE , and where the ties with the GPE country of origin are very poor , including where the child has attended school in GPE only , or where the child speaks LANGUAGE , but not the language spoken in the GPE country of origin , regard for the best interest of the child might also imply , in these circumstances , that family reunification in GPE must be granted .
