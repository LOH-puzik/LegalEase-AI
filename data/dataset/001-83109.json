While acknowledging that \u201c the use of the GPE powers by the High Representative was beneficial for GPE and its citizens and a necessity following a bloody war \u201d , ORG ) has recently called for a \u201c progressive phasing out of these powers and for the establishment of an advisory panel of independent lawyers for the decisions directly affecting the rights of individuals pending the end of the practice \u201d ( see the Opinion on the constitutional situation in GPE and the powers of ORG , adopted at the DATE session of ORG , ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) . The relevant part of this Opinion states :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The termination of the employment of a public official is a serious interference with the rights of the person concerned . In order to meet democratic standards , it should follow a fair hearing , be based on serious grounds with sufficient proof and the possibility of a legal appeal . The sanction has to be proportionate to the alleged offence . In cases of dismissal of elected representatives , the rights of their voters are also concerned and particularly serious justification for such interference is required .", "CARDINAL . In this context the ORG is certainly not called upon to enter into a quasi - judicial scrutiny of the individual decision of the High Representative . It can only provide a broad general assessment of the compatibility of these decisions with international standards . The removals by the High Representative certainly pursue a legitimate aim and are based on serious grounds . Non - co - operation with ORG is a serious violation of the international obligations of the country , and corrupt practices as well as the establishment of parallel institutions to the legitimate state institutions also justify tough sanctions . Subject to a detailed case - by - case analysis , the sanction of dismissal does not seem disproportionate to the alleged offences .", "CARDINAL . The main concern is however that the High Representative does not act as an independent court and that there is no possibility of appeal . The High Representative is not an independent judge and he has no democratic legitimacy deriving from the people of [ GPE ( \u201c BiH \u201d ) ] . He pursues a political agenda , agreed by the international community , which serves the best interests of the country and contributes to the realisation of ORG . As a matter of principle , it seems unacceptable that decisions directly affecting the rights of individuals taken by a political body are not subject to a fair hearing or at least the minimum of due process and scrutiny by an independent court .", "CARDINAL . It would have been unrealistic to have insisted on immediate full compliance with all international standards governing a stable and full - fledged democracy in a post - conflict situation such as existed in ORG following the adoption of the [ Peace ] Agreement . The addressees of the decisions of ORG were often powerful individuals and the actions taken by them were generally actions taken in the perceived interest of their political party or ethnic community . It would furthermore have been unrealistic to expect that the ORG judicial system should have been capable of effectively dealing with such actions in the early post - conflict period . It is therefore understandable that the decisions were not made subject to control by the courts of GPE This situation can however not last forever but , also taking into account the important reforms of the judiciary carried out at the request of or imposed by ORG , DATE must come when such decisions are made subject to full judicial control and made the responsibility of the proper national institutions .", "CARDINAL . It is not up to the ORG to indicate a precise date when such a transfer should take place although it should not be in the too distant future . But even pending such transfer , the present practice will have to be substantially modified to make it acceptable as an interim solution . The continuation of such power being exercised by a non - elected political authority without any possibility of appeal and any input by an independent body is not acceptable . As an urgent step the ORG recommends setting up an independent panel of legal experts which would have to give its consent to any such decision of the High Representative . Having regard to the confidential nature of many elements of the file , this might be a body composed of international experts .", "CARDINAL . In order for such a body to work effectively , it will be necessary to define the possible measures to be taken by ORG and the offences justifying such measures clearly and precisely . The conclusions of the GPE conference are not precise enough to enable a legal panel to determine the justification of individual removals . Furthermore , the issue of the duration of the ban on the holding of future public office and of possible rehabilitations will also have to be addressed . In this respect , the ORG welcomes as a first step the recent decision of ORG to initiate a process of rehabilitation of some of the persons dismissed earlier . If the office of High Representative were to be terminated in the near future , there would no longer be a political body enforcing respect for the previous decisions of the High Representative but their legal validity would not automatically cease . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subject to ORG consent , ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) exercises judicial review of the constitutionality of the content of legislation enacted by ORG , in the same way as it does for legislation adopted by the domestic authorities . However , it does not examine whether ORG was justified in enacting the legislation in the place of the domestic authorities ( see ORG decision no . U CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Indeed , ORG has not consented to the review of his other acts by any domestic authorities . ORG decision no . ORG CARDINAL of DATE , ordering the domestic authorities to secure an effective remedy in respect of removals from office by ORG , led to a vigorous response from ORG .
