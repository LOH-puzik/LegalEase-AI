He was represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "An acquaintance of the applicant disappeared in DATE while visiting the applicant in GPE . On DATE the police questioned the applicant , as a witness , about this disappearance .", "On DATE the applicant was apprehended and arrested on suspicion of murdering his acquaintance . On CARDINAL and DATE he was interrogated by the police . At the latter interrogation the applicant 's counsel was present for the first time .", "On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) ordered in camera that the applicant be detained and that the deadline for bringing the charges was DATE . This decision was not subject to appeal .", "On DATE , opposing the detention , the applicant lodged , in accordance with LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , a complaint ( kantelu , klagan ) with ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) . He claimed that there was no probable cause to believe that his acquaintance was dead , that he had been killed or that the applicant had killed him either acting alone or in concert with others . He also referred to LAW . On DATE ORG found that the complaint did not give cause to lift the applicant 's detention .", "By application dated DATE the applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , repeating the arguments already put forward before ORG . On DATE the court refused leave to appeal .", "On DATE , having heard that the public prosecutor was planning to request an extension of the time - limit for bringing the charges , the applicant 's counsel informed the police that the applicant would oppose this and that he would also request a re - examination of his detention . For this reason , the counsel requested , on the basis of ORG ( laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta , lag om offentlighet i myndigheternas verksamhet ; Act no . CARDINAL ) , that the following documents be submitted to him by the police in good time before the re - examination of the applicant 's detention :", "In general , the applicant 's counsel wished to obtain clarification concerning the matters which had arisen in the course of the investigation , as referred to in FAC ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . He wished to obtain for example the preliminary introduction to the forthcoming investigation records , if such an introduction had been drafted .", "On DATE the applicant 's counsel received from the police the investigation records and the records drawn up of the investigation conducted by the police dogs . He was told that the transcriptions of the wiretapping and of the monitoring of telecommunications were included in the investigation records .", "On DATE the chief of police confirmed this by a decision which was subject to appeal . According to the said decision , the applicant was denied access to the other documents on the basis of sections CARDINAL and DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG as the investigation was pending and access to such documents would have compromised the investigation of the matter . In addition , the applicant was denied access , on the basis of LAW of LAW , to an overall report on the state of the criminal investigation on the same grounds . Finally , according to the decision , there were no documents speaking against the applicant 's guilt .", "On DATE the public prosecutor requested an extension of the time - limit for bringing the charges . In this connection the applicant 's counsel found out that another person who was under suspicion for the same crime had been detained by the same ORG on DATE . The applicant 's counsel requested copies of the detention order and the application for it .", "On DATE the public prosecutor denied access to these documents by referring to the fact that ORG had examined the matter in camera . Moreover , ORG had declared the application for detention and its appendices , and most parts of the detention order confidential . Due to the denial , these documents were consequently withdrawn , in the applicant 's case , from the documents submitted to the court by the public prosecutor . Moreover , the prosecutor stated that the police investigation of the matter was still pending and the matter had not yet been referred to the prosecutor for the consideration of charges . Consequently , any information concerning the investigation was to be given by the police , not by the prosecutor . The applicant 's counsel was given directions on how to appeal , should the public prosecutor 's refusal be considered as a decision against which an appeal lay .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG , when examining the request for extension of the time - limit , also to re - examine the matter of his detention .", "On DATE the matter was examined before ORG . The applicant opposed the extension of the time - limit and claimed that the public prosecutor and the court had had greater access to the files than he . He denied the existence of a probable cause . ORG decided to extend the time - limit for bringing the charges until DATE and to hold the applicant in pre - trial detention . By way of reasoning , it stated that , according to the information received from the police and the public prosecutor , nothing in the criminal investigation had lessened the degree of probable cause which had formed the basis of the applicant 's initial detention . This decision was not subject to appeal .", "The applicant was subsequently convicted of murder .", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL , subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW ( pakkokeinolaki , tv\u00e5ngsmedelslag ; Act no . PERSON , as amended by Act no . CARDINAL entering into force on DATE ) , if a suspect of a crime has been detained , the court deciding on the charges as the first instance must re - examine the detention matter promptly , and at the latest within DATE from the request , if a detainee makes such a request . The issue of detention does not need to be re - examined DATE after the previous examination . Moreover , when re - examining the detention matter , the detainee or his or her counsel must be provided with an opportunity to be heard , unless it is deemed unnecessary . A detainee must be heard in person if he or she so requests or if the court deems it necessary .", "LAW , section CARDINAL , of the same LAW provides that a court must release a detainee immediately if it considers that the conditions for the detention no longer exist .", "Under LAW , section CARDINAL , subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of the same LAW , there is no ordinary appeal against a decision given in a detention matter but it is nevertheless possible for a detainee to challenge the detention by lodging a complaint ( kantelu , klagan ) with the competent court .", "ORG released , for example , in the case ORG CARDINAL , a detainee who had lodged a complaint , as the conditions for the detention no longer existed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
