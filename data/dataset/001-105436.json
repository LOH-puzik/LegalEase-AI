NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr. PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . PERSON practised as a lawyer in GPE until DATE , when she retired on the ground of having reached pensionable age . She received her pension from ORG ( ORG ) on a DATE basis until DATE , when she decided to leave the country and go to GPE . Pursuant to the national legislation in force at that time ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and Decree no . CARDINAL ) , those who left the country were compelled to give up the social and political rights conferred on them by GPE . The applicant had thus renounced her pension rights while she also gave up her NORP nationality . Consequently , by a decision of DATE , the ORG suspended the payment of the applicant \u2019s pension rights on the grounds that she was about to move abroad and had given up her NORP nationality .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant moved to GPE , where she resides at present . Upon her request , on DATE ORG in GPE granted the applicant NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . The NORP legislation applicable to the assessment of pension entitlements , PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL regulating the national pension system and LAW no . CARDINAL regarding the lawyers\u2019 pension system , were repealed on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE respectively , when the amending PERSON no . CARDINAL and the Statute of ORG were respectively adopted . The new regulations removed the NORP nationality and residence criteria from the conditions decisive for the payment of a pension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged her application for the resumption of pension payments , which was registered in due form by the ORG on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG allowed the above - mentioned application and granted the applicant the payment of her pension , starting from DATE , as requested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant contested this decision , claiming that she had retroactive entitlement to a pension , which should be calculated and updated for DATE ( starting from DATE , DATE being the general cut - off period for pecuniary claims ) . The ORG gave a decision on DATE allowing the claims in part . The pension was calculated as of DATE , the reference date when the new legislation became applicable to the applicant \u2019s case . The reasoning put forward by the ORG in rejecting the claims from DATE to DATE was that the legislation in force until DATE had not provided for payment of pensions to persons who did not have NORP citizenship and/or did not reside in GPE . Once the new legislation had come into force , on DATE , the nationality and/or residence criteria for a person \u2019s entitlement to payment of a pension had been removed .", "Furthermore , LAW ORG prescribed that pension payments were to resume , on request , DATE following DATE when the ground for their suspension ceased . Taking into account the entry into force of the Statute , the payment of the applicant \u2019s pension would become operative as of DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s pension was calculated and updated in accordance with the lex specialis , PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested this decision before ORG on DATE . On DATE , she amended her request to claim that she had become entitled to her pension rights on DATE . She argued that her renunciation of NORP nationality and residence , and implicitly the payment of her pension , had been determined exclusively by the unfair legislation in force during the communist regime . From DATE , that legislation had lapsed , hence the suspension of her rights should be considered to have terminated and the payments resumed as of right . In support of this claim , she also invoked LAW , asserting that lawyers\u2019 pension rights were not subject to negative prescription . Consequently , her pecuniary claims were not timebarred , the general cut - off period of DATE being inapplicable .", "The applicant also contested the ORG \u2019s method of recalculating her pension in that she considered that the readjustment should have been made on the basis of the inflation rate and not in accordance with the specific methods stipulated in the pension lex specialis no .

On DATE , ORG dismissed her claims , upholding the ORG \u2019s decision and reasoning . The applicant \u2019s submission regarding the lapse of the applicable legislation after the fall of the communist regime , that is , PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and Decree no . ORG , was rejected by the court , which held that the above - mentioned legislation had been officially repealed once the new pension Law no . CARDINAL and the Statute of the PERSON had come into force , namely , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively . Therefore , applying the tempus regit actum principle and in so far as the applicant had not complied with the statutory conditions ( NORP citizenship and/or residence ) , the first - instance court considered that the applicant had not proved that she had a substantive right to receive a pension for the period of time in question .", "With regard to her claims concerning the pension readjustment , the court held that as long as there was a lex specialis establishing a specific method of adjusting the amounts of all pensions ( recorelare ) , the general principles of adjusting pecuniary claims in line with the inflation rate could not be taken into consideration . The courts further held that the applicant was subject to NORP taxation as long as she had obtained the income in question in GPE and had not proved that she was actually paying taxes in another country .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal on points of law with ORG . She challenged the lower court \u2019s reasoning , asserting that her pension rights had first been acknowledged in DATE and had never ceased to exist , despite the changes in her nationality and residence and despite the fact that her enjoyment of those rights had been interfered with from DATE onwards . Consequently , the suspension of the payment of her pension had to be considered as a wrongful act that should have terminated once the communist regime had fallen .", "CARDINAL . By a decision rendered on DATE , the court dismissed the appeal . It held that since the LIF \u2019s Statute removing the citizenship and/or residence requirement had come into force on DATE , it was only from DATE , in accordance with LAW , that the applicant was entitled to have the payment of her pension resumed . In so far as the applicable legislation before DATE had provided that NORP nationality and/or residence was a mandatory and decisive condition for pension payments , the applicant had not proved that she was eligible for payment of a pension in respect of the earlier period .", "CARDINAL . a ) Law no .
