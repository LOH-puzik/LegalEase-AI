NORP The applicant , Mr D.T. , is a NORP national , born in DATE , and currently staying in the GPE . He was represented before the ORG by ORG , a lawyer practising in LOC .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE , having been informed of their right to intervene ( LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of the Rules of Court ) , did not avail themselves of this right .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows . Some of the facts are disputed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant entered the GPE where on CARDINAL DATE he applied for asylum , submitting in the course of CARDINAL interviews with immigration officials that he had been working as a military trained senior border guard at the border between GPE and GPE . Between the respective border posts lies a neutral zone via which drugs are being smuggled into GPE . CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s main responsibilities had been to combat drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had been ordered by his superior officer to escort a person , PERSON , from the neutral zone to GPE , evading the normal border controls . On DATE he had again been ordered to escort X across the border to GPE on DATE . On DATE , he had received a tip that a drugs trafficker had been sighted in the neutral zone . The applicant had gone to the market located in the neutral zone where he was discretely shown the trafficker whom he recognised as X. The applicant had passed on this information to his superior , PERSON , who responded by telling the applicant that he had checked this information and that it was wrong .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had once more been ordered by PERSON to escort X across the border . The applicant had refused . TIME he had received a telephone call from his mother who apparently was held hostage by CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s colleagues . He had then felt compelled to take X across the border into GPE , which he had done .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had asked his superior , PERSON , for explanations and informed his superior that he intended to do something about it . He had then written a memo to PERSON , the Chief of ORG as well as to the Deputy Minister of ORG , explaining the situation and asking for an inquiry , or to transfer or dismiss the applicant . He had left this memo at PERSON secretariat . DATE , he had been summoned to his superior Mr L. who showed him the memo and told him that he should stop writing and follow orders . The applicant had then resumed his work and nothing special had occurred until DATE . On DATE , Mr L. had ordered the applicant for a fourth time to escort NORP across the border . The applicant was told that it would be the last time and he saw on PERSON table a proposal to promote the applicant to the next rank , which promotion had been planned already for some time .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had taken X across the border into GPE and had returned with his car to an agreed spot at TIME to pick up X again and bring him back to the neutral zone . When he had arrived at the designated place , X had been accompanied by QUANTITY persons , CARDINAL of them wearing a jacket bearing the letters DATE which stands for ORG \u2013 and the other one dressed in plain clothes . The CARDINAL men brought X to the applicant \u2019s car . X and the plain - clothed man took a seat next to each other in the car and the applicant was given to understand that they had something to discuss and needed some privacy . Thereupon the applicant and the NORP man had walked away QUANTITY from the car . The ORG man had taken an interest in the applicant \u2019s service weapon . The applicant had then heard that X and the plain - clothed man had started shouting at each other . The plain - clothed man had then approached the applicant and the NORP man , telling the latter that X had not agreed . The ORG man , who was then holding the applicant \u2019s service weapon in his hands , had walked to the car , opened the door and fired three shots , killing X. The applicant had then run away as fast as he could and , it already being dark , had managed to hide himself in the nearby forest . After a short unsuccessful search for the applicant , the men had left .", "CARDINAL . As an NORP drug trafficker had been killed with the applicant \u2019s service weapon and in the applicant \u2019s car , and as the perpetrators had also tried to kill him , the applicant felt trapped CARDINAL fires and had decided to flee the country , fearing problems from the side of the NORP and/or the NORP drugs mafia . With the help of a colleague , who had managed to remove a plastic bag with documents belonging to the applicant from the applicant \u2019s office room and give these to the applicant , the applicant had managed to flee the country on CARDINAL DATE . ORG , he had travelled to the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) requested the Minister of ORG to conduct an inquiry in relation to the applicant \u2019s asylum request .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant was informed by his mother that she had had a visit from an official of ORG who had known that the applicant was in the GPE and who had asked her questions relating to the applicant \u2019s asylum account given to the GPE authorities and who had shown her documents submitted by the applicant to the GPE authorities . The applicant \u2019s comments about this visit to the GPE refugee aid agency led to a conversation on DATE between the applicant and the person at ORG dealing with the inquiry in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister of ORG transmitted a person - specific official report ( individueel ambtsbericht ) concerning the applicant to the Deputy Minister of Justice . According to this report , CARDINAL identity documents and a veteran \u2019s card in the applicant \u2019s name \u2013 submitted by the applicant in the asylum proceedings \u2013 were authentic but there was a reasonable doubt about the authenticity of another document . The report further contained the verified registration as home owner of the applicant \u2019s mother and brother at a specific address . However , it had not been possible to verify whether the applicant had been registered as living at that address or at the address of the military base . The report also stated that the applicant had worked as a border guard until DATE , that reportedly he had been dismissed due to a reorganisation , that various sources had indicated that he was not wanted by the ORG , and that he was not wanted in relation to the commission of a criminal offence . It further contained names and functions of persons mentioned by the applicant in his account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having been granted access to the underlying materials of the person - specific official report of DATE , ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) of ORG concluded that this report , both as regards its content and procedure , had been drawn up in a careful manner and that it provided insight in a transparent manner , and informed the Minister of ORG accordingly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request . Mainly on the basis of the outcome of the investigation carried out by the Minister of ORG of the applicant \u2019s claims as set out in the person - specific official report , the Deputy Minister concluded that no credence could be attached to the applicant \u2019s account and that it had not been established that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would be exposed to risks from the side of the NORP authorities or the drugs mafia from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG of The Hague and filed the grounds for this appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was informed that the impugned decision of DATE had been withdrawn and that a fresh decision would be taken .", "CARDINAL . In a fresh decision taken on CARDINAL DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG again rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request . Although accepting the veracity of the applicant \u2019s account that , at the orders of his superiors , he had taken a person DATE who turned out to be a drug trafficker \u2013 across the border into GPE without the papers and luggage of this person being checked and his account of the killing of this trafficker , the Deputy Minister rejected as not credible the claimed risk of persecution , taking into account that DATE according to the contents of the person - specific official report \u2013 several sources had stated that the applicant was not wanted by the ORG and that he was not wanted either as a suspect of a criminal offence . The Deputy Minister further considered that the general situation in GPE was not such that all persons from that country qualified for an asylum - based residence permit and that the applicant could turn for protection to the NORP authorities in so far as the alleged LAW risk would emanate from corrupt officials or the NORP drugs mafia .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was accepted on DATE by ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE . It quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON , ORG ; the successor to the Deputy Minister of Justice ) to take a fresh decision . It accepted the applicant \u2019s argument that the investigation on which the person - specific report was based had been incomplete as his registration as living at the address of his mother and brother could have been easily verified on the internet by consulting an electoral list and as it could be deduced from the underlying materials that a document of CARDINAL DATE ( DATE unknown ) referred to in the underlying materials was missing . The court also accepted the applicant \u2019s argument that the finding in the person - specific official report that the applicant had been dismissed following a reorganisation was contradicted by the applicant \u2019s statements , which had not been rejected as not credible , that until his departure from GPE he had followed professional training programmes and that he was about to be promoted . ORG lastly disagreed with the Deputy Minister that the applicant could have turned to the NORP authorities for protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister for ORG filed a further appeal to ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG . At the latter \u2019s request , the Minister of ORG provided ORG on DATE with the materials underlying the person - specific official report of DATE . In accordance with section CARDINAL:CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) , the Minister of ORG requested ORG to order that ( parts of ) these materials were to be disclosed only to ORG . On DATE , ORG decided that the access restriction requested by the Minister of ORG was justified . It subsequently sought and obtained the parties\u2019 consent to determine the further appeal also on the basis of those underlying materials which had not been disclosed to the parties but only to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG accepted the Minister \u2019s appeal , quashed the impugned judgment and rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . It held that the mere circumstance that the Minister of ORG had been unable to obtain information about the applicant \u2019s registration gave no cause to find that the inquiry into the registration or in respect of other elements had been careless and incomplete . It further rejected the applicant \u2019s claim in respect of the allegedly missing document dated DATE , finding that the mention thereof was an obvious clerical error and that the mention concerned had in fact referred to another document which had been taken into account in the decision - making process . It further found that ORG had unjustly held that the contradiction between the applicant \u2019s dismissal following a reorganisation and his statements about an imminent promotion concerned an essential part of his asylum account . According to ORG , the core of the asylum account was the alleged fear of persecution by the ORG in that he was wanted by the NORP for having witnessed the murder of GPE committed by a NORP collaborator whereas it was stated in the person - specific official report that various sources had indicated that the applicant was not wanted by the ORG . It therefore did not find it established that the person - specific official report had been drawn up in a careless manner or that it was incomplete . It also found no concrete indications in the applicant \u2019s other submissions for doubting the correctness or completeness of this report . It lastly accepted the Minister \u2019s view that it had not been shown that the incident with the ORG collaborator was representative for the entire police apparatus in GPE , that it had not been established by the applicant that the Head of the ORG was involved in drugs trafficking and that , bearing this in mind , the applicant could have turned for protection to the NORP authorities . No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice as regards asylum proceedings and enforcement of removals are set out in PERSON v. the GPE ( ( DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the ORG \u2019s policy on asylum - seekers from particular countries was devised by the Deputy Minister of ORG and his successor , the Minister for ORG , on the basis of , inter alia , official country assessment reports drawn up by the Minister of ORG on the countries of origin of asylum - seekers , but also reports published by ORG agencies or NGOs ( non - governmental organisations ) . There was no country - specific policy in respect of asylum - seekers from GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , person - specific reports ( individuele ambtsberichten ) are researched with the assistance of the GPE diplomatic missions in the countries concerned . In investigating information and documents submitted by asylum - seekers , ORG enlists the services of agents who are carefully screened for objectivity and reliability on the basis of information supplied by institutions such as NGOs , international organisations like the ORG ( ORG ) as well as third - country embassies that can make disinterested , informed assessments . Agents must satisfy high demands ; they must be discreet and painstaking , and have extensive networks and access to sources of information . Agents receive instructions before they begin their investigation , and their findings are discussed in meticulous detail when they report back to the embassy . The investigation is organised in such a way that the authorities are never made aware of the alien \u2019s identity , to ensure that ORG investigation does not cause any problems for the alien in his / her country of origin .", "CARDINAL . ORG never provides information to the alien concerned or to his authorised representative about the identity of the agents or informants who have assisted with the investigation , because this could expose them to serious danger from the authorities or from the alien or his relatives or associates . Nor does the ORG ever provide information about the methods and techniques used to examine the authenticity of documents , to avoid facilitating the making of better forgeries in the future or enabling future asylum - seekers to improve their accounts in support of their applications .", "CARDINAL . In a ruling given on DATE , ORG ( ORG ; \u201c REK \u201d ) of ORG of GPE held that the duty of due care when preparing a decision of an administrative law nature includes providing access to the documents on which a person - specific report is based . In cases in which a decision is based on a person - specific report , an employee of ORG and ORG ) must examine the report to determine , on the basis of the underlying materials , whether due care was taken in drawing it up , both substantively and procedurally , and whether the report is clear . This is referred to as the \u201c REK check \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , with the parties\u2019 consent , ORG and/or ORG may base its judgment also on information that has not been made available to the alien concerned . Before doing so , ORG and/or ORG decides , using a different panel of judges , whether the restrictions placed on the alien \u2019s access to the underlying document of a person - specific report are justified .", "CARDINAL . The most recent general official country assessment report ( algemeen ambtsbericht ) on GPE was published by ORG on DATE . It covers the period from DATE to DATE . As regards corruption it reads :", "\u201c In order to professionalise the judiciary and to combat corruption , the government of GPE started in DATE an extensive and fundamental reform of the judiciary . Many judges of the old regime were dismissed or placed on a reserve list . In addition , several judges resigned themselves . During the reporting period various measures were taken to increase the quality and independence of the judiciary . ...", "CARDINAL of the most visible reforms after the Rose Revolution of DATE concerns the police force . Corruption , abuse of power , extortion , torture practices and a dismissive attitude towards those seeking protection against criminality were being associated with the police in the past . With the assistance of the OSCE [ Organisation for Security and Cooperation in LOC ] the police was fundamentally reorganised . The number of staff was reduced drastically and the salaries of agents in active duty were increased by tenfold . After the reorganisation , the police force consists of traffic patrol police , criminal investigation police and border police . The new police force falls under the competence of ORG . In addition , in DATE , an improved Code of Ethics for the police entered into force . Corruption within the police force has almost entirely disappeared and the trust of the general population in the functioning and actions of the police during the reporting period has increased . ORG with complaints about the police can file them at specifically designated reporting points . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
