The applicant was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility .

He was sentenced to a term of discretionary life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s tariff ( that part of the sentence relating to retribution and deterrence ) expired on DATE . His continued detention was based on considerations of risk and dangerousness , ORG considering that he continued to present a risk of serious harm to the public .", "CARDINAL .

In the ORG judgment dated DATE , Lord Justice PERSON noted that section CARDINAL had a long history and cited the Secretary of ORG \u2019s reasons , given in the proceedings , for maintaining the current policy :", "\u201c By committing offences which by themselves or taken with any aggravating circumstances including the offender \u2019s character and previous criminal record require a custodial sentence , such prisoners have forfeited the right to have a say in the way the country is governed for that period . There is CARDINAL element to punishment than forcible detention . Removal from society means removal from the privileges of society , amongst which is the right to vote for one \u2019s representative . \u201d", "Examining the state of practice in other jurisdictions , he observed that in LOC CARDINAL countries , including GPE , did not give convicted prisoners a vote , while twenty did not disenfranchise prisoners and CARDINAL imposed a more restricted disenfranchisement . Reference was made to ORG which had rejected a challenge to LAW disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners ( see PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] GPE : ORG Reports DATE ) . Some considerable attention was given to NORP precedents , which were relied on by both parties , in particular that of ORG which , in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Reports CARDINAL ) , struck down the disenfranchisement of all prisoners as too widely drawn and infringing the minimum impairment rule , and that of ORG which , in PERSON ( no . CARDINAL ) ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Reports CARDINAL ) , upheld the subsequent legislative provision restricting the ban to prisoners serving a sentence of DATE or more in a correctional institution . While it was noted that the NORP courts were applying a differently phrased provision in LAW , ORG commented that the judgment of ORG in the second case in ORG contained helpful observations , in particular as regards the danger of the courts usurping the role of ORG . The cases before ORG and this ORG were also reviewed , ORG noting that the ORG had been consistent in its approach in accepting restrictions on persons convicted and detained .", "Lord Justice PERSON concluded :", "\u201c ... I return to what was said by ORG in paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment in PERSON . Of course as far as an individual prisoner is concerned disenfranchisement does impair the very essence of his right to vote , but that is too simplistic an approach , because what LAW is really concerned with is the wider question of universal franchise , and \u2018 the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u2019 . If an individual is to be disenfranchised that must be in the pursuit of a legitimate aim . In the case of a convicted prisoner serving his sentence the aim may not be easy to articulate . Clearly there is an element of punishment , and also an element of electoral law . As the Home Secretary said , ORG has taken the view that for the period during which they are in custody convicted prisoners have forfeited their right to have a say in the way the country is governed . ORG said that such prisoners had lost the moral authority to vote . Perhaps the best course is that suggested by ORG , namely to leave to philosophers the true nature of this disenfranchisement whilst recognising that the legislation does different things .", "ORG also requires that the means employed to restrict the implied Convention rights to vote are not disproportionate , and that is the point at which , as it seems to me , it is appropriate for this ORG to defer to the legislature . It is easy to be critical of a law which operates against a wide spectrum ( e.g. in relation to its effect on post - tariff discretionary life prisoners , and those detained under some provision of LAW DATE ) , but , as is clear from the authorities , those GPE which disenfranchise following conviction do not all limit the period of disenfranchisement to the period in custody . ORG in this country could have provided differently in order to meet the objectives which it discerned , and like PERSON in GPE , I would accept that the tailoring process seldom admits of perfection , so the courts must afford some leeway to the legislator . As [ counsel for the Secretary of ORG ] submits , there is a broad spectrum of approaches among democratic societies , and GPE falls into the middle of the spectrum . In course of time this position may move , either by way of further fine tuning , as was recently done in relation to remand prisoners and others , or more radically , but its position in the spectrum is plainly a matter for ORG not for the courts . That applies even to the \u2018 hard NORP of post - tariff discretionary life sentence prisoners ... They have all been convicted and if , for example , ORG were to have said that all those sentenced to life imprisonment lose the franchise for life the apparent anomaly of their position would disappear . ...", "If section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act can meet the challenge of LAW [ of LAW ] then LAW has nothing to offer , any more than LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s claims were accordingly dismissed as were those of the other prisoners .", "CARDINAL .

According to the ORG \u2019s survey based on information obtained from its diplomatic representation , CARDINAL countries allowed prisoners to vote without restriction ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , \u201c the former GPE \u201d , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , in CARDINAL countries all prisoners were barred from voting or unable to vote ( GPE , GPE", ", GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , while in CARDINAL countries prisoners\u2019 right to vote could be limited in some other way ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . Other material before the ORG indicates that in GPE prisoners may be debarred from voting if the principal sentence exceeds DATE , while in GPE prisoners serving a sentence in penitentiaries are not entitled to vote ; nor are prisoners in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the NORP ORG unanimously struck down a legislative provision barring all prisoners from voting ( see PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , cited above ) . Amendments were introduced limiting the ban to prisoners serving a sentence of DATE or more . ORG upheld the provision . However , following the decision of ORG in the present case , ORG on DATE in Sauv\u00e9 v. the Attorney General of GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) held by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL that section CARDINAL(e ) of LAW DATE , which denied the right to vote to every person imprisoned in a correctional institution serving a sentence of DATE or more , was unconstitutional as it infringed Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , which provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . LAW guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Every citizen of GPE has the right to vote in an election of members of ORG or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The majority opinion given by PERSON considered that the right to vote was fundamental to their democracy and the rule of law and could not be lightly set aside . Limits on this right required not deference , but careful examination . The majority found that the Government had failed to identify the particular problems that required denying the right to vote and that the measure did not satisfy the proportionality test , in particular as the Government had failed to establish a rational connection between the denial of the right to vote and its stated objectives .", "As regards the objective of promoting civic responsibility and respect for the law , denying penitentiary inmates the right to vote was more likely to send messages that undermined respect for the law and democracy than messages that enhanced those values . The legitimacy of the law and the obligation to obey the law flowed directly from the right of every citizen to vote . To deny prisoners the right to vote was to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility and ran counter to democratic principles of inclusiveness , equality , and citizen participation and was inconsistent with the respect for the dignity of every person that lay at the heart of NORP democracy and the LAW .", "With regard to the second objective of imposing appropriate punishment , it was considered that the Government had offered no credible theory about why it should be allowed to deny a fundamental democratic right as a form of ORG punishment . Nor could it be regarded as a legitimate form of punishment as it was arbitrary \u2013 it was not tailored to the acts and circumstances of the individual offender and bore little relation to the offender \u2019s particular crime \u2013 and did not serve a valid criminal - law purpose , as neither the record nor common sense supported the claim that disenfranchisement deterred crime or rehabilitated criminals .", "CARDINAL . The minority opinion given by PERSON found that the objectives of the measure were pressing and substantial and based upon a reasonable and rational social or political philosophy . The first objective , that of enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law , related to the promotion of good citizenship . The social rejection of serious crime reflected a moral line which safeguarded the social contract and the rule of law and bolstered the importance of the nexus between individuals and the community . The \u2018 promotion of civic responsibility\u2019 might be abstract or symbolic , but symbolic or abstract purposes could be valid of their own accord and should not be downplayed simply for being symbolic . As regards the second objective , that of enhancing the general purposes of the criminal sanction , the measure clearly had a punitive aspect with a retributive function . It was a valid objective for ORG to develop appropriate sanctions and punishments for serious crime . The disenfranchisement was a civil disability arising from the criminal conviction . It was also proportionate , as the measure was rationally connected to the objectives and carefully tailored to apply to perpetrators of serious crimes . The disenfranchisement of serious criminal offenders served to deliver a message to both the community and the offenders themselves that serious criminal activity would not be tolerated by the community . ORG , on this view , could choose to curtail temporarily the availability of the vote to serious criminals to insist that civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law , as goals worthy of pursuit , were prerequisites to democratic participation . The minority referred to the need to respect the limits imposed by ORG and to be sensitive to the fact that there may be many possible reasonable and rational balances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in DATE and ORG and Others ( CCTCARDINAL/CARDINAL : DATE ( CARDINAL ) SA CARDINAL ) , ORG considered the application of prisoners for a declaration and orders that ORG take measures enabling them and other prisoners to register and vote while in prison . It noted that , under LAW , the right of every adult citizen to vote in elections for legislative bodies was set out in unqualified terms and it underlined the importance of the right :", "\u201c The universality of the franchise is important not only for nationhood and democracy . The vote of each and every citizen is a badge of dignity and personhood . Quite literally , it says that everybody counts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that the right to vote by its very nature imposed positive obligations upon the legislature and the executive and that LAW must be interpreted in a way that gave effect to constitutional declarations , guarantees and responsibilities . It noted that many democratic societies imposed voting disabilities on some categories of prisoners . Although there were no comparable provisions in LAW , it recognised that limitations might be imposed upon the exercise of fundamental rights , provided they were , inter alia , reasonable and justifiable . The question whether legislation barring prisoners would be justified under LAW was not raised in the proceedings and it emphasised that the judgment was not to be read as preventing ORG from disenfranchising certain categories of prisoners . In the absence of such legislation , prisoners had the constitutional right to vote and neither ORG nor ORG had the power to disenfranchise them . It concluded that the ORG was under the obligation to make reasonable arrangements for prisoners to vote ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
