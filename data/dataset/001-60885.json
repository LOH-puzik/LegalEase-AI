The parents were allegedly also consuming large quantities of beer on a DATE basis .", "CARDINAL . The child welfare support group again considered the matter on CARDINAL DATE , discussing for the first time the possible need to place the children in public care , and on DATE .

ORG has not been provided with copies of these orders which were apparently issued by the Chairman of ORG on its behalf . In the care orders of DATE the ORG referred to its decision of CARDINAL DATE , at paragraph TIME , to issue such orders . The social welfare office \u2019s case reports contain no entry of that date recording the emergency care . According to the Government , the orders of DATE were grounded on the need \u201c to ensure the investigations concerning incest following the closing of department B CARDINAL of ORG and in order to place the children in the children \u2019s home of [ P. ] \u201d . The Government explained that as the child psychiatric examination had not been finished by DATE the day when the children \u2019s ward was closing due to DATE of the staff \u2013 it was necessary to issue emergency care orders allowing for the examination to be completed and for a final assessment of the possible need for further measures .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG upheld the emergency orders after having heard the parents in person . The parents had also submitted written observations in which they , inter alia , rejected the allegations of sexual abuse contained in the documents to which they had had access .

In addition to the GPE written observations and the submissions indicated in the preceding paragraph , ORG had before it a report by the school nurse and school welfare officer dated CARDINAL DATE in which they recounted their interview with A. and PERSON on DATE . It had also received an opinion by the director of ORG care centre .", "CARDINAL . ORG reasoned as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In addition to the previously appearing difficulties relating to [ the GPE ] mental health and financial situation , incest has been found to have been directed against the children in the family , which seriously endangers their development and health . In addition , the parents have been consuming alcohol on an everyday basis over a long period of time . In these circumstances the children are not able to receive such care and support from their parents as their age would warrant .", "CARDINAL . The family has been receiving assistance for domestic chores on a regular basis , in an attempt to support their survival as a family in spite of their problems . In order to support the children \u2019s development they have been provided with day care . Subsistence allowance has been granted whenever necessary , in spite of [ the GPE ] income . As the incest is linked to other serious problems it is not possible to ensure the children \u2019s development and health in their home by affording open - care assistance .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public care and the children \u2019s placement out of their home ( sijaishuolto , v\u00e5rd utom hemmet ) will enable them to grow up in secure , stable and stimulating conditions , where they can reach , as best as possible , the stage of development typical for children of their age . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG ordered that the public care was to be implemented as follows :", "\u201c The children \u2019s contact with their parents and other persons important to the children will be supported by organising meetings in the children \u2019s home , as need be . The [ children \u2019s ] need for out - of - home care is of long - term nature . Their first placement will be in the children \u2019s home and the possibility of providing foster care will be explored at a later stage . The children are in need of special support in the form of therapy , which can be afforded on the premises of the children \u2019s home . The overall situation of the family will be taken care of in co - operation with the child psychiatric clinic and the mental health office . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Board decided to reconsider the care orders under LAW of LAW within DATE from DATE of the emergency care orders , in pursuance of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the said LAW .", "CARDINAL . In an opinion of DATE PERSON drew the following conclusions :", "\u201c The investigations have shown that [ K. and A. ] have been sexually abused by their mother apparently for DATE . The father has not been able to protect his daughters , even though aware of the abuse . The family conditions seriously endanger the psychological and physical development of all of the children ( the serving of alcohol , violence ) . The children have to use an unreasonable part of their psychological energy on being concerned about themselves , their siblings , their parents and the family situation in general . This renders the children insecure , distressed , frightened and depressed . In my opinion the parents , even if supported by open - care assistance , are not able to secure the children \u2019s situation sufficiently and cater to their physical and psychological needs . The burden caused by the family \u2019s situation can already be seen in the disturbed psychological development of the children . In my opinion their physical and psychological development will be seriously endangered if they are returned to their biological parents . In this situation the biological parents ... also need psychiatric help and support . To this end they have been recommended to continue making appointments at ORG . The practical arrangements for providing psychotherapy to the children will be considered in the autumn . For now , priority must be given to taking child welfare measures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parents , heard by social workers , maintained their opposition to the public care of their children . The invitation to that meeting stated that the case - file would be available to them for consultation . On DATE ORG heard the parents , who denied the allegations concerning abuse and neglect of the children . They handed in written observations as well as a copy of ORG \u2019s patient records at the local ORG , arguing that they had regularly used its services in matters relating to the children \u2019s health and that nothing in the records suggested that PERSON had been subjected to physical violence . The parents requested that the ORG hear their daughter \u2019s teachers , domestic helpers and others familiar with conditions in the family . They further requested that lay helpers or support families be appointed for the family . They objected to a categorical statement made by CARDINAL social welfare official to the effect that they would not get their children back .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG maintained the public care on the grounds relied on in its decision of DATE . The parents appealed to the competent ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) without the assistance of legal counsel . In a statement to the court PERSON also questioned the care orders . On DATE ORG , without having held an oral hearing , rejected the appeal and confirmed the public care orders with the following reasoning :", "\u201c According to the evidence transpiring from the documentation on file , the shortcomings in the children \u2019s care and the other conditions in their home seriously jeopardise the children \u2019s health and development . The open - care assistance has proved to be insufficient and care outside the home has been deemed to be in the children \u2019s best interests . ORG has therefore been under an obligation to place [ the children ] in the care of [ the ORG ] . \u201d", "The parents appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . The care plan was reviewed at a meeting on DATE attended by the parents . The parents and the children would continue to meet CARDINAL times a week and psychotherapy was to be provided to the children starting DATE . The parents objected to foster care for the children and preferred to await the outcome of the appeal proceedings . According to the Government , meetings took place CARDINAL times a week from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The care plan was again reviewed on DATE at a meeting attended by the applicant . The children and the parents had continued to meet CARDINAL times a week and the children had been on DATE leaves to visit relatives . The possibility of placing the children in foster care was again raised but the applicant remained opposed to such care , preferring to await the outcome of the appeal . He was told that ORG would not necessarily reverse previous decisions and that the foster care needed to be planned at a sufficiently early stage . Moreover , on DATE the children themselves had been consulted about their possible foster care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the GPE appeal without holding an oral hearing and without adducing further reasons .", "CARDINAL . The care plan was again reviewed on DATE in the presence of the parents . They were told a decision now had to be made as to whether the children should remain in the children \u2019s home or be placed in a foster family . When consulted by a social welfare official the children had preferred to be placed in a foster family , \u201c if they could not return home \u201d . The applicant stated he would pursue his attempts to have them returned home . Meanwhile , they should stay in the children \u2019s home . The applicant was told that even if the children were placed in a foster family , they would continue to see their biological parents , \u201c although naturally not as frequently \u201d . The meeting was adjourned at the applicant \u2019s request until CARDINAL DATE . At that meeting the parents were informed that a foster family had already been found and that the children had repeated their willingness to move there , \u201c since their return to their [ original ] home was not possible \u201d . The parents were informed that ORG would receive a proposal for transferring the children into the foster family , since such care was in many respects a better alternative than care in an institution , considering that the public care was going to continue and given the children \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . At a further meeting on CARDINAL DATE the parents were informed that DATE , when the children would be transferred to the foster family , and DATE they would not be able to meet with the children . Subsequently , CARDINAL meetings DATE would be organised . According to the care plan of DATE , the temporary absence of meetings was aimed at ensuring a peaceful implementation of their transfer and adaptation to their new family , school and nursery . The care plan was to be reviewed at DATE or earlier , if necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to transfer the children into foster care and adopted the updated care plan . It noted that the family conditions had been deemed seriously to endanger the children \u2019s development and , as the matter concerned incest , their future health and development could only be secured by long - term foster care . Placing them in a foster family was thus in their best interests . ORG had regard to a written statement by the director of the children \u2019s home and a joint statement by the leading social welfare official , the aforesaid director and the children \u2019s individual nurses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , seeking to have the public care revoked or , in the alternative , to have meetings organised more frequently and to have the care plan reviewed at the latest in DATE . On DATE ORG declined to examine the merits of the appeal , as it was not competent to examine , in the first instance , the request for termination of the care . The adoption of the care plan had not comprised any binding decision on the applicant \u2019s right to see his children . Any access restriction had to be ordered separately by ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW . The expected time - limit for reviewing the care plan had the character of a guideline , since under the law such a plan was to be reviewed whenever necessary . ORG relied on sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE of LAW and on section CARDINAL of LAW . The applicant did not appeal further to ORG in respect of the decision to transfer the children into foster care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the public care be terminated . On DATE ORG refused the request . It found that continued public care was in the best interests of the children , considering \u201c the difficulties relating to the mental health and the use of alcohol as well as the incest directed against the children \u201d , which had formed the background to their placement in public care . In a meeting with the leading social welfare official on DATE and in their written statements of the same day K. and A. had stated their wish to remain in the foster family . J. had not been heard due to his young age . ORG also had regard to PERSON opinion of DATE . Moreover , in a written statement of CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL teachers of J. \u2019s nursery had attested to his gain of self - confidence . The foster parents noted that the children were adapting to the foster family . It was therefore in the children \u2019s best interests to remain there . ORG also had regard to a CARDINAL - page background summary by leading social worker GPE", "CARDINAL . In his appeal the applicant stated , inter alia , that he would move away from his wife and request sole custody of the children . In its opinion to ORG maintained its view that the biological GPE living situation had not changed significantly . Terminating the public care would therefore not be in accordance with the children \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . In an entry into the case - notes on DATE social worker PERSON wrote that the divorce proposed by the applicant would change nothing , as the children had been placed in long - term care , \u201c up to their adulthood , in my opinion \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal with the following reasoning :", "\u201c According to the evidence transpiring from the documentation on file , ORG considers that the need for public care outside the [ children \u2019s original ] home still exists . ORG has therefore been under an obligation to maintain the public care of the children . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further appeal without adducing further reasons .", "CARDINAL . According to the care plan adopted on DATE the biological parents had not , at a meeting on DATE , expressed any wish to meet the children more frequently . On DATE the leading social welfare official invited the parents to clarify their wishes in respect of meetings with the children .
