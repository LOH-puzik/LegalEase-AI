NORP The applicant , Mr E.N. , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for asylum and a residence permit in GPE . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) he stated that his name was X , born on DATE , and of NORP ethnicity . He was from GPE Rural , married and had finished his studies in DATE . The applicant further claimed that he had flown from GPE airport to GPE on DATE , with a stop - over in an unknown country . He had used a fake passport and a \u201c white man \u201d had escorted him . As concerned his grounds for seeking asylum he submitted that , in DATE , his mother had been killed by PERSON , a man who was now a police officer , and that he had been the only witness to the murder . Moreover , CARDINAL of his brothers had been killed by a man named P. in DATE . The applicant further alleged that , since DATE , he had been active in the Association Pour La Lutte Contre Le Genocide ( hereafter \u201c the Association \u201d ) . He had been arbitrarily detained from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and again from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . On neither of these QUANTITY occasions had he been given any explanation for the deprivation of his liberty or his release . He had again been arbitrarily detained DATE . He suspected that this deprivation of liberty had been ordered by PERSON and that he had been released only because he had been so badly beaten that they had feared that he would die . He had again been detained from DATE to CARDINAL DATE because he had participated in a demonstration to protest against a decision to release a number of persons convicted of genocide . The applicant claimed that he had been the victim of serious abuse each time he had been detained . Furthermore , on DATE he and some friends had been attacked but he had managed to escape . He thought that the attack was due to his political engagement and his witness statements . The applicant submitted to ORG that the main reason for his persecution was his ethnicity and his political opinion .", "CARDINAL . At the ORG 's oral meeting with the applicant , he submitted essentially the following . His father owned land and lived in ORG whereas his wife and brothers lived in GPE . Moreover , it was a relative of PERSON 's , by the name of PERSON , who had killed his mother when the bus they were travelling on had been stopped by rebels . The national army had intervened and so he and the other passengers had survived . He had reported the event to the police and he had been supposed to testify but PERSON had not appeared for the trial . Instead he had testified in court in DATE against L. , despite the fact that he had never witnessed PERSON commit any crime , but because he had wanted to know where PERSON was hiding . He had also testified against PERSON who had killed his brothers in DATE . Although he and his brothers had been hiding in different houses , he was sure that it was PERSON who had killed them . He had not been the only witness and PERSON had been imprisoned . Furthermore , the first time he had been arbitrarily detained , he had been at a meeting with the ORG and CARDINAL of them had been arrested . The second time , he had been detained together with CARDINAL others at the boarding school he attended , probably because they were ethnic NORP . The third time , he had been out walking when he had been taken by rebels on the orders of PERSON , who by then had become a police chief , and wanted to prevent him from testifying . He had managed to get a message out to his uncle , who was in the military , and who had come to inquire as to why he had been detained . As there had been no answer , they had released him . The fourth time , he had been detained together with CARDINAL other persons during a demonstration against a decision to release political prisoners since , among those prisoners , were persons who had committed genocide , inter alia , P. and L. On CARDINAL occasions , he had been released through the help of an organisation which helps prisoners and he had only been ill - treated when he had been detained by the rebels . Moreover , he had been a member of the ORG since DATE and had participated in meetings and organised CARDINAL demonstration . He thought that he was sought by the authorities because he had testified .", "CARDINAL . In a written submission to ORG , the applicant added that the trials against L. and P. had been held at the same time in DATE and that he had testified against both of them . They had then been imprisoned until the second trial in DATE , when he had again testified against them . L. had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment and PERSON had been sentenced to death . In DATE he had gone to the police to report that F. had killed his mother but the court had not considered his report . On DATE everyone who had been convicted of crimes against the NORP population had been released from prison and the applicant claimed that he now felt threatened by PERSON they held positions of power within the Government .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the applicant had only submitted an identity card , issued after he had left GPE , and of simple quality . He had not submitted any other documents to prove his identity . ORG also found it highly unlikely that the applicant had travelled to GPE without having to show a passport during the trip , despite transfers . It considered that the applicant had withheld information and that he had probably left GPE legally . However , ORG accepted that he was from GPE but considered that the general situation in that country was not so serious that the applicant could be granted leave to remain in GPE on this sole ground . Turning to the applicant 's personal situation , the ORG first observed that he had submitted no evidence at all . It then considered that the applicant had given rather vague and unclear information about his testimonies and police reports . In particular , as concerned his mother 's death , the ORG found it unlikely that he would have waited DATE until DATE to report the assailant to the police , especially since there had been many witnesses on the bus and the army had intervened . It further found improbable that the applicant had testified against L. as he had not witnessed him commit any crime and since , as a witness , he did not have the right to question ORG also found reason to doubt that he had testified against PERSON since he had only been DATE at the time of the crimes and had been hiding in a different house from where his brothers had been killed . Furthermore , the ORG observed that there had been several witnesses testifying against P. and PERSON during their trials for which reason it was unlikely that they would seek revenge on the applicant . As concerned PERSON , it appeared that he had neither been charged nor prosecuted . Hence , it was improbable that he would be looking to eliminate the applicant and , if the applicant had been detained and ill - treated by rebels in DATE , this was rather due to the general violence than due to PERSON 's orders . Turning to the applicant 's claim that he had been arbitrarily detained , ORG found no reason to question this since such detention was widespread in GPE . It then noted that the applicant had not been ill - treated during these arrests and that he had been released with the help of a specialised organisation . Moreover , he had not held a prominent position within the ORG and had each time been detained together with several others . Thus , ORG considered that it had not been shown that the arbitrary arrests had been due to his activities within the ORG . Also , since he had been released each time without being charged with a crime , the ORG found it very unlikely that he was sought in GPE . It also observed that he was a young , well - educated man whose wife and relatives were in his home country . Consequently , ORG concluded that the applicant was not a refugee or otherwise in need of protection in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , relying on the same grounds as before ORG and adding , inter alia , the following . He had never claimed to have been persecuted by the Burundian government . However , he had been persecuted , imprisoned and the victim of an attempt to kill him by persons against whom he had testified . Other witnesses , who had testified in such proceedings , had been killed or tortured by the rebels against whom they had testified once these rebels had been released . The authorities could not protect him since some of the criminals were now in high positions within the government and police . The applicant claimed that he was most afraid of F. who had been a rebel but had since become a police officer with friends in many places . P. and L. were normal persons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having held an oral hearing where the applicant was heard , rejected the appeal . It noted that the applicant had only been detained in connection with concrete situations and that he had been released with the help of an organisation . In the court 's view , this did not amount to persecution but was rather a reflection of the unstable situation in the country . The court further observed that the applicant had been unable to account for any tangible threats against him personally . It also pointed out that he had been released , relatively unharmed , after DATE of captivity by PERSON 's rebel group which indicated that PERSON had not intended to kill him . Hence , it concluded that the applicant had not made probable that he was in need of protection in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal , ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant requested ORG to review his case since he was a survivor of the genocide in GPE and therefore entitled to protection in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request as the applicant had failed to invoke any new circumstances and as there were no impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG and added to his earlier claims that , on DATE , he had left GPE on a flight to GPE where he had remained for DATE before continuing his journey to GPE by train . Hence , it was GPE that should try his asylum request . In the alternative , he asked to be allowed to travel to GPE to renew his registration at a NORP university . The applicant produced a copy of a passport in the name of ORG , born on DATE , with an entry stamp dated DATE at FAC in GPE . The passport also contained a multi - entry visa for GPE , valid from CARDINAL DATE until DATE . On the visa it was stated that the holder was a student and that he should request a residence permit ( carte de s\u00e9jour ) upon arrival in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision in full and , upon further appeal , ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the ORG to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG in order to stop the enforcement of his deportation , scheduled for DATE . He submitted that his name was ORG , born on DATE , and he produced a copy of his NORP visa as proof . He maintained the claims he had presented to the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Acting President of the Section to which the case had been allocated rejected the request . On DATE the NORP police tried to enforce the deportation of the applicant but he violently resisted . Although the police officers managed to get him on the plane , the pilot felt that he could not ensure the safety of all passengers with the applicant on board and so he was taken off the plane again and returned to the detention centre .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then renewed his request for interim measures to the ORG , insisting that deportation would violate his right to life and adding that his treatment by the NORP police had amounted to mental and physical torture . The request was refused by the Acting President of the Section on DATE , confirmed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that he was in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW , of the CARDINAL Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section DATE CARDINAL Act ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien 's health status . In the preparatory works to this provision ( Government Bill CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien 's home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
