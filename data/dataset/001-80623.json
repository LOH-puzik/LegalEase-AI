On DATE , at TIME , the applicant was walking towards a cafeteria in PERSON , a district of GPE , when he saw a police patrol carrying out an identity check on the passengers of a car . The applicant , who knew the passengers , proceeded to ask CARDINAL of them , Mr PERSON , what was going on .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that a police officer , who was subsequently identified as Police Sergeant Apostolos GPE , flashed his torch on him and asked him to identify himself . The applicant replied that he wanted to know whether his friend had a problem . The applicant was then asked by another police officer , later identified as Police Constable Zaharias Tsiorakis , to produce his identity card . The applicant replied that he did not have his identity card with him and suggested that they all go to the nearby police station for an identity check , as his identity card had been issued there . Then , allegedly , CARDINAL of the police officers asked him whether he was \u201c being the tough guy \u201d . The applicant submitted that , TIME later , NORP wrapped his handcuffs around his fist and then punched him in the mouth . The applicant alleged that this made him feel dizzy and that , as he was falling down , Tsiorakis kicked him twice in the chest and abdomen .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asserted that he managed to leave the scene when another acquaintance of his , PERSON , headed towards the police officers , asking them to stop beating the applicant on the head as the latter was suffering from a head problem . The applicant contended that by that time he had heard CARDINAL gunshots being fired . According to the testimony of Police Officer PERSON , the latter fired CARDINAL warning shots in the air \u201c in a safe way \u201d with the intention of intimidating the applicant as he was escaping from the scene .

They then handcuffed him and started beating and kicking him in various parts of his body . The applicant asserted that the police officers who had carried out the initial road check were among those ill - treating him . According to the applicant , this went on for TIME , until the officers realised that a high - ranking officer was coming . Upon hearing this , a police officer grabbed a dirty mop and wiped the blood off the floor and the applicant 's face , repeatedly uttering the word \u201c drop dead \u201d ( \u03c8\u03cc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 ) .", "CARDINAL .

Among them , PERSON and PERSON were charged with assaulting police officers . In their defence pleadings , dated DATE and DATE , they stated that they had been the victims of a discriminatory attitude due to their ethnic origin .

GPE , you are mafia , you come over here and you think you are tough , you bastards , if you do n't leave town or if we see you again in the cafeteria , we will f ... you , f ... your GPE and GPE \u201d .

I f ... your mothers \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government maintained that the identity check on the passengers of the car had been almost complete when the applicant , who was passing by , headed towards the police officers . The police officers initially warned him not to come close to the car so as to be able to complete the check unobstructed and not expose the passengers to public view .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite their initial warning the QUANTITY police officers were ignored by the applicant , who approached the car and started talking to the passengers . Police Officer PERSON asked the applicant to identify himself . The latter refused to obey and shoved the police officer abruptly with his arm .

The latter resisted strongly by punching and kicking the above - mentioned officers .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime PERSON and PERSON had appeared from a nearby caf\u00e9 and got involved in the argument between the applicant and the QUANTITY police officers . While the police officers were trying to handcuff the applicant and arrest him , PERSON and PERSON violently shoved the police officers with their arms and struck them with their arms and legs . By doing so , they managed to prevent them arresting the applicant , who fled from the scene . PERSON fired a shot in the air in order to scare his assailants away .", "CARDINAL . Due to the fact that the incident had been taking place close to GPE police station , as soon as Officer PERSON had fired the shot , another group of police officers ran to their assistance . A number of persons who had either actively participated in or just observed the incident ran away into the caf\u00e9 .

The hospitalisation note stated that the police officers were admitted to the hospital on DATE and discharged on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Police Officers Hamopoulos , GPE and NORP were not subjected to a medical examination by a forensic doctor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LOC police headquarters ordered an administrative investigation in order to ascertain the exact circumstances in which the QUANTITY police officers had been injured and whether they were liable for any disciplinary offence . The administrative investigation was assigned to an officer serving at the police 's sub - directorate of administrative investigations . As part of the investigation the investigating police officer summoned as witnesses the QUANTITY police officers who had been involved in the incident . The various witness statements available were studied but no further inquiry was conducted regarding the gunshots fired or the general legitimacy of the initial identity check . It was observed in the report of the administrative investigation issued on DATE that \u201c persons involved in the incident refused to comply with the police officers ' orders and , furthermore , CARDINAL of them [ ORG ] had intended to \u201c control \u201d the police officers who were performing the identity check , considering arbitrarily and cheekily that he had an inexistent right .... Taking into account also the unprovoked , violent and disproportionate assault by other individuals on the police officers , it is concluded that the police officers properly assessed the relevant circumstances and acted correctly . The brawl between the police officers and the individuals in question was inevitable . The police officers used necessary physical force against the civilians , mainly in order to defend their physical integrity that was under imminent threat . There was a clear danger that the police officers ' firearms would be snatched by the individuals concerned in the context of a disproportionate assault by CARDINAL of them on the police officers . Thus , apart from the injuries inflicted on the police officers , which could easily have been more serious , there was an imminent danger that firearms would be used by civilians in an extreme way ( fatal shooting of the police officers , etc . ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards the alleged ill - treatment on the LOC of the police station , the report observed , among other things , that \u201c the violent behaviour of the police officers transpired from the testimonies of the persons who had provoked the illegal acts . Even if these testimonies could not be rejected as such , their accuracy and objectivity could not be taken for granted . Testimonies such as those made by GPE and PERSON DATE cousin and friend respectively of the accused \u2013 undoubtedly concern personal opinions and assessments that will be of assistance to the accused during the trial . ... Not all the testimonies have been proven ; on the contrary , the police officers ( involved in the events ) have denied them . The latter insisted in their testimonies that there was no violence in the police station and that all the injuries sustained by the civilians were provoked before their transfer to the police station \u201d . It continued as follows : \u201c At this point reference should be made to the allegations of individuals concerning unprovoked ill - treatment inflicted by ' mean ' police officers against those who just ' happened ' to be there or were unrelated to the incident . These [ testimonies ] could not be taken seriously , nor could they be considered objective . On the contrary , they had to be considered as defence tactics by their friends / acquaintances , who faced serious criminal charges and whose depositions aim to cast the police officers in a bad light \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the report noted that both the applicant and the police officers had failed to submit to an examination by the forensic doctor . It stated that \u201c As they failed to undergo the forensic exam ( not CARDINAL of the victims went to the forensic doctor to be examined ) , the seriousness of the injuries inflicted on the individuals can not be accurately assessed . This fact shows an intention to prevent the disclosure of new evidence that would have facilitated the investigation of the case . ... The same considerations could be applied to the police officers . According to the investigating police officer , this omission was due to negligence on the part of the police officers . ... The disciplinary liability that derived from that omission was obvious in the present case , but was of minor importance in the context of the case as a whole . Thus , no such intention could be attributed to the police officers \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The report did not make any reference to the applicant 's forensic medical examination of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE charges were brought against the applicant for resisting arrest , assaulting a police officer and causing grievous bodily harm . On DATE the applicant appeared before the investigating judge in order to testify with regard to the charges against him . The applicant contended that Police Officer PERSON had submitted his criminal record to the investigating judge in order to establish his \u201c criminal and socially deviant character \u201d . ORG contended that the files relating to the applicant 's criminal record had been compiled by the police department in which he served . The applicant contended that the information about his criminal record as submitted by ORG was inaccurate and not up to date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge granted the applicant bail for CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of First Instance sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment under LAW for resisting lawful authority . The first - instance court established that Police Officer PERSON had asked the applicant to identify himself and that the latter had refused to obey and had shoved him violently with his arm and then violently pushed Officers PERSON and NORP with his arms and feet . It further considered that Police Officers Apostolidis , LOC had been assaulted by PERSON and PERSON , who had appeared from a nearby caf\u00e9 in the meantime and tried to help the applicant escape . The court accepted that the QUANTITY police officers had feared for their physical integrity as a group of CARDINAL persons had hindered them , either physically or verbally , in their task of carrying out a normal police control . Finally , the court did not accept that the aggravating circumstances described in LAW could be applied in the applicant 's case ( judgment no . MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . The case is currently pending before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with ORG . The complaint was lodged against the police officers who had been involved in the incident described above and concerned the alleged ill - treatment both during the course of his arrest and during his detention on DATE . The applicant further complained that he had not been given time to apply to ORG for a copy of the police officers ' criminal and disciplinary records , whereas Police Officer PERSON had been able to submit the applicant 's criminal record to the investigating judge in order to establish his \u201c criminal and socially deviant character \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor at ORG of First Instance dismissed the applicant 's criminal complaint as \u201c factually unfounded \u201d . The prosecutor endorsed the conclusions reached in the administrative investigation on the basis of the depositions of the police officers .

On DATE the applicant lodged a fresh appeal with the Prosecutor at ORG . On DATE his appeal was dismissed as \u201c factually unfounded \u201d again .

The applicant 's allegations of ill - treatment were considered to be false and the prosecutor concluded that there was no need to launch an in - depth judicial investigation into the incident . Lastly , the prosecutor confirmed the conclusions of the Prosecutor at ORG as to the admissibility of the files which had been compiled by Police Officer PERSON from the applicant 's criminal record and submitted to the investigating judge ( decision no .

ORG issued a report on DATE entitled \u201c Disciplinary - administrative investigations into allegations against police officers \u201d . It stated in relation to the use of medical certificates by the police :", "\u201c This is a major issue mainly in cases that are routine and do not contain any reference to the effect that the existing medical certificates were taken into consideration when deciding on the issue of disciplinary punishment and do not provide an adequate explanation for the conclusions of the administrative investigation , especially in cases where , for example , the nature of the bodily injuries attested to by the medical certificates , would clearly warrant a more careful examination . For instance , reference is made to [ a case where ] ORG noted that the extent of bodily injuries , as borne out by the medical certificates assessed by the police in a routine manner , indicated that either the police officers involved had exceeded the limits of self - defence or that [ the police officers ] had breached LAW ] . As a consequence , the NORP Police should have assessed the evidence before it in a more careful and substantiated way . Due to the merely routine assessment of evidence , the validity of any ensuing judgment of police disciplinary bodies is justifiably rendered vulnerable and susceptible to all kinds of criticism .", "In cases like the one mentioned above , suspicions naturally arise as to the perfunctory assessment of the available evidence . Because of the routine assessment of evidence , the validity of every decision of the police disciplinary bodies becomes somewhat vulnerable and susceptible to all kinds of criticism if [ the decision ] disregards the precepts of legal science and all the methods it employs in establishing the actual facts of a case \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
