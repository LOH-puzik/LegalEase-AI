Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant ( hereinafter \" Dombo \" ) is a limited liability company under GPE law ; it is the continuation of a public limited company ( naamloze vennootschap ) originally founded in DATE . It has its registered office in GPE . At the material time , its business included holding shares in several other companies , for which it provided management ; these subsidiary companies engaged in commercial activities . The shares in Dombo were held by a foundation ( ORG ) which issued certificates of shares ; these were apparently all held by a Mr PERSON . The company \u2019s management also included PERSON ; he was the sole managing director from DATE until his dismissal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , except for a short period DATE and DATE during which he was suspended as managing director and temporarily replaced by a Mr C.U. and PERSON", "CARDINAL . At the material time , PERSON banked with ORG ( hereinafter \" the ORG \" ) through its branch office in ORG . The manager of that office was a Mr van W. ; under the ORG \u2019s company statutes his position was not that of managing director of the ORG itself and his powers to represent the ORG , which included allowing credit up to a certain maximum , were strictly circumscribed . An agreement existed between PERSON and the ORG under which ORG and its subsidiaries enjoyed credit in current account , i.e. the possibility of overdrawing on accounts held with the ORG . In DATE this credit facility amounted to MONEY ( NLG ) , with an additional temporary overdraft facility of up to NLG CARDINAL . This agreement had been formalised in a written confirmation of an oral agreement to that effect and in a contract dated CARDINAL DATE under which the ORG opened a joint account ( compte - jointovereenkomst ) in the name of ORG and its subsidiaries , who assumed responsibility jointly and severally for meeting their obligations to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . A dispute arose between PERSON and the ORG concerning the development of their financial relationship during the period DATE and DATE . In the ensuing civil proceedings both parties gave renderings of the facts which differed materially on significant points .", "CARDINAL . PERSON \u2019s account may be summarised as follows .", "( a ) In DATE the ORG , through the manager of its ORG branch , Mr PERSON , agreed orally to raise the maximum of the credit available to PERSON by NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL to a total of NLG CARDINAL . As PERSON had explained to PERSON required this extension to take over the commercial operations of a certain limited liability company , ORG , which had gone bankrupt ; action was needed urgently . This oral agreement was to be formalised later ; at this point , however , PERSON did agree in writing to stand surety himself for PERSON and its subsidiaries to the amount of NLG CARDINAL . Following this alteration of the agreement of CARDINAL DATE PERSON opened an account with the ORG earmarked for its activities in connection with the ORG takeover and the ORG provided letters of credit on a number of occasions .", "( b ) In DATE CARDINAL PERSON was offered the opportunity to take over CARDINAL other limited liability companies , GPE and NORP , which had run into financial difficulties . To finance these takeovers PERSON required another extension of the credit limit ; this was discussed between PERSON and PERSON Following these discussions the ORG made ORG an offer in writing dated DATE to raise the maximum credit to NLG CARDINAL . In anticipation of this extension , the ORG paid out NLG CARDINAL in connection with the takeover of ORG and NORP and subsequently agreed to a withdrawal by PERSON of another NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the same purpose . Mr PERSON required security for these sums in the form of a mortgage and made PERSON Reijendam sign a blank power of attorney . The ORG made use of that document to have a deed drawn up by a notary mortgaging all immovable property belonging to ORG , its subsidiaries and PERSON personally . This mortgage was surety for a credit of NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL , i.e. it further secured the extension of the credit referred to in sub - paragraph ( a ) above .", "( c ) On DATE the ORG , through Mr PERSON , unexpectedly and inexplicably withdrew its confidence in PERSON , called on him to resign and froze all PERSON \u2019s accounts without warning , this in spite of the fact that its total debit balance was then NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and therefore well within the agreed limit of NLG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s rendering of the facts may be summarised as follows .", "( a ) The ORG acknowledged that PERSON had asked for a higher credit limit in connection with the takeover of the commercial activities of the company O. It had agreed in principle but had required certain additional information to be provided by PERSON , including its DATE statement for DATE ) ; these had never been received and an agreement to raise the existing credit facilities as claimed by PERSON had therefore never been reached . However , in connection with the takeover of the activities of the NORP company ( which it approved of in principle ) and the urgent need for funds , the ORG had been prepared to enable PERSON to act in anticipation of the extension of the credit facilities by providing letters of credit on a number of occasions . PERSON had been asked to stand surety for these himself to the amount of NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . By DATE the sum for which the ORG had bound itself amounted to NLG CARDINAL . The ORG pointed out that there was a difference between a letter of credit and a credit under a current account agreement ; the former implied only occasional and short - term risk , whereas the latter involved more permanent , long - term risk .", "( b ) The ORG acknowledged also the second request for an extension of the credit facilities for the takeover of the companies NORP and NORP In this connection , PERSON had indicated that others would stand surety for at least NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Relying on that statement , the ORG had written to PERSON on DATE that it agreed in principle to an extension of the credit facilities to NLG CARDINAL , subject however to certain conditions regarding DATE statements and securities . No DATE statements had been forthcoming , nor any securities either , and so the ORG had written to PERSON on DATE withdrawing the offer .", "The ORG acknowledged the transfer of NLG CARDINAL but denied having been aware of the purpose for which that sum was intended . It claimed that PERSON had misled it in this regard . This also applied to the withdrawal of LAW . The ORG had referred to this deception in its letter of DATE and stated that in consequence it would annul the credit agreement ( which it had nevertheless continued to honour ) if PERSON were to take up his position as manager of PERSON again ( see sub - paragraph ( c ) below ) .", "The ORG claimed that it had required the mortgages as surety for the letters of credit referred to in sub - paragraph ( a ) above and the withdrawal of the above - mentioned sums of NLG CARDINAL . The mortgages had been established under a power of attorney drawn up by a notary who - as the document itself showed - had read it aloud before PERSON signed it . The ORG denied that there had been a blank power of attorney . ( c ) The ORG denied categorically that it had frozen PERSON \u2019s accounts on CARDINAL DATE . In any case , withdrawals from these accounts had by then exceeded the agreed maximum of NLG CARDINAL , the balance being NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL in debit . It had , however , made it clear that it no longer had confidence in PERSON after the above - mentioned deception had come to light . The ORG \u2019s doubts concerning his suitability to continue managing PERSON were later confirmed when PERSON was suspended as managing director with effect from DATE and shortly afterwards committed to a mental institution under a court order . During the period from CARDINAL DATE until DATE the ORG continued its dealings with ORG under different management , consisting of Mr GPE and PERSON It continued to allow credit to finance the activities taken over from the O. company . After PERSON \u2019s return the ORG had allowed PERSON every opportunity to reduce its debt ; when it became clear that PERSON was not prepared to do so , it had annulled the credit agreement with effect from DATE . Only then had it frozen the accounts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to a court order which it had obtained for that purpose , Dombo seized certain moneys which it still owed to the ORG and summoned the ORG before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) , claiming financial compensation for the damage caused by the ORG \u2019s alleged failure to honour its commitments .", "CARDINAL . After extensive argument in writing - in which each party presented written pleadings CARDINAL times and produced a considerable number of documents and PERSON offered to produce witnesses ( in particular the managing directors , Mr GPE and PERSON , who had temporarily replaced PERSON , to prove that there had been negotiations at that time to raise the credit limit from NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL to NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) - ORG delivered an interlocutory judgment on DATE allowing PERSON to call witnesses to prove , firstly , that the ORG had frozen PERSON \u2019s accounts on CARDINAL DATE and , secondly , that the existing credit arrangements had been extended by NLG CARDINAL in DATE . In addition , it ordered the appearance in person ( comparitie ) before CARDINAL of its judges of representatives of PERSON and the ORG able to give information and empowered to agree to a friendly settlement .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed against this interlocutory judgment to ORG ( gerechtshof ) , arguing that PERSON \u2019s claim should have been dismissed out of hand . According to ORG had abandoned the original basis of its claim , and the basis which it had in the meanwhile adopted for it obviously could not support it . Besides , PERSON had no interest in the claim and ORG requirement of evidence was in any case too vague and CARDINAL - sided .", "After both parties had submitted a written statement and produced new documents and , through their lawyers , pleaded their cases orally ( PERSON repeating its offer to provide evidence ) , ORG , in a judgment of DATE , refused to accept the ORG \u2019s arguments and confirmed the judgment of ORG .", "At the request of both parties , ORG did not refer the case back to ORG but proceeded to deal with the case itself . Accordingly , it ordered the hearing of witnesses to go ahead on CARDINAL DATE before CARDINAL of its own judges , PERSON , but reserved the decision on the date of the personal appearance of the parties\u2019 representatives until the witnesses had been heard .", "CARDINAL . PERSON called a number of witnesses , including PERSON . Producing the minutes of a ORG meeting dated DATE , it claimed that PERSON had been dismissed as managing director for reason of \" lack of funds \" . It further produced a document from which it appeared that PERSON had been registered as an unemployed person seeking employment on DATE and an extract from the commercial register from which it appeared that another person had been appointed managing director of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG objected to PERSON Reijendam being heard . It based this objection on the rule that a party to the proceedings could not himself be heard as a witness ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . It claimed that Mr PERSON \u2019s dismissal did not reflect the true state of affairs but had been effected only to enable him to testify .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE Judge PERSON upheld this objection and refused to hear PERSON . He had become convinced that both PERSON dismissal as managing director of PERSON and the appointment in his place of another person were shams ( schijnhandelingen ) which served no other purpose than to enable PERSON to testify in the instant proceedings . He pointed out that PERSON had been present at the oral pleadings before ORG on DATE and had not protested when PERSON \u2019s lawyer referred to him as PERSON \u2019s managing director . He added that in his view the motives alleged for the dismissal were implausible .", "The other CARDINAL witnesses produced by PERSON were heard on CARDINAL and DATE . CARDINAL of them , Mr GPE , was heard on both dates . This witness had been PERSON \u2019s financial affairs manager from DATE until DATE and had since retained links with PERSON as an external adviser . During DATE and DATE he had \" been very closely involved \" with the running of PERSON and this had led to his appointment as statutory managing director after the suspension of PERSON on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL , sub - paragraph ( c ) , above ) . On DATE Mr PERSON stated , inter alia , that he had been present at several meetings of the parties between DATE and DATE and that , although he could not recall the exact words used , he had heard Mr PERSON say something like , \" Then for the time being we will take a credit of NLG CARDINAL as a starting - point \" . When examined for the second time at PERSON \u2019s request , he corrected his statement to the extent that besides the original credit facility of NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL a new facility had been agreed to the amount of NLG CARDINAL in connection with takeovers ( mainly of the activities of the O. company , a small part being intended for the takeover of the T. company ) . There had been several discussions , in which this witness had taken part , about the amount to which the credit was to be extended .", "CARDINAL . In the exercise of its right to have its own witnesses heard in reply ( contra - enqu\u00eate ) , the ORG called CARDINAL of its employees , CARDINAL of whom was the manager of its ORG branch office , Mr van W.", "PERSON objected to the hearing of PERSON , stating the view that at all stages of the credit relationship , and also in the instant proceedings , he had been and remained the formal representative of the ORG ; to hear him as a witness at this point , when PERSON had not been so heard , would upset the fair balance that should exist between parties in civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a decision delivered orally on DATE Judge PERSON dismissed PERSON \u2019s objection . He considered first and foremost that Mr PERSON was a competent witness in the instant case since he was not a party to the proceedings either formally or in fact and went on to state that it could not follow from the fact that PERSON was put at a disadvantage because PERSON was not heard as a witness while Mr PERSON was so heard that Mr PERSON was no longer a competent witness .", "ORG judge proceeded to hear the ORG \u2019s witnesses immediately .", "After the witnesses had been examined , both parties submitted extensive written pleadings in which they analysed the ORG statements . PERSON submitted a large number of additional documents , including written statements by persons not heard as witnesses ; the ORG also submitted further documents . PERSON then submitted pleadings in response to those of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its final judgment on DATE . It first examined the ORG statements in detail . As far as the statements of the witness Mr C.U. were concerned ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it observed that these contradicted each other on a significant point , namely the figure to which it had been agreed to extend the credit facility , and added that this discrepancy , for which no explanation had been given , adversely affected the convincingness of the statements of this witness . ORG then examined a number of written depositions submitted by PERSON . CARDINAL of these were rejected because they were not signed . With regard to a deposition signed by PERSON , the ORG attributed the same value to it as to a statement made by ORG itself .", "ORG went on to hold :", "\" ORG is of the opinion that the evidence required from PERSON has not been provided . The statements of the witnesses [ NORP , PERSON are not definite enough for this purpose and the statement of [ GPE ] and the notarial statement made by [ S. ] - whose experience , as considered , dates only from after CARDINAL May CARDINAL - are contradicted by those of the witnesses [ PERSON and PERSON ] . The fact that no written evidence is available of such an important agreement as that referred to by PERSON , as would normally be expected , compels ORG to take a strict view of the evidence , and this should also be taken into account . It was established during the proceedings that DATE and DATE the [ ORG ] in effect consented to extend the credit facilities to ORG in various forms in larger amounts than PERSON was entitled to by virtue of any written agreement , but this does not necessarily mean that PERSON was entitled to the credit facilities for that reason alone , in the sense that the [ ORG ] would not be justified in applying a kind of temporary embargo on the facilities for reasons of its own . Although the ease with which the [ ORG ] allowed [ Dombo ] to exceed considerably the credit limit officially in force provides food for thought , it can be explained by the negotiations between the parties , which came to light during the proceedings , concerning the establishment of a substantially higher credit limit , in which - as was also common ground between the parties - the sum of NLG CARDINAL was mentioned . It is clear from the statement of the witness [ Van W. ] - and PERSON did not contest this again after the examination of that witness - that at DATE the then managing director of PERSON , by misleading the witness , twice succeeded in drawing considerable sums over and above what was already to be regarded as officially a substantial overdraft on ORG \u2019s consolidated accounts . This amount could reasonably provide the [ ORG ] with grounds for temporarily \u2018 shutting off the flow of credit\u2019 to PERSON . \"", "ORG further held that since the agreement had not been proved , it was not necessary to examine the question whether the ORG had in fact frozen PERSON \u2019s accounts in breach of it and it went on to dismiss PERSON \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON filed an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) to ORG ( PERSON ) . Paragraph CARDINAL of its ( quite extensive ) statement of grounds of appeal ( middel van cassatie ) was particularly directed against Judge PERSON decisions to uphold the objections to hearing PERSON as a witness for PERSON and reject those against hearing PERSON as a witness for the ORG . This paragraph argued , inter alia :", "\" Furthermore , the decisions of ORG , ( also ) if considered in relation to one another , are incorrect in view of DATE ( article CARDINAL ) of LAW ] , which guarantees everyone a fair hearing of his case in the determination of his civil rights and obligations . After all , this provision implies ( inter alia ) that the parties should be able to fight each other with equal means ( \u2018 equality of arms\u2019 ) and that every party to civil proceedings should have the opportunity to present his case to the court in circumstances which do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis - \u00e0 - vis the opposing party . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG ( advocaat - generaal ) , in her advisory opinion ( conclusie ) of DATE , formulated the opinion that PERSON was right to argue that \" according to current legal opinion \" a person who \" could be identified with a party \" should be allowed to testify . In support of this view she referred to the new law of evidence in civil procedure , which had by then been accepted by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As an additional argument in favour of this proposition she pointed to Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , on which PERSON could in her view properly rely . In this connection she argued , inter alia :", "\" In the present case the point was that [ Mr van W. ] was able to present his view of what was ( or was not , as the case may be ) agreed or discussed between himself and PERSON in DATE to the court extensively ( his statement comprises CARDINAL pages in the official record and CARDINAL pages in the judgment of ORG ) , while PERSON was not allowed to give his version of the events himself . Yet the success of PERSON \u2019s action depended on that . \" She went on to advise allowing PERSON \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . It rejected PERSON \u2019s arguments based on \" current legal opinion \" , considering that the law of evidence in force was based on the exclusion of parties as witnesses in their own case so that it was not possible to anticipate the entry into force of the new law , which had an entirely different structure . It likewise rejected the complaint based on LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW ; this was based , according to ORG , on the argument that ORG had violated the principle that \" the procedural rights of both parties should be equivalent \" . This line of argument , in the opinion of ORG , \" ... fails to recognise that in assessing the convincingness of the content of ORG statements , the judge with competence to determine questions of fact is free to consider the nature and degree of involvement of a witness with a party in proceedings and that he must also judge a witness \u2019s statement in the light of what the opposing party has put forward in its written pleadings or when appearing before the court in person \" .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the entry into force of the new rules of evidence in civil cases on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) evidence in civil procedure was governed by LAW ( Burgerlijk Wetboek - CC ) and LAW ) , both of which dated from DATE and were largely based on the corresponding NORP codes . The former law , which applied at the time of the proceedings in issue , did not lay down in so many words that a person was not allowed to testify in a case to which he was a party . It was nevertheless generally accepted that , in the words of ORG , \" one of the principles of the GPE law of civil procedure is that a person who is formally or substantively a party to litigation can not be heard as a witness in his own case \" ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , GPE ( PERSON , GPE Law Reports ) DATE , CARDINAL ) . This view was based on , inter alia , Article DATE para . ORG , according to which relatives by blood or by marriage in a direct line , spouses and former spouses of parties to proceedings were disqualified from being witnesses . The rule that an actual party was not allowed to give evidence himself was repeatedly confirmed and strictly applied by ORG , as reflected by , inter alia , its judgments of CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL , and the judgments referred to below in paragraph CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . However , it did not follow that it was impossible for the courts to hear parties in person . The courts had the following possibilities at their disposal :", "( a ) The \" decisive oath \" and the \" supplementary oath \" involved hearing a party to proceedings on oath .", "( i ) CARDINAL party might call upon the other to confirm on oath the truth of a certain disputed fact . If the other party took the oath , then proof to the contrary was no longer admissible ; if he refused , then the contrary statement was accepted as the truth . This was the \" decisive oath \" ( beslissende eed ) ( Articles DATE - CARDINAL CC ) .", "( ii ) The court also had the possibility of ordering , of its own motion or at the request of a party , that CARDINAL or other of the parties should take the \" supplementary oath \" ( aanvullende eed ) . It could impose such an oath on the party which was , in its view , the most appropriate for the purpose , provided that the statements to which the oath was to relate were neither proved nor entirely unsubstantiated ( Articles DATE and DATE CC ) . It was in particular the supplementary oath on which parties not infrequently relied when there was a possibility that their evidence would be insufficient ; they would ask the court for permission to supplement their evidence in this way if the court were to hold it to be insufficient on its own .", "( b ) The courts also had CARDINAL possible ways of hearing parties which did not involve putting them on oath :", "( i ) By means of an \" examination on points in issue \" ( verhoor op vraagpunten ) of CARDINAL party at the request of the other ( ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL ORG ) . The party requesting such an examination had to file his questions beforehand ; however , the court was entitled to ask additional questions occasioned by the examination , as was the party who had requested it .", "( ii ) By ordering , of its own motion or at the request of either party , the personal appearance of the parties for the purpose of obtaining information ( comparitie tot het geven van inlichtingen ) ( Article CARDINAL ORG ) . In principle , such an order was for the appearance of both parties .", "( iii ) In the event of oral pleadings ( pleidooien ) . LAW ORG allowed parties to present their cases themselves , but this was very rare ; however , parties were frequently present at the oral pleadings and the court could make use of the opportunity to question them ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ORG ) . It was commonly assumed that statements made in these CARDINAL instances did not constitute evidence in support of the position of the party that made them .", "CARDINAL . If a party to proceedings was a legal person , then the rule disqualifying a party as a witness applied to any natural person who was to be identified with the legal person concerned .", "A natural person was identified with a legal person if he had acted in the proceedings as its representative ( as appears from , inter alia , ORG judgments of DATE , GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , p. CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) , or if he was empowered by law or by its statutes to act as its legal representative ( see , inter alia , ORG judgments of CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , ORG ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Whether or not a person was qualified to be a witness had to be determined in the light of the situation obtaining when he was to make his statement . Under this general rule it was usually assumed that a former director of a legal person , who would have been prevented from giving evidence while he retained his position , qualified as a witness following his dismissal ( see , inter alia , ORG judgment of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) . However , this was not the case if the person concerned had not genuinely lost his position within the legal person and where his dismissal had to be construed as a sham ( schijnhandeling ) ( see , inter alia , ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL , and its judgment in the present case of CARDINAL DATE , published with an annotation in GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The law of evidence in civil proceedings was extensively amended by LAW DATE , Staatsblad ( Official Gazette ) CARDINAL , which entered into force on DATE .", "The PERSON on which the new law is based dates from DATE . CARDINAL of the reasons why it took so long for this PERSON to become law was the controversy surrounding the question whether the above principle - i.e. that parties should not be allowed to testify -should be abandoned or whether , alternatively , it should be accepted that parties might be heard as witnesses . During the parliamentary proceedings this remained the subject of heated debate both in ORG and outside it , but it was eventually decided to abandon the old practice . LAW ORG now allows parties to give evidence as witnesses in their own case . Accordingly , the decisive and supplementary oaths referred to in paragraph CARDINAL , sub - paragraph ( a ) , above have ceased to exist .", "It appears from the drafting history of this legislation that those cases \" in which insufficiency of evidence on the part of CARDINAL party leads to legal inequality \" especially led to the conclusion that \" the arguments in favour of allowing parties to testify should be given more weight than the fear of bias and problems of assessment , which incidentally are just as likely to occur in the case of other statements by witnesses \" . As an example of such legal inequality it was mentioned \" that a party who is a natural person who is disqualified as a witness may be confronted with ( for instance ) a party who is a legal person , which is in a position to bring forward \u2018 third parties\u2019 , although the credibility of these witnesses is just as doubtful in view of their close connections with that party or the proceedings . ... [ I]t is difficult to see why one individual should be allowed to make a statement under oath in court about matters in which he had a part while the other person involved should not . This even applies regardless of any insufficiency of evidence in the sense that no other evidence is available \" ( ORG , Parliamentary Drafting History of LAW , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL )", "It should be observed that differences continue to exist between a witness who is a party to the proceedings in question and a witness who is not . For present purposes , it is sufficient to note that pursuant to LAW CARDINAL ORG the statement of a witness who is party to the proceedings \" concerning the facts to be proved by him can not provide evidence to his advantage , unless the statement supplements incomplete evidence \" ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
