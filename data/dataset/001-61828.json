In GPE , ORG judgment was considered a landmark ruling on LOC claims , encompassing a detailed historical and legal analysis of that issue . Referring to the historical background of the case , ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c The first issue to be dealt with concerns the empowerment of the [ communist authorities that concluded the NORP Agreements ] to enter into international agreements . There is no doubt that ORG can not be considered a constitutional entity of a sovereign ORG , with corresponding democratic legitimacy and capable of taking sovereign decisions in the name of the ORG .", "The scope of compensation set out for repatriated persons in the NORP Agreements was in no way equivalent or proportionate to the scope of compensation that the GPE with which these Agreements were concluded took upon themselves as an obligation . In most cases the repatriation was de facto in one direction , as most evacuees were former NORP citizens from the territories lost by GPE as a result of the Second World War . As a consequence , despite a considerably greater material burden of resettlement and repatriation , GPE , by virtue of the CARDINAL Pact , was obliged to pay the GPE the substantial sum of MONEY ( LAW ) . As in the case of the change in GPE 's borders , this type of obligation can certainly not be treated as a sovereign decision by the NORP State authorities .", "It should be mentioned at this point that similar burdens in connection with the consequences of the war were also borne by other GPE , but in no case , with the exception of GPE , was the weight of the burden comparable to the CARDINAL ORG had to bear . It is worth recalling that meeting these obligations was further complicated by the considerable material losses suffered during the war and immediately afterwards . Under these conditions , it was evident that the process of affording satisfaction to the repatriated persons , as set forth in the agreements with the GPE and GPE concerned , had to be moderate and spread over time . This also means that it is necessary to take into consideration the difficult financial situation of the ORG and , above all , the situation of groups of citizens other than LOC repatriates . Undoubtedly , the consequences of the war were felt by NORP society as a whole . In this connection , it can not be argued that , for example , compensation that is incomplete , subject to time - limits or taking a specific form is automatically in contradiction with the principle of justice . This view also applies to mechanisms providing only partial compensation for losses suffered as a result of acts of war and territorial changes . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment , which contained extensive reasons , was based on the following main grounds :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The NORP Agreements gave rise to a specific type of State obligation to award compensation , through appropriate domestic law , to persons who had lost property in connection with the delimitation of GPE 's borders after the Second World War . ORG did not constitute a direct basis for repatriates to lodge compensation claims , as the legislature was left free to determine how the compensation machinery would be set up . The ORG 's responsibilities in this regard , as undertaken in successive legal regulations , are matters left for an independent decision by the legislature .", "( CARDINAL ) The right to credit , which provides for the possibility of offsetting the value of property lost by NORP citizens after being abandoned outside the present territory of the ORG against the sale price of immovable property or against fees for the right of perpetual use , constitutes a specific surrogate for the lost property rights , which is not solely a legal expectation of compensation but rather a property right recognised in the LOC 's legal order as part of its public law . As such , this right enjoys the constitutionally guaranteed protection of property rights ( LAW and QUANTITY of the LAW ) .", "( CARDINAL ) The creation of legal frameworks for given institutions can not be entirely abstracted from the factual circumstances and the economic realities in which the legal institutions thus established are to function . As a matter of principle , therefore , the legislature may not narrow down the possibility of benefiting from a general right granted to an individual so severely that the ultimate result is essentially a nudum ius , so that the property becomes an immaterial right devoid of any pecuniary value in practice . In the case of the so - called right to credit , its nominal value does not , however , correspond to its actual value . The depreciation of the value of this right has occurred as a result of the legislature excluding specific categories of immovable property , which has fundamentally limited the possibility of enjoying this right .", "( CARDINAL ) All property rights within the legal order are subject to constitutional protection . An interference with the sphere of an entity 's legally protected property interests , when it occurs without the formal removal of the entity 's legal title , amounts to de facto expropriation , within the meaning adopted in the case - law of ORG . Consequently , the assessment of provisions that eliminate the possibility of benefiting from a right in practice leads to the conclusion that they are incompatible with LAW and QUANTITY of the LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG solutions limiting the possibility of benefiting from the right to credit , within the framework determined by the law , and resulting in those rights being stripped of their substance , can not be considered necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law , and are not functionally related to any of the values set out in LAW [ of LAW ] ( the principle of proportionality ) .", "( CARDINAL ) The requirement of respect for the principle of maintaining citizens ' confidence in the ORG and the law made by it , ensuing from the principle of the rule of law ( LAW ) , entails a prohibition on enacting laws that would create illusory legal institutions . This principle therefore requires that the obstacles which prevent [ persons ] from benefiting from the right to credit be eliminated from the legal system . From the point of view of the confidence principle , in the case of the right to credit it is the means of protecting this right that is subject to assessment , rather than its substance . The lack of opportunity to benefit from this right , within the framework set out by the legislature , shows that an illusory legal institution has been created , and thereby constitutes a violation of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG coined a new term for the entitlement under section CARDINAL of LAW , calling it the \u201c right to credit \u201d ( \u201c prawo zaliczania \u201d ) . That term has already entered legal usage and has frequently been referred to in many subsequent judicial decisions and various legal texts .", "The court considered that even though that right originated in the provisions of the NORP Agreements , section CARDINAL constituted the actual legal basis for it . In that regard , it held that those agreements did not constitute part of the domestic legal order since , even though they had been ratified , they had not been published in ORG and could not be regarded as a source of law within the meaning of LAW .", "ORG defined the right to credit as follows :", "\u201c The right to credit has a special nature as an independent property right . In the opinion of ORG , it constitutes a specific surrogate for property rights rather than a mere expectation of the right to compensation , and for this reason it should be recognised as enjoying the constitutionally guaranteed protection of property rights ( LAW and CARDINAL ) . In the assessment of ORG , it is justified to hold that the right to credit is a special property right of a public - law nature . It is not a proper ownership right , but neither can it be reduced to the category of a potential right in the sense of a maximum formulated expectation [ ekspektatywa maksymalnie ukszta\u0142towana ] . Even though materialisation of the right depends on action by the entitled person , it would not be justified to conclude that this right does not exist until the time of its realisation resulting from winning a bid , in which the entitled person may offset the value of abandoned property against the value of acquired property or against fees for perpetual use . ...", "There can be no doubt that the right to credit belongs to the category of rights subject to protection under LAW No . CARDINAL to ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further examined the case under LAW , laying down the principle of the protection of property rights . It described the ORG 's conduct in the following way :", "\u201c In the opinion of ORG , there is no doubt that , in these circumstances , all laws restricting the repatriates ' access to acquisition by means of bids for certain categories of ORG property have a direct impact on the possibility of realising the right to credit .", "In the present legal circumstances , one can identify a peculiar functional paradox in that a general right laid down in the legislation in force can not be materialised in practice . Consequently the right to credit is becoming more and more of an ' empty obligation ' and is turning into a nudum ius . Maintenance of the present trend , in which various types of ORG land are excluded from the application of the right to credit will mean that there is no hope of this right materialising in the future . This state of affairs is already resulting in an unfavourable and paradoxical situation : entitled persons who have been waiting for DATE to be able to participate in competitive bids and , subsequently , in the course of such bids , being aware of how difficult it is to realise their right to credit , ' push up ' the price of the property to a level considerably exceeding its market value .", "In the present circumstances , in order to assess the possibility of taking advantage of the right to credit , one must take into consideration not only the limitation of the availability of certain types of property , with varying degrees of justification , but also the actual opportunities for enforcement of this right and its economic value .", "The statutes restricting repatriates ' access to ORG property essentially result in de facto expropriation , whereby it is impossible to enjoy the right to credit either at present or in the future , in the sense in which this concept is used in ORG case - law cited above . ...", "The unconstitutionality of the limitations set out in section CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL of LAW , in DATE LAW , and in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , consists precisely in the fact that the general right ( the right to credit ) was formulated in such a way that it could not be materialised in the existing legal environment , so that it has become illusory and a mere sham . Moreover , it is not just a question of temporary impossibility , conditioned by certain factual and legal circumstances , but rather a question of the creation of legal constructions that exclude this possibility ex thesi . In the case at hand , assessment of the possibility of this right materialising is all the more essential in that the legislature , in accepting the principle of the ORG 's obligations towards repatriates on the basis of the international agreements , failed at the same time to establish any alternative compensation mechanism . For DATE , the right to credit has been the only available de lege lata solution allowing for compensation of the material losses suffered by NORP citizens as a result of territorial changes in DATE . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Assessing the situation from the point of view of LAW , namely the admissibility of the restrictions imposed by the authorities on the exercise of the right to credit , ORG observed , inter alia :", "\u201c [ T]he protection of property rights does not mean that it is completely impossible to interfere with their substance , or that they are absolutely inviolable ... What is necessary is to remain within the constitutional framework which sets out the boundaries for constitutional protection of a given property right [ references to the relevant judgments of ORG ] . Such limitations are introduced by LAW in LAW . In ORG case - law it has been indicated on many occasions that this provision provides tests for determining the conditions for the admissibility of limitations on the enjoyment of constitutional rights and freedoms . ...", "In this context , it is important to note ORG position expressed in the judgment of DATE , [ references ] , according to which the scope of such limitations must not cause annihilation of the fundamental components of the general right , resulting in its being ' stripped ' of its real substance and turned it into a legal fiction . Such a situation leads to a constitutionally unacceptable violation of the fundamental substance or the essence of that right . ...", "In the light of the foregoing considerations , it must be recognised that all the provisions referred to in the ORG 's application , which limit the actual scope of property in respect of which the procedure set out in section CARDINAL of LAW DATE can be applied , are incompatible with LAW and CARDINAL read in conjunction with LAW of LAW .", "Such limitations are not justified in a democratic ORG governed by the rule of law . The aims set out in section CARDINAL of LAW , and the grounds provided for limiting the right to credit in the case of property entrusted to ORG , namely the need for funds to modernise the armed forces , must not be pursued in a manner that deprives only a specific group of persons of the possibility of realising property rights vested in them .", "In the case of agricultural property administered by ORG , such exclusion can not be tolerated without the simultaneous establishment of universal solutions that would open up a way to solve property problems relating to the regulation of ownership relations .", "In the case of exclusions provided for in LAW , the aim of generating resources for the modernisation and maintenance of military institutions does not justify discrimination against persons entitled to credit for the value of property abandoned outside the present territory of GPE , purely because those persons may not be able to pay the purchase price in cash . This type of solution can never be recognised as necessary in a democratic ORG governed by the rule of law . Neither is there any functional connection between that limitation and the pursuance of the aims referred to in LAW . The need to introduce limitations could arise if the realisation of the right to credit were to make it impossible to satisfy the legally protected interests of other persons . In particular , the existence of the right to credit does not lead to a situation in which the rights of other persons might be violated ( for example , the rights of former owners who have been given priority or persons with a right of pre - emption ) .", "At the same time , it should be stressed that the unconstitutionality of these provisions is not connected with a legislative omission consisting of the lack of certain regulations regarding compensation for LOC repatriates . Rather , it arises from the defective legal formulation of the provisions governing the question of compensation , which causes an inadmissible systemic dysfunction . It must be stressed that in creating a general property right , the ORG may not at the same time arbitrarily introduce , by taking advantage of the attributes of ORG power , such limitations which , by excluding substantial stocks of property from the compensation procedure , de facto paralyse the possibility for beneficiaries to derive any economic advantage from these rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG referred to the principle of the rule of law , set out in LAW . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c This principle means , first and foremost , the need to protect and respect properly acquired rights and to protect interests that have not yet been vested ... but it also encompasses a prohibition against the legislature creating legal constructions that can not be implemented and constitute an illusion of law , and hence a pretence of protecting those property interests that are functionally connected with the substance of the established general right .", "As a matter of principle , the legislature may therefore not narrow the possibility of realising a general right formally vested in an individual to such an extent as to effectively create a nudum ius , that is , . a property right that consequently becomes devoid of substance and has no pecuniary value in practice . For it must be stressed yet again that in the case of the so - called ' right to credit , ' its nominal value does not correspond to its real value . This depreciation occurs precisely because the possibility of realising this right has been limited to a significant extent through legislation excluding certain categories of property . ...", "The imperative of adherence to the principle of maintaining confidence in the ORG , which encompasses , as indicated above , a prohibition against creating law that introduces fictional legal institutions , requires the elimination of legal obstacles that make it impossible to enjoy the right to credit . ORG can not assess to what extent a properly functioning right to credit could repair the damage caused by the loss of ' property beyond LOC . The resolution of this problem , which is part of the general issue of redress for the losses sustained by particular groups of the population as a result of the country 's historical territorial changes and changes in ownership introduced DATE , lies within the competence of the legislature . ...", "Essentially , then , the important point here is the implementation of the postulate that legal regulations should be formulated in such a way as to secure to the individual not only legal certainty , but also complete foreseeability as to the extent to which their implementation will affect the individual 's legal position in particular legal situations . The compensation mechanism introduced for persons who were deprived of their property as a result of territorial changes resulted in the development of legitimate expectations , on the part of those concerned , that this problem would be definitively resolved in the future , with due consideration for the interests of all persons in whom this right to credit was vested . The opinion that there has been a violation of the principle of maintaining confidence in the ORG and the law made by it , is further strengthened by the lack of alternative forms of compensation in the legal system . ...", "Elimination from the legal system of the limitations introduced by sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , and by the other individual provisions , would make it possible for the remainder of the credit mechanism to become a real , and not , as hitherto , fictional instrument of compensation . ORG has not assessed the advisability of selection by the legislature of specific means of satisfying the repatriates ' property interests , since the determination of concrete institutional solutions is within the legislature 's independent sphere of competence . Therefore , it is the compensation machinery already set out in legislation that has been subjected to assessment from the point of view of constitutional guarantees .", "It should be pointed out in passing that , in addition to the compensation procedure directly established by section CARDINAL of LAW , the legislature recently introduced a new possibility for the realisation of the right to credit in LAW DATE on amendments to the PERSON on the exercise of ORG powers , the PERSON on commercialisation and privatisation of ORG enterprises and other statutes , which enters into force on DATE , and which adds a third subsection to section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE on the commercialisation and privatisation of ORG enterprises . On the basis of this provision , the persons referred to in section CARDINAL of LAW have been given the possibility of crediting the value of abandoned property against the sale price of a privatised enterprise , corresponding to the value of rights to certain items of immovable property included among the assets of the enterprise , or against the sale price of such rights not included among the assets .

Also , there were situations where ORG organised auctions from which , under the relevant provisions , persons from beyond LOC were excluded .", "Particular attention should , however , be given to situations where auctions did not exclude persons from beyond LOC . These occurred extremely rarely . In such situations a large group of persons who had entitlements to compensation would participate . These people , concerned that , owing to the small stock of property set aside to satisfy their claims , they would not be able to obtain any satisfaction , would increase their bids for the property in such a way that the price of the property for sale was several times higher than its market value . It was symptomatic that only persons from beyond LOC took part in these auctions , although the organisers also permitted the participation of persons who were able to buy the property in cash . In CARDINAL of the auctions a property whose reserve price , assessed in line with market valuations , was MONEY , was sold for MONEY . In another auction a plot with a building that had been used as a dissecting room , and which had a reserve price of MONEY , was sold for MONEY . In the context of the above situation , it suffices to say that , within the area of activity of ORG of ORG of ORG , that is , within the territory of the former GPE and part of ORG , only about CARDINAL entitled persons out of a total of some CARDINAL having certificates or administrative decisions took advantage of their right to credit and , of these , nobody obtained full compensation for their entitlement . It should be added that , within the area of activity of LOC of ORG of ORG , CARDINAL persons tried to obtain certificates confirming their right to receive an equivalent to the abandoned property . \u201d", "The court further found that the plaintiffs , or their predecessors , had earlier refused to accept CARDINAL offers of compensatory property .

The second offer had been to choose CARDINAL of CARDINAL tenement houses in another town , but those houses had been in a catastrophic state .", "CARDINAL . ORG shared ORG opinion that ORG did not constitute part of the domestic legal order . Consequently , they could not form a legal basis for raising a civil claim for damages before the court . It found , however , that the conduct of the ORG had amounted to a series of tortious acts and held , inter alia , that :", "\u201c As has been proved in detail in this case , a paradoxical situation arose , where entitled persons waited for DATE to participate in an auction , and then , if an auction actually took place , knowing how difficult it was to use their entitlement to credit and pressured by the situation they found themselves in , they bid up the price of the property to levels far exceeding its market value . In this way , finding themselves in a highly pressured situation , they lost a large part of their entitlement . The severe limitations placed on the possibility of satisfying their entitlements in effect brought about its elimination . This situation , where the ORG has created the circumstances described above , is in effect a totally unjustified expropriation [ and amounts to ] taking from persons from beyond the LOC property rights to which they are entitled . Even the creation of such a situation should be considered a state of lawlessness with regard to the rights of repatriated persons .", "It should be emphasised most strongly that the legislature not only has the positive obligation to create regulations and procedures that protect property rights , but there is also a negative obligation to refrain from introducing regulations that might remove legal protection from such rights , or that might restrict them , not to mention [ measures ] eliminating them entirely . If the legislature does not fulfil the above conditions , it is in breach of LAW and enacts lawlessness . ...", "In the opinion of this ORG , the statutory restrictions resulting from the legislation described above \u2013 although the statutes may have been necessary DATE and relating to local government reform , agricultural restructuring , the modernisation of the army and other issues , do not justify discrimination against persons who have the right to credit the value of property abandoned outside the borders of the country , just because these people can not pay the price of this property or [ the fee for ] the right [ of perpetual use ] in cash . ...", "The statutory restrictions affecting the property rights acquired by persons from beyond LOC create a situation where they are deprived of the property value that was set by the legislature .", "This is in effect a tortious act committed by the ORG , as a result of which , for reasons attributable to the ORG , the plaintiffs sustained damage in that they were unable to realise their rights to obtain property at the value confirmed in the relevant administrative decision . While the legislature , in LAW of the DATE Act and in section CARDINAL of LAW , gave persons from beyond LOC the right to credit the value of property abandoned abroad against the price of building plots or the price of buildings or LOC situated on land belonging to ORG , the subsequent acts rendered ineffective any possibility of this social group satisfying that entitlement .", "In essence , the damage sustained by repatriated persons , and also by the plaintiff in the context of the present case , consists of the difference between what they should have been able to have within the value of their entitlement , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , and what they actually have in practice , as a result of the wrongful manner in which the ORG has implemented the law . ...", "In accordance with LAW , everyone has the right to obtain compensation for unlawful acts carried out by a public authority . The liability of ORG follows from LAW , linked as it is with the functioning of a public authority as a whole , rather than with specific persons connected to that institution , bearing in mind that responsibility arises if there is an unlawful act . Furthermore , the functioning of the public authorities should be taken , in a wider sense , as an act or omission , as specific actions , or as orders , judgments , administrative decisions , quasi - normative statutes and , finally , legislative activity . ...", "The fact that it was impossible for the [ plaintiffs ] to satisfy the entitlements they had obtained without a reduction in the greater part of their value , gives them the right to claim , on the basis of liability for a tort , compensation equal to the amounts stated in the relevant certificate .", "It is completely understandable that the plaintiffs , after obtaining the certificates that confirmed their entitlements as laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW , did not participate in auctions organised by the [ authorities ] , since the number of auctions of which they could have been aware was very small . However , in the context of the number of repatriated persons who were entitled to take part in auctions , any possible participation in an auction could result in their losing a significant proportion of their entitlement .", "Even though ORG judgment of DATE took immediate effect after its publication in ORG , namely , on DATE a judgment that ... lifted the restrictions placed on repatriated persons in regard to the realisation of their entitlements \u2013 in practice , ORG and ORG , taking the view that the above - mentioned judgment of ORG required the provisions of LAW and other statutes to be updated , have created a situation where it continues to be impossible for repatriated persons to realise the entitlements that they have obtained .", "This fact , as described in the establishment of the facts of this case , is a matter of common knowledge from newspaper reports . Thus , the government , incorrectly interpreting the consequences of ORG judgment , continues to block the rights of repatriated persons , thereby committing a tort to the extent and with the consequences described earlier by this ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the defendants filed appeals against that judgment with ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) .", "The appeals were heard on DATE . ORG upheld the findings of fact made by the lower court but altered the ruling on the merits . It accordingly amended the first - instance judgment and dismissed the claim .", "In its reasons , ORG stressed that the enforcement of the right to credit depended , to a large extent , on the activity of the entitled person . It therefore constituted only a contingent right . Moreover , no pecuniary compensation was provided in section CARDINAL , which laid down another specific procedure for the discharge of the ORG 's obligation . The plaintiffs could have obtained compensation only if they had proved that it had been impossible for them to obtain any compensatory property within the entire territory of GPE . In that context , the court stressed that the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted all means available under domestic legislation . They had not participated in auctions and had refused to buy the compensatory property offered to them by the authorities . Only through their active participation in the auctions could the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they had difficulty in satisfying their claim . ORG also held that there was no basis for attributing tortious liability to the ORG , in particular liability for the alleged legislative inactivity . It rejected the idea that the legislature , by enacting erroneous legislation or by failing to guarantee properly the LOC people 's rights , had unlawfully expropriated the plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the plaintiffs lodged a cassation appeal ( kasacja ) against the above judgment with ORG . The cassation proceedings are pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , composed differently , having heard an action brought by CARDINAL individuals , GPE . and PERSON . , against ORG ( Governor of GPE ) , allowed the plaintiffs ' claim for damages arising from the ORG 's failure to discharge its obligation under section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the provisions of ORG could not constitute a basis for a civil claim since they had not been duly published in ORG . It further considered , however , that not only the ORG 's failure to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to credit but also its failure to discharge its legal duty to publish ORG a failure that had prevented the plaintiffs from relying on them as a legal basis \u2013 amounted to torts for which ORG was liable . It held , inter alia :", "\u201c [ As to the facts ]", "Unfortunately , it has to be said that , although the period since ORG judgment was given has not been very long , the agencies that hold ORG property have currently suspended the organisation of auctions for this property , on the ground that there are no new legislative provisions to replace those repealed . However , it is worth noting that ORG judgment ... concerned , as mentioned above , ' the elimination of restrictions from the system ' ; hence there are no grounds for adopting the position expressed in the communiqu\u00e9s made available to the public on the Internet . As a result , this possibility [ of satisfying claims ] remains illusory for LOC people .", "[ As to the law ]", "In the light of this ORG 's findings of fact , there is no doubt that , while the Agreement of DATE with the NORP SSR was ratified , nevertheless it certainly has not been published since then in ORG ( which is also true of the agreement with the NORP SSR ) . In the light of the constitutional provisions cited above , it therefore can not constitute a source of law , since it did not come within the domestic legal order . Consequently , this agreement can not be applied directly or relied on as a basis for the plaintiffs ' claims . A similar opinion was expressed by ORG in its judgment of DATE , which has already been mentioned in connection with the findings of fact made in the present case . ...", "The plaintiffs applied for publication of LAW of DATE with the NORP SSR , but the Minister for ORG refused to take action along those lines , as he was required to do under the law on international agreements , responding that the agreement was terminated as a result of its having been executed . The basis expressed for this opinion was that , in the opinion of the Minister , the agreement had been executed inter partes , and therefore terminated , given the conclusion of the CARDINAL Pact with the government of the GPE . ...", "This opinion is erroneous for CARDINAL reasons .", "To begin with , in formal terms LAW does not provide for the possibility of terminating an agreement as a result of its execution , but rather for termination as a result of the renunciation of the agreement . ...", "Even if CARDINAL were to accept the possibility that agreements could be terminated as a result of their execution , this is not an argument that is relevant where agreements have not yet been fully executed . ...", "Apart from the above , which is , in a sense , of marginal relevance , it can be added that acceptance that ORG had been terminated with effect from DATE would have strange consequences , for it should be remembered that in this case the result would occur ... precisely from that date . But then one must ask the question why , for example , ORG in its case - law , quoted so extensively in the present case , has bothered over DATE with the issue of agreements which were no longer in force ? For instance , in the well - known resolution of CARDINAL ORG judges of CARDINAL DATE ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ... ) , ORG ruled not only on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE , which set out the right to credit , but also on the NORP Agreements of DATE , and considered the substance of LAW . ...", "It can be seen from the above arguments that the executive authority , despite an application from the plaintiff to this effect , did not proceed with the publication of the Agreement with the NORP SSR ( at least ) , despite the existence of a statutory obligation to publish ratified agreements immediately . ... To put it in precise terms , the public authority refrained from acting , despite a statutorily formulated duty to do so , and hence it acted in breach of the law ( objective unlawfulness ) . Hence the first of the conditions of liability required by LAW , read in conjunction with LAW , is fulfilled . ...", "In its findings of fact , this ORG found that the plaintiffs could not satisfy their claims under LAW , since ORG , as represented by the mayor , had not made it possible for the right to credit to be enjoyed , given that it had not offered any immovable property for auction , and that this situation had lasted for DATE . In these circumstances , as rightly pointed out by ORG , this right had become illusory . It was also indicated that the situation had not changed at all since ORG judgment . ...", "As has been mentioned above , if the Agreement with the NORP SSR of DATE were published in ORG , then , in accordance with LAW , this Agreement would be considered under LAW ; there would then be a sort of presumption of its self - executing nature , and this ORG would be obliged to apply it in the present case . ...", "... [ had ] the NORP Agreements been published , then at the present time there would have been no obstacles to pursuing claims on the basis of the LAW 's provisions quoted above ... In the opinion of this ORG , the above remarks indicate that these provisions of the Agreement are self - executing in nature . ...", "This is an assertion of substantial significance . For , although the plaintiffs could invoke this instrument , its absence in the legal order makes that impossible in practice . But this absence is the result of an unlawful omission by the executive power , which neglected to publish the Agreement in ORG .", "Given these circumstances , there is a clear and direct causal link between the unlawful omission by the public authorities and the damage suffered by the plaintiffs . This pecuniary damage consists in the fact that it is impossible for the plaintiffs to satisfy their claims through a civil action based on LAW , given that the result of such a process is prejudged at the present time ( rejection of the claim , or , as in the present proceedings , an indication that such a basis is unfounded ) . It is certain that such proceedings can not have a positive outcome . ...", "It should be stressed that the damage described above would not have occurred if it had been possible for the plaintiffs to enjoy their so - called right to credit , which consists in offsetting the value of abandoned property . Hence the fact of causing damage by making it impossible to conduct proceedings is closely connected with that fact as well .", "In conclusion : the unlawful omission by the public authorities , consisting in not publishing the Agreement in the Journal of Laws despite the application by GPE . and MONEY . , made it impossible , as the plaintiffs could not enjoy their right to credit as a general right within the existing legal order , to obtain effective compensation in the maximum amount possible DATE namely , the value of the plaintiffs ' property abandoned in GPE , which they claimed on the basis of LAW of the Agreement with the NORP SSR . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In particular , there was no issue of inactivity on the part of the Prime Minister since he could not order publication of an international agreement without a prior recommendation from the Minister for ORG . The latter had not , however , recommended the NORP Agreements for publication in ORG .", "In its decision the court made certain important findings of fact and law .

It did not just contain a promise to act , which could not in and of itself constitute a basis for pursuing claims , since it only provided , as shown by the Constitutional Court judgment of DATE , and by the opinion of DATE of ORG to the Minister for ORG in the matter of LOC property , for a special type of responsibility on the part of the State to regulate , in domestic law , the issue of settlement with persons who lost property as a result of the delimitation of the NORP borders .

Considering the nature of the entitlement laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG observed , inter alia :", "\u201c While the nature of that right is disputable , there is nevertheless a prevailing view that it constitutes a particular proprietary right , [ which is ] inheritable and transferable in a specific manner and whose substance consists in the possibility of having a certain pecuniary obligation satisfied through the use of the so - called ' LOC money ' [ pieni\u0105dz zabu\u017ca\u0144ski ] .

[ T]here can be no doubt that the legislative initiatives taken in DATE have affected the value of the right to credit and that this reduction in value can be considered a material loss covered by the notion of damage . In this regard , it is necessary to compare the value of the right to credit in a hypothetical legal situation free from the laws found to have been defective , and the value of this right resulting from the enactment of the [ defective ] laws in question .", "In considerations relating to damage , one must not fail to mention the way in which the legal provisions relating to the LOC people 's rights are applied in practice . The case file contains documents confirming that ORG does not hold any auctions in which they could participate . Neither ORG nor ORG have complied with ORG judgment . Such practices make it impossible , for all practical purposes , [ for the claimants ] to have their right to credit realised . Of course , [ in such matters as ] the existence of damage and its value , the burden of proof lay on the plaintiff . Admittedly , this damage does not amount to deprivation of property rights and its value is not equal to the value of the property abandoned in GPE . ...", "In conclusion , [ the LOC claimants ] may , under LAW , seek pecuniary compensation from ORG for the reduction in the value of the [ right to credit ] resulting from the enactment of legislation restricting their access to auctions ... which either made it impossible for them to enforce their rights or reduced the possibility of enforcing those rights . ...", "That does not mean , however , that it is possible [ for the claimants ] to obtain the full pecuniary value of the property abandoned in the LOC . It would be contrary to ... section CARDINAL of LAW , by virtue of which the legislature \u2013 acting within its legislative autonomy \u2013 laid down specific compensatory machinery . The crucial point is , however , that previous legislative action rendered [ this machinery ] illusory \u2013 as ORG has unequivocally held . This had an impact on the actual value of the [ right to credit ] . Indeed , the value of this right was reduced since the legislature , on the one hand , excluded from the scope of section CARDINAL ... [ certain ] portions of ORG land and , on the other , through the application of this provision in practice ( failing to hold auctions ) , made it unenforceable . [ I]n consequence , the right to credit could not , and still can not , be realised .", "Such actions can not be accepted in a democratic ORG governed by the rule of law and applying the principles of social justice ( LAW ) , or in a ORG in which equal protection is guaranteed in respect of ownership , other property rights and the right of succession ( LAW ) .", "It must be noted that PERCENT of persons entitled to compensatory property have obtained [ full ] compensation , in particular through the realisation of the right to credit .
