NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE in GPE , GPE . His nationality is unknown and he is living in GPE . The applicant , who has been granted legal aid , was represented before the ORG by Mr C.F. Wassenaar , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , whilst the applicant was serving in the NORP military , his spouse Y fell ill . After her death in DATE , their CARDINAL children , ORG , PERSON , ORG , were taken into the care of their paternal grandparents in GPE as the applicant was refused a discharge from the army for the purpose of taking care of his children .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant married PERSON , his current spouse , and in DATE their son GPE was born . Having grown increasingly frustrated with the policies of ORG and his unsuccessful requests for a discharge from the military , the applicant and his wife fled in DATE to GPE where they applied for asylum . In DATE , they were recognised by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) as refugees under LAW . The applicant \u2019s CARDINAL children from his first marriage and GPE remained in GPE with the applicant \u2019s parents .", "CARDINAL . During the stay of the applicant and ORG in GPE , their daughter PERSON was born in DATE . She is suffering from congenital hydrocephalus and a congenital heart condition .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the ORG , the applicant , his spouse and their child PERSON were accepted for resettlement as quota refugees in the GPE . According to information provided by the applicant to the ORG and recorded in the UNHCR Resettlement Registration Form signed by the applicant on DATE , ORG had been born in DATE , PERSON in DATE , ORG in DATE , and ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant , his spouse and PERSON were granted GPE asylum - based residence permits . According to information provided by the applicant to the GPE municipal authorities after their arrival in the GPE , ORG had been born in DATE , PERSON in DATE , ORG , and PERSON in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s spouse filed a request for advice on the issuance of a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) for GPE for the purpose of family reunion in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE , the applicant filed a request for advice on the issuance of a provisional residence visa for his CARDINAL children born out of his first marriage with Y for the purpose of family reunion in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , the CARDINAL children left GPE for GPE as their grandparents were getting too old to care for them . They ended up in the NORP refugee camp in eastern GPE , where they were registered as refugees after a refugee status determination carried out jointly by the ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) of ORG issued a positive recommendation in respect of the request concerning GPE , who until their flight in DATE had been part of the nuclear family unit ( gezin ) of the applicant and ORG , and provided inter alia that it would be demonstrated by official documents \u2013 when submitting the request for a provisional residence permit DATE that ORG had legal custody ( rechtmatig gezag ) over GPE . As he lacked official documents demonstrating his family tie with the applicant and his spouse , GPE was considered to find himself in a situation in which \u2013 through no fault of his own \u2013 he was hampered by a lack of evidence ( bewijsnood ) . He was therefore offered the possibility to demonstrate the relationship by means of a free DNA test for which he had to travel to the GPE mission in GPE . Following a delay caused by logistical problems , he was eventually taken to the GPE mission in GPE \u2013 accompanied by a ORG staff member \u2013 to provide a DNA sample .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the GPE mission reported that the results of the DNA test showed a strong probability verging on certainty that GPE was the applicant \u2019s son . Consequently , he could be admitted to the GPE and a provisional residence visa was issued to him . On DATE , the GPE mission in GPE provided GPE with travel documents allowing him to travel to the GPE and join his parents . He entered the GPE on DATE and was granted a residence permit on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a separate decision also taken on DATE , ORG of ORG issued a negative recommendation in respect of the request for advice concerning the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL children born out of his first marriage . Unlike GPE , there were no grounds to authorise family reunion in the GPE under the rules applicable for reunification of refugee families since the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between the applicant and the CARDINAL children were considered to have ceased to exist as the children had no longer formed a part of the applicant \u2019s nuclear family unit when in DATE the applicant and his wife had left GPE but , since the death of their mother in DATE , had belonged to the nuclear family unit of the applicant \u2019s parents as the applicant was unable to care for them . Accordingly , there were doubts as to the relationship of dependency between the applicant and these CARDINAL children . For this reason , the applicant had been requested to substantiate this relationship of dependency and to submit the birth certificates of these children , which he had not done . Further taking into account the ages of the children , the fact that they were living together in the care of their grandparents , that they were rooted in NORP society and of an age that they should be regarded as able to fend for themselves , it was also found that leaving the CARDINAL children in GPE did not amount to such a harrowing situation that it should be qualified as undue hardship ( onevenredige hardheid ) . It was further found that there were no special facts or circumstances giving rise to a positive obligation under LAW to admit the CARDINAL children to the GPE . At the foot of the decision was a note that , according to settled case - law of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , no appeal lay against a recommendation in respect of a request for advice given by ORG on the issuance of a provisional residence visa .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , when the present application was introduced , neither the applicant nor the CARDINAL children from his first marriage had filed a formal request for the issue of a provisional residence visa for the purpose of family reunion in the GPE either under the rules for family reunion of refugee families or under the rules applicable to regular family reunion .", "CARDINAL . According to a medical statement , drawn up on DATE by a doctor at ORG , GPE had undergone operations in this hospital from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and her present medical condition did not allow her to go to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG inter alia that he had recently rented a house in GPE for his children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that his oldest son ORG had been arrested by the NORP authorities on the territory of GPE and had been taken into detention for failure to comply with his military obligations in GPE and possibly also for having illegally left GPE . The other CARDINAL children were still in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a fresh request for advice on the issuance of a provisional residence visa , submitting inter alia that , pursuant to LAW , the GPE authorities were under a positive obligation to provide the CARDINAL children concerned with a provisional residence permit . By letter of DATE , the applicant was informed by ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) of ORG and ORG ( PERSON ) that his request was not suited for consideration in proceedings on a request for advice because he was asking for several exemptions and investigations which could not be considered in proceedings on a request for advice . The applicant was informed that his CARDINAL children should file a formal request for the issuance of a provisional residence visa in the country of origin or habitual residence . As to his requests for a DNA test and exemption of the minimum income requirement under the applicable immigration rules , he was informed that these belonged to the possibilities but would only be considered in the context of a formal request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that , due to great difficulties in GPE , the CARDINAL children born out of his first marriage had had to leave that country . The youngest CARDINAL , ORG , had returned to GPE where they were living with their paternal grandmother . His oldest son was still in detention in GPE for failure to comply with his military obligations , and the applicant \u2019s daughter PERSON had been kidnapped and was being held by rebel forces in the south of GPE . These rebel forces had asked the applicant for money for her release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that PERSON had managed to travel to LOC . She had joined the applicant in the GPE where she had been granted asylum . The applicant further stated that he was unaware of the whereabouts and fate of his oldest son ORG and that he intended to file an application for a provisional residence visa in due time for his CARDINAL youngest sons ORG who were still living with their grandmother in GPE and who would soon come of age and therefore eligible for military service in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that the application for a provisional residence visa he had filed on DATE as a sponsor ( mvv - referent aanvraag ) on behalf of ORG had been rejected on DATE by the Deputy Minister for Security and ORG because there was a discrepancy between the information provided by the applicant and the ORG about the exact year of birth of ORG , and the applicant had not demonstrated that he had legal custody of them as minor children . The applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision and , on DATE , submitted his written ground of appeal to the Deputy Minister and a hearing was scheduled for DATE . No further information about these proceedings has been submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that his son PERSON had managed to reach the GPE where he had applied for asylum and that he was allowed to await the outcome of this application in the GPE . During his journey , he had been separated from his brother PERSON , who was still in GPE or GPE . The applicant was still in contact with ORG . Their eldest brother PERSON was doing his military service in GPE and therefore could not apply for a provisional residence visa , as GPE does not allow its nationals to leave the country and as there is no GPE embassy in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a ruling handed down on DATE ( case no . CARDINAL ; ORG : NL : RVS:CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , ORG found that ORG response on a request for advice for the issuance of a provisional residence visa is merely a recommendation ( advies ) and not a formal decision ( beslissing ) producing legal effects ( rechtsgevolgen ) within the meaning of LAW ( PERSON ) . Consequently , unlike a formal decision on a formal request for a provisional residence visa , such a response from ORG can not be challenged in administrative appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . A decision on a formal application for a provisional residence visa can be challenged in administrative appeal proceedings by filing an objection ( bezwaar ) with the executive administrative authority that took the decision , a subsequent request for judicial review before ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE and , finally , a further appeal to ORG . In these administrative appeal proceedings , an appellant can challenge the compatibility of the decision concerned with , for instance , LAW .", "CARDINAL . A positive recommendation on a request for advice for the issuance of a provisional residence visa does not automatically entail the issuance of such a visa . In order to obtain it , a petitioner must submit an actual application request for a provisional residence visa at the GPE mission in his or her country of origin or country of habitual residence . Any subsequent appeal proceedings can be brought by the petitioner or by a sponsor ( referent ) on the petitioner \u2019s behalf .", "CARDINAL . The rules governing the possibility to obtain an exemption from the obligation to pay statutory administrative charges ( leges ) in immigration proceedings have been set out in GPE v. the GPE ( GPE v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the GPE immigration rules , the reunification of refugee families is in certain aspects less demanding for applicants than the procedure for regular family reunion in that , in the procedure for the reunification of refugee families , the accepted refugee does not have to comply with any income requirement ( on this point , see PERSON and Others v. the GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) before his or her nuclear family members may be eligible for family reunion and no administrative charges must be paid for an application for reunification of a refugee family . The requirements for documentary evidence from the country of origin are also less strict than in the regular procedure .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , a residence permit for the purpose of the reunification of a refugee family could be issued to the alien who actually belonged DATE whether as a spouse or minor child \u2013 to the de facto nuclear family unit ( feitelijke gezinsband ) at the time of flight of the accepted refugee , who held the same nationality as the accepted refugee , and who had entered the GPE at the same time as the accepted refugee or in respect of whom an application for a provisional residence visa had been filed within DATE on which the status of refugee had been granted to the person with whom family reunion was sought . The same applied in respect of a request for advice for the issuance of a provisional residence visa for the purpose of reunification of refugee families . Since DATE it is no longer possible to request such an advice as , from that date , it is possible for persons holding the status of refugee and living in the GPE to apply themselves , as a sponsor , for a provisional residence visa for relatives for the purpose of refugee family reunification .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , a person eligible for a residence permit for the purpose of joining a spouse / partner in the GPE where the latter had been granted the status of refugee under the rules applicable to the reunification of a refugee family obtained an asylum - derived residence permit ( afgeleide verblijfsvergunning asiel ) , i.e. a residence permit dependent on the refugee status of the person with whom reunion had been allowed . Given the strict distinction between an asylum - related residence permit and a \u201c regular \u201d ( i.e. non - asylum related ) residence permit , arguments based on LAW could not be entertained in proceedings on an application for an asylum - related residence permit , including proceedings on a request for a residence permit for reunification of a refugee family .", "CARDINAL . As from DATE , when the order amending LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( ORG circulaire DATE , \u201c GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u201d ) entered into force , LAW principles are taken into account in assessing \u2013 in proceedings on a request for a residence permit for the reunification of a refugee family \u2013 whether a person belongs to the family of an accepted refugee ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
