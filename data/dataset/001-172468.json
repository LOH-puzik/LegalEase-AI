The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Split .", "CARDINAL . He is the owner of a flat in ORG with a surface area of QUANTITY . According to the applicant , that flat is the only real estate in his ownership and his only property of value .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that in DATE the housing authorities awarded a specially protected tenancy ( stanarsko pravo ) of the flat to a certain Ms ORG and her family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG entered into force . It abolished the legal concept of the specially protected tenancy and provided that the holders of such tenancies in respect of , inter alia , privately owned flats were to become \u201c protected lessees \u201d ( za\u0161ti\u0107eni najmoprimci ) . Under the Act such lessees are subject to a number of protective measures , such as the duty of landlords to contract a lease of indefinite duration , payment of protected rent ( za\u0161ti\u0107ena najamnina ) , the amount of which is set by the Government and significantly lower than the market rent ; and better protection against termination of the lease .", "CARDINAL . The applicant refused to conclude a lease contract with ORG under the protected lease scheme .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , on DATE she brought a civil action against him in ORG ( PERSON ORG ) with a view to obtaining a judgment in lieu of such a contract .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . The Municipal and ORG established that GPE was living in the flat with her son PERSON , her daughter - in - law and her grandson whereas the applicant was living with his mother in a flat located in the same building . His mother also owned an adjacent building where he was running his medical practice in CARDINAL of the flats . The court also found that ORG and her son PERSON indeed owned a small summer home in GPE surfacing QUANTITY only .", "CARDINAL . Against this factual background the Municipal and ORG held that the conditions provided in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG , as interpreted by ORG ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) , had not been met and that the applicant was therefore not entitled to refuse to enter into a lease contract with ORG under the protected lease scheme . In particular , even though the applicant intended to move into the flat and had no other accommodation , he was neither entitled to permanent social assistance or was over DATE of age , nor was ORG \u2019s DATE home in LOC located in the same municipality or township .", "CARDINAL . Those courts also held that , apart from being protected from eviction , ORG was also entitled to protected rent ; the applicant thus having no right to charge her the market rent for living in his flat . That was so because they found that ORG DATE home did not constitute a habitable house within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Lease of Flats Act ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the judgments of the PERSON and ORG , and served its decision on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1", "P1-1-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
