THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis;Nicolas Bratza;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born on DATE and living in GPE . She is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , solicitor , of Messrs. PERSON and GPE , GPE .", "A.", "A chronology of the applicant , from her birth in DATE until she reached her majority in DATE , submitted by the ORG and not contested by the applicant , is attached to the present decision . In DATE , the applicant was convicted of common assault , criminal damage and affray . On CARDINAL DATE , an interim hospital order was made under LAW DATE , and the applicant was transferred to ORG for assessment . Whilst at ORG , Dr. PERSON , a consultant psychiatrist , took the view that the applicant suffered from a psychopathic disorder within the meaning of LAW , but that that condition was not treatable . An assessment from the applicant 's solicitors ' own psychiatrist , Dr. PERSON , did not reveal criteria for psychopathic disorder . The applicant was discharged from PERSON to FAC on DATE .", "On DATE ORG under LAW of LAW DATE , granted an application made by ORG , that the applicant be kept in secure accommodation until DATE . An order under LAW may only be made in respect of a child who is being looked after by a local authority ; the applicant had been subject to a full care order since DATE . The magistrates stated in their reasoning that if she was kept in any other accommodation the applicant was \" likely to injure herself or other persons \" .", "The secure accommodation order was due to expire on DATE . On DATE CARDINAL applications came before Mr Justice Stuart - White in ORG . The applications were an application by the local authority for a further secure accommodation order to last up to the applicant 's eighteenth birthday , and an application by the applicant for revocation of a care order . After considerable discussion about whether the court had jurisdiction to deal with both applications , the judge made a limited secure accommodation order for TIME so that the case could be dealt with DATE by ORG . Directions concerning the future conduct of the care proceedings were given .", "", "On DATE an application for a secure accommodation was made by ORG with the support of the guardian ad litem before ORG . Prior to the hearing a psychiatric hospital had refused to accept the applicant as a patient . PERSON to which the applicant had first been admitted in DATE and where she was detained at the time of the application , provided a report for ORG . This report , dated DATE , stated under the heading \" Future Recommendations \" :", "\" We are unable to recommend that [ the applicant ] remains at PERSON as we can not provide a suitable environment for her . She is the oldest member of a mixed group . We have nothing further to offer in terms of treatment . \"", "Under the heading \" ORG \" the report states , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\" [ The applicant ] does have access to a Studies programme . Since the granting of a further Secure Order in DATE , [ the applicant ] attended Studies regularly until recently when following an altercation with another young person [ she ] was required to remain on her corridor when the other young person was on the unit . [ The applicant ] was able to attend Studies and to be out on the unit in the absence of the other young person who was at work DATE but , for the most part , she has chosen not to attend studies . \"", "ORG also stated :", "\" It is acknowledged that [ the applicant ] has been subject to a great deal of uncertainty concerning her future , the possibility of her being sectioned under LAW if FAC offer her a place and the likely renewal of ORG . It is accepted that these uncertainties have had a direct effect on her behaviour . \"", "This passage of the report echoed the sentiments of the guardian ad litem , who in a report of DATE ( the identity of the guardian ad litem subsequently changed ) stated that she was \" appalled \" by the lack of advance planning or preparation with regard to the future care of the applicant and that some forward planning and identification of a treatment programme was essential . This guardian ad litem proposed a phased plan whereby there would be a final placement in a non secure therapeutic setting prior to the applicant 's eighteenth birthday .", "The application on DATE for a secure accommodation order was opposed by the applicant and her parents . The application was however successful and a further secure accommodation order was made which authorised the applicant 's detention in secure accommodation for DATE until TIME DATE , DATE before the applicant 's eighteenth birthday . In their reasoning the magistrates stated as follows :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) We find that there has been a long history of aggressive behaviour and self harm , which is only controlled whilst under close supervision within a secure environment .", "( CARDINAL ) We find although there have been fewer incidents of self harm recently , we believe that there exists a danger of her injuring herself and others .", "( CARDINAL ) We find it is clear that all avenues open to help [ the applicant ] have been closed for CARDINAL reason or another , leaving ORG with the only option , that being to rehabilitate [ the applicant ] into the community .", "Great emphasis has been put on the fact that if an order is made there will be no time to prepare a rehabilitation place before [ the applicant 's ] eighteenth birthday . This is not our concern ... our duty is to consider if the criteria to make the order under LAW [ of LAW DATE ] are made out . On the evidence we have read and heard we are satisfied that the criteria are made [ out ] and therefore we make an order to TIME on DATE . \"", "The applicant appealed against the order of DATE . The appeal was allowed by ORG on DATE . Mr ORG varied the order so that it expired at TIME on DATE . This new order was accepted by the applicant and her parents .", "DATE previously , on DATE , the applicant had been given liberty to withdraw her application for a discharge of the care order as a care plan had been agreed .", "On her release from secure accommodation the applicant went to live with her parents .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , so far as relevant , provides as follows :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) Subject to the following provision of this section , a child who is being looked after by a local authority may not be placed , and if placed , may not be kept , in accommodation provided for the purpose of restricting liberty ( \" secure accommodation \" ) unless it appears-", "( a ) that-", "( i ) he has a history of absconding and is likely to abscond from any other description of accommodation ; and", "( ii ) if he absconds , he is likely to suffer significant harm ; or", "( b ) that if he is kept in any other description of accommodation he is likely to injure himself or other persons . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
