He was in possession of a false passport in the name of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was questioned by ORG . Criminal proceedings were instituted against PERSON .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE , the GPE investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody . He observed that there was strong evidence of guilt against the applicant , who was in possession of documents showing that he was in contact with persons connected to drug - trafficking . Given the amount of cocaine ( QUANTITY ) imported by those persons and the fact that they were probably part of a major criminal organisation , the investigating judge considered that there was a serious risk of re - offending and a risk of tampering with evidence . Moreover , the applicant had declared that he was a tourist and that he had no links whatsoever to GPE . It was therefore reasonable to believe that he would try to abscond in order to avoid the consequences of the legal proceedings commenced against him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the order before ORG , which dismissed his appeal on DATE . ORG observed that new evidence had emerged against the applicant , who had been recognised as the person who had rented a deposit box in which the cocaine had been found , had helped to move a container into the deposit box and was facing another set of proceedings for drug - trafficking pending in ORG . ORG held that there was a serious risk of his re - offending , as evidenced by the fact that the applicant was part of a powerful criminal organisation . Moreover , if he were released , the applicant might try to get in touch with the other members of the organisation in order to tell them about the investigations with a view to tampering with the evidence .

After confirming the observations made in the orders of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , he noted that further investigation had revealed that the applicant had played an active role in renting the deposit box where the cocaine had been found and in sending the container in which it was concealed and had kept in contact with the other defendants who had been caught by the police in the act of removing the cocaine from the container . The investigating judge considered moreover that there was a risk of his re - offending and absconding after having committed the offence . He noted in that respect that another set of criminal proceedings had been instituted against the applicant in ORG , and that the accused had tried to abscond , producing false identification papers .", "CARDINAL .
