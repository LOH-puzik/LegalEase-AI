NORP In DATE PERSON asked the national authorities to restore his property rights to a plot of land in LOC , that had originally belonged to his deceased wife \u2019s father . He gave only his own name in his restitution request , failing to mention the fact that after his spouse \u2019s death he had married again in DATE , to ORG , or that there were any other successors to whom the property rights could be restored .", "CARDINAL . M.G. died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG property rights were restored in respect of QUANTITY of land in GPE .

ORG asked ORG to establish as a legal fact that she was the owner of ORG property for the purposes of inheritance . The claim was signed by the applicant . During the proceedings before ORG , where the applicant was present , ORG children contested ORG \u2019s right to inherit the property , including the plot of land . They argued that the land did not belong to MONEY , but to his deceased wife \u2019s father .

It annulled the property restitution order of CARDINAL DATE and the parts of the will and purchase agreement concerning the land . As regards the time - limit , the court held that the prosecutor had started court proceedings on DATE . However , he had not received a letter about an act that was allegedly contrary to the public interest until CARDINAL DATE , when he had also had to ask for additional documents from the authorities , which he had only received on DATE . The court held that the timelimit had not been missed by much and decided that it was not an obstacle to examining the case on the merits . The court decided to apply the rules on restitution and to return the land to the ORG . The court held that ORG had not had any property rights to restore because the land in question had belonged to his deceased wife \u2019s father , while PERSON , a widower at the time , had remarried in DATE , to ORG That meant he had not fallen within the scope of persons to whom property rights could be restored in accordance with domestic law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE below ) .

It held that the applicant and his wife had acted in bad faith and that the guarantees for owners who had acquired property in good faith were not applicable . The applicant and his wife argued that the prosecutor had missed the time - limit of DATE to lodge a complaint , but the court held that the prosecutor had only become aware of an act that was contrary to the public interest on DATE and had started court proceedings on DATE .
