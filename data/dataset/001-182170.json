NORP The applicant association appealed against this decision and asked ORG to hold a public hearing .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held in private on DATE , the court allowed the applicant association \u2019s appeal and quashed the lower court \u2019s decision as it had not specified which registered religious entity used the name \u201c GPE \u201d or which statutory provision forbade the use of identical doctrinal sources by multiple religious communities and groups . Furthermore , there was no statutory provision under which an application for registration could be refused owing to lack of proof of ownership of the headquarters of a religious community .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the registration court again refused to register the applicant association as its intended name contained the term \u201c GPE , which had already been used by another religious entity , namely the \u201c Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia \u201d registered in the court register on DATE . The court stated that \u201c the existing LAW [ did ] not allow for the registration of a new religious entity under a name that [ had ] already been recorded in the register for another registered religious entity \u201d . Furthermore , its doctrinal sources were no different from the doctrinal sources of ORG , which had existed for DATE and which had been registered in the court register on DATE . As to the doctrinal sources as described by the applicant association , the court stated as follows :", "\u201c ... [ they consist of ] the NORP religion and the teaching of the Holy Koran , which is supplemented and interpreted by the knowledge and practices of prophet PERSON and PERSON , PERSON ( the prophet \u2019s family ) and ORG of PERSON ... it is about the sources of the NORP religion , for which there is already a registered religious community ... whose teaching includes the LAW and the practices of PERSON . According to NORP teaching , PERSON was his son - in - law and a member of the family ( or ehlibeyt ) , the fourth elected caliph who ruled the NORP state , and PERSON was the founder of ORG and one of the prominent NORP philosophers . In other words , the doctrinal sources of [ the applicant association ] are not at all different from the doctrinal sources of the ... ORG ...", "In the court \u2019s opinion , the doctrinal sources are to be regarded as official insignia of a church , religious community or group within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . It would be a violation of [ that provision ] if they did not differ i.e. did not have specific characteristics , elements that were different from the doctrinal sources of the teachings of an already registered [ religious entity ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In such circumstances , the court held that the \u201c substantive conditions \u201d for registration of the applicant association in the court register had not been fulfilled . Accordingly , it refused its application for registration under section QUANTITY of the DATE Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association challenged the grounds on which the registration court had based the refusal of registration . It argued that there was no other religious entity registered under the same name . In this connection , it submitted that there were CARDINAL registered religious entities that contained the term \u201c NORP \u201d in their name and CARDINAL registered entities that used the term \u201c NORP \u201d . The intention of the DATE Act was not to ban the use of terms that had a generic and not exclusive meaning . Otherwise , it would mean that the law would only allow the registration of CARDINAL religious entity containing the term NORP , NORP , GPE , NORP , GPE , NORP , ORG . It also argued that it had sought registration as a religious community , as opposed to \u201c FAC , which was registered as a religious group . Its intended name was substantially different from the name of that entity ; it had existed for DATE , as was evident from the directory and correspondence with various ORG institutions . As regards the doctrinal sources , it argued that they could not be regarded as official insignia within the meaning of section CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act . Doctrinal sources could be identical for multiple religious entities ( as the Bible was common for NORP and NORP , and the Koran was common for ORG , ORG and NORP or NORP ) . They were of an ideological nature and were not constant , nor could they be interpreted in that way . Official insignia concerned symbols ( crosses , crescents , graphic symbols ) , a flag or a totem that represented something . In this connection , it stated that the interpretation which the court had given regarding its doctrinal sources , namely that they were identical to the doctrinal sources of all NORP teaching , was wrong . The mere fact that the court had interpreted its doctrinal sources implied that the ORG was not separated from religion . Furthermore , if that interpretation had been based on some material , it had not been communicated to the applicant association . Nor had it been given the opportunity to present its views at a public hearing . In this connection , it requested that ORG hold a public hearing . Lastly , it complained that the refusal of registration was discriminatory .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held in private on CARDINAL DATE , the court dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court \u2019s decision . It held that although the intended name of the applicant association was not entirely identical to the name of the \u201c ORG Macedonia \u201d , it contained the term \u201c FAC , which was \u201c decisive and represented a synonym for the religious entity \u201d . Consequently , the registration of the applicant association could create confusion among the believers . ORG made no mention as to the lower court \u2019s findings regarding the doctrinal sources of the applicant association . It accordingly held that section CARDINAL of the DATE Act had been correctly applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association and the second applicant ( and CARDINAL other individuals ) lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG complaining that they had been discriminated against contrary to LAW . They summarised the factual background described above and reiterated the arguments raised in the appeal against the court \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They complained that the use of the term \u201c GPE could not be exclusive ( like the use of \u201c NORP \u201d and \u201c NORP \u201d ) . Furthermore , the registration of the \u201c Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia \u201d implied that the domestic authorities had implicitly accepted that the doctrinal sources of that religious group were allegedly identical to the teaching of ORG . They requested that ORG hold a public hearing ( \u0458\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 ) in accordance with section CARDINAL of the Rules of Procedure of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on DATE in the absence of the parties , ORG dismissed the constitutional appeal . The relevant parts of its decision ( U.br.CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) read as follows :", "\u201c ... in the present case , the court considers that it should examine whether the refusal to register ORG violated freedom of religion and whether there are elements of discrimination on religious grounds .", "As regards the first part of the question and having regard to section CARDINAL of the Legal Status of Churches , Religious Communities and Religious Groups Act , it appears that registration in ORG is a requirement for a religious entity to obtain legal status , but it is not a precondition for religious ceremonies , rituals and prayers , which believers ... can hold irrespective of whether they are organised as a registered religious legal entity .", "In the present case , having regard to the arguments put forward in the application and the established facts , it appears that the applicants , who define themselves as members of ORG , have freely practised their religion for DATE . They participate in public life , communicate with ORG bodies , and participate in religious gatherings and conferences . This leads to the conclusion that , although they are not formally registered under the [ CARDINAL Act ] , they can practise their religion freely and hold religious ceremonies in accordance with the NORP religion , without any pressure or persecution . Consequently , the applicants\u2019 freedom of religion has not been violated .", "In order to reply whether there are elements of discrimination in the dismissal of the application for registration of ORG , ORG assesses whether the courts which decided in the registration proceedings ... gave sufficient reasons and whether the refusal to register ORG was based on relevant and reasonable grounds , namely whether the refusal of registration pursued a legitimate aim and whether there was a measure of proportionality between the means used and the aim pursued ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court then referred to the grounds on which the registration court had based its decision and stated as follows :", "\u201c ... the [ registration ] court refused to register the [ applicant association ] on CARDINAL grounds : ( CARDINAL ) the intended name of the [ applicant association ] contained the term \u2018 PERSON which had been incorporated into the name of an already registered religious entity , the \u2018 Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia\u2019 ... and ( CARDINAL ) its doctrinal sources were the same as the doctrinal sources of an already registered religious entity , ORG .", "The refusal to register the [ applicant association ] was based on grounds specified by law ... which , in the court \u2019s view , was correctly applied . The [ dismissal decision was based on ] section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of [ the DATE Act ] ...", "ORG endorses the findings of the first - instance court that the name and the doctrinal sources are official insignia of a religious entity and distinctive elements through which it is identified and recognised by the public ...", "This particularly concerns smaller religious entities , namely [ those ] that ... manifest their distinctiveness through these CARDINAL elements . Hence , equating the complainant [ the applicant association ] with another already registered religious entity can mislead the public , that is , it can confuse believers , which is at the same time itself a violation of their religious beliefs . It is not in dispute that the right of a religious entity to be registered should be secured in the context of freedom of religion , but nor should it violate the religious rights and feelings of the members of already registered religious entities .", "... Each religious entity , church , religious community or group has the right to be distinct and be recognised in public by its identity . The absence of such [ distinctiveness ] or competition leads to confusion and misunderstanding by the public.[Such is the case ] if there are multiple similar entities which are in competition , indefinite parallelism and division .", "The aim of the statutory requirement for the name and official insignia of religious entities , including doctrinal sources , not to be identical ( \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0458\u0430 ) ... is to prevent confusion among believers , incorrect perceptions , and lawful indefinite division of same - faith believers in several religious communities or entities . In the court \u2019s view , these aims are legitimate and necessary in order to protect the freedoms and rights of others , to secure religious tolerance and prevent religious conflicts , as part of ensuring public safety , which is the responsibility of the ORG .", "In view of the foregoing , ORG considers that the refusal to register ORG did not violate [ the applicants\u2019 ] freedom of religion of the applicants , nor were they discriminated against on the basis of their religion . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
