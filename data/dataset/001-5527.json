In TIME DATE , the applicant went the police and stated that he had killed PERSON It appeared that , when making this statement , the applicant had an alcohol level of QUANTITY in his blood .", "On DATE , the police arrested the co - suspect PERSON , whose statement of DATE to the police confirmed the applicant 's account . The police further took samples of and secured material found under the CARDINAL suspects ' finger nails . The police further seized and secured the suspects ' coats and outer layer of their clothes . In the course of his pre - trial detention , the applicant withdrew his earlier statement that he had killed Mr M. By summons of DATE , the applicant was summoned to appear before ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) on charges of murder .", "By letter of DATE , the applicant 's lawyer , referring to previous telephone messages , requested the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) dealing with the case to provide him with further information in relation to the samples taken by the technical criminal investigation department ( technische recherche ) as well as the secured clothes of the applicant and GPE", "In the course of a hearing held on DATE before ORG , the defence stated that there were CARDINAL persons in the victim 's home , namely GPE , PERSON and the applicant and that their statements were not consistent .

ORG further took evidence from the applicant .", "After having deliberated , ORG decided to refer the case back to the investigating judge in order to take evidence from the CARDINAL witnesses proposed by the defence . On CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , statements were taken from the witnesses and the applicant by the investigating judge .", "On DATE , the applicant 's lawyer was told by the public prosecutor that it was unclear what had happened with the material taken from the suspects ' finger nails and of their clothes and that , therefore , no forensic reports on these materials would be submitted to the court .", "On DATE , a further hearing took place before ORG . As the court 's composition had changed , it fully recommenced its examination .

On the basis of the findings of a psychiatric report on the applicant , ORG accepted that the applicant had to a certain extent a diminished responsibility and took this into account in the determination of its sentence .", "As to the argument submitted by the defence that the prosecution should be declared inadmissible as the clothes and the samples taken from material under the fingernails of the suspects had gone lost thereby rendering a - for the applicant possibly exculpating - forensic examination thereof impossible , ORG held that :", "< Translation >", "\u201c The formal police records mention that , pending a possible further investigation , the secured items at issue have been entrusted to the technical criminal investigation [ department ] of the GPE - Rijnmond Regional Police . It appears from appendices to counsel 's written pleadings that the suspect 's former defence counsel has requested the investigating judge to have these materials examined . A reply to that request is not included in the documents . The written pleadings of the defence counsel in the first instance proceedings only mention that this counsel has been told by the public prosecutor \u201c that no clarity can be obtained what [ has ] happened with this \u201d .", "Assuming that the materials referred to have in fact gone missing , the ORG considers this indeed regrettable , but , noting the other investigation results contained in the case - file , not an omission of such importance that this should result in the sanction of inadmissibility of the prosecution . The objection is therefore rejected . \u201d", "ORG based the applicant 's conviction on his statement of DATE to the police and his statement of DATE to the investigating judge , the statement of CARDINAL DATE by GPE to the police , the formal police records of the finding of the victim 's body , and the report on the autopsy of the victim 's body .", "The applicant 's subsequent appeal in cassation was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . As to the applicant 's complaint of the rejection by ORG of his argument that the prosecution should be declared inadmissible , ORG held at the outset that unlawful activities of criminal investigation officials could under circumstances result in such a serious violation of the principle of a fair trial that this should lead - also in cases where there is sufficient other lawfully obtained evidence - to the inadmissibility of the prosecution . However , such a far reaching sanction could only follow where it would concern serious violations of those principles by , deliberately or with gross negligence , disrespecting the suspect 's interest in his right to a fair hearing of his case . Due to the impossibility of giving a general rule , this question needed to be examined on a case by case basis .", "Turning subsequently to the instant case , ORG held that :", "< Translation >", "\u201c ... ORG has at the outset - correctly - expressed that the circumstance that the secured traces have gone lost violates the principles of fair proceedings . ORG further held that the present case does not concern a case of a serious violation of the principles of fair proceedings as a result of which , deliberately or with gross negligence , the suspect ' interest in his right to a fair trial of his case has been disrespected This finding does not disclose an incorrect conception of the law and is also not incomprehensible taking into consideration :", "a ) that it has not been argued and that the case - file contains nothing from which it could be concluded that the fact the investigation material has gone lost is the result of a deliberate action and", "b ) that ORG has apparently assessed this violation [ of the principles of fair proceedings ] in the light of the harm that this , also taking into account of what the defence has submitted on this point , could reasonably have caused the interests of the defence , in which [ assessment ] ORG with [ the phrase ] \u201c the investigation results contained in the case - file \u201d apparently referred to the facts and circumstances on which it based the conviction ( \u201c voor het bewijs redengevend geachte feiten en omstandigheden \u201d ) as set out in the evidence described under CARDINAL . and the possibly exculpating material contained in the case - file .", "The complaint therefore fails . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
