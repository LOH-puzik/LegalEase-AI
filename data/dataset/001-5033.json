{"ITEMID": "001-5033", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "DONNELLY v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is NORP citizen , born in DATE and resident in FAC , GPE . He is represented before ORG by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "A.", "On DATE , the applicant was arrested for obtaining property by deception in connection with fraudulent claims against ORG ( ORG ) . He was subsequently charged with his wife of CARDINAL counts :", "Count CARDINAL : - Obtaining property by deception - dishonestly obtaining \u00a3 MONEY in unemployment and supplementary benefits and income support payments from the ... \u201c DHSS \u201d DATE by falsely representing that they were unemployed , not in receipt of income and had no capital savings .", "Count CARDINAL : - Obtaining property by deception - dishonestly obtaining \u00a3 CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL in housing benefits from ORG DATE and CARDINALth DATE by falsely representing that they were unemployed , not in receipt of income and had no capital savings and fulfilled the requirements for eligibility for unemployment and supplementary benefits and income support payments .", "After committal for trial in DATE , the first pre - trial hearing was held in FAC on DATE . The applicant and his wife were jointly represented and pleaded not guilty . The applicant received legal aid for representation by solicitor and counsel .", "On DATE , at the second pre - trial hearing , counsel informed the court that he was unable , due to a conflict of interest , to represent both the applicant and his wife and that the applicant would have to instruct fresh lawyers . The judge ordered the defendants to serve their accountant \u2019s report on the prosecution within DATE . A problem with the payment of the accountant \u2019s fees was drawn to the judge \u2019s attention .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel invited the judge at the third pre - trial hearing to express a view as to the necessity for an accountant \u2019s report , with a view to facilitating the request for legal aid for this purpose . The judge declined , expressing the view that the issues in the trial as to whether the applicant had income and if so , was he dishonest in representing to the authorities that he had none , did not require an accountant . The trial was listed to be heard on DATE .", "ORG , on a date unspecified , refused to grant legal aid for an accountant \u2019s report . The applicant has not provided the decision . Correspondence prior to the decision included a warning by ORG that legal aid would be limited to the fees set in the relevant guidelines and that any further amounts would have to be justified on submission of the bill .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s counsel applied to the trial judge for an adjournment for DATE to permit the applicant to apply for a loan to pay for the report , have the report prepared and served on the prosecution . The application was refused , the judge not being satisfied from counsel \u2019s submissions that there was at least an arguable defence that would be supported by such an accountant \u2019s report .", "On DATE , without warning his lawyers , the applicant did not appear in court . He provided a letter which stated that he could not have a fair trial without an accountant and gave his reasons for that belief . After some deliberation , the judge decided to proceed with the trial in his absence . His counsel continued to represent him .", "In summary , the evidence proved that the applicant \u2019s wife had \u201c signed on \u201d DATE on the family \u2019s behalf , representing that she and the applicant were unemployed , had no income , capital or savings or property apart from the family home . The prosecution also presented evidence to show that during the relevant period the applicant was working and did have some income , savings and capital .", "On DATE , the applicant and his wife were convicted . Sentence was adjourned until DATE . On DATE , his wife was present and represented . The applicant still did not attend . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and his wife to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . Joint and several compensation orders were made for repayment of the benefits , plus interest .", "On DATE , a single judge of ORG refused leave to appeal . On DATE , leave was granted by the full court . The applicant argued that the counts against him were duplicitous as they purported to cover a single \u201c obtaining \u201d of property whereas in reality they covered multiple \u201c obtainings \u201d . He also argued that the trial should not have continued in his absence and that he should have been granted an adjournment to obtain an accountant \u2019s report .", "On DATE , the appeal was heard before ORG . It dismissed the appeal against conviction but reduced the applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE .", "In respect of the applicant \u2019s counsel \u2019s arguments that the counts against him were duplicitous , ORG held that it was not duplicitous in form . Any duplicity in substance could have been discovered at or before the trial by requiring particulars from the ORG and if duplicity was shown , a motion to quash the indictment could have been moved . No such step had been taken by counsel and it was not being submitted by counsel at the appeal that trial counsel had been flagrantly incompetent in not doing so . The allegation that defence counsel had erred in failing to taking a particular step was not sufficient . It may indeed have been counsel \u2019s view that this method of proceeding was simpler and to the applicant \u2019s advantage .", "As regarded the refusal of an adjournment and the applicant \u2019s refusal to attend without an accountant , ORG noted that \u201c the trouble was that the fee that ORG was prepared to pay to cover the accountant for legal aid was not nearly as much as the accountant wanted and the < applicant > was reluctant to have any other accountant . \u201d It referred to the views of the judges at the pre - trial hearings that the case did not require an accountant . For the applicant to say that if the court did what he wanted he would come to court but that if it did not he would not was totally unacceptable behaviour . ORG found no irregularity in the judge \u2019s refusal to order legal aid for an accountant of the applicant \u2019s choice . The applicant had been \u201c utterly pigheaded \u201d and refused to instruct any other accountant . It was also not apparent , if he could obtain an accountant from his own resources , why he waited until DATE to request a DATE adjournment for that purpose . Counsel had been unable to point to any steps taken DATE and DATE to obtain an accountant \u2019s report .", "The applicant \u2019s application to appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
