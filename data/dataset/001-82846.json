In addition , the author announces the subject matter of his work in the title itself , \u2018 PERSON on ORG . On the back cover he asks the question \u2018 How can PERSON be fought effectively?\u2019 and in the first few lines of the book he raises another question : \u2018 Is n\u2019t the Chairman of ORG responsible for the murder committed by one of his teenage militants inflamed by his rhetoric?\u2019 The reader thus immediately becomes aware that the fictional trial is a vector for direct criticism of PERSON , especially since the facts described are largely , and obviously , inspired by actual events which have had a great impact on public opinion .", "Accordingly , although it is a novel , and although the offending remarks are only made by fictional characters , it can nevertheless be observed that the work seeks to impart clearly expressed ideas and to communicate a certain image of PERSON Pen , his party and their behaviour . The classification of the charge can not therefore be ruled out purely on the basis of the technique used to that end .", "The text , regardless of its literary genre , is capable of harming the honour and reputation of the civil parties and it is appropriate to examine each of the offending extracts to establish their meaning and significance and to determine whether , for the charge of defamation to be made out , they are precise enough for the issue of proof to be addressed .", "First passage , page CARDINAL : To allege that PERSON is the chief of a gang of DATE in other words , that he heads a group of murderers \u2013 constitutes , in the context of the book , an evidently defamatory allegation of sufficiently precise conduct , reference being made to the racist crime committed by the novel \u2019s protagonist , a young ORG member whose criminal act is said to have been inspired by the ideas advocated by PERSON .", "It is of no consequence that the crime of \u2018 PERSON is not real , because the author \u2019s intention is not to write a satire about an impossible event but , on the contrary , to make the reader believe that , given PERSON ideology , such a scenario is quite plausible and that he would be accountable for it . The story also evokes \u2013 inevitably , for the reader \u2013 the trial in DATE of ORG billstickers accused of killing a NORP youth , PERSON , in GPE . Similarly , when the author , a few passages further on , recounts the killing of a black youth called \u2018 PERSON , who is thrown into the Seine during a demonstration at which ORG is present , the reader is bound to recall the real murder of PERSON , whose killers were taking part in a march held by that party .", "The precision of the facts described in the offending extract is thus sufficient to constitute defamation against the civil parties , and the facts thus alluded to were susceptible of proof .", "Second passage , page CARDINAL : The assertion that \u2018 all his mates from ORG were bragging about their DATE clean - up rounds on the housing estates\u2019 is not clarified by other remarks or illustrated by any given facts . It may stem from the boastfulness attributed to the character in the novel and is too vague to justify prosecution .", "Third passage , page CARDINAL : ORG is accused of using violence against those who leave the party .

The author moreover explains a few lines further on that PERSON ORG can put the idea of a racist murder into simple minds like that of PERSON , who \u2018 would not have had a gun in his hand and a NORP kid at the end of it if PERSON had not made it PERSON ( p. CARDINAL ) .", "Fifth passage , page CARDINAL : This passage , which describes the young ORG militants firstly as being whipped up by their \u2018 master PERSON and secondly as being armed by the CARDINAL and of creating an atmosphere of \u2018 pre - insurrection\u2019 , is certainly insulting to PERSON , but too imprecise to constitute defamation ; the subsequent remarks do not concern the ORG but participants in that party \u2019s demonstrations and can not therefore be taken into account .", "Sixth passage , page CARDINAL : PERSON is accused of being a \u2018 vampire\u2019 who thrives on \u2018 the bitterness of his ORG and \u2018 the blood of his enemies\u2019 , and of being a liar , defaming his opponents to protect himself from the accusations against him .", "The author develops this image and the term \u2018 vampire\u2019 by writing , just after the offending passage : \u2018 ...

He portrayed to his readers PERSON , engaged in his usual activities as Chairman of ORG , with the intention of criticising him and his party and of challenging their ideas . PERSON indeed stated at the hearing that he had made much use of information in the news and , as a result , the reader may not be able to distinguish clearly between fact and fiction , so clear was the intention to associate the situations and remarks with recent events .", "Although , in the sphere of political polemics and ideological debate , the greatest freedom of expression must be afforded to the author , that freedom is not unrestricted , and stops when it comes to personal attacks , whether they are made directly by the author or through the intermediary of fictional characters , and is discredited by the distortion of facts and by immoderate language .", "Whereas the defence has asserted that this story reflects reality and does not twist it , the documents produced , which are mainly press articles , being devoid of evidentiary value , are insufficient to substantiate the defamatory allegations taken into account by the court concerning the criminal conduct imputed to the civil parties . No relevant judicial decision against them , which might have justified such assertions , was produced in the proceedings , and in the absence of documents the court can only find that PERSON distorted the facts to reinforce the hostility of his readers towards PERSON and his party .", "Furthermore , whilst authors and polemicists are afforded freedom to use a specific register , this does not authorise the particularly excessive remarks that appear in the text .", "It can not therefore be accepted that the defendants acted in good faith and the charge of defamation to the detriment of PERSON and ORG is accordingly made out ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants appealed against the above judgment in ORG . They challenged the finding that the offending extracts were defamatory in nature . They argued that it was simply a work of fiction portraying fictional characters , as the reader could see from the very first page . They also argued that the remarks merely amounted to value judgments about the claimants , reflecting a public debate , treated with distance and irony , about how best to combat the rise of the far right . In the alternative , pleading good faith , they submitted that the ideas of PERSON Pen and ORG had not been distorted by the book and its characters , and that the offending passages consisted exclusively of remarks made by the fictional characters without reflecting the ideas of the author , who , for his part , had sought to criticise the strategy adopted by anti - racist associations and left - wing intellectuals in general , in their fight against ORG .", "The applicants relied on LAW , claiming that this provision precluded any conviction because a work of fiction was entitled to reflect debate as to the moral responsibility borne by ORG and its leader \u2019s ideas in the commission of racist crimes . They emphasised that the freedom to hold opinions would be infringed if the author of a value judgment were to be penalised on the pretext that he could not prove the pertinence of his opinion , and referred in this connection to the PERSON v. GPE judgment ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . Lastly , they argued that equally aggressive and defamatory remarks against the civil parties had been made in the past by politicians or journalists , and that Mr Le Pen himself had been convicted several times of incitement to racial hatred .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG ( ORG , consisting of PERSON , President , PERSON and Mr PERSON ) upheld the judgment of DATE as regards the defamatory nature of CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL passages taken into account by ORG , together with the fines imposed and the damages awarded by that court .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG considered , firstly , that the work in question was a \u201c novel \u201d , \u201c a \u2018 creation of the imagination\u2019 as defined by the PERSON dictionary \u201d , whose story line was constructed around the dilemma facing the main character : \u201c The author has developed a plot , based on that framework , running from the beginning of the proceedings against the young defendant until his suicide in prison before counsel \u2019s address and the prosecution speech , and has given expression to many characters who mainly appear as stereotypes characterised by their moral or political position in relation to the civil parties , who themselves are explicitly real people . \u201d It further observed that Mr ORG and ORG , both appearing under their real and current identities , were constantly at the forefront not only of the debate conducted in open court but also of the exchanges between the various characters , \u201c and even at the heart of the intimate contradictions facing the main protagonist \u201d . The court then noted that , on a number of occasions , words had been put into the mouth of Mr Le Pen , who \u201c express[ed ] views that [ were ] close or identical to those [ that he took ] in reality , but which [ had not been ] regarded by the civil parties as impugning his honour and reputation or those of the party of which he [ was ] the leader \u201d . It further considered that the subject of the book was the question set out on the back cover , \u201c How can PERSON be fought effectively ? \u201d , adding that \u201c to ask that question , even in a novel , [ was ] not per se defamatory against him \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court went on to point out that LAW of LAW DATE defined defamation as \u201c any statement or allegation of a fact that impugns the honour or reputation of [ a ] person \u201d and that the law made no distinction based on the nature of the writing in issue . On that basis , any writing , whether political , philosophical , novelistic or even poetical , was governed by the applicable rules in such matters , with regard both to public order and to the protection of individuals . However , the court added that \u201c the application of the rules on defamation in respect of a press article or other text directly expressing the view of its author requires , if the text is a work of fiction , an examination of the question whether the civil parties are actually the individuals concerned by the offending remarks , and then of the meaning attributed by the author to the words of his characters in the light of the ideas that he expounds in reality in his work \u201d . As to the second point \u2013 the first being manifestly established DATE the court found as follows : \u201c ... a distinction has to be made between the offending passages on pages CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL , and , lastly , CARDINAL , the only extracts now to be taken into account : some of them express the view of the narrator and coincide with the author \u2019s ideas as they emerge from the work as a whole , whilst others can be attributed only to the character making the remarks in question , in so far as the author genuinely distances himself from those remarks throughout the work , either through the narrator or by other means . \u201d", "Using that method the court ruled as follows on the CARDINAL passages in question :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

Why does ORG accuse NORP of the alleged murder of PERSON ?

However , that animosity is explicitly related to the aversion felt by the defendants in reaction to the ideas and values presented for public debate by the civil party as Chairman of ORG . That animosity , which is not directed against the civil party in person , can not be regarded as reprehensible per se .", "Since this is a work of fiction , the question of the seriousness of the investigation underpinning the work can not be assessed as if it were a text intended to inform the reader of real facts or comment on such facts .

Is n\u2019t the ORG Chairman a vampire who thrives on the bitterness of his electorate , but sometimes also on their blood , like the blood of his enemies ? Why does ORG accuse the NORP of the alleged murder of PERSON ? Because he is n\u2019t afraid of lies \u2013 because engaging in defamation against his opponents always appears useful for him , of course , but it is also quite simply a means to deflect suspicion ; he \u2019s the one who shouts the loudest in the hope that his ranting will drown out the accusations against himself\u2019 is not defamatory in my view and I am prepared to write this in a novel .", "If these passages are to be considered defamatory in a novel , they are also defamatory in reality .

It was on account of the above article that Mr Le Pen and his party summoned the third applicant to appear before ORG in his capacity as publication director of ORG , alleging that he had committed the offence of public defamation against a private individual ( under sections PERSON ) , CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Freedom of LAW of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the court found the applicant guilty of the criminal offence of defamation and sentenced him to pay a fine of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . It also awarded FRF CARDINAL ( ORG MONEY ) in damages .", "The court , after observing that ORG had reproduced in extenso passages from the work that it had characterised as defamatory in its judgment of DATE , found that \u201c the defamatory nature of the remarks , which ha[d ] already been found to have impugned the honour and reputation of another and ha[d ] been repeated in the offending article , [ was ] ... not in doubt \u201d . As to the question of good faith , the court found that , whilst the newspaper ORG was entitled to comment on a judicial decision and to impart ideas and information on questions that formed the subject of public debate , it was nevertheless true that there was \u201c a distinction between the right of petition and the publicity given to a petition by the use of objectionable terms \u201d . In the court \u2019s view , the publication of the defamatory passages in abstracto , outside their literary context , strengthened the dishonouring force of the allegations , which were shifted to the terrain of reality and plausibility , without any debate of ideas , as the signatories of the article had emphasised in concluding : \u201c If these extracts are to be considered defamatory in a novel , they are also defamatory in reality . \u201d The court added that other newspapers had reported on the debate triggered by the publication of \u201c PERSON Le Pen on Trial \u201d and the petition following the conviction of its author but had not reproduced the offending comments in extenso . It inferred that the third applicant \u201c could ... have reported on the offending petition and informed readers of the views of numerous writers and journalists , without , however , reiterating the offence of which Mr PERSON and his publisher had been convicted by reproducing the passages that had been found to be defamatory in the court \u2019s previous decision \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment . He contended that the impugned article was part of a broader political debate concerning ORG and its Chairman , and that the debate was intense because of events that had actually taken place . It was those events which had provided the inspiration for the novel by the first applicant , whose cause had been defended by the signatories of the petition , reacting in a democratic spirit and out of vigilance towards the far - right movement . The third applicant explained that the column \u201c Rebonds \u201d was specifically reserved for the opinions of commentators from outside the newspaper who expressed their views with the intention of triggering debate and provoking reactions among readers . He added that the column , in principle , was not supposed to be objective or impartial but to convey opinions and therefore entailed the freedom to hold those opinions . He argued that the free discussion of political matters should not be hindered by excessive requirements relating to the protection of the rights of others or the prevention of disorder .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG of ORG ( consisting of PERSON , President , and Judges PERSON and PERSON ) upheld all the provisions of the judgment under appeal .", "The court pointed out that , in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , it had upheld the conviction of the first CARDINAL applicants on account of CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL offending passages in the novel . It reproduced those passages and , as regards the defamatory nature of the article , referred back to the grounds set out in DATE judgment , of which , it stated , the reasoning \u201c remain[ed ] applicable \u201d . It went on to dismiss the defence of good faith on the following grounds :", "\u201c The existence of controversy surrounding Mr ORG and ORG has been patent for DATE , and that controversy has taken on a polemical aspect at certain times .", "As regards the work \u2018 PERSON ORG on Trial\u2019 , the court found in its previous judgment that it was established that its very subject matter was the fight against the political ideas of the civil parties , which in this case had taken the form of a novel .", "Such a medium does not preclude the application of the LAW of DATE where , firstly , the characters portrayed can be identified as real people , and , secondly , the defamatory allegations against them are a reflection not of the narrative process but of the author \u2019s own views .", "On the basis of that analysis , the court considered that this situation obtained in respect of the novel itself . It is all the more true for the impugned article , which is presented as a shift from fiction in CARDINAL ways , being published even though the passages in question had formed the basis of a conviction and by clearly indicating that shift : \u2018 If these passages are to be considered defamatory in a novel , they are also defamatory in reality . We will write against ORG", "The authors of the text in issue had no other aim than that of showing their support for PERSON by repeating with approval , out of defiance , all the passages that had been found defamatory by the court , and without even really calling into question the defamatory nature of the remarks .", "The polemical aim of a text can not absolve it from all regulation of expression , especially when , far from being based merely on an academic debate , its line of argument is built around reference to precise facts . There was therefore an obligation to carry out a meaningful investigation before making particularly serious accusations such as incitement to commit murder , and to avoid offensive expressions such as those describing Mr ORG as the \u2018 chief of a gang of ORG or as a vampire .", "The defence of good faith can not be admitted ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant appealed on points of law , claiming in particular that there had been a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . In respect of DATE he contended that ORG had already ruled on the defamatory nature of the book in question and that it had relied on that earlier judgment , so that the appeal had not been heard by an impartial tribunal but by a \u201c court which openly regarded itself as clearly targeted by the offending article \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

That article incorporated certain passages from a book for which the author had previously been found guilty under LAW of LAW DATE by a bench of ORG consisting of President PERSON and Judges PERSON and PERSON .", "The appellant is not entitled to complain that Judges PERSON and GPE sat on the bench of the appellate court before which he appeared , in so far as the participation in this case of a number of judges of the criminal division of ORG in proceedings concerning charges brought , firstly , against the author of a defamatory text and , secondly , against the publication director who allowed certain passages from that text to be published , is not contrary to the requirement of impartiality enshrined in LAW . In addition , contrary to what has been alleged , there is nothing in the judgment appealed against to suggest that the judges deemed themselves to be targeted by the offending text or that they expressed an opinion contrary to the requirement of impartiality .", "... In finding PERSON guilty ... ORG stated that the polemical aim of a text could not absolve it from all regulation of expression , when , far from being based merely on an academic debate , its line of argument was built around reference to precise facts .
