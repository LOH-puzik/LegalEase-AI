The letter bore the signature of CARDINAL PERSON possibly a fictitious person - , followed by the words \" on behalf of the Anti - clerical ORG ( PERSON ) of ORG ( multi - coloured group ) \" and a post - office box number . It read as follows :", "\" On CARDINAL the trial against Mr [ J. ] will take place before you . We , the Anti - clerical ORG of ORG , protest most strongly about these proceedings .", "In the ORG , the ORG , on the basis of the PERSON concordat and in violation of the ORG \u2019s duty to maintain neutrality , enjoys most extensive privileges . As a result , every non - NORP citizen of this ORG has to suffer disadvantages and DATE annoyance . Among other things , the ORG is the only ORG which acts as ORG - tax collector . It requires employers , whether they be NORP or not , to pay over ORG tax for their NORP employees and thus relieve the ORG of financial administrative work . [ J. ] has , for DATE , courageously and consistently refused to support the financing of the ORG in this way and has made an appropriate arrangement whereby the ORG tax of his NORP employees is paid without his own involvement .", "This attempt - in a ORG which counts the separation of ORG and ORG among its basic principles - to insist upon just such a separation has not only exposed [ J. ] to persistent vexation and interferences on the part of ORG authorities , culminating in the tax office employing coercive measures , such as attachment , to collect from him ORG tax which his employees had already paid a long time previously . It has in addition involved him - when he called these underhand methods by their name - in the present proceedings for alleged insulting behaviour .", "Were it your task as the competent judge to conduct an unbiased examination of this \u2018 case of insulting ORG , then it must be said that you have not only failed to carry out this task , but also abused your office in order to try - by means which give a warning and a reminder of the darkest chapters of NORP legal history - to break the backbone of an unloved opponent of the ORG . It was with extreme indignation that we learned of the compulsory psychiatric examination which was conducted on your instructions , and to which [ J. ] has had to submit in the meantime . We shall use every avenue open to us , in particular our international contacts , to bring to public notice this action of yours , which is incompatible with the principles of a democratic ORG subscribing to the rule of law .", "We shall follow the further course of the proceedings against [ J. ] and expect you to abandon the path of terrorisation which you have embarked upon , and to reach the only decision appropriate in this case - an acquittal . \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant had , as a city councillor , been chairman for DATE of ORG , which is a local political party . He had also played a particularly committed role in , although he had never been a member of , its Anti - clerical ORG , which sought to curtail the influence of the ORG .", "Until DATE certain of the mail for the ORG , which had as its address for correspondence only the post - office box number that had been given in the letter to Judge PERSON , had been delivered to the office ( B\u00fcrogemeinschaft ) of the applicant and a colleague of his ; the latter had also been active on behalf of the party and had acted for it professionally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of the Munich ORG ( Landgericht ) requested the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office ( ORG ) to institute criminal proceedings against PERSON for the offence of insulting behaviour , contrary to LAW . Attempts to serve a summons on him were unsuccessful . The applicant \u2019s colleague refused to give any information about PERSON or his whereabouts and other attempts to identify him failed .", "CARDINAL .

The search of the law office , the need for which the investigating authorities had first tried to obviate by questioning a witness , was effected by representatives of the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office and the police on CARDINAL DATE . According to a police officer \u2019s report drawn up on DATE , the premises were entered at TIME and inspected in the presence of CARDINAL office assistants . The actual search began at TIME , when the applicant \u2019s colleague arrived , and lasted until TIME The applicant himself arrived at TIME He declined to give any information as to the identity of PERSON , on the ground that he might thereby expose himself to the risk of criminal prosecution .", "Those conducting the search examined CARDINAL filing cabinets with data concerning clients , CARDINAL files marked respectively \" BL \" , \" C.W. -Freiburg ORG ... \" and \" G. - Hamburg Regional Court \" and CARDINAL defence files marked respectively \" K.W. - Karlsruhe District Court ... \" , \" Niemietz et al . - ORG ... \" and \" NORP - Freiburg District Court \" .

The Chairman sent copies to the NORP Minister of ORG and ORG and invited the latter to associate itself with the protest .", "In a reply of DATE , the President of ORG stated that the search was proportionate because the letter in question constituted a serious interference with a pending case ; hence no legal action on the protest was necessary .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings against \" PERSON \" were later discontinued for lack of evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL the GPE ORG declared an appeal ( Beschwerde ) lodged by the applicant , pursuant to LAW , against the search warrant to be inadmissible , on the ground that it had already been executed ( \" wegen prozessualer PERSON \" ) . It considered that in the circumstances there was no legal interest in having the warrant declared unlawful . It had not been arbitrary , since there had been concrete indications that specified material would be found . There was no ground for holding that LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been circumvented : the warrant had been based on the fact that mail for ORG had for some time been delivered to the applicant \u2019s office and it could not be assumed that that mail could concern a lawyer - client relationship . In addition , personal honour was not so minor a legal interest as to render the search disproportionate . There could be no question in the present case of preventing a lawyer from freely exercising his profession .", "CARDINAL .
