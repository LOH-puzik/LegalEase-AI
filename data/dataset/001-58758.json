When DATE broke it was n't very light in the security cell . The cell was not lit up ; I did n't see a lamp or a switch or anything . I was hung up by a chain with my arms apart . I ca n't tell you the size of the chain ; there were handcuffs at both ends , but I did n't see how big the links in the chain were .", "Question : How did Mr PERSON manage to hang you up ?", "[ The applicant ] : He 's the one who knows what it 's like inside the cell ; I do n't know . ... PERSON put the handcuffs on both my arms ; he 's the only one who knows how he hung me up .", "Question [ to Mr PERSON ] : How are security cells set out ?", "Mr PERSON : There were CARDINAL security cells in the police station at the time , and they were fully in conformity with the regulations ; there were no hooks or bars inside them . As far as I recall , there were air vents of QUANTITY or QUANTITY , slightly broader than a cigarette . Our handcuffs are a standard design and can not possibly be used to hold a person 's arms apart . I fail to see how we could have hung someone up in the security cell when we had been having trouble restraining him . I can state that when PERSON PERSON took [ the applicant ] into the security cell in TIME , I was not there . The light switch for the security cell is outside the cell ; the light bulb is embedded in the thickness of the wall inside a block of reinforced glass .", "Question [ to Mr Bavarin ] : How do you account for the marks which the doctor observed on [ the applicant 's ] wrists ?", "Mr PERSON : Very often when you put restraints on people , they MONEY on their wrists . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , delivered after the applicant had filed pleadings on DATE and DATE , ORG held , in accordance with ORG submissions of DATE and after reiterating the applicant 's and the police officers ' accounts and the medical findings , that there was no serious evidence against the officers in question .", "CARDINAL . It held :", "\u201c Whether the CARDINAL persons placed under investigation should be committed for trial depends on the answers to the following questions :", "CARDINAL . Did any violence occur ?", "PERSON referred initially to a scuffle ( DATE and DATE ) ; he later referred to blows , without giving any further details ( ' I was hit ' , ' beaten ' DATE ) , and then to unspecified blows but also to being chained up TIME ( DATE ) and all afternoon ( DATE ) ; lastly , besides that form of ill - treatment , he spoke of specific blows on his buttocks , his side , the left - hand side of his head and all over his body ( DATE ) .", "Police officers PERSON and PERSON mentioned a scuffle , while the latter stated that PERSON had been taken back to the police station with both his arms held behind his back . They categorically denied that they had inflicted any blows or used a chain .", "ORG 's statements , the acknowledgment by the QUANTITY police officers that they used force and PERSON medical certificate establish that some violence did occur .", "CARDINAL . NORP What form did the violence take ?", "ORG and the police officers disagreed on this point , but only from CARDINAL DATE . The noticeable escalation in LOC 's successive statements as regards the severity of the violence he suffered does not make his evidence persuasive , unless it can be corroborated by the certificate issued and the statements made by PERSON .", "The only visible lesion observed by the doctor was a bruise on the right shoulder . It might have been the result of a blow , but it could also have been caused by DATE . No signs of any blows were observed in the regions mentioned by PERSON at a later stage . It has therefore not been established that he was ' hit ' or ' beaten ' .", "The pain , scoliosis and marks indicating that both wrists had been bound may , however , be consistent with a fall , a scuffle and being chained up .", "CARDINAL . When did the violence occur ?", "According to the police officers , in DATE , at TIME , when they had to use force to restrain PERSON , who was putting up resistance after running away .", "According to the complainant , in DATE , while he was offering resistance to the police officers \u2013 in any event , before PERSON visit ( statements from DATE ) DATE or before and after the doctor 's visit , including the following night ( later statements ) .", "What weight can be attached to the police officers ' statement ? Their version of the events is coherent , consistent in time and credible as a whole ; their disagreement on CARDINAL specific points does not affect the overall account . There remains the possibility that they concealed their knowledge of events that had occurred after they restrained PERSON .", "What weight can be attached to ORG 's statements ? The statements he gave at different times contain a fundamental contradiction , which naturally diminishes their credibility . When was he telling the truth ?", "According to the complainant , from DATE , since the statements made before that date had been taken by police officers , including CARDINAL of the officers under investigation . The statements had , he argued , been distorted by his fear of the police officers and his comprehension difficulties as no interpreter was present . Those obstacles had disappeared when [ he ] was able to speak to a judge with the assistance of an interpreter . Moreover , his later statements , which referred to violence being inflicted well beyond TIME , were , in his submission , corroborated by CARDINAL circumstances : firstly , no physical anomalies had been noted during PERSON visit , yet a number of lesions had subsequently been observed by PERSON ; secondly , he had denied the offence on DATE , yet a confession had suddenly been obtained the following day . Accordingly , he argued , something had happened between the first and second medical examinations and between the denials and the confessions .", "However , that reasoning is not in any way consistent with the evidence .", "Even leaving aside the initial record drawn up by Mr PERSON , it is clear that in his statements of DATE , which were made with the assistance of an interpreter , PERSON gave exactly the same version of the events . Admittedly , when he was interviewed again DATE by police officers , this time from the GPE force , he retracted those statements , maintaining that he had not wanted to ' annoy ' the police officers , but on DATE ( DATE ) he reiterated his account , stating clearly : ' All the acts of violence which I have reported were carried out before the man [ Dr PERSON ] visited me ... All the blows were inflicted while the officers were restraining me . ' This third record , which was signed by PERSON in front of the officers from the GPE police , against whom there could not have been any suspicion of the acts of violence of which he complained , plainly corresponded finally to the truth in his eyes and can not be erased by his subsequent statements . If any violence had occurred while he was being questioned or ' chained up ' , he would not have failed to mention it on that occasion .", "It should be noted that the allegation of a chain being tied around his neck and attached to the wall of the cell was not made spontaneously by ORG . He did not refer to that incident until his first examination on DATE by the President of ORG of ORG , although it had been mentioned much earlier in documents drawn up by his lawyer ( the pleadings filed with the registry of ORG on DATE , DATE before the hearing in that court 's ORG ) . The allegation is , moreover , wholly incompatible with the standard official design of security cells , and LOC was confused about the matter at the general confrontation on DATE .", "The fact that LOC did not complain of any pain to PERSON but did to Dr GPE DATE does not necessarily mean that any violence occurred in DATE , since , as the CARDINAL doctors interviewed on DATE pointed out , pain is sometimes not felt until DATE .", "Nor were the confessions of DATE necessarily the result of ill - treatment meted out TIME . PERSON was entirely at liberty to retract them shortly afterwards . Yet he did not do so until the hearing on CARDINAL DATE , having in the meantime confirmed them to other police officers and a member of the ORG legal service . There is therefore no proof at all that PERSON was ill - treated after the police officers ' initial efforts to restrain him ; only at that time was he subjected to any violence , the physical effects of which were noted by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Who was responsible for the violence ?", "Certainly not Mr PERSON , who was nonetheless formally accused by PERSON before he withdrew his accusations at the last confrontation . It has been established that that officer was in mainland GPE at the material time . Nor was PERSON responsible , since he was not at the police station at the time of the initial events and only returned later , while PERSON was being questioned . The violence was indisputably perpetrated by Mr PERSON and PERSON , who acknowledge that they used force . However , the complainant has lodged no complaint against the latter officer .", "CARDINAL . Was the violence unlawful ?", "In his first version PERSON acknowledged that he had ' run off ' or left the police station ' in a hurry ' . He admitted to having ' put up some resistance ' , ' gesticulating wildly ' as the police officers sought to restrain him . In his second version he tried to deny that episode , but the observations made above on the respective weight to be attached to LOC 's CARDINAL versions are also valid here .", "The use of force to restrain PERSON while he was offering resistance to the police officers who were arresting him was perfectly legitimate . The violence inflicted on that occasion did not go beyond what is acceptable in such matters : it can be concluded from the medical findings that there was a scuffle and a fall , but that no blows were struck and no weapons were used . The marks that appeared on LOC 's wrists were those commonly left by handcuffs . The answer to the fifth question is therefore ' no ' .", "In conclusion , it appears after a thorough assessment of the case file that there is no serious evidence against the police officers concerned or against any other person . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After the applicant had appealed on points of law on DATE and filed full pleadings on DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment on DATE , holding :", "\u201c ORG , referring to the expert medical opinions and the evidence and statements obtained during the police investigation and the judicial investigation , set out its reasons for holding that there was not sufficient evidence of intentional violence by anybody on the person of [ the applicant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After being held in police custody from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was charged with intentional damage to another person 's property and forceful resistance to a public officer , and the file on Mr PERSON 's complaint was forwarded to the public prosecutor 's office .", "CARDINAL .

At the hearing , according to the court record , there was a dispute between the public prosecutor and the defendant 's lawyers when the public prosecutor refused to exclude a witness . The lawyers went to find the Chairman of the Bar , who demanded an apology from the public prosecutor for stating that he would not be told what to do by lawyers who knew nothing about procedure . When the public prosecutor refused to apologise and asked for it to be noted in the record that the lawyers had advised him to take another look at his copy of LAW and had called him an incompetent bully , all the lawyers present left the courtroom , having had their request for an adjournment refused , and the hearing therefore continued without them .
