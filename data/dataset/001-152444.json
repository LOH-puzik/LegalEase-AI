On DATE ORG rejected GPE \u2019s request .

In the former ORG nearly all flats were under the regime of \u201c social ownership \u201d . They were generally built by socially - owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees , who became \u201c occupancy right holders \u201d . The matter has been regulated by LAW ( Zakon o stambenim odnosima , ORG of GPE nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL ; ORG Herzegovina no . CARDINAL , ORG Herzegovina nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ORG of ORG nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) which is still in force in GPE . An occupancy right , once allocated , entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent , lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee . When occupancy right holders died , their rights were transferred , as a matter of right , to their surviving spouses or registered members of their family households who were also using the flat ( sections DATE CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "Until the entry into force of LAW , occupancy right could also be awarded in respect of privately owned flats . Those flats were also allocated by public bodies . With LAW DATE it was no longer possible to award occupancy right in respect of flats in private ownership . However , the pre - existing occupancy rights in respect of such flats were preserved ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of this Act ) . LAW , on the other hand , authorised owners of such flats to seek eviction of the occupancy right holders under the condition that they provide them with another suitable flat .", "CARDINAL .

The occupancy right holders on socially - owned flats were entitled to purchase their flats under that LAW . If they did not purchase the flats , they became tenants . However , the occupancy right holders on privately owned flats could not purchase their flats ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of this LAW ) . It would appear that their situation continued to be regulated by the relevant provisions of LAW and that they became \u201c protected tenants \u201d ( za\u0161ti\u0107eni stanari ) .", "CARDINAL .
