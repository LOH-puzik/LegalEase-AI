The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By an indictment of DATE , the applicant and his father were charged under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( sexual relations with a minor ) and CARDINAL ( sexual relations with a close relative ) of LAW ( straffeloven ) with having committed sexual offences during the periods from DATE respectively against the applicant \u2019s daughter , PERSON , who was born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , sitting with CARDINAL judges and a jury , noted that the jury had answered the questions on the charges in the negative and therefore acquitted the applicant and his father . No appeal was lodged against the judgment , which consequently gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicant and his father filed a petition with the ORG requesting compensation under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( straffeprosessloven ) for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage caused by the criminal proceedings against them . The father sought , in the alternative , compensation under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In the compensation proceedings , ORG , sitting with the same judges as in the trial , received written pleadings but did not hold an oral hearing . By a decision ( kjennelse ) of DATE , it rejected the applicant \u2019s claim but awarded his father MONEY in compensation under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "In the introduction to its decision , ORG reiterated certain information derived from the criminal proceedings , notably the specific contents of the charges of sexual abuse , the jury \u2019s verdict and the acquittal by ORG .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s claim , ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ORG notes that , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL or CARDINAL ... of LAW , it is a condition for obtaining compensation that it must be shown to be probable that the accused did not carry out the act which formed the basis of the charge . Accordingly , in order to award compensation it must be shown on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not commit the acts in respect of which he has been acquitted .", "The High Court finds it probable that the victim [ L. ] , born on DATE , has been subjected to sexual abuse in the form of sexual intercourse . Reference is made to the medical examination carried out ... on DATE ...", "[ L. \u2019s ] father and mother separated in DATE when the mother moved to GPE together with [ L. ] ... As a witness , the mother made statements about [ L. \u2019s behaviour ] before as well as after the separation . This could indicate that she has been subjected to sexual abuse . The child \u2019s behaviour resulted in the mother contacting the ... institute in DATE where [ L. ] underwent individual and family therapy , as did her mother and her cohabitant .", "As a witness during the trial , PERSON , a psychologist , ... explained [ PERSON \u2019s ] behaviour . In the light of this and of talks and symbolic games with [ L. ] , PERSON concluded that there was no doubt that [ L. ] had been subjected to sexual abuse .", "The question is therefore now whether on the balance of probabilities other persons than the defendants are behind the abuses . In this respect the judicial examinations of [ L. ] are of central importance and the witness evidence as to what [ L. ] has stated is significant . From the outset there had been no concrete information in this case about other offenders . [ L. ] has been subjected to judicial examinations CARDINAL times ... In connection with the first examination the judge recorded that no information had been submitted which could justify a concrete suspicion of sexual abuse having been committed against [ L. ] . During the second examination [ the applicant ] was mentioned in connection with a description of immoral sexual relations and during the third examination even the grandfather was mentioned . During the examinations the information was submitted , without spontaneity , in part under pressure from the examining judge , and in part through writing down names and events on pieces of paper .", "According to the mother \u2019s and her partner \u2019s statements , [ L. ] had referred to both [ the applicant ] and the grandfather . It appeared as if the child had been under pressure to speak in order to enable the family to calm down . PERSON stated that [ L. ] , in the course of a realistic conversation , had referred to \u2018 intrusions , pawing , threats and aggression by [ the applicant]\u2019 and that she had spontaneously confirmed that abuse had taken place several times . She also appeared to have been agitated both during and after these conversations .", "Considering the case as a whole , ORG does not find it shown on the balance of probabilities that [ the applicant ] did not engage in sexual intercourse with his daughter . ...", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] claim for compensation is thus dismissed . In the light of this conclusion , there is no reason to order the reimbursement of his costs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision to ORG ( PERSON ) . On DATE ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) upheld ORG decision , stating , inter alia :", "\u201c ORG has correctly taken as its starting - point the view that under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ... of LAW it is a condition that it must be shown to be probable that the accused did not carry out the act which formed the basis for the charge against him and that this implies that on the balance of probabilities [ sannsynlighetsovervekt ] the accused did not commit the acts in respect of which he was acquitted . In this connection the ORG refers to [ its decision reported in ] PERSON DATE , p. CARDINAL , where the first voting judge stated , with the approval of the other judges , inter alia :", "\u2019Compensation pursuant to LAW , first sentence , must DATE when the accused is acquitted or the case against him is discontinued DATE cover the financial losses he has suffered if \u201c it has been shown to be probable [ gjort sannsynlig ] \u201d that he has not carried out the act which formed the basis for the charges . It is the accused who carries the burden of proof that he did not carry out the act . It is sufficient that it is more probable than not . I do not agree with counsel for the defence in that the accused has discharged the burden of proof where both alternatives , on the basis of the available evidence , appear to be equally likely . In this assessment the ordinary standards of evidence must apply and the requirements in respect of the strength of the evidence must then to some extent be adapted to the ability of the accused to show that he did not carry out the act . Given the manner in which the provision has been formulated , the situation may easily arise that an acquittal is not sufficient to justify a compensation claim where the accused is unable to discharge the burden of proof . I should like to stress that the refusal of a compensation claim does not imply that the previous acquittal is undermined or that the acquittal is open to doubt . The compensation claim must be determined on an independent basis and the rules of evidence applying in such compensation cases do not differ from those which apply to ordinary compensation claims . The legislator has as a starting - point opted for a solution whereby the financial burden caused by the institution of criminal proceedings which are discontinued or which end with an acquittal must be borne by the accused unless he is able to show that it is probable that he did not commit the act.\u2019", "ORG has found it probable that [ the applicant \u2019s ] daughter was subjected to sexual abuse ... Considering the case as a whole , ORG has further concluded that it has not been shown that on the balance of probabilities [ the applicant ] did not engage in sexual intercourse with his daughter . ORG finds no reason to depart from ORG assessment of the evidence , which is based on the judges\u2019 participation at the trial hearing in this case , where it must be deemed vital that the court had the opportunity to hear directly the accused and the witnesses DATE something which ORG is not empowered to do ...", "ORG accordingly finds that the evidence is not such as to fulfil the conditions for compensation under LAW ; nor , as a consequence , are the conditions for awarding damages under Article CARDINAL satisfied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under the NORP jury system , when an accused is acquitted the jury is not entitled to disclose whether any of its members held a different opinion , and no records are kept which could disclose that a negative answer as to the applicant \u2019s guilt was not unanimous . CARDINAL conclusions are possible in a criminal case \u2013 guilt or acquittal ( see Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . There is no third alternative , such as that formerly known in some other NORP countries , where a criminal charge could result in the finding that there was not sufficient evidence to establish guilt .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW provide for compensation where a person has been acquitted or the proceedings have been discontinued . The provisions read as follows :", "\u201c If a person charged is acquitted or the proceedings against him are discontinued , he may claim compensation from the ORG for any damage that he has sustained as a result of the prosecution if it is shown to be probable that he did not carry out the act that formed the basis for the charge . If a sentence of imprisonment or other custodial sanction has already been served , any damage resulting from this shall be compensated without regard to what has been shown to be probable .", "Compensation shall not be awarded where the person charged , by making a confession or otherwise , has wilfully instigated the prosecution or the conviction .", "If he has otherwise contributed to the damage by negligence , the compensation may be reduced or dispensed with entirely . \u201d", "\u201c Even if the conditions prescribed in LAW are not fulfilled , the court may award the person charged compensation for special or disproportionate damage as a consequence of the criminal proceedings whenever this appears to be reasonable in the circumstances . \u201d", "\u201c If the conditions relating to compensation prescribed in ORG CARDINAL or CARDINAL are fulfilled , the court may , when special reasons so indicate , award the person charged a suitable amount as redress for the indignity or other damage of a noneconomic nature that he has suffered as a result of the prosecution . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , there are certain formal conditions set out in Article CARDINAL for the submission and examination of a compensation claim made under ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL :", "\u201c Any claim for compensation or redress must be submitted not DATE after the person charged has been informed of the decision that finally settles the case . The provisions of LAW , first paragraph , shall apply correspondingly .", "If the case has been concluded without any judicial examination of the evidence relating to the issue of guilt , the claim shall be submitted to a court of summary jurisdiction .", "Otherwise the claim shall be submitted to the court that is to conduct or has last conducted any such trial . If the claim is submitted to the district court or the city court , but has not been decided when an appeal against the assessment of evidence in relation to the issue of guilt proceeds to an appeal hearing , the court of appeal shall also decide the question of compensation . When examining the claim , the court shall as far as possible sit with the same judges who decided the criminal case . In the court of appeal , lay judges or the selected jurors who join the court pursuant to LAW ) shall not take part unless the decision is made at the same court sitting as that at which judgment is given in the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Compensation after acquittal or discontinuation of the proceedings is not automatic and is not awarded unless the conditions in the above - cited ORG are met .", "CARDINAL . When compensation is awarded to persons who are considered innocent as they have been acquitted or the proceedings against them have been discontinued , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL are the general provisions and , de facto , the main provisions providing for compensation .", "CARDINAL . In the present case the applicant , unlike his father , did not seek compensation under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Instead , the applicant claimed compensation under the special provision in LAW , together with LAW . Under this provision , the ORG may be liable to pay compensation even in the absence of any proof of negligence or fault on the part of the authorities . The liability of the ORG to pay compensation is strict where it has been shown to be probable that the claimant did not carry out the act with which he or she was charged . In the assessment of that probability , none of the other constitutive elements of a criminal offence , such as criminal intent , is in issue .", "CARDINAL . According to the case - law of ORG , the evidentiary standard applying in respect of liability to pay compensation under LAW differs from that applying to criminal liability . Whereas in criminal proceedings it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the impugned act , in compensation proceedings it is for the claimant to show that , on the balance of probabilities , it was PERCENT probable that he or she did not carry out the act that formed the basis of the charge . The requirement of proof in compensation cases may nevertheless be adjusted ( i.e. to PERCENT ) in the light of the claimant \u2019s ability to adduce evidence , especially where a long time has elapsed since the alleged criminal act . The competent court has to make a new assessment , independently of the acquittal , of all the evidence available in order to establish whether it is probable that the claimant did not carry out the act which formed the basis of the charge .", "CARDINAL . It is not a requirement for obtaining compensation that the claimant should adduce new evidence . The compensation claim may thus be made with reference to the evidence made available in the criminal proceedings or obtained by the court of its own motion .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ) made a recommendation to ORG that ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW be amended in a number of respects , including the abolition of the condition whereby the claimant had to prove that on the balance of probabilities he or she had not carried out the act giving rise to the charge . Nevertheless , the ORG was of the view that the provisions in force were not inconsistent with GPE \u2019s obligations under LAW , as interpreted by ORG in its case - law ( see PERSON GPE ( NORP Official Reports ) , \u201c Erstatning i anledning straffeforf\u00f8lgning \u201d ( \u201c Compensation in connection with criminal proceedings \u201d ) , CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , DATE , DATE ) . On DATE a government bill was presented to ORG ( Ot.prp.nr.CARDINAL , DATE ) , proposing , inter alia , the repeal of that condition ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
