Valticos;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . PERSON is an NORP citizen residing at PERSON . At the relevant time , he was Chairman of ORG ( PERSON , ORG ) for LOC in GPE and councillor ( PERSON ) of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr GPE , Mayor of PERSON in GPE and a member of the ORG , was convicted of negligently causing bodily harm ( fahrl\u00e4ssige GPE ) and of abandoning the victim ( NORP eines ORG ) of a traffic accident whilst under the influence of alcohol ( CARDINAL per mille ) . He was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The question whether the Mayor should resign because of his conviction later became the subject of discussion in political circles and the press in LOC .", "On DATE the NORP newspaper ORG published an article headed \" If ORG does n\u2019t think it over , we will \" . That article quoted from an interview with the Head of ORG , PERSON , who was the Chairman of the LOC branch of ORG ( ORG ) , about the question whether the Mayor should resign or not . Mr PERSON stated that , although an accident of the kind in question could happen to anybody , it was not acceptable that a person who had acted in such a way should remain in public office . He continued : \" I do not intend to take part in a witch hunt , but after a period of reflection Tomaschitz ought to realise that he must resign \" . According to PERSON , however , that was primarily a matter for the ORG . He nevertheless concluded by saying that if Mr Tomaschitz would not think it over , ORG ( ORG ) would .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON issued a press release by way of reply to that article and sent it to several NORP newspapers . On DATE the ORG published a summary , headed \" Looking after morality in the SP\u00d6 \" . A complete version of the release appeared on DATE in FAC ( an ORG newspaper ) , under a headline \" Different standards ? \" ( PERSON ? ) . It read :", "\" Councillor PERSON , Chairman of ORG for LOC , stated in a broadcast that , after being convicted for leaving the scene of an accident without reporting it , PERSON , the Mayor of PERSON and a member of the \u00d6VP , would unquestionably have to resign .", "However , he added that PERSON , the Head of ORG , did not have the slightest moral right to attack Mayor PERSON for his refusal to resign . PERSON had known for DATE that his Deputy , PERSON , had caused an accident on DATE at ORG ( GPE ) while under the influence of alcohol ( i m alkoholisierten GPE ) . The accident had left CARDINAL children fatherless . One could not help feeling that the Head of ORG applied stricter standards to a \u2018 small mayor of a ORG , who was a member of another political party , than to his \u2018 party friend\u2019 and Deputy , PERSON . PERSON concluded that PERSON \u2019s credibility would be enhanced if he were to provide , within the ORG , for the political morals which he requires of others . \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant had based his press release on an article that had appeared in the NORP magazine ORG on DATE . It referred to the circumstances of PERSON car accident in DATE , in which a man had died and other persons had been injured , and contained the following passage :", "\" ...", "PERSON was found to have a blood alcohol content of CARDINAL per mille . That was the limit .", "DATE , on DATE , Fr\u00fchbauer , whose immunity as a Member of ORG had been lifted , was sentenced by ORG to a prison term of DATE , suspended for DATE , for negligent homicide .", "There was no conviction for intoxication ( GPE ) . Jurists are still guessing at the reasons because , according to LAW CARDINAL of the DATE Road Traffic Code , impairment by intoxication is presumed \u2018 at QUANTITY or ORG .", "Be that as it may . I do not want ( and the criminal law does not allow me ) to reproach Fr\u00fchbauer with his conviction at that time . After all , no one is immune from being similarly involved in a traffic accident .", "My accusation is a political one . When PERSON was appointed Transport Minister by PERSON in DATE , he kept quiet about his conviction , or at least about the fact that at that time he still had a criminal record ( noch vorbestraft war ) .", "In fact on DATE , the date of the judgment , the DATE period of suspension of his sentence began to run . DATE before DATE , on DATE , PERSON was appointed Transport Minister but he continued to have a criminal record for a long time afterwards , because of the period which was then applicable with regard to the cancellation of such records . He was thus , to my knowledge , the only Minister of GPE to have a criminal record ... \"", "The applicant had verified the contents of the ORG article in a telephone conversation with its author . Furthermore , he had taken into account the judgment of CARDINAL DATE of ORG ( GPE ) . In determining sentence , that court had regarded as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the accused had been driving after consuming alcohol in an amount that brought him close to the level at which a driver was presumed to be intoxicated ( GPE , QUANTITY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Fr\u00fchbauer requested ORG ( PERSON , \" ORG \" ) to initiate a preliminary investigation against PERSON . After completion of the investigation , PERSON brought a private prosecution under LAW paras . CARDINAL and CARDINAL and LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of defamation ( Article CARDINAL paras . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) and of having reproached a person with an offence for which he had already served his sentence ( LAW ) . The penalty imposed was a fine of MONEY or , in default of payment , CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . ORG also ordered the seizure of the relevant issue of ORG and the publication of its judgment and awarded to PERSON compensation of MONEY , to be paid by the owners of the newspaper . In addition , the latter were declared to be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the fine and the complainant \u2019s costs .", "After reciting the relevant facts , ORG concluded that , contrary to LAW , PERSON had reproached PERSON with a conviction , relating to a traffic accident , that dated back DATE . Furthermore , his statement that the complainant was under the influence of alcohol and his comparison of the accident in question with Mr ORG , in addition to his criticism of the complainant for lacking political morals , amounted to defamation .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , Article CARDINAL was primarily aimed at securing the reintegration of criminal offenders , but it was applicable irrespective of whether or not reproaching them with a previous conviction jeopardised that reintegration .", "PERSON had not been obliged under LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to make the impugned statement . The fact that a political party felt embarrassed about a car accident of CARDINAL of its officials was not an excuse for \" digging out \" a very old accident of an official of the opposite party . Moreover , the applicant had not been under a duty to reply to a political opponent , since Mr PERSON \u2019s criticisms were addressed to Mayor PERSON and not to him . In particular , PERSON , the Chairman of a small district organisation , did not need to react by defaming a third person .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , moreover , it was not open to the applicant to plead that his allegation that PERSON had been driving under the influence of alcohol was correct . The man in the street would conclude from such a statement that the latter - like Mr Tomaschitz - had had a blood alcohol content of CARDINAL per mille at the time of the accident . In fact , a lower level was tolerated by the legislature and the public , and the applicant had not mentioned that the complainant had not been convicted of drunken driving ( in alkoholbeeintr\u00e4chtigtem GPE ) .", "Neither could PERSON maintain that he had intended to refer to a blood alcohol content lower than CARDINAL.CARDINAL per mille . The aim of his press release had been to put both accidents in moral terms on an equal footing , which would entail the same consequence , namely the resignation of the CARDINAL officials concerned . That , together with the title of the article , \" Different standards ? \" , could have led the reader to believe that the complainant \u2019s blood alcohol content had also attained the forbidden level at the time of his accident .", "The defendant also could not claim that his press release had been directed not against PERSON , but against Mr PERSON . It was true that the criticism relating to a lack of political morals had been primarily aimed not at the latter , who was responsible in principle for the political morals of the ORG , but at the former , who had not resigned after his accident . However , that particular allegation could not in itself constitute defamation , since a politician had to be tolerant in this respect ; what was decisive in the present case was the comparison of the CARDINAL accidents from a moral point of view .", "In respect of this defamation too , the applicant could not rely on Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW , because , as he had or should have been aware , the impugned statement had been incorrect . Furthermore , in the present case proof of good faith ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was not relevant , since the offence had taken place through a publication ; neither was proof of proper journalistic care ( section CARDINAL of LAW , Mediengesetz ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , since the defendant was not a journalist . As to proof of truth , ORG considered evidence given by a witness of PERSON accident in DATE , as well as the expert opinions submitted in the relevant criminal proceedings in DATE , and concluded that PERSON had failed to prove the truth of his allegations .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged an appeal ( GPE ) against his conviction with ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) . He submitted in particular that he had written his press release in the context of a political discussion and in reply to criticisms by the Head of ORG expressed in respect of a member of the ORG and of that party , and that the release had not been directed against PERSON . He had , accordingly , felt himself obliged to defend his own party and to inform the public about the Head of ORG political morals and apparent motives . He had then remembered the DATE Profil article ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and found that the CARDINAL accidents raised the same problem , namely whether it was proper for a person with a criminal conviction to exercise official functions . He had thought that this question was worth discussing and wanted to draw the attention of the public to a possible information lacuna . Finally , he had considered his statement about the complainant having driven under the influence of alcohol to be correct , since it was based on the formulation used by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; and it was also justified in the context of a political discussion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL ORG dismissed PERSON appeal .", "The court observed that the applicant \u2019s statement had clearly amounted to a reproach concerning a criminal conviction for which the sentence had already been served , within the meaning of LAW . In its view , he had not been compelled to reply to PERSON . Neither had he been given any mandate to reply in the name of the ORG , nor had he himself been addressed directly as Chairman of ORG or as a member of the party \u2019s executive committee . Someone who by his conduct has given good reason for criticising him must accept attacks on his honour to a greater extent than someone who has not . Furthermore , PERSON himself had made no statement which called for reaction on the part of PERSON .", "The court also upheld ORG judgment in all other respects .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was served on the applicant on DATE . He thereupon requested the Attorney - General ( Generalprokurator ) to file a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes ) , with reference , inter alia , to the right to freedom of expression under LAW ) of the LAW and to the PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL-B ) .", "PERSON was informed on DATE that the Attorney- General did not intend to take any action .", "CARDINAL .
