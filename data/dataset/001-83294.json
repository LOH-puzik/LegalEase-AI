AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art.8 (failure to protect the applicant's reputation);Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses (Convention and domestic proceedings) - partial award", "JUDGES": "Loukis Loucaides", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a freelance journalist who lives in GPE . From DATE to DATE he was the editor of the official magazine of the GPE NORP community .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG of ORG ( ORG ) published an article in its yearbook , written by ORG , a professor of political sciences at ORG . The article was entitled \u201c Internationalism against nationalism : an eternal mortal enmity ? \u201d and alleged that the NORP had declared war on GPE in DATE . Moreover , it trivialised the crimes of the NORP regime .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant published a commentary on this article in the magazine of the GPE NORP community . It was entitled \u201c ORG DATE yearbook with ( neo-)Nazi tones \u201d . He criticised PERSON in harsh terms for using NORP terminology and disseminating ideas which were typical of the \u201c Third Reich \u201d . More specifically , he accused P. of reviving the old NORP lie of a worldwide NORP conspiracy and of confounding the roles of perpetrators and victims .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG brought defamation proceedings under LAW ) against the applicant . ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) acquitted the applicant . Its judgment was upheld on CARDINAL DATE by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , which found that the applicant 's criticism constituted a value judgment which had a sufficient factual basis in the numerous quotations from ORG 's article . Having regard to the publication of ORG 's article in the yearbook of a political party and given the highly sensitive topic , the applicant 's criticism , though harsh , was not excessive .", "CARDINAL . DATE , in DATE , ORG brought proceedings against P. on charges under LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d \u2013 GPE ) . Relying on numerous quotations from PERSON 's article in ORG DATE yearbook , the public prosecutor argued that the article constituted a national - socialist activity within the meaning of section CARDINAL g of LAW . Shortly before the date scheduled for the trial , P. committed suicide .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the DATE PERSON , a right - wing magazine whose chief editor PERSON was the former Chairperson of ORG , published a CARDINAL - and - a - half - page article with the headline \u201c The deadly terror of virtue \u201d ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . It referred to the applicant 's criticism of ORG 's article in DATE and alleged that the applicant 's comment had unleashed a manhunt which had eventually resulted in the death of the victim . It referred to the applicant and a number of other persons , mostly politicians of ORG or ORG and also a number of journalists , a historian and a professor of political sciences , as members of a \u201c hunting society \u201d which used LAW as a tool to attack persons close to ORG and had ultimately chased CARDINAL victim to his death . The article was accompanied by pictures of the members of the alleged \u201c hunting society \u201d , including a picture of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant brought defamation proceedings under LAW ( Mediengesetz ) against the publishing company owning PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the article fulfilled the elements of defamation and ordered the defendant company to pay the applicant compensation under LAW . In addition the defendant was ordered to publish the judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the impugned article accused the applicant of being morally responsible for PERSON 's death . Certain facts were undisputed , namely that the applicant had written a critical commentary on PERSON 's article , that PERSON had been charged under LAW and that he had died before the opening of the trial . However , the allegation that the applicant was part of a \u201c hunting society \u201d , that is , a group of persons persecuting P. and eventually causing his death , amounted to a statement of fact , the truth of which had not been established . In particular , the defendant company had not offered any proof for the causal link between the applicant 's article and P. 's death . Even if the statement were to be treated as a value judgment , it was excessive as it presented a conclusion which went far beyond what could reasonably be based on the underlying facts . Thus , it transgressed the limits of criticism permitted by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set the judgment aside on an appeal by the defendant .", "CARDINAL . It found that the impugned article contained a value judgment which was , however , not excessive . The use of the term \u201c hunting society \u201d did not imply coordinated activities of a group of persons with the aim of destroying P. 's existence . Thus , the article could be understood as implying that the applicant 's and other persons ' activities had eventually caused PERSON 's death but it did not contain an accusation of their having foreseen or planned this outcome . The factual basis was sufficient to attribute some moral responsibility for P. 's death to the applicant and a number of other persons who had been active either by criticising PERSON in the media or by bringing actions against him in the courts . As regards the applicant , the article referred to his critical commentary on P. 's publication , thereby enabling the reader to assess whether or not he shared the opinion expressed in the impugned article . Moreover , the reader was aware that the article was written from a political and ideological point of view and involved a certain degree of exaggeration . In sum , it remained within the limits of permissible criticism set by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE PERSON addressed a CARDINAL - page letter to the subscribers to PERSON asking them for financial support . As a reason for this request readers were told that the DATE PERSON was under massive pressure from anti - fascists who , after having campaigned against PERSON , PERSON and other \u201c undesirables \u201d , had now chosen PERSON as their target . It alleged that the above - mentioned group was trying to damage PERSON by means of disinformation in the media and by instituting a multitude of criminal proceedings and civil actions .", "The relevant passage of this letter reads as follows :", "\u201c Then there is the case of PERSON v. PERSON . The long - standing editor of the NORP religious community 's magazine , PERSON , was identified following Professor PERSON 's [ family name in full ] death as a member of the hunting society that drove the conservative political scientist to his death . It was common knowledge that court proceedings were due to be opened against P. under LAW on account of his statements in ORG DATE yearbook . The NORP journalist PERSON had condemned the statements for their NORP tone and as a result had unleashed the judicial avalanche against P. When PERSON dared to show that this was the cause of the suicide , PERSON lodged a complaint . The extremely complex , time - consuming and costly proceedings , naturally accompanied by a corresponding media campaign in the trendy left - wing rags , are still in progress . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a further set of defamation proceedings under LAW against LAW and under LAW against the publishing company owning PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to adjourn the proceedings pending ORG judgment in the first set of defamation proceedings . Once the latter had given its judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , ORG resumed the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the defendants . It noted that the CARDINAL sets of defamation proceedings related to very similar factual and legal issues . Again , as in the article \u201c The deadly terror of virtue \u201d , the applicant was referred to as a member of a \u201c hunting society \u201d which had driven P. to commit suicide . Thus , it was alleged that there was a causal link between the applicant 's criticism of ORG 's article and the latter 's death . The considerations which had led ORG to acquit the defendants in the first set of proceedings also applied in the present case . ORG followed the appellate court 's view expressed in the judgment of DATE and found that the impugned letter contained a value judgment which relied on a sufficient factual basis . In this connection , it noted that addressees of the letter , even if they had not read the article \u201c The deadly terror of virtue \u201d , were given a summary of its contents which enabled them to form an opinion about the pertinence of the allegation raised . The value judgment was not excessive , although the underlying facts were commented on from a strongly ideological point of view . It followed that the publication at issue was protected by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant , upholding ORG assessment that the CARDINAL sets of proceedings were so closely linked that the principles and considerations set out in its previous judgment of DATE applied .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ) , reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
