The applicants are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE , GPE . The third and fourth applicants are the children of the first and second applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants have resided in a house in GPE owned by the first and second applicants since DATE . Their property includes QUANTITY . m of surrounding fields . The house is CARDINAL of QUANTITY houses in a remote area of grassland .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on the occasion of certain village feasts , firework displays are set up in the fields close to the applicants\u2019 residence ( a distance of QUANTITY or more ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants allege that every time fireworks are let off from this area they are exposed to grave risk and peril to their life , physical health and personal security . Moreover , the heavy debris produced causes considerable damage to the residence .", "CARDINAL . In consequence , over DATE the applicants complained to the Commissioner of Police ( \u201c CoP \u201d ) , but no remedial action was taken .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants brought their complaint before the ORG . By a report of DATE , the latter recommended that in considering applications for discharge of fireworks from areas whose residents had put forward complaints , the CoP should request the advice of a group of experts established by law in order to determine whether the area in question ought to be declared a restricted area in terms of Rule CARDINAL of ORG and Other Explosives Regulations ( \u201c the regulations \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Eventually , the group of experts recommended that the fields from where the fireworks were being let off should be classified as a restricted area in terms of the regulations .", "CARDINAL . In spite of this recommendation the CoP again issued permits for the letting off of fireworks from the field in question for the purposes of CARDINAL village feasts . Since the committee of experts had not , at the relevant time , been constituted , the CoP acted on the recommendations of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants again complained to the ORG . By a report of DATE , the latter held the complaint justified and noted that the CARDINAL licences issued were not in accordance with the regulations ( regarding the applicable distances and type of fireworks ) . The group of experts had the duty to give advice and the competent authority had little justification to exercise its discretion and refuse this expert advice on such technical matters . While the pressure applied on the authorities from DATE in such cases was well known , this was an instance of maladministration which could not but attract criticism .", "CARDINAL . This notwithstanding , the CoP continued to issue the relevant permits for the purposes of CARDINAL feasts per year , to the present date .", "CARDINAL . The applicants alleged that further requests to the CoP , by the applicants and their neighbours , for information or reasons as to why they had not been consulted , remained unheeded , except for CARDINAL meeting which was held at the police station in the absence of the group of experts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings , complaining that the CoP was not protecting them as he was duty bound to do . While he ignored the experts\u2019 recommendations , the applicants had not been consulted about the issue of the relevant permits . They submitted that the law did not protect their interests , in that although it established a certain distance which had to be maintained between residences and the letting off of fireworks , it applied such distances only to \u201c inhabited areas \u201d which according to law meant \u201c an aggregation of houses inhabited , or capable of being inhabited , by CARDINAL persons \u201d . However , their house was CARDINAL of CARDINAL in the area and thus did not benefit from the protection of the law . Moreover , they claimed that the law was deficient , as it did not provide a procedure for issuing licences whereby the residents were informed and could make submissions to safeguard their interests , or appeal against the issue of such permits . Furthermore , the application of the definition of \u201c inhabited area \u201d resulted in discriminatory treatment against the applicants . They invoked DATE , alone and in conjunction with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction upheld the applicants\u2019 claims in part . It dismissed the complaint about the failure of the authorities to take appropriate procedures for the issue of licences for lack of exhaustion of ordinary remedies . For the rest , it held that the legal definition of \u201c inhabited area \u201d breached the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW , alone and in conjunction with LAW , and that the law regarding the issue of permits and licences also breached their rights under LAW , in that its application failed to include sufficient procedural safeguards . The ORG noted that the applicants were aware of the situation when they purchased the property . However , it noted that the letting off of fireworks had caused damage to the applicants\u2019 property , namely to the roof \u2019s membrane and the swimming pool area , as a result of the debris produced ; and during the relevant feasts the noise levels were very high , to the extent that the applicants were suffering hearing impairment that could become permanent . Although the effects of this pollution were not continuous , as in most cases which had been decided by the ORG , the practice of letting off of fireworks would certainly continue and its effects on the applicants included damage and threats to their person and their home , as dangerous unexploded fireworks were often found in the surroundings . In consequence , the court considered that , while the legality of the issue of these permits was questionable , by depriving the applicants of protection , on the basis that their area did not accommodate CARDINAL people , the law was not giving due weight to the interests of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The respondent ORG , together with ORG and the NORP society of ORG , appealed . In common they submitted , inter alia , that unlike the ORG cases dealing with environmental pollution , the present case did not deal with such pollution , because , among other reasons , the letting off of fireworks was restricted to TIME over DATE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG reversed the first - instance judgment . It noted that the applicants\u2019 case was not grounded on LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , although the applicants had made reference to damage to their property , but on LAW . Thus , the ORG had to establish whether the ORG had taken all the necessary measures to protect the applicants\u2019 rights under this provision . The ORG acknowledged that the noise and peril to their lives and property during DATE created an inconvenience for the applicants which amounted to interference . However , the interference was in accordance with the law , as it had its basis in ORG and Other Explosives Regulations , and whether the CoP had issued licences according to the regulations , a matter which was to be examined by the ordinary courts as established by the first - instance court , was irrelevant . As to the proportionality of the interference the ORG considered that in the present case the complaint was not directed towards a fireworks factory near the ORG residence , but simply the venue used to let off the fireworks at a specific time . In the present case , the relevant law struck a balance between the conflicting interests by means of specific measures , such as the times at which fireworks could be let off ; the type of fireworks which could be let off ; the different venues which could be used ; the security distances which had to be complied with ; compulsory insurance coverage ; the presence of a fire engine ; and police on site . Indeed , in the present case the police were on site to make sure that the action was taken according to the permits issued and a person from the relevant association was present in the area of the ORG houses as a precaution . The latter association also offered the applicants its help and protection to prevent any harm to the property . Thus , it could not be said that the applicants had not been protected . As to the definition of \u201c inhabited area \u201d , it was to be borne in mind that GPE was a small country , densely populated , with few , if any , areas where no people lived , and such legislation could only be seen in this context . Furthermore , the letting off of fireworks happened in a limited period for TIME in DATE twice a year and DATE even less often . Acknowledging that such noise might also cause disturbance to other persons , old and young especially , the court could not ignore the fact that the applicants had been informed of this danger by the previous owner ( who had had an accident in the house due to the fireworks ) before they bought the house . Yet , they chose to purchase the said property . Overall the court was of the view that the legislator had successfully tried to reach a balance between the right to home and private life of the applicants and the traditional , cultural , religious and touristic needs of NORP society , bearing in mind the size of the island . This might be otherwise if it were established that the measures applied were or would not be in accordance with the parameters set by law , a matter which the applicants had and have the right to contest before the ordinary courts regarding any future permit granted . In consequence there was no violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the alleged discrimination , the court reiterated that the provision only applied to persons in analogous situations . However , the applicants had not proved that they had been treated differently to other persons who resided in \u201c inhabited areas \u201d . Moreover , it has already been held that the applicants were receiving appropriate protection and that the applicants had knowingly decided to move to the area in question .", "CARDINAL . Fireworks in GPE have a long - standing tradition which is still very much alive in the crowded calendar of village feasts that take place all over GPE and GPE , especially in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of this case deal with a specific area where fireworks are let off during CARDINAL separate DATE and only during DATE , therefore not on a DATE basis during DATE . Moreover , from DATE the site was used for fireworks less regularly ( following a death amongst the pyrotechnic personnel of the relevant parish while manufacturing fireworks ) .", "CARDINAL .
