The applicants , all NORP nationals , were born in DATE and DATE respectively . At the material time they lived in different flats in a residential block ( \u201c the building \u201d ) constructed in DATE and situated at CARDINAL FAC in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The building is located in the city centre , in close proximity ( QUANTITY ) to the \u201c NORP \u201d thermal power plant ( \u201c the plant \u201d ) . The plant was constructed in DATE and reconstructed at a later date . It started operations in DATE . For DATE it burned coal to generate power , before replacing it with natural gas . The plant provided the adjacent residential areas with electricity and heat .", "CARDINAL . Several accidents have been reported throughout the plant \u2019s history . An accident on DATE rendered it inoperative for DATE . An expert report concerning the incident disclosed that the main reason behind the accident was the fact that no major repairs had been carried out there since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Presidential Decree No . CARDINAL was issued , stating that the plant was to be privatised and sold directly to a private company . The privatisation agreement between the Government and the company was concluded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the plant partially ceased generating power owing to financial problems . However , it continued to use some of the generators .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , while operational the plant \u2019s dangerous activities were not subject to the relevant regulations , as a result of which , in addition to some other alleged nuisances , it emitted various toxic substances into the atmosphere negatively affecting their well - being .", "CARDINAL . On unspecified dates the applicants and other residents of the building lodged complaints with the municipal authorities , alleging that nuisances were emanating from the plant such as air , noise and electromagnetic pollution and water leakage . By official letters dated DATE , DATE and DATE the FAC ( \u201c FAC ) acknowledged that the residents of the building had been affected by the nuisances they had complained of . It advised ORG that relocation of the plant would not be in the public interest in view of the acute energy crisis in the country and suggested that the residents of the affected area be offered electricity and heat free of charge as a form of compensation .", "CARDINAL . In the letter dated DATE ORG asked the plant to implement certain environmental protection measures , including the installation of chimney filters to reduce the air pollution emanating from the plant . The request was left unaddressed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in an official response to a query by the applicants , ORG confirmed that the plant \u2019s activities fell within the \u201c first category \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE below ) and that ORG ( \u201c ORG ) was responsible for issuing the relevant permit .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicants and other residents of the building brought an action for damages against the plant concerning the environmental nuisances emanating from the plant . A friendly settlement was reached between the parties on DATE , according to which the claimants would renounce their claims in exchange for a commitment by the plant \u2019s management to provide them with hot water , electricity and heat free of charge . Owing to technical difficulties and a lack of cooperation between the relevant authorities , the friendly settlement was left unenforced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants and CARDINAL other residents of the building ( \u201c the claimants \u201d ) brought a fresh action against the plant and other respondents including the GPE electricity distribution company , ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , FAC and ORG . They claimed compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage for the harm caused to their health and well - being by the air , noise and electromagnetic pollution and water leakage emanating from the plant . They relied on privately commissioned independent expert opinions in support of their complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the NORP ORG granted a request by the claimants and ordered ORG , ORG and ORG to arrange a number of expert examinations . The latter were intended to measure the environmental pollution caused by the plant , clarify how the associated harmful effects had affected the claimants\u2019 health and might have endangered human life , and identify appropriate remedies .", "CARDINAL . An expert examination dated DATE and carried out by the Expertise and ORG at ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c As the \u201c NORP \u201d plant does not have a [ buffer ] zone and is immediately adjacent to a residential building , the plant \u2019s chimneys must be equipped with appropriate filters and other equipment to protect the population from the hazardous gases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) at ORG issued an expert opinion on the air pollution and noise levels in the residential area concerned . It noted that while the plant \u2019s equipment responsible for the emission of toxic substances stood idle , it was impossible to determine the real pollution situation with which the residents had had to cope for DATE and noted that \u201c the results were considerably minimised compared to the possible real picture . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The expert opinion disclosed that the plant \u2019s technical compliance document was defective as it did not reveal all the chemical substances known to be emitted into the atmosphere in the course of natural gas burning . That document also incorrectly indicated the height of the chimneys as QUANTITY instead of the actual QUANTITY , which could lead to the pollution data being misleadingly decreased .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the air pollution and the possible impact upon the residents of the building , the expert opinion concluded as follows :", "\u201c Considering the fact that the plant does not have a [ buffer ] zone and is immediately adjacent to a residential building ... , taking into account the direction of the wind , a whole bouquet of emissions is reaching into the homes ... negatively affecting the population living in the adjacent area . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The opinion specified that even where individual hazardous substances were considered to be within the acceptable margin , it was necessary to consider the combined impact of various substances upon the health of the population as the combined toxicity might go beyond the acceptable limits . It continued to note in this connection that the concentrated toxicity of the gases emitted by the plant was twice the norm and the residents of the building concerned had to live in conditions where the concentration of toxic substances surpassed the acceptable limits TIME a day . The ORG proposed that the competent municipal authorities either ban those industrial activities or ensure the plant \u2019s relocation outside the town , where at least a buffer zone could be established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG at ORG responded to a query by the applicants and listed the diseases that might potentially be caused by excessive concentrations in the air of substances such as SOCARDINAL , ORG , ORG , smoke and black dust . These were mucocutaneous disorders , conjunctivitis , bronchitis , bronchopulmonary and other pulmonary diseases , allergies , different types of cardiovascular disease and anoxemia ( low oxygen levels in the blood ) , which could lead to other serious disorders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued an expert opinion concerning the noise levels in the building . Without specifying the noise levels in the individual flats of the applicants , the opinion concluded in generic terms that \u201c the residential building ... situated at CARDINAL FAC [ was ] affected by noise in excess of the permissible limits . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG expert carried out an additional investigation aimed at determining the noise levels in the individual flats of the claimants . It concluded that the permissible levels of noise were exceeded only with respect to CARDINAL claimants and not in the applicants\u2019 apartments .", "CARDINAL . An expert opinion issued by the ORG on DATE stated that the intensity of the electromagnetic waves did not exceed the permissible levels .", "CARDINAL . The expert opinion produced by ORG on DATE disclosed that , in some instances , the intensity of the electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the building exceeded the permissible levels . It concluded however that it was impossible to establish the exact source of the electromagnetic pollution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ordered ORG at ORG to examine the health of CARDINAL of the claimants . The third applicant and another claimant were not included , without any reasons being given for their exclusion . Its experts were asked to give an opinion on whether the claimants were suffering from any diseases which might have been caused by the pollution emanating from the plant .", "CARDINAL . The Forensic Medical Examination Centre carried out the courtcommissioned examination DATE and DATE . A panel of experts concluded that the CARDINAL claimants \u201c [ had ] been affected by a combined impact of protracted exposure to harmful factors such as SOCARDINAL , NO , COCARDINAL as well as black dust , noise and electromagnetic pollution negatively impacting their health . \u201d The first and second applicants were found to be suffering from largely similar health conditions such as neurasthenia and asthenic syndrome . The panel considered it \u201c possible that the asthenic syndrome and neurasthenia ... [ had been ] caused by the prolonged and combined effect of being exposed to harmful factors . \u201d It added that \u201c the worsening of the health conditions of the persons examined [ had not been ] excluded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the claims of the applicants and another claimant , but partially allowed the claims of CARDINAL other claimants ( \u201c the successful claimants \u201d ) with respect to the noise pollution emitted by the plant \u2019s generators . Relying on the expert examination of the ORG concerning the noise levels , the court found that only the CARDINAL successful claimants\u2019 flats were affected by noise in excess of the permissible limits . It awarded them CARDINAL NORP laris ( GEL \u2013 equivalent to CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) each , holding the plant , FAC , and ORG jointly liable :", "\u201c ... Both FAC and the Ministry failed to fulfil the obligations imposed on them by law . That is to say , despite the claimants\u2019 numerous requests and complaints , [ the authorities concerned ] failed to take specific measures to ensure an environment safe enough for the claimants\u2019 health . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , acknowledging that the plant was responsible for the infiltration of water into the foundations of the building , the court ordered it to halt the leakage and make the necessary repairs to the ruptured walls .", "CARDINAL . As regards the air pollution complained of , the court found that the material before it did not prove a causal link between the emissions and the claimants\u2019 health problems described in the Forensic Medical Examination Centre \u2019s expert report . It further suggested that the third applicant and another claimant had refused to undergo the medical examination .", "CARDINAL . While the court accepted the experts\u2019 conclusions that the plant had breached certain environmental standards by not having filters and other purification equipment in place to decrease the emission of toxic substances , it refused to order the plant to install such equipment on the grounds that the sole remedy requested by the claimants had been compensation for the damage caused by the pollution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the claimants appealed to ORG . Relying on the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and the findings of the courtcommissioned expert examinations at the domestic level , they reiterated their complaints about the lack of a buffer zone and the inherent risk of pollution , the absence of purification equipment over the plant \u2019s chimneys and its impact upon their health and well - being , and the defectiveness of the plant \u2019s technical compliance document . They further disagreed with the lower court \u2019s findings with respect to the alleged noise pollution emanating from the plant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a final judgment in the case . It upheld the appeals of the CARDINAL already successful claimants and ordered the plant \u2019s operators , ORG and ORG to pay them , jointly , GEL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) each for the deterioration of their health caused by the noise pollution that persisted after the partial termination of the plant \u2019s activities on DATE and affected them individually ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . In addition , it ordered the plant to pay GEL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) DATE to CARDINAL claimant and GEL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) to the other . It further upheld the lower court \u2019s finding concerning the plant \u2019s responsibility for the infiltration of water into the foundations of the building .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the complaint concerning the electromagnetic pollution as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . As regards the submissions concerning the air pollution , ORG dismissed them as unsubstantiated . It reasoned that the PERSON reference to violations of environmental standards , regardless of their validity , could not have served as a basis for awarding damages for air pollution considering that they had not requested that the plant \u2019s permit be revoked , that filters be installed over the chimneys , that other environmental protection measures be implemented , or that the hazardous activities be banned or relocated .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that the ORG \u2019s findings in the case of PERSON NORP v. GPE could not serve as grounds for requesting damages . It highlighted the fact that the plant in the instant case had been operational DATE while the flats had been built at DATE . It consequently concluded that the applicants had accepted the associated dangers when choosing to settle near the plant and were effectively barred from claiming any damages in that respect within the meaning of the Compensation for Damage Inflicted by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It thus concluded that the appellants had been under a duty to tolerate nuisances such as noise , smells , steam and gases caused by the ordinary industrial activities of the neighbouring plant , whose essential purpose had been to supply the nearby buildings with heating and hot water . The court interpreted the ORG unenforced friendly settlement in an earlier set of proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as their acceptance of the ecological discomfort .", "CARDINAL . ORG further reasoned that at the time of the proceedings the plant had suspended most of its operations and had no longer been emitting any substances into the air . Consequently , the appellants were no longer being affected by the pollution . Moreover , they had failed , in the court \u2019s opinion , to show what specific pecuniary damage , if any , had been sustained as a result of the air pollution in DATE . It was further noted that the appellants had not specified the costs which they had incurred or would inevitably incur in the future for medical treatment for their health problems ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
