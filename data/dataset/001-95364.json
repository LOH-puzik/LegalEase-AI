The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON , PERSON .", "CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant joined ORG ( \u201c TA \u201d ) as a pay and accounts clerk , a military post , carrying out duties such as filing , photocopying and maintaining a stationery store . In DATE the applicant was informed that he was to be made redundant , following organisational changes in the ORG pursuant to a process of civilianisation . He was subsequently informed that the clerical post which he had occupied was to become a civilian post and was to be converted to that of a technical store - man . The applicant applied for this new post , but was informed in DATE that he could take it only if he undertook a training course , but that all relevant training courses had been cancelled . He also applied for a number of other clerical posts within the ORG but was refused for them all .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was therefore made redundant . His discharge from the ORG , dated DATE , was formally made , incorrectly , on the basis that his services were no longer required . The applicant later discovered that his former duties were being carried out by an untrained civilian , while the technical store - man post remained vacant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about his redundancy to ORG , but his claim was rejected because ORG did not have jurisdiction over matters involving military personnel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed redress in respect of his redundancy from his Commanding Officer , under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Army Act DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Commanding Officer issued a brief in which he concluded that the applicant had a weak case for redress . He further requested ORG to determine whether the applicant was subject to military law . The applicant 's solicitors , on DATE , submitted observations in reply . The matter was then placed before ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant applied for judicial review in respect of ORG failure to determine the case within a reasonable time . His application was granted by ORG on DATE and ORG was ordered to deal with the case expeditiously .", "CARDINAL . ORG , without holding an oral hearing or directing a ORG to be convened , issued its decision on DATE , refusing the applicant 's claim for redress .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for judicial review of the decision not to hold an oral hearing or convene a ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the judicial review application was pending , ORG directed that a ORG should be convened . ORG was convened by an order dated DATE . It sat in DATE , considered oral and documentary evidence and issued a summary of its factual findings on DATE . It found in the applicant 's favour as regards his argument that he ought to have been , but was not , given priority before CARDINAL selection boards . It was anticipated that the level of compensation would be fixed by negotiation between ORG and the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG met to reach a determination on DATE . It issued its decision on DATE , ordering that the applicant be offered compensation in respect of the failure to offer him alternative employment within the ORG . On DATE , an award of compensation was notified to the applicant but he disputed the calculation of the compensation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a further offer of settlement was made to the applicant , which he rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made a further compensation offer of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The sum was made up of CARDINAL parts : loss of salary ( minus the applicant 's actual earnings during the relevant period ) ; a redundancy payment estimated on the basis that the applicant would have had DATE service ; and loss of pension rights , again based on a DATE period . The applicant rejected the offer on the basis that it did not include costs or a sum to compensate him for the stress he had suffered .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , acting as a litigant in person , subsequently applied for judicial review of the decision , claiming that the award had not been properly assessed . Permission was granted on DATE . The applicant advanced CARDINAL criticisms : first , that the award was based on the assumption that he would have been discharged from the army DATE after the date on which he was actually discharged ; second , that the salary base used for the calculation of all CARDINAL elements of the award was taken to be GBP CARDINAL per year gross . The latter criticism was only formally advanced at the hearing itself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's complaint regarding the DATE cut - off date . However , in light of evidence produced to the court regarding the level of the applicant 's salary at the time of his redundancy , the court accepted ORG undertaking to review the level of the annual salary used in its calculation and , if appropriate , to reassess the award of compensation within DATE . Although formally the applicant was the unsuccessful party in the litigation , and as a result would normally be required to pay the costs of ORG , the court ordered the applicant to pay CARDINAL of ORG costs partly on the ground that \u201c the history of this matter displays an inordinate period of delay \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a revised offer of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL was made to the applicant . The offer was rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant again applied for judicial review on DATE seeking an order requiring ORG to investigate and take steps towards redressing his complaint within a prescribed time - frame and damages for the losses suffered by him as a result of ORG failure to perform its duties . There was a hearing on DATE but no order was made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a further offer was made to the applicant in the sum of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again applied for judicial review in respect of the delay but again , following a hearing on DATE , no order was made .", "CARDINAL .
