NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented by PERSON K. O\u2019Rourke of ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a presenter with PERSON , a speech - based radio station . He presented a programme which covered a range of news issues and he was well - known for his \u201c combative and hard - hitting \u201d style with interviewees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant conducted a live interview with PERSON , the ORG Member for ORG for ORG . The interview concerned the council \u2019s proposal to ban smokers from becoming foster parents on the ground that passive smoking could harm foster children . The applicant had spent some of his childhood in the care system and on TIME of the interview an article written by him on the subject was published in The PERSON newspaper . The article was headlined \u201c NORP did n\u2019t stop my foster mum caring for me \u201d . The following extract is relevant to the present proceedings :", "\u201c TIME in GPE CARDINAL children wo n\u2019t have a special person to tuck them in at TIME , read them a story or take an interest in what happened during DATE at school .", "Meanwhile , the zealots who dreamed up this policy will sleep easy on their futons because they are putting the \u2018 health needs\u2019 of kids in care first .", "This is the same warped logic that condemns black children to a life in care rather than let them be fostered by white couples .", "The same master race philosophy that forbids fat couples from adopting .", "The SS DATE that is social services by the way \u2013 think that the risk from passive smoking is more dangerous to a child than them being left to rot in a children \u2019s home .", "They should understand that most parents realise the dangers and would n\u2019t smoke in an enclosed space with children around .", "Foster parents are no different .", "The woman who rescued me from care , and undoubtedly turned me around as a child , smoked like a chimney but she was also a hospital matron .", "She lavished love , care and , most importantly , discipline on me .", "Without her I would n\u2019t be where I am DATE ...", "DATE it \u2019s GPE but , unless we all make a noise now , DATE it will be a national policy and CARDINAL more children will fall victim to the health and safety NORP and be left alone in a care home . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Prior to the applicant \u2019s interview with PERSON , he was warned by PERSON that the subject might be emotive for him . In fact , in TIME before the interview programming staff advised him on CARDINAL occasions to remain calm and allow PERSON to put his point of view across .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s radio interview with PERSON lasted TIME . In the proceedings which followed , the President of ORG summarised the interview in the terms set out below :", "\u201c The first part of the interview was reasonably controlled , giving [ GPE ] a reasonable opportunity to explain his council \u2019s policy . The claimant then asked him about existing foster parents who only ever smoke in the open air . [ PERSON ] explained that the council would not drag children away from existing foster parents , but that such smokers would not be used in the future . The trouble was that such people do smoke in the house . Asked by the claimant how he knew this , [ GPE ] explained that there were GPE councillors who say they never smoke in the building , but in fact do so . To which the claimant said \u2018 so you are a NORP then?\u2019 When [ GPE ] began to protest , the claimant again said \u2018 no you are , you \u2019re a Nazi\u2019 . [ GPE ] protested vehemently that this was an offensive and insulting remark , and the interview then degenerated into an unseemly slanging match . When [ PERSON ] protested that the insult , as he saw it , was probably actionable , the claimant challenged him to \u2018 take action if you wish\u2019 , but then said \u2018 you \u2019re a health Nazi\u2019 . The slanging match continued with the claimant asking [ PERSON ] if he wanted to carry on with the interview , and [ GPE ] replying that he would love to if the claimant would just shut up for TIME . It emerged that the claimant had himself been in care . He referred to his column in The LOC DATE and again called [ GPE ] a \u2018 health Nazi\u2019 and then \u2018 a Nazi\u2019 . The heated shouting continued with the claimant doing much of the talking . [ GPE ] asked him just to shut up for a moment , and said in effect that the conditions of those in care were better than they had been . The claimant regarded this as an offensive insult to his own upbringing and called [ GPE ] \u2018 you ignorant pig\u2019 . He later referred to him as a \u2018 health fascist\u2019 and an \u2018 ignorant ORG , and shortly after this he ended an interview that by then had got completely out of control .", "It is scarcely possible to convey the general and particular tone of this interview in a short written summary , and the full transcript is in this respect incomplete . You have to hear it for its full impact . As we have said , it degenerated into a shouting match from the point when the claimant first called [ GPE ] \u2018 a Nazi\u2019 . That first insult was not said with particular vehemence , but \u2018 you ignorant pig\u2019 was said with considerable venom and was we think gratuitously offensive . The interview as a whole can fairly be described as a rant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Within TIME of the interview , the applicant apologised to the listeners , accepting that he did not \u201c hold it together \u201d , that he had been \u201c unprofessional \u201d and that he had \u201c lost the rag \u201d . TIME after the end of the broadcast , he made a further apology in the following terms :", "\u201c The Councillor wants me to apologise for calling him a NORP . I \u2019m sorry for calling you a NORP . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was suspended from his programme by PERSON DATE and an internal investigation was launched . PERSON subsequently terminated his contract without notice by letter dated CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the broadcast , ORG , the independent regulator and competition authority for the GPE communications industries , received CARDINAL complaints about the applicant \u2019s conduct . Some of the complaints concerned the manner in which the interview had been conducted , as the complainants believed that it was an \u201c unprovoked personal attack \u201d , and that the applicant was \u201c oppressive \u201d , \u201c intimidating \u201d , and \u201c shouting like a playground bully \u201d . Other complainants were offended by the word \u201c NORP \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG launched an investigation into the matter under LAW . In its response to ORG , PERSON stated that it regretted what had happened and accepted that the interview \u201c fell way below the acceptable broadcasting standards which it expected and demanded \u201d . It totally accepted and regretted that the applicant \u2019s language had been offensive and that the manner in which the interview was conducted had been indefensible .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a report published on DATE , ORG concluded that the broadcast had breached LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as it fell short of the generally accepted standards applied to broadcast content and included offensive material which was not justified by the context . In reaching this conclusion , ORG took into account the right of broadcasters to hold opinions and impart information without interference ; the fact that PERSON specialised in a genre of hardhitting talk radio which could at times prove uncomfortable and challenging listening ; the fact that the broadcast of \u201c offensive \u201d material was not in itself a breach of ORG \u2019s code as the Code did not prohibit the broadcasting of offensive material ; the extremely aggressive tone of the applicant \u2019s interview style on this occasion ; and the seriousness which the broadcaster attached to the incident , as demonstrated by its prompt investigation and the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL on - air apologies . Nevertheless , it found that PERSON \u2019s compliance procedures did not appear robust enough to deal with problematic material being broadcast live . Moreover :", "\u201c the language used by PERSON , and the manner in which he treated [ GPE ] , had the potential to cause offence to many listeners \u201d", "and", "\u201c the offensive language used to describe [ GPE ] , and what would be considered to be a persistently bullying and hectoring approach taken by PERSON towards his guest , exceeded the expectations of the audience for this programme , despite listeners being accustomed to a robust level of debate from this particular presenter . Even taking into account the context of this programme such as the nature of the service , the audience expectations and the editorial content , ORG did not consider that this was sufficient justification for the offensive material . The broadcaster therefore failed to comply with generally accepted standards in breach of LAW and CARDINAL of the Code . \u201d", "CARDINAL . No sanction or penalty was imposed either on PERSON or the applicant other than the publication of the decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted leave to judicially review ORG \u2019s decision on the ground that it disproportionately interfered with his freedom of expression and infringed his rights under LAW Liberty intervened in the proceedings to support the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . Although ORG \u2019s decision was against the broadcaster , which had acknowledged that there had been a breach of the LAW , ORG judge noted that the parties had ( in his view , rightly ) accepted that the applicant had standing to challenge it because it \u201c enunciates an inhibition capable of affecting his unrestrained freedom to conduct radio interviews in the way in which he did on this occasion \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant did not contend that LAW itself violated LAW , the narrow question for the court to address was whether ORG \u2019s findings had disproportionately interfered with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . The judge noted at the outset that the unchallenged statutory basis for ORG \u2019s finding meant that it was prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of others . With regard to the question of necessity , the judge accepted that as the broadcast was live the applicant had had no opportunity to edit or correct what he said once he had said it . Moreover , the subject of the interview was political and controversial and the person being interviewed was an elected politician who would expect to receive and tolerate a \u201c rough ride \u201d . It was therefore an interview where the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression should be accorded a high degree of protection . Nevertheless , his freedom of expression did not extend to gratuitous , offensive insult or abuse without contextual content or justification . Applying these principles and giving due weight to ORG \u2019s judgment , the judge considered that to call someone a \u201c NORP \u201d was capable of being highly insulting . It accepted , however , that in the present case the first use of the word could have had some contextual justification , especially in light of the applicant \u2019s use of it in his newspaper article , and could therefore be seen as an emphatic and pejorative assertion that GPE was , in the matter of smoking and fostering children , one who imposes his views on others . Nevertheless , the court noted that after the applicant used the word , the interview degenerated and the applicant \u2019s conduct of it became increasingly abusive , hectoring and out of control . His subsequent use of the word \u201c NORP \u201d undoubtedly assumed the nature of undirected abuse and the expression \u201c ignorant pig \u201d was said \u201c with such venom as to constitute gratuitous offensive abuse \u201d . As a consequence the later part of the interview became abusive shouting which served to convey to listeners no real content at all .", "CARDINAL . The judge therefore concluded that , taking full account of the applicant \u2019s LAW rights , ORG was justified in its conclusion . The broadcast was highly offensive to CARDINAL and well capable of offending the broadcasting public . Moreover , its offensive and abusive nature was gratuitous , having no factual content or justification . As a consequence , the judge accepted that ORG \u2019s finding constituted no material interference with the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression at all . In this regard , he found it relevant , but not decisive , that no sanction or penalty was imposed on the broadcaster , let alone the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . With regard to the applicant \u2019s standing , the court reiterated that it was \u201c accepted that he had locus standi to [ challenge ORG \u2019s finding ] , unsurprisingly since it is obviously possible that the finding may have had an adverse impact on him and on his reputation as a journalist \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted that there were a number of facts which supported the proposition that a tribunal should be slow to hold that what was said in an interview offended the provisions of paragraphs CARDINAL.CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code : first , the interview in question was concerned with an issue of general public interest ; secondly , the interview was a live discussion and was not pre - recorded ; thirdly , the applicant was well known to be a hard - hitting and robust interviewer ; and fourthly , the interviewee was a politician and he made no subsequent complaint . However , these factors did not mean that the interview could not be susceptible to a finding that it fell foul of CARDINAL of the Code .", "CARDINAL . In considering whether or not the interview offended paragraphs CARDINAL the court considered it as a whole and in its context . It accepted that it would be wrong to focus too hard individually , let alone exclusively , on specific insults such as \u201c health NORP \u201d and \u201c ignorant pig \u201d , the applicant \u2019s hectoring tone and bullying manner , his persistent interruptions , his failure to let PERSON answer questions , or his treating one or more innocuous comments by PERSON as an insult . All those points had to be considered , together with the fact that the interview was permitted to run on for TIME after it had become clear that it had got out of hand .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the court concluded that the combination of the CARDINAL concerns identified in the preceding paragraph rendered it impossible to accept that ORG \u2019s finding , which contained no sanction other than the publication of the decision , represented an interference with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . Although the topic covered was of public interest , this point was of limited force in the context of an interview where the interviewee was not permitted to express his views or reasons . Moreover , while the interview was broadcast live , the applicant was not an inexperienced interviewee being provoked in the heat of the moment ; rather , he was an experienced interviewer who had plainly decided to embark on a particularly aggressive assault on GPE and his opinions . The fact that his style of interviewing was well known did not render the interview acceptable ; nor did PERSON \u2019s failure to complain . The court therefore concluded that ORG was right to find that PERSON had infringed paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code .", "CARDINAL . Finally , with regard to the severity of the sanction , the court noted that ORG could have decided that the complaint had been resolved instead of finding that there had been a breach of the LAW . However , it had rejected this option since this was not a case of inadvertent error , as PERSON had allowed the interview to continue for TIME after it plainly got out of control , and there had been CARDINAL previous findings against PERSON where producers had lost control of an interview or discussion .", "CARDINAL . That being said , having concluded that ORG rightly found that PERSON had infringed paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code , the court found it impossible to contend that ORG \u2019s decision to impose no other sanction than the publication of the report \u201c even got near being disproportionate \u201d . Furthermore , the court noted that from the point of view of the applicant , he had been dismissed before ORG \u2019s finding was published and there was no suggestion that he had lost work or that his reputation as a journalist had been damaged .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal therefore dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for leave to appeal to ORG . ORG refused permission in a decision dated DATE , sent to the applicant under cover of a letter dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . Broadcasting standards are governed by LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which requires them to be implemented , supervised and enforced by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of the DATE Act places a duty on ORG to secure the application by all television and radio stations of standards that \u201c provide adequate protection to members of the public from the inclusion of offensive and harmful material \u201d in broadcast programmes .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act obliges ORG to set up a \u201c standards code \u201d for radio and television services which is \u201c calculated to secure \u201d the so - called \u201c standards objectives \u201d . These objectives include , at section MONEY ) , that \u201c generally accepted standards are applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion in such services of offensive and harmful material \u201d . ORG is also obliged by LAW to \u201c establish procedures for handling and resolution of complaints about the observance of [ those ] standards \u201d .", "CARDINAL . This code , known as LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , states in terms that it has been drafted in the light of the right to freedom of expression as expressed in LAW , which encompasses a broadcaster \u2019s right to disseminate , and an audience \u2019s right to receive , creative material , information and ideas without interference , but subject to restrictions prescribed by law and necessary in a NORP society .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the LAW provides that generally accepted standards must be applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion in such services of harmful and/or offensive materials . Paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON states that , in applying generally accepted standards , broadcasters must ensure that material which may cause offence is justified by the context . Such material may include , among other material , offensive language .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Broadcasting Act CARDINAL precludes ORG from entertaining a complaint of unfair treatment unless made by the person affected or by a person authorised by him to make the complaint for him .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to sections CARDINAL \u2013 CARDINAL of LAW DATE , where there has been a breach of the Code ORG could take a range of possible measures : publish its finding indicating that a breach of the LAW has taken place ; direct that the broadcaster transmits a correction or a statement of ORG \u2019s finding ; impose a financial penalty on the broadcaster ; or shorten , suspend or revoke the broadcaster \u2019s licence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
