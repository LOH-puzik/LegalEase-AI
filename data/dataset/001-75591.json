In their pleadings to ORG , the ORG stated that at the time of the Security Police \u2019s decision on DATE it had not been possible to find the file owing to the fact that the second applicant had not been the subject of a personal record in connection with the report in issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant appealed to ORG in GPE , requesting authorisation to view his file and all other entries made on him by ORG . He relied on certain written evidence to the effect that he had been mentioned in the records of ORG , notably on the cover page and page CARDINAL of a secret report dating back to DATE and emanating from Section ( byr\u00e5 ) A of ORG , that had been released by the GPE police shortly beforehand .

He stressed that since he had never been convicted , charged or notified of any suspicion of crime and had never taken part in any illegal , subversive or terrorist activity , refusing him full access to the files could not be justified . The wishes of ORG to maintain secrecy about their work should have been balanced against his interest in clarifying the extent of the violation that he had suffered , not only through their collection of information about him but also through their disclosure of such information .", "CARDINAL . NORP In accordance with standard procedure , the appeal was brought to the attention of ORG , who then decided , on DATE , to release the same CARDINAL pages of the DATE report referred to above , while maintaining their refusal regarding the remainder of the second applicant \u2019s initial request . The reasons given were largely the same as in the first decision , with the following addition :", "\u201c In the Security Police archives there are a number of documents which contain information both about different subject matter and individuals . The fact that such documents exist in ORG archives does not mean that all information in the documents is registered and therefore searchable . Information which is not registered can only be retrieved if details have been submitted about the document in which the information is contained . Since you provided us with such details , it was possible for us to find the document you asked for in your request . \u201d", "After receipt of the above decision , the second applicant had a telephone conversation with PERSON , an officer of ORG ( who had signed the decision of DATE ) . According to the applicant , she explained that , when dealing with requests such as his , only documents that were searchable by computer would be verified , which was the reason why the initial request had been rejected in its entirety and access had been granted to the CARDINAL pages of the DATE report .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his appeal to ORG , the applicant pointed out that from the above telephone conversation it emerged , firstly , that since DATE CARDINAL personal files in ORG register had been destroyed . Secondly , information about persons whose files had been erased could still be found in ORG archives but could not be searched under names or personal identity numbers . Thirdly , the so - called destruction lists , comprising CARDINAL names , was all that remained of the erased files . The second applicant complained that ORG had failed to search those lists ( assuming that the files no longer existed ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal in its entirety , giving essentially the same reasons as the Security Police , with the following further considerations :", "\u201c In connection with the introduction of [ section CARDINAL of LAW ] , the government stated that even the information that a person is not registered by ORG is such that it should be possible to keep it secret under the said provision ( prop . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . According to the government bill , the reason is the following . A person who is engaged in criminal activity may have a strong interest in knowing whether the police have information about him or her . In such a case it could be highly prejudicial to the investigation for the person concerned to be informed whether or not he or she is of interest to the police . It is therefore important for a decision on a request for information from the register not to have to give information on whether the person appears in the register or not . The nature of secret intelligence is such that there can only be disclosure of information in special cases .", "ORG finds that it is not clear that information , beyond that which emerges from the disclosed documents , about whether [ the second applicant ] has been the subject of any secret police activity falling under LAW , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , of LAW can be disclosed without jeopardising the purpose of measures taken or anticipated or without harming future operations . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

A thematic file may be started in order to collect documents that concern the relations between GPE and organisations . It may also be started in order to collect a certain type of document , for instance a series of reports . It should be observed that thematic registration as such does not mean that names are entered into the Security Police \u2019s register , even though names may be found in the documents of a thematic file . Thus , a search for a person who has been mentioned in a thematic file can not be done unless , for independent reasons , that person has also been registered in a personal file .

CARDINAL ) , where it was stated that a person linked to criminal activities may have a strong interest in knowing whether the police have any information regarding him or her . In such a case , it could be very damaging for an investigation if it were revealed to the person in question either that he or she was of interest to the police or that he or she was not .
