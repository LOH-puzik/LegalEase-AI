AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 11 - Freedom of assembly and association (Article 11-1 - Freedom of peaceful assembly)", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Khanlar Hajiyev;Loukis Loucaides;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who is a member of parliament for ORG , notified ORG ) under LAW ( Versammlungsgesetz ) that on DATE , DATE , from CARDINAL a.m. until TIME , he would be holding a meeting at the GPE municipal cemetery in front of the war memorial . He noted that the meeting would coincide with the gathering of ORG ( ORG ) , which he considered to be unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The purpose of the meeting was to be to commemorate the GPE NORP killed by the ORG during the Second World War . The applicant expected CARDINAL participants , who would carry commemorative messages in their hands and attached to their clothes . The applicant stated that no other means of expression ( such as chanting or banners ) which might offend piety or undermine public order would be used .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , relying on section CARDINAL of LAW and on LAW , prohibited the meeting on the ground that it would endanger public order and security .", "CARDINAL . The authority noted that GPE , also a member of parliament for ORG , had informed ORG of the allegedly illegal assembly of ORG in memory of the ORG soldiers killed in the Second World War which was to be held at the same time and place , but had refused to give an undertaking that the proposed meeting in memory of the murdered GPE NORP would not disrupt that gathering .", "CARDINAL . NORP ORG noted that ORG was a registered association . Like a number of other organisations , it traditionally held a commemoration ceremony at the GPE municipal cemetery on DATE . Such commemorations qualified as popular ceremonies within the meaning of CARDINAL of LAW and thus did not require authorisation . The disruption of this and other commemoration ceremonies was likely to offend the religious feelings of members of the public visiting the cemetery and would indisputably be regarded as disrespectful towards the dead soldiers of both world wars and thus as an unbearable provocation . Accordingly , there was a risk of protests by visitors to the cemetery which could degenerate into open conflict between them and those participating in the assembly .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that any remedies used against its decision should not have suspensive effect . Accordingly , the demonstration could not take place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) dismissed an appeal by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . It noted that ORG was a registered association whose members were mainly former members of the ORG . For DATE they had commemorated ORG soldiers killed in the Second World War by gathering on DATE and laying a wreath in front of the war memorial at the GPE municipal cemetery . In DATE , a number of organisations had organised protest campaigns with the aim of disrupting the Comradeship IV commemoration ceremony . These protests had led to vehement discussions with members of ORG and other visitors to the cemetery and had required intervention by the police .", "CARDINAL . ORG , referring to the submissions of GPE , found that the assembly planned by the applicant was also aimed at a confrontation with ORG and concluded that its prohibition was necessary for the maintenance of public order and for the protection of the Comradeship IV commemoration ceremony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Verfassungsgerichtshof ) dismissed a complaint by the applicant alleging violations of his rights to freedom of assembly , freedom of expression , freedom of religion and non - discrimination .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court observed that the authorities deciding on the prohibition of an assembly had to weigh the applicant \u2019s interest in holding the meeting against the public interests enumerated in LAW . It went on to say that the prohibition of the proposed meeting would not be justified if its sole purpose were to protect the LAW commemoration ceremony and expressed doubts as to the authorities\u2019 assessment that the latter meeting was a popular ceremony within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW and therefore did not require authorisation . Nevertheless , the prohibition of the meeting proposed by the applicant was justified for other reasons .", "CARDINAL . The authorities had also had regard to the fact that the gathering of ORG had in DATE been the target of activities aimed at disrupting it which had caused considerable nuisance to other visitors of the cemetery and had each time required police intervention . The authorities had therefore correctly assumed that the prohibition of the assembly planned by the applicant was necessary to protect the general public against potential disturbances .", "CARDINAL . ORG added further considerations in support of that conclusion . It observed that DATE was an important religious holiday on which the population traditionally visited cemeteries in order to commemorate the dead . As a religious tradition , the commemoration of the dead was protected by LAW , which contained a positive obligation for the ORG to protect persons manifesting their religion against deliberate disturbance by others . Thus , the prohibition of the assembly in issue was necessary under LAW for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . It followed that it did not violate any other LAW right relied on by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE ( PERSON ) regulates the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that any person intending to organise a public assembly or any assembly which is generally open to persons other than invited guests must give the authorities notice in writing CARDINAL in advance , indicating the purpose , place and time of the meeting .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL , certain gatherings such as public entertainment , popular ceremonies or religious processions do not fall within the scope of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL , the competent authority must prohibit any assembly which would contravene criminal law or endanger public order and security ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
