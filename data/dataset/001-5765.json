POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE , residing in Racib\u00f3rz", "In DATE the applicant wrote a letter to ORG ( ORG ) in which he requested that his wish to abandon his NORP citizenship be acknowledged . He formulated at this occasion various complaints about , in his view , catastrophic situation of the country , about poverty of growing parts of population due to ruinous economic policies and about a number of other social and political issues . He also wrote a letter to the Chancellery of the President of GPE , requesting to be divested of his citizenship .", "On an unspecified date criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on charges of arson .", "On DATE ORG submitted a motion to ORG , requesting that an order be given for the applicant \u2019s placement at a psychiatric institution .", "On DATE ORG , after a hearing held on that date in the presence of the applicant , his lawyer and a prosecutor , committed the applicant to a mental hospital . The court established that criminal proceedings had been instituted against the applicant on suspicion of arson . As doubts had arisen as to the applicant \u2019s mental health , the prosecutor appointed experts in order to establish his condition . The experts requested that the applicant undergo a psychiatric observation , and , after the observation had been completed , submitted their report . They concluded that on account of psychiatric illness he could not be held criminally responsible , within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINALof LAW applicable at that time , and that he posed a threat to public order . The prosecutor had subsequently requested the court to order the applicant \u2019s committal to a psychiatric institution . The court further stated that in the light of the evidence gathered in the investigations the applicant was , beyond any doubt , an author of the criminal offence in question ( \u201c analizuj\u0105c dowody zgromadzone w toku \u015bledztwa PERSON uzna\u0142 , \u017ce nie budzi w\u0105tpliwo\u015bci , i\u017c podejrzany jest sprawc\u0105 zarzucanego mu czynu \u201d ) . The court further considered that the prosecutor \u2019s request was supported by unequivocal conclusions of the experts .", "The applicant lodged an appeal , arguing that he had not been given the access to the full text of the medical expert opinion , that the charges against him were supported only on circumstantial evidence and his guilt had not been established , and challenged the experts\u2019 argument that his wish to emigrate had been motivated by his mental illness .", "On DATE ORG , in a session in the presence of a prosecutor , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court stated that the evidence allowed for a finding that the applicant had committed the offence concerned . The court referred in this respect to the applicant \u2019s confession made in the investigations , and to the testimony of a fireman who had been leading action of the fire brigade . In his view , the applicant \u2019s apartment had deliberately been put on fire . He had also found CARDINAL bottles with petrol in the apartment . The court further had regard to the medical expert opinion to the effect that the applicant , who suffered from paranoid syndrome , could not be criminally responsible on psychiatric grounds and that he should be committed to a hospital as he posed a genuine and serious threat to public order . The court concluded that , in view of the fact that the applicant who had never before been under any psychiatric treatment , was uttering threats that he would escalate his violent actions , the conclusions of the lower court were justified .", "Subsequently the applicant was placed in a psychiatric hospital . On an unspecified date he requested the ORG to lodge a cassation appeal against this decision .", "On DATE the ORG lodged a cassation appeal against the decision of ORG . The ORG argued that ORG had failed to inform the applicant and his lawyer about the date of the hearing which was held before that court on DATE . The applicant had thus been deprived of his defence rights .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision of ORG , considering that in view of the fact that the applicant \u2019s lawyer had not been informed about the date and time of the latter court \u2019s session of DATE , and that the applicant \u2019s interests had not been properly presented and defended in the proceedings . ORG ordered that the case be remitted to ORG for reconsideration .", "Apparently later the applicant submitted a request to be discharged from the psychiatric hospital to ORG .", "On DATE ORG , having again examined the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE , upheld the decision . The court took into consideration that the evidence gathered in the investigations conducted by the prosecution allowed for a conclusion that the applicant had been the author of the offence concerned , as shown by his own confession and by the testimony of the witness PERSON , relied on by the lower court . The court further referred to the medical expert opinion of psychiatrists from PERSON hospital who , having regard to the results of a clinical observation of the applicant , established that he had been suffering from paranoid syndrome , and that in view of his illness he posed a serious and genuine threat to legal order . The court concluded that the decision of the lower court was well - founded . The court finally observed that , in the light of the letter of the Chief Physician of ORG of DATE , apparently concerning the applicant \u2019s condition at that time , a judicial review of the applicant \u2019s detention , provided for by LAW , was called for .", "By a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant that a decision concerning his request for release would be given as soon as the medical expert opinion was submitted to the court .", "On DATE the applicant complained that the proceedings concerning his request for release lasted too long .", "In reply , ORG , in a letter of CARDINAL DATE , informed the applicant that the decision would be given as soon as the experts appointed to prepare an opinion as to his continued detention submit their final report . They had been urged by the court to speed up their progress , to no avail . In view of their failure to react , the court had requested them again to accelerate their work .", "On DATE ORG , having questioned the experts , decided that the applicant \u2019s detention should be maintained as he still presented a threat to public order .", "The applicant and his lawyers lodged appeals against this decision , submitting that , in the view of the applicant \u2019s condition the maintaining of the applicant \u2019s detention had ceased to serve any purpose , and that the decision to detain him had been \u201c politically motivated \u201d .", "On DATE ORG declined to examine the appeal , considering that under LAW it was ORG , composed of CARDINAL professional judge and CARDINAL lay judges , which was competent to rule on the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE . The court considered that the first - instance court had been thorough in its assessment of the evidence , in particular in respect of the expert medical opinions of psychiatrists ORG and ORG , the conclusions of which they had reiterated at a hearing on DATE , indicating that the applicant \u2019s detention should be maintained . The court further considered that the conclusions of this expert report , contrary to the appearances ( \u201c wbrew pozorom \u201d ) , were identical with statements contained in another medical expert opinion drawn by psychiatrists ORG and ORG who had stated that the applicant \u2019s personality had certain paranoiac characteristics . They had further argued that , since the applicant had been uttering threats , he should remain in detention . The court therefore concluded that their conclusions actually strengthened the conclusions of the other CARDINAL experts . The court went on to state that in view of the applicant \u2019s past conviction for uttering threats and arson and the fact that during his detention in the hospital he had been submitting numerous complaints to various institutions , his further detention was called for as he had not ceased to pose a serious and genuine threat to legal order .", "On DATE , the applicant requested that criminal proceedings be instituted against certain experts involved in his case . On DATE ORG , to whom the case had been transferred as the prosecutor in whose jurisdiction the proceedings should be conducted , requested that the investigations be conducted by another prosecuting authority , refused to do so . The applicant appealed , and on DATE ORG set this decision aside .", "On DATE ORG refused to re - open the proceedings in which the applicant \u2019s placement at the mental hospital had been ordered , finding that the legal requirements had not been met .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing at which it examined the applicant \u2019s request for release , submitted at an unknown date . The court , having regard to doubts as to the applicant \u2019s current health , and in accordance with the applicant \u2019s request , ordered that an opinion of a specialised research institution be sought . The applicant subsequently underwent DATE observation in the hospital of ORG of ORG in GPE hospital .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the investigations against the experts , considering that they had no case to answer . The applicant \u2019s appeal was subsequently transmitted to FAC . On DATE the court upheld this decision .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release .", "The conditions for detention of persons of unsound mind who are not responsible on medical grounds were laid down in LAW , as it stood at the material time :", "\" If it has been established that a person has committed an offence in a state of mental disorder [ excluding his criminal responsibility ] , and his remaining at liberty entails a serious danger to public order , the court shall commit him to a mental hospital or another appropriate institution . \"", "\" In cases provided for in LAW ... ) the period of detention is not determined in the decision of the committal to the psychiatric institution ; the court shall order the release if the detention ceases to be necessary . \"", "According to the case - law of ORG , a threat to public order is to be determined on the basis of a situation obtaining at a time when the offender \u2019s detention in the psychiatric institution is imposed . The assessment of the existence and the degree of such threat should be made in the light of a medical expert opinion . For a decision ordering detention in a psychiatric hospital to be given , it is not necessary that it is expressly stated in the medical expert opinion that it would pose a threat to public order if the offender were to remain at liberty . It suffices that such a conclusion could be drawn from the medical expert opinion taken as a whole ( ORG , ORG i DATE , item CARDINAL ) .", "A threat to public order is considered serious if an offender \u2019s remaining at liberty gives rise to a risk of an unlawful act being committed by him ( ORG , ORG i DATE , item . CARDINAL ) .", "LAW , applicable at the relevant time , reads :", "\" CARDINAL . A director of a medical institution is obliged to keep the court informed of the detainee \u2019s health and of the progress in treatment .", "...", "CARDINAL .
