AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1 as regards the plea of nullity;Violation of Art. 6-1 as regards the appeal against sentence", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE ORG at ORG ( PERSON ) filed an indictment charging the applicant with murder . It was alleged that the applicant , in DATE , had killed his wife and had then buried her decapitated corpse in a field where it had been discovered in DATE . It was further alleged that he had had a mistress , and had run into financial difficulties as he had rented and furnished an apartment for her and had maintained her , whereas his wife , who had opposed a divorce , had owned the spouses ' house and a collection of jewellery of considerable value . In these and the trial proceedings the applicant was represented by official counsel , Mr. PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a ORG ( GPE ) , gave judgment . The jury found the applicant guilty of murder . The court , sitting with the jury , sentenced him to life imprisonment . It considered as aggravating circumstances that the applicant had acted for particularly base motives and had acted cruelly . It found that there were no mitigating circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , still represented by Mr. PERSON , filed a plea of nullity ( GPE ) and an appeal ( GPE ) . In his plea of nullity he complained about the composition of the court , the court 's failure to put alternative questions to the jury and about the lack of reasons for the jury 's verdict . He also submitted that there was no factual basis for finding him guilty . In his appeal he complained in particular that ORG judgment did not give sufficient reasons for the sentence . As to the aggravating circumstances , it was not clear which motives had been established and deemed particularly base . Nor did the judgment mention any facts which would allow the conclusion that he had acted in a cruel manner . As to possible mitigating circumstances , the applicant complained that ORG had failed to take his advanced age and lack of prior convictions into account . The applicant did not request to attend the hearing before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) fixed the hearing date for the applicant 's plea of nullity and his appeal for DATE . The applicant received a notification , which stated that his counsel would be summoned to the hearing . As to the hearing of the plea of nullity , the notification informed him that he , being detained , could only appear through his counsel . As to the hearing of the appeal , he would not be brought to the court as the conditions of S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafproze\u00dfordung ) were not fulfilled . At an unspecified date in DATE , the applicant was informed by ORG that for the purpose of his representation at the hearing before ORG a new official defence counsel , PERSON , had been appointed as PERSON would be unable to attend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having held a hearing in the absence of the applicant but in the presence of his new official defence counsel , Mr. PERSON , rejected his plea of nullity as well as his appeal . As regards the appeal , the ORG found that the applicant had rightly claimed as a mitigating circumstance that he had no prior convictions . Furthermore , cruelty had not been factually established as an aggravating circumstance . However , there was evidential support for the conclusion that the applicant had acted for particularly base motives . Attaching particular weight to this aggravating circumstance , ORG found that - notwithstanding the aforementioned deficiencies - the sentence of life imprisonment was commensurate with the applicant 's guilt .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance judgment of an assize court may be challenged by a plea of nullity to ORG on the specific grounds enumerated in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . ORG task is mainly to control the acts of the bench and the presiding judge of the assize court . Its examination includes whether the trial has been conducted in a manner which complies with fundamental procedural principles , whether the right questions have been put and the correct directions given to the jury . ORG may only verify whether the jury has provided unclear , incomplete or contradictory answers to the questions put to it . ORG supervises the correct application of the criminal law , but in so doing is bound by the jury 's findings of fact .", "CARDINAL . In certain cases ORG may reject a plea of nullity without a public hearing ( section CARDINAL ( c ) of LAW ) . In all other cases - such as the present - there will be a public hearing which may also be combined with a public hearing on an appeal against sentence .", "CARDINAL . As regards the hearing on a plea of nullity , section CARDINAL of LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . When the date of the public hearing is being fixed , the accused ... shall be summoned ...", "CARDINAL . If the accused is under arrest , the notice of the hearing given to him shall mention that he may only appear through counsel . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure extends these rules to nullity pleas arising out of jury trials .", "However , if the hearing is a combined one on a plea of nullity and an appeal against sentence , an accused who is present for the latter purpose may also exercise his rights concerning the nullity plea .", "CARDINAL . The sentence as such may be challenged by way of an appeal against sentence . It may concern both points of law ( in particular whether mitigating or aggravating circumstances have been correctly taken into account ) and factors relating to the assessment of the sentence . Where the substance of an appeal is examined , a public hearing must normally be held .", "CARDINAL . As regards the personal appearance of the accused at a public appeal hearing , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of LAW provides :", "\u201c An accused who is detained shall always be summoned and an accused who is detained shall also be brought before the court if he has made a request to this effect in his appeal or counter - statement or otherwise if his personal presence appears necessary in the interests of justice . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
