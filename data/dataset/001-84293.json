NORP The return of the children to GPE without the mother will be difficult for them as it will be damaging .

The court justified the review of the final decisions ordering the return of children to GPE , under LAW , by reference to a risk that their return would expose the children to psychological harm or would otherwise place them in an intolerable situation . It based its assessment on the visits that had been carried out in the place of residence of the children , in DATE and DATE , and on the opinion of the Pozna\u0144 Family Consultation Centre of DATE . The court established that during their DATE stay in GPE the girls had fully assimilated in the country , spoke NORP , and had forgotten their life in GPE .

The bond between the younger B and the applicant was considered by the experts as suppressed .
