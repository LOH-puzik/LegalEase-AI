GPE , DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL in fine and CARDINAL in fine , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINALII ) . The service devised a plan and assigned a number of officers to the operation .", "CARDINAL . According to the findings of the military courts which later examined a set of criminal charges against CARDINAL officers who took part in that operation ( see paragraphs PERSON and DATE below ) , CARDINAL officers were dispatched to the applicant \u2019s address in advance to inspect the surroundings and check whether the applicant was at home . A group of CARDINAL officers was given the task of carrying out the actual arrest . At TIME that group arrived at the applicant \u2019s home in a block of flats in GPE , where they joined the CARDINAL officers previously sent there . The officers had CARDINAL cars . CARDINAL of them was a ORG Transporter minivan that they parked at DATE to QUANTITY from the front entrance of the applicant \u2019s building . Shortly before TIME officers went up to the applicant \u2019s flat , CARDINAL remained in the minivan , and CARDINAL was left at the building \u2019s entrance . The CARDINAL officers who went up rang the applicant \u2019s doorbell . His fourteenyear old daughter answered the door . The applicant showed up at the door moments after that . The officers told him that he was to accompany them to the police station . The applicant went back in , took his passport and a jacket , and followed the officers down . CARDINAL officers escorted the applicant in the lift . The CARDINAL others went inside his flat and remained there until TIME to prevent the persons present in the flat DATE the applicant \u2019s family and CARDINAL neighbours \u2013 to make telephone calls . Downstairs , the CARDINAL officers escorting the applicant were joined by the officer who had remained near the building \u2019s entrance . When the group was QUANTITY from the minivan , CARDINAL of the officers who was inside the vehicle opened its side sliding door . At that point , the applicant abruptly tried to move to the back of the minivan instead of its door . The CARDINAL officers who were escorting him grabbed him by the arms and placed them behind his back . The applicant resisted the ORG attempt to push him into the minivan . CARDINAL officer tripped him and the applicant fell , face down , on the minivan \u2019s floor , his legs remaining outside . The officer inside the minivan tried to pull him in . The minivan set off and , at the same moment , an officer who remained on the street pushed its side sliding door to close it . As the applicant \u2019s feet were still hanging outside , he was hit by the door . The officers inside the minivan kept on trying to close the minivan \u2019s door and handcuff the applicant , who resisted , keeping his arms under his body and trying to get up . The door could not be closed as the applicant \u2019s feet protruded outside . The officers eventually managed to pull the applicant \u2019s legs in and handcuff him . A hood was then placed on his head to blind him , so that he could not see where he was being taken .", "CARDINAL . The applicant denied that he had put up any resistance to his arrest , and asserted that the above findings had been based only on evidence given by the police officers involved . According to him , when he approached the minivan he was hit on the neck and fell inside , where he was handcuffed and hooded .", "CARDINAL . The minivan set off for ORG , a small town QUANTITY east of GPE . It seems that CARDINAL officers were with the applicant in the back of the minivan , and a fourth one was driving it , but it is equally possible that CARDINAL of the officers were in the back and the third one was sitting beside the driver .", "CARDINAL . According to the findings of the military courts , throughout the trip the applicant was lying , undisturbed , on the minivan \u2019s floor , and the officers were sitting around him , monitoring his behaviour . The minivan did not stop en route , and arrived in PERSON at TIME .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , during the trip the officers asked him questions and hit him . The minivan stopped several times en route . The questioning and the beating continued during those stops . The applicant received blows with solid objects to all parts of his body save for his face and genitals . During CARDINAL of the stops CARDINAL of the officers held the applicant \u2019s legs and another pushed the minivan \u2019s sliding door to strike them . The applicant was hit in the ankles . At CARDINAL point , pressure was applied to his eyes . The applicant lost consciousness several times .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , the applicant was taken out of the minivan and into a house used by the police as a \u201c secret base \u201d . According to him , the illtreatment continued there . Objects were inserted under CARDINAL of his nails . Solid objects were placed between his fingers and his hand was squeezed .", "CARDINAL . According to minutes drawn up by the police , the applicant was questioned TIME on DATE by colonel PERSON in relation to suspicions that he had been involved in the assassination of PERSON PERSON .", "CARDINAL . According to the transcription of a tape on which the questioning was secretly recorded by the police ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , colonel PERSON addressed the applicant as follows :", "\u201c Be careful , if you make a mistake , it will be an enormous one . If you want to go [ as a bull ] with his horns forward , that \u2019s your decision . But then we \u2019ll also go forward with our horns . And our horns may turn out to be much sharper than yours ... This is because we took our time to sharpen them so as to make them prick cruelly ... If you want to play the hero \u2013 please , go ahead ... But I would say that TIME is a fateful one for you . It is decisive for you . A life to gain or lose and not only your life ... And this is the reason why this conversation is taking place here and not elsewhere ... Confession and repentance are the only chance for you ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . At some point during the interrogation the applicant made statements in which he confessed that he had taken part in a plot to assassinate PERSON PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant was taken back to PERSON in a police vehicle . He was again hooded . In GPE he was brought before an investigator who charged him with complicity to premeditated murder .", "CARDINAL . Four other persons , including a Mr GPE , who had allegedly ordered Mr PERSON \u2019s assassination , and a Mr PERSON , who had allegedly carried it out by shooting Mr PERSON dead , were arrested and illtreated by the police at DATE and in DATE , and also charged . Both of them also made confessions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon being admitted to the detention facility of ORG , the applicant was examined by PERSON , the facility \u2019s onduty medical doctor , who noted numerous haematomas in the area of his armpits , on his torso under the arms , on his wrists , on his left thigh , on his leg below the knee , and on both of his ankles . She also found open wounds on the applicant \u2019s left wrist and the index finger of his left hand . Her estimation was that all those injuries had been sustained DATE . When interviewed by the authorities in relation to that on DATE , a colleague of PERSON said that such examinations were being carried out routinely on all incoming detainees and did not involve any forensic findings as to the origin of any injuries found on the detainees . Such findings could be made only by forensic medical doctors , and the usual practice was to refer a detainee suspected of having been subjected to physical violence to ORG . When interviewed by the authorities in relation to that on CARDINAL DATE , PERSON said that when examined by her on DATE the applicant had told her that he had been illtreated after his arrest .", "CARDINAL . In spite of his request , the applicant was not allowed to contact a lawyer of his own choosing . An ex officio counsel was appointed to represent him . The counsel allegedly did not heed the applicant \u2019s request to contact his relatives and ask them to arrange for a forensic medical examination .", "CARDINAL . DATE after the applicant \u2019s arrest his mother and wife were allowed to visit him . After their meeting , the applicant \u2019s mother sent letters to ORG , the Minister of ORG , the President , the Prime Minister and the media , describing traces of serious violence which she had seen on the applicant and requesting an adequate reaction by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken , apparently in the face of opposition by the investigator in charge of his case , to ORG for examination . The ORG findings included the following : an injury measuring QUANTITY to the parietal area of the skull ; injuries to both wrists ; a hematoma on the thumbnail of the left hand ; an injury to the fingertip and the nail of the index of the left hand ( with CARDINAL of the nail missing ) ; an injury to the ring finger ; CARDINAL injuries to the front of the left leg under the knee ; CARDINAL injuries to the front of the right leg under the knee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL investigators , assisted by a medical doctor from ORG of ORG and a technical assistant , examined the applicant in the presence of CARDINAL attesting witnesses . They noted the following injuries on him ( all of them in various stages of recovery ) : an injury measuring QUANTITY to the parietal area of the skull ; an injury measuring CARDINAL and CARDINAL by QUANTITY to the inner left elbow ; an injury measuring CARDINAL by QUANTITY to the outer left elbow ; CARDINAL parallel linear injuries QUANTITY long each to the outer left wrist ; a similar injury QUANTITY long to the inner left wrist ; an eightmillimetrelong hematoma under the thumbnail of the left hand ; partially missing nail and swelling of the index of the left hand ; a ninemillimetrelong linear injury between the first and the second phalanges of the ring finger of the left hand ; CARDINAL injuries each measuring CARDINAL or CARDINAL by QUANTITY to the front and inner surfaces of the lower right leg , situated in the area QUANTITY below the knee and QUANTITY above the ankle ; CARDINAL similar injuries to the lower left leg ; and swelling of the left ankle .", "CARDINAL . The applicant remained in pre - trial detention until DATE , when he was released on bail .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s interrogation on DATE in the house in PERSON was secretly recorded . This was apparently done without the applicant \u2019s knowledge and without a judicial warrant . Judicial authorisation to carry out secret recordings in the house in PERSON in relation to the applicant was only given on DATE by the President of ORG , and concerned a tenday period beginning on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A visual examination of a photocopy of the document containing the police request for a judicial warrant and the judge \u2019s decision shows that the request was dated DATE and that , apparently , it was not submitted to the judge before DATE . It can also be seen that the initial proposal by the police was for a period starting on DATE and that the number \u201c CARDINAL \u201d was then written over the number \u201c CARDINAL \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a transcription of the recording was drawn up . According to the applicant , the transcription did not reflect the whole interrogation .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s trial ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the prosecution sought to rely on the recording . On DATE , noting that it had been made surreptitiously and without a valid warrant , ORG refused to admit it in evidence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , DATE and DATE the police allegedly made statements to the media , implying that they had arrested the persons responsible for PERSON PERSON \u2019s assassination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG , replying in ORG to a remark that the police had repeatedly made groundless assertions that they had found Mr PERSON \u2019s assassins , said that since his appointment as Minister he had only once asserted that the assassin had been arrested and that had been DATE when PERSON ( one of the applicant \u2019s coaccused ) had been detained .", "CARDINAL . In DATE after their arrests , the applicant and his CARDINAL coaccused maintained their initial confessions and gave evidence in this sense to the investigators in charge of their case . Later , they changed their position and stated that they had never been involved in a plot to assassinate PERSON and that their confessions had been extracted under torture .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , which started in DATE , ORG admitted in evidence medical certificates and witness evidence concerning the illtreatment to which the applicant had been subjected on CARDINAL or DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found the applicant and his CARDINAL co - accused guilty of Mr PERSON \u2019s assassination , and sentenced all of them to life imprisonment ( without parole for the applicant \u2019s coaccused and with parole for the applicant ) . The court relied heavily on the confessions made by the applicant and CARDINAL of his coaccused .", "CARDINAL . Addressing the argument of the defence that those confessions had been extracted under torture , the court accepted that there existed solid evidence that the police had used serious physical violence and psychological harassment against them immediately after their arrests . The court observed that such acts were unacceptable and called for disciplinary and , if appropriate , criminallaw measures against the officers concerned .", "CARDINAL . However , the court went on to observe that the applicant and his CARDINAL coaccused had maintained their confessions for DATE , and that they had not been ill - treated after DATE . The applicant had maintained his confession in the course of CARDINAL interviews held DATE and DATE in the presence of counsel of his own choosing , retained by him on an unspecified date . The court considered that it could therefore rely on the confessions made during those interviews , which had been conducted by investigators .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the other accused appealed .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia Court of Appeal court heard expert evidence concerning the illtreatment to which the applicant and his CARDINAL coaccused had been subjected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment and acquitted all accused on the charges concerning PERSON PERSON \u2019s assassination .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court analysed the evidence concerning the way in which the applicant had been treated on CARDINAL or DATE , and concluded that he had been subjected to torture in breach of the LAW . The applicant and his coaccused had confessed under illtreatment which had left longlasting marks on their bodies . The pain from the injuries had not subsided for DATE . It was moreover significant that when CARDINAL looked at the medical evidence concerning each of the CARDINAL accused , one could see that the higher the intensity of the torture , the longer the accused concerned had maintained his confession . The applicant , who had suffered the most serious injuries , had been the most consistent in maintaining his confession .", "CARDINAL . The court went on to say that there was evidence of an attempt to delay the proper medical examination of the applicant and his coaccused . During that time , they had been questioned by investigators although their bodies had carried marks of illtreatment . The investigators\u2019 good faith was therefore open to doubt .", "CARDINAL . The court therefore decided that the confessions should not be taken into account and , analysing the remaining evidence , concluded that the charges had not been made out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , hearing the case on an appeal by the prosecution , upheld the acquittal ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. , ORG , ORG \u043d. \u043e. ) . It agreed with the finding that the applicant and his coaccused had been subjected to illtreatment , and held that it could not admit the resulting confessions , which were a \u201c fruit of the poisonous tree \u201d , because that would be in breach of the right to a fair trial . The court went on to say that in a democratic legal system unlawful attempts to extract confessions , as in the case at hand , were in the final analysis harmful to the prosecution \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened a preliminary investigation in relation to the applicant \u2019s alleged ill - treatment . During DATE the military investigation authorities interviewed a number of people and obtained a medical expert report on the applicant \u2019s injuries and the manner in which they had been inflicted .", "CARDINAL . The report , filed on DATE , reviewed the medical findings of the examinations on DATE and CARDINAL and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) . The experts said that the injury to the applicant \u2019s head had been caused by a blow with or against a blunt object . The injuries to his left elbow , his left ring finger and legs below the knees had been caused in a similar way . The lack of detailed findings in relation to them in DATE examination showed that they had either not been present at that point and had occurred later , or that they had not been properly noted . The injuries to the wrists had been caused by handcuffs . The injuries to the nail of the left index finger had been caused by a frontal traumatic impact to the finger . As the injury had been inflicted a long time before the examination which had noted it , its exact cause could not be determined : it could have consisted of a blow to the distal phalange , the insertion of an object under the nail , or the removal of the nail by the application of pressure to its extremity . The hematoma on the left thumbnail had been caused by a blow or by the pressing of the thumb between hard blunt objects . The hematomas noted during the examination on DATE had been caused by blows with hard blunt objects .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the proceedings were stayed because CARDINAL of the officers who had allegedly ill - treated the applicant was abroad on an official mission and could not be interviewed . On DATE , following his return , the proceedings were resumed .", "CARDINAL . DATE the investigator in charge of the case charged CARDINAL officers who had travelled with the applicant in the police minivan which had taken him to the house in GPE with causing him light bodily harm , contrary to LAW ) in conjunction with LAW of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The investigator also obtained an additional medical expert report with a view to clarifying the exact origin of the applicant \u2019s injuries and elucidating the discrepancies in the medical findings made by PERSON on DATE and the findings of the forensic doctors of DATE . However , the report , filed on DATE , was unable to reach more definite conclusions on that point . Nor were the experts able to say \u2013 without being presented with clearer information \u2013 exactly what kind of injuries would be caused by an intensive eighthour beating .", "DATE . On DATE the investigator proposed that the CARDINAL officers be brought to trial . However , on DATE ORG referred the case back for additional investigation . It observed , inter alia , that no information had been gathered about the officers in charge of the applicant between his arrival in PERSON and his return to GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the proceedings were stayed once again , because CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - accused , who had also been taken to the house in GPE , had left the country and could not be interviewed as a witness . They were resumed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator again proposed that the CARDINAL officers be brought to trial . However , on DATE the Sofia Military Prosecutor \u2019s Office once more referred the case back for additional investigation . It observed that the charges did not specify which of the CARDINAL officers had administered which blows to which parts of the applicant \u2019s body .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator again sent the case to ORG , which again referred it back on DATE for additional investigation , saying that the charges did not specify the exact manner in which the officers had caused the applicant \u2019s injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Sofia Military Prosecutor \u2019s Office indicted the CARDINAL officers , but on DATE the ORG referred the case back for additional investigation . On DATE the Sofia Military Prosecutor \u2019s Office again indicted the officers , and DATE the Sofia Military Court again referred the case back . It appears that DATE the case lay dormant with the military prosecuting and investigating authorities .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the Sofia Military Prosecutor \u2019s Office submitted an indictment against the CARDINAL officers to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The trial took place on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . At the outset the applicant made a civil claim against the officers , seeking MONEY , plus interest , in nonpecuniary damages .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG acquitted the officers and rejected the applicant \u2019s civil claim . The court started by setting out its findings of fact ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . It went on to hold that , based on those findings , the ORG actions could not be regarded as a criminal offence because , although causing the applicant bodily harm , they had been justified under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court reproduced in its judgment the applicant \u2019s allegations concerning his ill - treatment inside the minivan and in PERSON , and said that those allegations , if true , meant that the applicant would have had injuries all over his body and would carry horrifying marks of illtreatment . However , the findings of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not revealed such marks and were fully consistent with the version put forward by the CARDINAL accused officers . Dr D.D. had not recorded multiple injuries to the applicant \u2019s head , but CARDINAL injury to the central parietal area . It was implausible to assume that all of the alleged numerous blows to the applicant \u2019s head had been administered to a single spot . There were no recorded injuries to the front or the back of his torso , belly or feet , or injuries to his eyes caused by pressing . It could therefore be accepted that the ORG account as to the amount of force that they had used to restrain the applicant and handcuff him was truthful , and that the use of force has stopped after the applicant had been subdued . The ORG aim had been to arrest the applicant , who they believed had committed a criminal offence , and to bring him before the appropriate authority \u2013 colonel PERSON The officers had also sought to prevent the applicant from alerting his accomplices . In view of his resistance , there had been no other way of carrying out the arrest . The use of force had also been justified under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) because the applicant had failed to heed a lawful order and had put up resistance . The CARDINAL officers had not used disproportionate force . The applicant had been arrested in relation to a very serious offence \u2013 the assassination of a former prime minister \u2013 , had resisted arrest , and had not sustained very serious injuries . The use of force had stopped immediately after he had been subdued . Since the ORG actions had not constituted an offence and had amounted to a lawful use of force , the applicant \u2019s civil claim was to be rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution appealed against the acquittal to ORG . The applicant also appealed against the acquittal and the rejection of his civil claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG of Appeal heard the appeal on DATE . It drew the ORG attention to the fact that the limitation period for prosecuting them on the charges against them DATE had expired on DATE . The court went on to say that the proceedings could continue only if the officers were to waive the statute of limitations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . All CARDINAL of them stated that they wished to have the charges against them determined despite the expiry of the limitation period . The court then heard the parties\u2019 arguments and announced that it would hand down its judgment in due course .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE the court found that it could not decide the case without rehearing the applicant and colonel PERSON , and called them to testify . At the next hearing , held on CARDINAL DATE , counsel for CARDINAL of the police officers requested CARDINAL of the judges to withdraw from the case . She argued that he had shown bias against her client . The court said that it did not find any grounds for that but that it would accede to her request to avoid any suspicions of partiality . As a result , the appellate proceedings had to start anew , as required under the principle of immediacy . On DATE the court , sitting in a new formation , decided to rehear the applicant ; this time , however , it did not mention colonel PERSON", "CARDINAL . When appearing in court on CARDINAL DATE , colonel PERSON apparently again asserted in front of journalists that the applicant and his co - accused had assassinated PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The new formation heard the appeal on DATE . It likewise drew the ORG attention to the fact that the limitation period for prosecuting them had expired , and the officers reiterated that they agreed to waive the statute of limitations . The court then heard the applicant as a witness , and admitted in evidence the judgments of ORG and ORG in the criminal proceedings against the applicant ( see paragraphs PERSON above ) . It turned down a request by the ORG defence to recall colonel PERSON and several other witnesses to the stand , finding that this would be superfluous .", "CARDINAL . At the next hearing , held on DATE , the court turned down a request by counsel for CARDINAL of the officers for a fresh medical expert report , observing that the medical evidence that had already been adduced DATE which included the results of the medical examinations of the applicant on DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs DATE \u2013 was sufficient . The court reheard the officers and the parties\u2019 oral arguments .", "CARDINAL .

It fully agreed with the lower court \u2019s findings of fact , saying that they were based on a proper analysis of the statements of the CARDINAL accused , the evidence given by the applicant , the medical expert report obtained in the course of the proceedings , and the notes made by PERSON when she had examined the applicant on DATE . The court went on to say that the indictment did not contain factual allegations in respect of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL officers , who was therefore to be acquitted on the basis that he had not used any force in respect of the applicant . The court did not agree with the lower court that LAW was applicable , holding that this provision referred exclusively to the arrest of offenders who have been convicted by means of a final decision , which was not the case of the applicant . However , it went on to say that the ORG actions were not criminal because they had constituted a lawful and proportionate use of force within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant had failed to heed a lawful order and had resisted the ORG efforts to put him into the minivan and to handcuff him inside the minivan . The officers had stopped using force immediately after handcuffing the applicant . Lastly , the court noted that during the preliminary investigation the applicant had given evidence that he had been subjected to violence in the house in GPE , where the CARDINAL officers had left him . That showed that not all injuries later found on the applicant had been caused by them .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the prosecution sought the reopening of the criminal proceedings against the applicant on the ground that the acquittal of the officers was a new relevant fact showing that the applicant had not been illtreated .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE CARDINAL of them , Mr PERSON , brought a claim under LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) against ORG , seeking MONEY in non - pecuniary damages .", "DATE . On DATE the ORG rejected the claim . It held that although the claimant had proved that he had been illtreated on DATE , he had not been able to prove who exactly had ill - treated him and under what circumstances . The facts alleged in his statement of claim did not match the evidence given by a witness called by him ( the other coaccused ) , and that evidence did not match the evidence given by the applicant , who had also been called to testify . Moreover , the first witness had not pointed to the specific individuals who had carried out the beating , whereas torts under section CARDINAL of LAW had to be attributed to a specified individual .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s co - accused appealed .

Following the ORG \u2019s judgment in that case , on DATE the Government laid before ORG a bill for the amendment of the Special Surveillance Means Act CARDINAL . The explanatory notes to the bill referred to the ORG \u2019s judgment and to the need to bring the LAW into line with the requirements of the LAW . The bill was enacted on DATE and came into force on DATE . Along with a host of other changes , the amendment created a ORG , an independent body whose CARDINAL members were to be elected by ORG and whose task was to oversee the use of special means of surveillance and the storing and destruction of material obtained through such means , and to protect individuals against the unlawful use of such means ( new sections NORP ) , ORG and DATE ) . The ORG was to be a permanently acting body having its own administration ( new section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) ) .

The ORG was to submit to ORG an DATE report setting out aggregated data on the matters that it was overseeing ( new section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) ) . It was also to inform of its own motion persons who had been unlawfully subjected to surveillance , unless notification could jeopardise the purpose of the surveillance ( section MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before the ORG could start operating , ORG enacted further amendments to LAW , abolishing the ORG and replacing it with a special parliamentary commission , which has the same powers and duties , save for the power to give mandatory instructions ( point ( d ) in the above paragraph ) ; it may only make suggestions for improvements ( section CARDINAL g , as amended in DATE ) . The amendments came into force on DATE . Under related amendments to ORG \u2019s standing rules , which came into force on DATE , that commission is in effect a permanent subcommission of ORG \u2019s legal affairs commission ( new rule CARDINAL ) ) .

The commission has thus far submitted CARDINAL DATE reports : the first was submitted in DATE and accepted by ORG on DATE , the second was submitted in DATE and accepted by ORG on CARDINAL DATE , and the third was submitted on DATE and has yet to be accepted by ORG . In that latest report the commission said , inter alia , that it had received a number of complaints from individuals , and had taken measures to examine them . It had carried out inspections in CARDINAL towns , and had noted many irregularities , such as insufficiently reasoned applications for judicial authorisation of secret surveillance , failures to destroy material obtained through such surveillance within the statutory timelimits , and failures to report back to the court which had authorised surveillance . The commission went on to say that the lack of proper recordkeeping made it difficult to oversee the operation of the system as a whole . It also noted the very low percentage of refused applications for judicial authorisation of secret surveillance . The total number of requests in DATE had been CARDINAL . CARDINAL had been refused , chiefly on purely technical grounds . CARDINAL persons had been subjected to surveillance . CARDINAL requests had yielded material subsequently used in criminal trials . The analysis of the available data showed that the authorities were not using secret surveillance as a means of last resort , but routinely , mainly because it was an almost effortless way of gathering evidence . It was therefore necessary to tighten up the relevant regulations and to strengthen judicial control . The commission made a number of specific proposals in that respect .", "CARDINAL .
