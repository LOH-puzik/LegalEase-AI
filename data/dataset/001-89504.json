The applicants were born in DATE and currently live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants paid PERSON and PERSON ORG the purchase price of a house located at NORP street in GPE and moved into it . Instead of registering the transaction in accordance with the applicable law , however , the applicants had the nominal house owners issue an authorization to Mr B. , to whom the first applicant owed a debt , allowing him to perform any transactions relating to the house . As a result of the first applicant defaulting on his debt , in DATE Mr B. signed this house over as a gift to his daughter , although the applicants continued to live in it .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr B. instituted civil proceedings against the applicants seeking repayment of the debt and various compensatory payments . The applicants lodged a counterclaim , seeking to confirm the validity of their unregistered purchase of the house . By the final decision of CARDINAL DATE the claims of both parties were dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicants also lodged numerous complaints with law enforcement authorities alleging that they had been deprived of their house and money by gang members and that their lives were in danger on account of threats from Mr B. In support of their allegations , the applicants submitted tapes of their telephone conversations with Mr B. , in which he had referred to his organized crime connections .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were instituted , in which Mr A.Kh . , the first applicant \u2019s cousin and a member of the applicants\u2019 household , born in DATE , acted as CARDINAL of the witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 family was provided with police bodyguards to secure their safety in connection with these proceedings . On DATE the measure was lifted with reference to the first applicant \u2019s inappropriate behaviour towards the guards . By the final decision of DATE ORG upheld the earlier decisions finding the lifting of the measure lawful . The applicants subsequently made unsuccessful attempts to have the matter reopened .", "CARDINAL . Mr B. was eventually tried , but acquitted of extortion , as the applicants\u2019 tapes were not admitted as permissible evidence . However the applicants insisted on bringing various other criminal actions against him , some of which appear to be currently pending .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicants informed LOC that they had found Mr A.Kh . dead in his bed in the annex to their house at NORP street .", "CARDINAL . On DATE several police officers and medical experts in presence of lay witnesses broke into the annex which was purportedly locked from the inside . A decomposing corpse was found in the bed on its back , with the head on the pillow . The group recorded no traces of a struggle or other evidence suggesting homicide . Pictures of the site were taken ; however , they could not be developed on account of a defect in the film . The body was taken to the mortuary . However , as DATE was a national holiday , the autopsy was not carried out until DATE . According to the applicants , no precautions were taken to prevent decomposition of the body in the mortuary .", "CARDINAL . Following the autopsy of CARDINAL DATE , the experts found it impossible to establish the cause of the death as the body had significantly decomposed . They further noted that no broken bones or other visible injuries could be found on the body . Finally , they suggested that the death , which must have occurred on or around DATE , was likely to have been caused by atherosclerosis of brain and heart vessels .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police decided not to institute a criminal investigation in relation to the death having found no appearance of a homicide .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed maintaining that Mr A.Kh . could have been killed DATE by a gang in which PERSON was involved or by other members of organized crime groups who feared him as an important witness in criminal proceedings , in which the applicants were the aggrieved parties . They noted , in particular , that they had found rubber gloves and a hammer of an unknown origin on the table in his room , which could have been used to murder Mr A.Kh . Furthermore , Mr A.Kh . \u2019s height according to his records had been QUANTITY , while the height of the autopsied corpse was recorded as being QUANTITY . Finally , Mr A.Kh . had no record of atherosclerosis or any other life - threatening illness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG remitted the case for additional investigation . It found , in particular , that in light of the second applicant \u2019s report about having seeing Mr A.Kh . alive on TIME DATE , it was strange that his body had decomposed so rapidly . It further noted that a photographic record of the site had not been prepared , the deceased \u2019s medical record had not been checked and the applicants\u2019 assertion that he could have been killed by individuals involved in organized crime had not been investigated .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently on numerous occasions ( DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE ) the law enforcement authorities refused to initiate criminal proceedings having found no evidence of a homicide . All of these decisions were subsequently annulled by the ORG office ( on DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL October DATE ) as having been based on only superficial inquiries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Zhovtnevyy District ORG refused to initiate criminal proceedings . Following additional questioning , it found , in particular , that the difference in height could have been due to a clerical error by mortuary personnel . As regards the gloves and the hammer , although certain witnesses had recalled seeing them , these objects were no longer available and it was not possible to determine their origin . Furthermore , although no mention of atherosclerosis or any other life - threatening illness had been found in Mr A.Kh \u2019s medical records , regard being had to the fact that the annex had been locked from inside , no traces of any struggle or disorder had been noticed in the room and no injuries had been found on the body , there was no reason to suspect a homicide .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG annulled this decision and remitted the case for additional investigation . It referred to several omissions in the preliminary inquiries , such as the failure to measure the body at the site , failure to establish a probable cause of death against the absence of any record concerning atherosclerosis and the superficial examination of the door to the annex . In particular , the results of the investigation stated that the door could only be locked from the inside , while , according to a photographic record of the scene , the door had both a lock and a padlock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the law enforcement authorities refused to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the General Prosecutors\u2019 Office annulled this decision , having found that the\u2019 Office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings having found no evidence of a homicide . It noted , in particular , that due to the lapse of time witnesses could not accurately recall certain details . On the other hand , the witnesses clearly recalled having seen no traces of a struggle or other signs of a homicide . Mr B. , implicated by the applicants as being involved in the murder , could not be interviewed as he had moved abroad . His son - in - law denied any family involvement in Mr A.Kh . \u2019s death . The discrepancy in the records concerning Mr A.Kh . \u2019s height appeared to be due to a typographical error by the mortuary registrar . The gloves on the table had been left by CARDINAL of the medical experts . As regards the hammer , the first applicant had mentioned having taken it together with the gloves and Mr A.Kh . \u2019s linen , but its existence was doubtful as he had refused to surrender these objects without explanation . The investigation further found that the applicants\u2019 hypothesis that Mr A.Kh . had been killed late on DATE was improbable , in particular , as the case file records contained a certificate from Mr A.Kh . \u2019s employer that he had undergone a medical test on TIME of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant offered the family \u2019s other house , located at V. street in GPE , as collateral for a bank loan of CARDINAL hryvnyas ( ORG ) . In DATE the house at V. street was sold in default at a public auction to PERSON PERSON In DATE Mr PERSON leased it out to PERSON PERSON , who moved in with his family .", "CARDINAL . The applicants unsuccessfully attempted to secure the criminal conviction of the individuals implicated in the sale and instituted civil proceedings , claiming back the house . As appears from scarce documents presented by the applicants , these proceedings are currently still pending .", "CARDINAL . Pending examination of their proceedings for annulment of the sale , on DATE the applicants broke the lock on the door and entered the house with their CARDINAL acquaintances PERSON Ch . , PERSON and Mr ORG They refused to leave the house at the tenants\u2019 request . An argument and a fight between the tenants and the applicants broke out . The police were allegedly called , but the applicants explained that they were the owners of the house and the police left . TIME Mrs Ch . and PERSON left , while the applicants and PERSON ORG remained for the night .", "CARDINAL . At QUANTITY on DATE the tenants called the police again , complaining about the applicants\u2019 and PERSON ORG \u2019s obnoxious behaviour : smoking inside the house , putting pressure on them to leave , threatening them and swearing at them . Several police officers from the special detachment responsible for keeping order in courts entered the premises and ordered the applicants and PERSON GPE to follow them out of the house . The applicants and PERSON ORG protested . The first applicant and PERSON ORG were eventually restrained and handcuffed and the group was brought to the police station . According to the police records , the applicants stayed in the police station from CARDINAL a.m. to CARDINAL p.m. pending the drawing up of a report about an administrative offence . According to the applicants , they stayed in the police station for TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE first applicant and PERSON PERSON stood trial before ORG accused of \u201c malicious resistance to the lawful demands of law - enforcement officers \u201d ( an administrative offence ) . They were accused , in particular , of grabbing the officers by their uniforms , pushing them , threatening and swearing at them in response to their demands to cease disorderly conduct . The court discontinued the administrative proceedings having found that the GPE conduct at the house warranted a criminal investigation on account of the possible trespass of the dwelling . The case was remitted to LOC . Subsequently ( on DATE ) ORG decided not to press charges in relation to the trespass . They found that the GPE actions could potentially qualify as infliction of minor bodily injuries on PERSON PERSON and vigilantism , which could be prosecuted privately by the aggrieved party .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , following the first applicant \u2019s medical examination of CARDINAL October CARDINAL , he was certified as having sustained light bodily injuries ( several bruises and a scratch on a finger ) , which could have been inflicted on or around DATE . On DATE the second applicant was certified as having sustained in the same period light bodily injuries resulting in short - term health problems ( cerebral concussion , for which she had undergone out - patient treatment ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers for assault and battery , infliction of bodily injuries , disorder , racketeering , abuse of office and premeditated unlawful apprehension and detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE their requests were rejected following preliminary inquiries and the interviews of the parties involved for lack of any evidence suggesting criminal conduct on the ORG behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remitted the case for additional investigation . The court found , in particular , that the investigation had only established that the applicants were apprehended for good cause ,", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused to initiate criminal proceedings . It found , in particular , that the cerebral concussion as well as other injuries had been sustained in the course of the fight with the tenants on DATE and that the force used by the police officers to restrain and arrest the applicants had not been disproportionate . The investigation referred , primarily , to the testimonies of the police officers and other parties involved . In particular , the applicants testified that they had been battered by the tenants on DATE ; the tenants complained that they had been forced to defend themselves against the applicants , who had beaten them ; PERSON . and PERSON reported having seeing PERSON PERSON \u2019s wife beating the second applicant with a slipper on the head and banging her head against the wall . Several other witnesses reported having seen the police officers taking the first applicant and PERSON GPE handcuffed out of the house , while the latter were resisting and swearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld this decision following contested proceedings . On DATE the ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 appeal .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lent ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to PERSON ORG and NORP , who were leaders of local NGOs . They had requested the loan allegedly for the arrangement of transportation of humanitarian aid ( clothes and shoes ) donated by a GPE .- based foundation , although according to relevant documentation the donor was responsible for all transportation costs . Subsequently the first applicant was repaid CARDINAL of the loan and given QUANTITY of goods from the humanitarian aid cargo , which he stored in the house at D. Street and subsequently surrendered to the police .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants lodged various criminal complaints about having been allegedly defrauded by PERSON ORG and NORP , who had never repaid the sum loaned to them for the transportation of humanitarian aid . Eventually , on DATE the Dnipropetrovsk Prosecutor instituted a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the transportation and distribution of the cargo . The alleged perpetrators were questioned in these proceedings as witnesses .", "CARDINAL .

DATE and DATE the investigative authorities interviewed numerous recipients of the aid and officials involved in its distribution ; ordered several financial expert assessments , commissioned the collection of information from the GPE donor organization and examined several volumes of documents concerning the distribution of the aid .", "CARDINAL . Messrs ORG and NORP acknowledged having received the money from the first applicant . However , they alleged that a portion of it had been repaid in cash . The remaining amount was , in their opinion , the price paid by the first applicant for purchasing part of the cargo . The first applicant intended to sell it for profit , in spite of the fact that he had been aware of the statutory ban on selling humanitarian aid and about the official undertaking of the GPE donor to pay all transportation costs . The applicant had received his part of the cargo in DATE , so PERSON ORG and NORP had discharged their civil obligation in his respect .", "CARDINAL .
