The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He is a doctor with substantial experience , having been a general practitioner for DATE . In this capacity , he currently has his own private practice , with CARDINAL employees . He also teaches at ORG and has authored several works in the field of general medicine .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant graduated from law school ; DATE , he registered to become a lawyer , after having passed the annual entrance examination organised by ORG . On DATE ORG issued a decision validating the results of the examination and declaring that the applicant was admitted to the Bar .", "CARDINAL . The Bucharest Bar further decided on DATE to register the applicant as a trainee lawyer ( avocat stagiar ) as of DATE . A DATE traineeship period being an obligatory condition for obtaining a licence to practise as a lawyer , the applicant signed a traineeship agreement ( contract de colaborare ) with the ORG private law firm . On DATE the Bar approved the applicant \u2019s traineeship within the firm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request to the PERSON of ORG to be allowed to pursue his DATE traineeship ( stagiu ) in compliance with section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL regulating the legal profession , notwithstanding the fact that he simultaneously had his own private medical practice . He considered that \u201c the medical profession was not incompatible with the dignity of the legal profession or the lawyers\u2019 rules of conduct within the meaning of Rule CARDINAL of the Rules governing the Legal Profession \u201d .", "On DATE , applying section CARDINAL ( b ) and section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( e ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request . In its decision the Bar held :", "\u201c the applicant \u2019s request to practise simultaneously as a lawyer and as a doctor is dismissed , and the applicant must consequently opt for CARDINAL of the CARDINAL professions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant contested that decision before ORG . He challenged the reason for the dismissal of his request , which , citing section CARDINAL ( b ) , referred to ineligibility to practise as a lawyer for anyone who already pursued a \u201c profession that infringes the dignity and the independence of the legal profession or is contrary to good morals \u201d . He contended that his professional CV , including a Ph.D. in medicine , a career of teaching at the university and the authorship of several books on medicine , could on no account infringe the dignity of the legal profession . At the same time , he pointed to the fact that he was neither an employee nor a trader , as proscribed by the legislation regulating the activities of lawyers .", "On DATE ORG upheld the GPE decision , this time on the basis of LAW no . CARDINAL , which enumerated \u201c exhaustively \u201d the professions that were compatible with the profession of lawyer ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . As the practice of medicine was not specified among those professions , the applicant \u2019s request was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was contested before ORG .", "In its reply to the applicant \u2019s submissions , the respondent argued , firstly , that the combined interpretation of sections DATE and CARDINAL of the PERSON led to the conclusion that no other profession could be practised in parallel with that of a lawyer , except for those restrictively enumerated under section CARDINAL ; furthermore , the practice of CARDINAL liberal professions at the same time was not permitted by the law , nor was it desirable , in view of the fact that each liberal profession required PERCENT dedication on the part of the person practising it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court allowed the applicant \u2019s claims , holding that section CARDINAL ( b ) was not applicable , in so far as \u201c the profession of doctor does not impinge on the independence of the profession of lawyer \u201d . The court further held that any restriction on practising a profession must be expressly and unequivocally prescribed by law , which was not the case in this instance . Moreover , LAW protected the right to work , which could not be subject to any limitations , with a few exceptions expressly enumerated in section CARDINAL , such as national security reasons , protection of public order , health and public morals or protection of individual rights and freedoms , none of which was applicable in the applicant \u2019s case .", "Furthermore , the prohibition on practising as a lawyer while also practising as a doctor was not included in the text of section CARDINAL ( b ) of Law no . CARDINAL , which referred only to professions that infringed the dignity and the independence of the legal profession or were contra bonos mores .", "The court further held that LAW did not contain an exhaustive list of the professions compatible with the profession of lawyer , in spite of ORG interpretation of that provision to the effect that if the medical profession was not included in the text among the compatible professions , this meant , by converse implication , that it was not compatible with the profession of lawyer . The incompatible professions were enumerated exhaustively in section DATE , and the profession of doctor was not among them .", "The assertion that practising a liberal profession required total dedication and implicitly a lot of time on the part of the practitioner could not be taken into consideration for the assessment of the lawfulness of the decisions taken by the local and national Bars ; not having enough time to devote to clients\u2019 cases had nothing to do with the independence of the legal profession . The court thus confirmed the applicant \u2019s right to practise both professions simultaneously , annulling the Bars\u2019 decisions .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed against that judgment to ORG and ORG . It argued that while section CARDINAL of the PERSON listed the professions that were incompatible with the profession of lawyer in a generic manner , giving examples , LAW regulated , strictly and restrictively , the exceptions that were allowed , among which the profession of doctor was not mentioned . At the same time , the simultaneous practice of both professions infringed the principle of the independence of lawyers . In wanting to practise both professions , the applicant demonstrated only his extreme mercantilism , as he \u201c minimised the importance of these professions , treating them as mere sources of income \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal and dismissed the applicant \u2019s request , holding that the combined interpretation of sections CARDINAL and DATE led to the conclusion that the list of compatible situations was exhaustive and thus section CARDINAL referred to the only professions that by law were compatible with that of a lawyer ; ORG pointed out that even if the provisions of LAW , relied on by the applicant in his defence , also enumerated other situations of incompatibility and compatibility , they were of inferior rank to a law and therefore they could not contradict those of the law itself .", "The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The right to work shall not be restricted .
