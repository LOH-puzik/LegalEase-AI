The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of rape and abduction and of CARDINAL count of attempted rape and deprivation of liberty committed in DATE . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and ordered his placement in preventive detention pursuant to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The court found that the applicant , acting with full criminal responsibility , had raped CARDINAL young women and had attempted to rape another woman all of whom he had taken with him in his car . It further noted that the applicant had previously been convicted by juvenile courts of attempted rape and of rape ; in respect of the second offence he had been placed in a psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his full prison sentence in FAC . He was then placed in preventive detention , executed in that same prison , for the first time on DATE ; he had thus served DATE in preventive detention by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The continuation of the applicant 's preventive detention was ordered by ORG on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in judicial review proceedings under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , refused to suspend the applicant 's preventive detention and grant probation .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant 's continued preventive detention was necessary because there was still a risk that the applicant , owing to his criminal tendencies , might commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims if released ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph DATE below ) . Since the court 's last order of DATE , to the reasoning of which it referred , no circumstances leading to a more positive conclusion had become known .", "CARDINAL . ORG had consulted a psychological expert on the question whether there was a risk that the applicant , if released , might commit offences by which his victims would suffer serious physical or mental harm . However , the expert could only submit a view on the basis of the case file as the applicant had refused to talk to her .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that in his report of CARDINAL DATE a neurologic expert had found that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder which had resulted in his acts of sexual aggression . ORG acknowledged that the applicant had accepted social - therapeutic treatment from DATE until DATE . However , he had then terminated that treatment . In DATE the detention authorities had proposed certain relaxations in the conditions of the applicant 's detention , but the applicant had refused to cooperate . In his report of CARDINAL DATE the neurologic expert had found that the applicant still suffered from the said personality disorder . In DATE the applicant had refused any therapy . Therefore , there was nothing to indicate that the applicant was no longer dangerous . In any event , his release could only be taken into consideration after his conditions of detention had been relaxed , combined with a successful social - therapeutic treatment .", "CARDINAL . ORG further stated that it did not consider the new version of Article DATE of LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to breach constitutional law in so far as it applied also to persons convicted prior to that change in the law .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE , ORG , fully endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant 's appeal . In particular , contrary to the applicant 's submission , it considered that Article PERSON of LAW , read in conjunction with LAW to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which entered into force on DATE , were constitutional . The prohibition on retrospective punishment did not apply to orders of preventive detention , which did not constitute a penalty , but a measure of correction and prevention . In view of the fact that there was a risk that the applicant , if released , might commit sexual offences similar to those he had previously committed , his continued detention was not yet disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against the decisions ordering his continued preventive detention even on completion of the tenyear period . He argued that these decisions were based on Article CARDINAL of LAW , as amended in DATE , under the terms of which the duration of a convicted person 's first period of preventive detention was extended retrospectively from a maximum period of DATE , applicable prior to the change in the law , to an unlimited period of time . Therefore , this provision violated the prohibition on retrospective punishment under LAW , the prohibition of retrospective legislation enshrined in the rule of law , his right to liberty under LAW , second sentence , of LAW and the principle of proportionality ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) as it was ill - founded . Referring to its leading decision given on DATE in relation to the case of PERSON ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; application no . CARDINAL before this Court ) , it found that Article CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with LAW to LAW , as amended on DATE , were constitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having consulted a psychiatric expert , PERSON , again refused to suspend the applicant 's preventive detention and grant probation under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . ORG endorsed ORG view that there was still a risk that the applicant , if released , might commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims .", "CARDINAL . ORG had regard to the report of DATE by psychiatric expert PERSON , who , having examined the applicant and the case file , had considered the applicant liable to reoffend . According to the expert , the applicant still suffered from a personality disorder which had , in the past , manifested itself by violent sexualised behaviour .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed that the expert 's negative prognosis was based on a limited factual basis in respect of the applicant 's personal development after his offences . The expert had only found that the applicant 's personality disorder had not been cured by therapy , without assessing whether this disorder would still manifest itself in similar offences in the future . It was for the prison authorities and the regional courts to extend the basis for a prognosis by therapeutic measures and by granting relaxations in the conditions of detention . However , such therapeutic measures had not been taken in the applicant 's case in DATE , even though an expert had already made specific proposals for such measures in DATE and again in DATE . The applicant had refused a dialogue with the prison authorities on his therapy , but it was for the prison authorities to make reasonable offers of treatment and to grant relaxations in the conditions of the applicant 's detention , which it had failed to do . However , without testing and preparing the applicant for release in the course of relaxations in his conditions of detention , there was a risk that he would commit serious sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He argued that his continued preventive detention violated his right to liberty , the prohibition of retrospective punishment , the prohibition of double punishment for the same offence and the prohibition of inhuman treatment . He argued , in particular , that by the further execution of preventive detention against him , he had been treated as a mere object of ORG action in disregard of his human dignity . Moreover , his right to a fair trial had been breached , in particular in that the criminal courts had failed to decide on his continued preventive detention within the statutory time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It found that the applicant 's complaint was inadmissible for non - exhaustion of domestic remedies in so far as he had complained about ORG failure to decide on his continued preventive detention already in DATE , as prescribed by LAW \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant had failed to apply for judicial review of this failure to comply with the statutory time - limit .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant had complained about his continued preventive detention for a period exceeding ten years , his complaint was ill - founded . His continued preventive detention on the basis of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , as amended in DATE , was constitutional . The criminal courts had further respected the principle of proportionality in respect of deprivations of liberty in their decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , reviewing the necessity of the applicant 's continued detention , decided that the applicant was to remain in preventive detention as , owing to his criminal tendencies , he was still liable to commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that decision and remitted the case to ORG . It found that ORG had not sufficiently established the facts on which it had based its decision and had failed to hear the medical expert , who had submitted a report in writing on its request , also in person at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request of CARDINAL DATE that ORG , by way of an interim injunction , request ORG to order the applicant 's immediate release and declare whether the ORG 's findings in its judgment in the case of PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , were applicable to other detainees ( file no . CARDINAL BvQ CARDINAL ) . It found that the applicant had failed to explain why he could not be expected to await the decisions to be taken by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences on his further detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again decided not to suspend the applicant 's preventive detention and grant probation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant 's preventive detention terminated and ordered his supervision of conduct . ORG , referring to a leading decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , argued that it was possible to interpret LAW so as to comply with the LAW as interpreted by this ORG in the case of PERSON GPE . Accordingly , it found that in relation to preventive detention the application of a new statutory provision retrospectively to the detriment of the person concerned was prohibited and the law in force at the time of the offence had to be applied . As Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version in force at the time the applicant committed his offences , provided that the first period of preventive detention could not exceed DATE , the applicant 's preventive detention was terminated and the applicant was to be released .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the applicant had no claim for damages under LAW ( Gesetz \u00fcber die Entsch\u00e4digung f\u00fcr Strafverfolgungs - ma\u00dfnahmen ) . A claim for damages under LAW or official liability proceedings had to be brought in the civil courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE and has been submitted to constant surveillance by QUANTITY police officers since then .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . The provisions relevant to the present case can be summarised as follows :", "CARDINAL . The German Criminal Code distinguishes between penalties ( GPE ) and socalled measures of correction and prevention ( Ma\u00dfregeln der Besserung und GPE ) to deal with unlawful acts . Preventive detention ( LAW seq . of LAW ) is classified as a measure of correction and prevention . The purpose of such measures is to rehabilitate dangerous offenders or to protect the public from them . They may be ordered for offenders in addition to their punishment ( compare Articles CARDINAL et seq . ) . They must , however , be proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed by , or to be expected from , the defendants as well as to their dangerousness ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The temporal applicability of provisions of the Criminal Code depends on whether they relate to penalties or measures of correction and prevention . The penalty is determined by the law which is in force at the time of the act ( LAW ) ; if the law in force on completion of the act is amended before the court 's judgment , the more lenient law applies ( LAW ) . On the other hand , decisions on measures of correction and prevention are to be based on the law in force at the time of the decision unless the law provides otherwise ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender 's conviction , order his preventive detention under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to DATE imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALc of the Criminal Code governs orders for the preventive detention of convicted persons which are not executed immediately after the judgment ordering them becomes final . Paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention , the court responsible for the execution of sentences ( that is , a special ORG composed of CARDINAL professional judges , see sections ORG and CARDINAL ) of LAW ) must review , before completion of the prison term , whether the person 's preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective . If that is not the case , it suspends on probation the execution of the preventive detention order ; supervision of the person 's conduct ( GPE ) commences with suspension .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW the court ( i.e. the chamber responsible for the execution of sentences ) may review at any time whether the further execution of the preventive detention order should be suspended on probation . It is obliged to do so within fixed time - limits ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) . For persons in preventive detention , this timelimit is DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version in force prior to DATE , the first period of preventive detention may not exceed DATE . If the maximum duration has expired , the detainee shall be released ( Article QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW was amended by the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other LAW of DATE , which entered into force on DATE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , in its amended version , provides that if a person has spent DATE in preventive detention , the court shall declare the measure terminated ( only ) if there is no danger that the detainee will , owing to his criminal tendencies , commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims . Termination shall automatically entail supervision of the conduct of the offender . The former maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention was abolished . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to LAW , the amended version of Article CARDINAL of LAW was to be applied without any restriction ratione temporis .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( file no . CARDINAL StR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG ( fourth senate ) , in a decision concerning a retrospective order of preventive detention ( nachtr\u00e4gliche GPE ) , found that LAW was to be and could be interpreted so as to comply with LAW as interpreted by ORG in its judgment in GPE , no . CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , decisions on measures of correction and prevention were to be based on the law in force at the time of the court 's decision unless the law provided otherwise . LAW , in its interpretation by this ORG , was such a law which provided otherwise as the ORG had considered that preventive detention was to be qualified as a penalty for the purposes of LAW to which the prohibition of retrospective punishment applied ( the fifth senate of ORG , in its decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL StR CARDINAL , disagreed with the fourth senate on that point in relation to a different provision on retrospective preventive detention ) . Therefore , court decisions concerning orders of preventive detention had to be based on the law in force at the time of the offence .", "CARDINAL . Referring , in particular , to these findings of ORG , several ORG found in cases comparable , as regards the temporal course of events , to the LAW v. GPE case that the abolition of the maximum period of DATE laid down in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW in its version in force before DATE could not be effected retrospectively and therefore still applied to preventive detention ordered in relation to offences committed prior to that date . As a consequence , these courts declared terminated the preventive detention of the detainees concerned whose first period of preventive detention had been executed beyond that maximum period and ordered their release ( see , in particular , GPE am ORG , decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ORG , decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ORG , decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; and ORG , decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL Ws DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On the contrary , several ORG considered that the ORG 's findings in the case of PERSON GPE could not be applied at present by the domestic courts responsible for the execution of sentences as LAW as it stood did not permit its interpretation in compliance with LAW Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to LAW had expressly stipulated that the abolition of the maximum duration of DATE for a first period of preventive detention also applied to persons who had committed the offences in question prior to the entry into force of that abolition and had thereby unambiguously authorized the application of the amended law with retrospective effect . It was therefore for the legislator to execute the ORG 's judgment in the PERSON case . ORG accordingly did not terminate the preventive detention of the persons concerned ( see , in particular , ORG , decision of CARDINAL DATE , file no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ORG , decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ORG , decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; ORG , decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; and ORG , decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL Ws CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Several of ORG subsequently submitted such cases to ORG for a preliminary ruling under a new provision of LAW ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL ) in force since DATE , which is aimed at securing a uniform case - law of the NORP courts on that issue ( see , for instance , ORG , decision of DATE , file no . CARDINAL Ws DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "7"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "7-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
