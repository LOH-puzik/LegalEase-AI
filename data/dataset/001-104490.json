GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Art. 5-1;Violation of Art. 7-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Dean Spielmann;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . When lodging his application , he was detained in FAC . He has been released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has been convicted of CARDINAL counts of rape and CARDINAL counts of attempted rape of women aged DATE and has been sentenced CARDINAL times to terms of imprisonment . Between DATE and his arrest in DATE he spent CARDINAL outside prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of attempted sexual coercion . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and ordered his placement in preventive detention pursuant to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . ORG found that in DATE the applicant , returning to methods similar to those he had used to commit some of his previous offences , had simulated a breakdown of his car and had asked a DATE woman to help him restart it . He had then attempted to force his victim to submit herself to sexual acts , but she had managed to escape . The preventive detention of the applicant , who had acted with full criminal responsibility , was necessary as he had a tendency to commit serious sexual offences in order to humiliate and abuse women and was thus likely to reoffend .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his full prison sentence . He was then placed in preventive detention , for the first time , on DATE ; he had thus served DATE in preventive detention by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The continuation of the applicant 's preventive detention was ordered by ORG at regular intervals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a chamber responsible for the execution of sentences , having heard the applicant , his counsel and a psychiatric expert , PERSON , in person , ordered the applicant 's preventive detention to continue pursuant to Article CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It found that there was still a risk that the applicant , owing to his criminal tendencies , might commit serious sexual offences if released resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims .", "CARDINAL . ORG subscribed to the opinion given by expert PERSON in his report of DATE . The expert , who had to give his view on the basis of the case file as the applicant had refused to make any submissions to him , had concluded that there was nothing to indicate that the applicant , who had committed numerous sexual offences and suffered from a personality disorder , had changed . He was therefore likely to reoffend if released .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that neither the applicant 's personal situation nor his attitude had changed since its last decision . As had also been confirmed by expert PERSON , without submitting himself to a therapeutic treatment , notably to a social therapy , which the applicant kept refusing to do , the conditions for suspending the applicant 's preventive detention on probation could not be met .", "CARDINAL . Contrary to the applicant 's view , ORG further considered that Article PERSON of LAW , as amended in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was constitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained about the decision to prolong his preventive detention on completion of DATE of placement on the basis of the amended LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , which had entered into force after he had committed his offence . He argued that the decision violated the prohibition of retrospective punishment under LAW , the prohibition of retrospective legislation enshrined in the rule of law and his right to liberty . That decision further breached the principle of proportionality in that the courts responsible for the execution of sentences had made his release dependent on the completion of a social therapy lasting DATE , which would unduly prolong his preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found that the applicant 's complaint was ill - founded . Referring to its leading judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; application no . CARDINAL to ORG ) , it stated that the provisions on which the applicant 's continued preventive detention was based , Article CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with LAW to LAW , as amended in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , were constitutional .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , in ORG view , the criminal courts had not applied these provisions to the applicant in a disproportionate manner . There were notably no objections under constitutional law to considering the total absence of a necessary therapy to be a negative factor in the assessment of whether the applicant was likely to reoffend .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was diagnosed with cancer of the lymph nodes and subsequently with cancer of the eyes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE ORG ordered the continuation of the applicant 's preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a chamber responsible for the execution of sentences , decided to suspend the further execution of the applicant 's preventive detention on probation as from CARDINAL DATE and ordered the supervision of his conduct . Having consulted a medical expert , it considered that there were justifiable reasons for testing whether the applicant could be released without committing further unlawful acts . It noted that the applicant had persistently refused to make a social ( group ) therapy , considered most suitable by all medical experts consulted , but had at least made an individual therapy with an external psychotherapist . The applicant was released from preventive detention on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows :", "CARDINAL . The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender 's conviction , order his preventive detention , a so - called measure of correction and prevention , under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence , a penalty , if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to DATE imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version in force prior to DATE , the first period of preventive detention may not exceed DATE . If the maximum duration has expired , the detainee shall be released ( Article QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW was amended by the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other LAW of DATE , which entered into force on DATE . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , in its amended version , provided that if a person has spent DATE in preventive detention , the court shall declare the measure terminated ( only ) if there is no danger that the detainee will , owing to his criminal tendencies , commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims . Termination shall automatically entail supervision of the conduct of the offender . The former maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention was abolished . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to LAW , the amended version of Article CARDINAL of LAW was to be applied without any restriction ratione temporis ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "7"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "7-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
