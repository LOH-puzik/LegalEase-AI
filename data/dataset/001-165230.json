At TIME on DATE a DATE boy was mugged and his mobile phone taken from him while he was walking along a road CARDINAL villages in southeastern GPE . The perpetrators of the mugging were not known to him .", "The boy and his parents subsequently reported the incident to the local county police .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response , a police unit consisting of CARDINAL officers searched the area surrounding the crime scene with the boy and his father .", "At TIME they spotted the applicant , who was then aged DATE , another minor and a third person , all of whom the boy identified as his assailants .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his CARDINAL associates , both of whom were also of PERSON origin , were arrested . The parties dispute the circumstances of the arrest .", "The Government relied on entries in the county police logbook for the relevant TIME and on a note on the record drawn up by the county police dated DATE indicating that the suspects had resisted arrest and attempted to flee . They had consequently had to be subdued , no injuries had been sustained , and the use of force by the arresting officers had been found lawful . That material referred to the measures of restraint used against the applicant and the other CARDINAL suspects as \u201c self - defence mechanisms for holding and grabbing \u201d . The applicant , for his part , denied that he had shown any resistance or that the police had used any measures of restraint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his companions were then taken to the county police station . According to the results of a breathalyser test carried out there , all CARDINAL detainees had consumed alcohol and the applicant was in a state of slight inebriation .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL suspects were kept at the police station and preliminarily questioned ( vy\u0165a\u017een\u00ed ) by officers from the county police . As to the rooms in which they were kept , these were used as offices , were fitted out with the usual office equipment and were not furnished as detention cells .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s and the ORG \u2019s accounts in relation to further details vary as follows .", "According to the applicant , during the probing , the officers subjected him to psychological pressure and physical violence with a view to obtaining his confession . In particular , he was slapped and punched in the head , was not allowed to sit or lie down or to rest during the entire length of his detention , and was not provided any food or drink .", "In the ORG \u2019s submission , there had been no ill - treatment , the CARDINAL suspects were kept in separate rooms and were checked on at fifteenminute intervals . The applicant was allowed to use the toilet , which was equipped with a washbasin with drinkable tap water .", "CARDINAL . The Public Prosecution Service ( \u201c the PPS \u201d ) was informed of the arrest and , at TIME the case file , along with the responsibility for the detention of the young men , was passed on to an investigator from the local district police .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile or in parallel , the victim was examined by a doctor , his mother orally submitted a criminal complaint , and the crime scene was inspected .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE the applicant and his CARDINAL co - detainees were charged with robbery and the investigator decided to place them in a facility for provisional detention . However , the decision was not implemented as no room was available in such a facility within a reasonable distance .", "Subsequently , a legal - aid lawyer was appointed for the applicant and a copy of the document containing the charges was sent to , inter alia , the child protection services .", "CARDINAL . TIME on DATE the applicant was brought before the investigator , who interviewed him in the presence of his mother and the lawyer . No mention was made of any illtreatment .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant was placed in a provisional detention cell as documented by a protocol , which cites him as submitting in response to a pre - printed question that had not been subjected to any violence . The relevant documentation further contains a hand - written note with the applicant \u2019s signature indicating that \u201c [ he ] ha[d ] received dinner \u201d . According to the Government , the cell was equipped with , inter alia , a washbasin and drinkable water from the tap .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant and his co - detainees were released , and the police took them home .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant \u2019s mother appeared before the investigator on DATE she decided to avail herself of her right not to give evidence , making no mention of any ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , acting through the intermediary of his lawyer , the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal against the charge , arguing that he himself had not been involved in the mugging , which had been perpetrated by his minor associate alone and to which the latter had confessed . There was no mention of any ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the charge against the applicant was withdrawn .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s submission , meanwhile , in DATE that followed his release , his mother presented herself at the county police station and contacted ORG by telephone to complain about the treatment to which her son had been subjected while detained . According to the applicant , her complaint was not registered and she was orally advised to submit it in written form .", "According to the Government , however , the heads of the county police and the district police , who were the only persons entitled to receive complaints in matters such as those obtaining in the present case , did not receive any complaint from the applicant \u2019s mother . Similarly , there was no mention of a visit or any communication from her in the records of visits and telephone calls received by the county police or in the operational logbook of the district police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his associates lodged a written criminal complaint with ORG .", "They directed it against the officers of the county police who had been on duty TIME on DATE and TIME on DATE , suggesting that the offence of abuse of authority of a public official could have been committed .", "In particular , they submitted that , while in police custody , each of them separately had been pressured to confess on the pretext that the others had already confessed . The applicant also submitted that he had been subjected to slapping in the face and on the head until he had confessed . The persons inflicting that treatment had worn uniforms . Although the applicant did not know their identity , he would certainly recognise them . Another person had been present , not wearing a uniform , presumably a relative of the boy who had been robbed .", "Throughout the entire time in police custody , the applicant had had to stand , without being allowed to sit or lie down , and he had not been given any food or water .", "Moreover , in the applicant \u2019s submission , his legal guardians had not been notified of his custody , let alone been present .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a medical report dated DATE . The doctor who issued the report observed that the applicant had \u201c allege[d ] that he had been beaten by police officers the day before \u201d and \u201c had received a slap on the right CARDINAL of a cheek \u201d . In reply to a printed question about whether the injury could have been sustained as alleged , the reply \u201c yes \u201d was given . The doctor further observed that there was no haematoma and that the cheek was sensitive and slightly swollen . He diagnosed \u201c a bruised cheek on the left \u201d and classified the injury as slight , with recovery time DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The criminal complaint was sent to the local ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) of ORG for examination . Subsequently , the part of the complaint concerning the failure to notify the applicant \u2019s legal guardians of his arrest and detention , to provide him with food and water during his detention , and to hear him immediately after his arrest was sent to the district police ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In examining the complaint concerning the alleged physical mistreatment , the ORG interviewed the applicant and his associates , as well as the investigator and CARDINAL officers under suspicion . In addition , it examined the case file concerning the investigation into the alleged robbery and other documentary material .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the complaint . In doing so it observed that the applicant had not raised any complaint of ill - treatment during his interview with the investigator on DATE , and held that this could not be explained by his proclaimed fear of the officers involved since , in that interview , the applicant had been assisted by his mother and lawyer ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The ORG observed that in his oral depositions , the applicant had claimed that he had been beaten at the county police station for TIME and that he had sustained bruises and a swollen cheek . However , those allegations of sustained beating and its consequences did not correspond to the findings in the doctor \u2019s report of DATE , which only attest to an allegation of having received a slap on the right cheek and to having a swollen cheek , but no haematoma .", "The ORG also noted that in the investigation file concerning the alleged robbery there was no indication of any ill - treatment . It observed that the applicant \u2019s injury could have been inflicted in the course of his arrest , which he had resisted and which accordingly had had to be carried out forcefully .", "In addition , the ORG observed that the police officers in question had not been involved in the investigation of the alleged robbery , but had merely been guarding the applicant . Consequently , they had had no reason to pressure him into confessing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE by lodging an interlocutory appeal with the PPS . He requested twice that a decision by the PPS to dismiss the appeal be reviewed .", "The applicant argued in particular that he had not resisted his arrest and that , accordingly , no physical force had been used in the course of it . His injury could therefore not be explained as the ORG had done . He had not complained of the ill - treatment before the investigator because nobody had asked him about it and because he had been concerned about possible repercussions .", "The applicant further argued that the fact that there was no mention of the ill - treatment in the investigation file was irrelevant . In fact , it was logical , because the officers involved would naturally not mention their misconduct and would deny it . That incongruity and contradiction of the arguments had not been examined .", "According to the applicant , a \u201c racial motive was not excluded \u201d and the treatment to which he had been subjected had been contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The interlocutory appeal and the requests for review were eventually dismissed by ORG ( \u201c the OPG \u201d ) , which communicated its decision to the applicant in a letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "The ORG fully endorsed the findings of ORG , considering as crucial the fact that before the doctor on DATE the applicant had only alleged slapping , that the doctor \u2019s observations on the applicant \u2019s injury did not correspond to the applicant \u2019s subsequent allegation of sustained beating , and that the applicant had not raised any ill - treatment allegation with the investigator on DATE .", "Without any explanation , the ORG also concluded that there was no indication of any racial motive behind the treatment complained of by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . As to the part of the applicant \u2019s criminal complaint concerning the alleged failure to notify his legal guardians of his arrest and detention , to provide him with food and water during his detention , and to hear him immediately after his arrest ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the district police informed the applicant in a letter of DATE , without any explanation at all , that \u201c in the investigation of the given matter , no error had been committed by the investigative organs \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint , under Article CARDINAL of the LAW , with ORG against the ORG and ORG of the PPS involved in his case .", "He emphasised that at the time of his arrest he had been a minor , that he had been kept at the police station TIME without being able to sit or lie down , and without being given any food or water , and that he had been subjected to psychological pressure and physical violence with a view to forcing him to confess . He considered that such treatment had been in breach of his rights under LAW , as was the ensuing investigation into his complaints on account of its lack of efficiency and independence , as well as the authorities\u2019 failure to act on their own initiative .", "The applicant also alleged that the lack of a proper investigation had been aggravated by the lack of an effective remedy and discrimination , contrary to his rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "On the last point , the applicant argued that there had been many known incidents of police violence against the GPE in the course of arrest and detention in GPE , and that his treatment by the police had been influenced by his PERSON origin .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint as manifestly ill - founded . It observed that the applicant had no legal right to have a third person criminally prosecuted , that his right to lodge a criminal complaint merely implied that he had the right \u201c to have the complaint dealt with by a body authorised to do so \u201d , and that it had thus been dealt with . It further observed that the applicant had not complained of his alleged ill - treatment before the investigator on DATE or in his interlocutory appeal against the charge ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The fact that he had had those means of asserting his rights at his disposal excluded the jurisdiction of ORG . It concluded without further explanation that , in the circumstances , neither the proceedings before the PPS nor their decisions could have violated the applicant \u2019s rights as identified in his constitutional complaint .", "The decision was served on the applicant on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
