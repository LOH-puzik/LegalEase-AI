CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "By a judgment of DATE the GPE ORG ordered the applicant to pay outstanding rent for an apartment located in GPE , to vacate the apartment and to bear the costs of the court proceedings .", "On the applicant \u2019s appeal ORG by a judgment dated DATE set aside the judgment of ORG on the ground that the applicant \u2019s right to be heard had been infringed and remitted the case to this court for fresh consideration .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG heard the parties and ordered the taking of evidence .", "On DATE the applicant objected to the participation of the acting judge in the proceedings on the ground of possible bias since the same judge had already conducted the proceedings resulting in the judgment of DATE .", "By written submissions of DATE the applicant lodged a counterclaim against the owner of the apartment regarding , inter alia , repayment of rent .", "ORG by a partial judgment ( ORG ) dated DATE again ordered the applicant to vacate the apartment .", "The applicant appealed on CARDINAL DATE and lodged a further application for bias against the acting judge .", "On DATE ORG set aside the ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the owner of the apartment , in his capacity as underlying plaintiff , to bear the costs of the proceedings . By a decision of DATE ORG clarified that the plaintiff had to bear the costs of the appellate proceedings .", "The applicant appealed against the decision of ORG on the ground that the latter had ordered the plaintiff only to bear the costs of the appellate proceedings but not of the proceedings at first instance . On DATE ORG dismissed his complaint . It found that since the partial judgment of ORG CARDINAL DATE had not contained a decision on the costs of the proceedings at first instance ORG could only decide on the costs of the appellate proceedings . The decision on the costs of the first - instance proceedings was reserved for the final decision ( PERSON ) of ORG in the first - instance proceedings .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG held that the complaint was inadmissible on the ground that the impugned decision of ORG had not been rendered to the detriment of the applicant and that according to the information submitted there was nothing to establish that he would have to bear the costs of the proceedings at first instance .", "On DATE the applicant brought a claim against a construction firm before the GPE ORG regarding compensation for water damages caused in his cellar on the occasion of renovation works in a neighbouring building .", "ORG heard the parties on DATE and by a decision dated DATE ordered the taking of evidence and summoned witnesses for a hearing scheduled for DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to adjourn the hearing as unsubstantiated .", "The applicant did not attend the hearing on DATE but was represented by counsel .

He also complained that his request to hear further witnesses had been dismissed by the court . He finally asked to be granted legal aid for the appellate proceedings .", "By a letter dated DATE ORG informed the applicant that his appeal was not signed by a lawyer as statutorily required and furthermore that it appeared to be ill - founded . On DATE the applicant submitted written observations in reply .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid since his appeal was devoid of prospects of success . It held that ORG had correctly assessed the evidence obtained and rightly rejected the applicant \u2019s request to hear further witnesses as belated .", "By a decision of DATE , which was served on the applicant on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of ORG as inadmissible , as he was not represented by counsel as statutorily required . The applicant lodged a complaint against this decision with ORG on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint which he further motivated by written submissions of CARDINAL DATE . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE ORG by its presidential council ( NORP ) informed the applicant that there existed doubts as to the admissibility of his complaint since he had not sufficiently substantiated a violation of his rights guaranteed under LAW . The applicant nevertheless pursued his constitutional complaint .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint of DATE against its decision of DATE on the ground that only ORG ( ORG ) would have been competent to deal with it .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint of CARDINAL DATE and imposed a fee of MONEY ( ORG ) upon the applicant for abuse of process ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It referred to its established case - law that the introduction of a constitutional complaint constituted abuse of process if one could reasonably assume that the complaint was devoid of any prospects of success . In the instant case the applicant , after receiving the letter of the presidential council of ORG dated DATE , could not have had any doubts that his constitutional complaint was not sufficiently substantiated and thus clearly inadmissible . The applicant had merely used ORG as an additional appellate instance without specifying any issues that were relevant under constitutional law in the manner required by the applicable procedural rules . ORG pointed out that it could not agree to be hindered in the performance of its tasks by unsubstantiated complaints .", "By a letter to ORG dated DATE the applicant contested that his complaint had been abusive and requested that the fee be revoked .", "Pursuant to LAW ( Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz ) the proceedings before ORG shall be free of charge . According to LAW , ORG may charge a fee of up to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL if the lodging of a constitutional complaint constitutes an abuse of process .", "In its established case - law ORG has consistently held that the lodging of an obviously inadmissible or unfounded complaint is considered to be abusive if one can reasonably expect the complaint to be devoid of any prospect of success . ORG held on several occasions that this was the case if an applicant merely used ORG as an additional appellate instance without raising issues that were relevant under constitutional law in compliance with the procedural requirements . The ORG also has repeatedly held in this context that it could not agree to be hindered in the exercise of its functions by complaints that clearly did not have any prospect of success , thereby delaying the protection of the basic rights of other citizens .", "In a decision of DATE ( file No . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG held that fees charged in accordance with LAW had to be legally qualified as court fees notwithstanding that they also had a punitive character . While LAW established the rule that proceedings before ORG were free of charge , its paragraph CARDINAL established the conditions under which an exception to this rule could apply . A fee imposed on this basis could be considered an appropriate consideration for costs triggered by an abusive resort to ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
