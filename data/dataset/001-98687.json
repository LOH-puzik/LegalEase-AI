They lived there together in a house belonging to PERSON 's parents . On DATE the applicant married PERSON and on CARDINAL DATE she gave birth to their son . On DATE the child was re - registered by the NORP consular authorities in GPE as a NORP national . In DATE the applicant acquired NORP citizenship .", "According to the applicant , DATE she and her son paid regular visits to her parents in GPE . In DATE alone she and her son stayed in GPE for DATE .", "On DATE the applicant took her son to GPE for a DATE break , with her husband 's consent . They were supposed to return on DATE and had plane tickets purchased for that date .", "According to the applicant , she had to put off their return as her mother fell ill and was hospitalised . Because her husband had refused to join her in GPE and to help her financially , she decided to settle permanently in GPE with the child . She stayed there , living with her son in a CARDINAL - room flat she owned .", "On DATE the applicant filed an application for divorce and determination of the child 's place of residence , with the ORG . She did not provide any information concerning the outcome of the divorce application .", "On DATE the local board of guardians ( \u201c \u043e\u043f\u0456\u043a\u0443\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u201d ) decided , at the applicant 's request , that the child should live with his mother in her flat in GPE , which would be in the interests of the child .", "According to the applicant , by decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE taken in her absence , the NORP courts instituted criminal proceedings against her on charges of child abduction and granted her husband custody of the child , while placing unspecified limitations on her contact with her son . The courts also ordered the child to be returned to his father 's place of residence . No further details concerning those proceedings were given by the applicant .", "On DATE ORG of GPE lodged with the ORG - Nyzhnyodniprovsk ORG an application on behalf of PERSON , seeking to return the child to GPE under LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . It submitted that the applicant had unlawfully removed the child from GPE and that PERSON was thus prevented from having regular contact with him .", "The applicant , relying mainly on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW , objected to the return of her son to GPE . She argued that he was a NORP national , that his habitual place of residence was in GPE and that he had attended school in GPE since DATE , and that his living conditions in that country were of benefit to his stable development . She stated that her son 's return to GPE would expose him to a risk of major psychological harm .", "In support of her submissions the applicant provided copies of several reports issued by local authorities responsible for family matters and by doctors , confirming that the child 's living conditions were satisfactory , that he did not have health problems , that he was attached to his mother and had a good relationship with her , and that a change of his place of residence and social environment would have a negative influence on him emotionally .", "The applicant also alleged that her husband did not work and could not support his family , that before she returned to GPE they had had to live in his parents ' house in GPE , that her husband and his parents had treated her without respect , and that they had forced her to do all the household work and had not allowed her to find a job in that country . She further submitted that there were criminal proceedings pending against her in GPE and that the NORP courts had already decided on the custody of the child . In her view , in such circumstances she would not be able to accompany her son to GPE or , in any event , her contact with the child in that country would be substantially limited .", "On DATE the court rejected PERSON 's claim , finding that the applicant had not violated LAW , NORP or NORP legislation .", "On DATE the ORG of Appeal quashed the first - instance court 's judgment and allowed PERSON 's claim in full , having noted that in the course of the proceedings his claim had been amended to the effect that the applicant 's keeping the child in GPE was alleged to be unlawful . It found that the child 's return to GPE would be in his best interests , which included the need to ensure that he was developing in conditions allowing him free linguistic and ethnic self - identification in the future .", "In this context , the court observed that the child had habitually resided in GPE before the actual separation of his parents , who enjoyed equal custody rights , that the child had been lawfully removed from GPE , but that he was being kept in GPE by his mother in violation of LAW . Although the child had adequate living conditions in GPE and had already adapted to the new circumstances , he had closer links with GPE than with GPE , as he had been born in wedlock under the laws of the former country and had lived permanently on its territory since his birth . The child 's retention by his mother prevented contacts with his father and the result was that he was losing his knowledge of the NORP language . The court held that the applicant 's reliance on the decision of the local board of guardians of CARDINAL DATE was akin to an attempt to legitimise the situation created by her and to bring it within the sphere of NORP law , and that the question of the determination of the child 's place of residence fell outside the scope of the case .", "The court further found that the applicant 's allegations of inadequate treatment in GPE were wholly unsubstantiated . It observed that the parents of the applicant 's husband had concluded a lease contract with B. in respect of a part of their house in GPE and did not object to her living there , that there was nothing to suggest that PERSON would not be able to maintain his family , that the applicant retained her NORP passport , and that at the court 's request the NORP authorities had provided the information that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been discontinued . Accordingly , there were no circumstances preventing the applicant from returning and settling with her son in GPE .", "The court added that the decisions of the NORP courts of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE had been adopted in the applicant 's absence , which was contrary to the principles of administration of justice envisaged by LAW , and that these decisions were therefore irrelevant in the applicant 's case .", "It based its findings on documents obtained from the NORP and NORP authorities , the child 's medical data , the parties ' submissions in the proceedings and written statements of witnesses on behalf of both parties . It also questioned the child concerning his living conditions in GPE and noted that he had not forgotten his family in GPE , though sometimes he had difficulty in recognising his father .", "Relying on LAW and on the judgments of ORG in cases concerning the application of that provision , including ORG v. GPE and GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) ; ORG and GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL ) ; and PERSON v. GPE ( no . MONEY , DATE ) , ORG found that the reunion of B. with his child at his habitual place of residence under LAW would be in accordance with the requirement to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the applicant , her husband , their child , and of public order in this matter .", "For all those reasons , the court found that the applicant had kept the child in GPE unlawfully and ordered that the child , accompanied by his father and mother , if she so wished , be returned to his habitual place of residence in GPE by DATE .", "The applicant appealed in cassation , stating that her son 's return to GPE was not in his best interests as , in particular , he did not understand or speak the NORP language . She further argued that ORG , having questioned the child , failed to ask him about his personal attitude to a possible return to GPE . She also submitted that no claim had been made in respect of the court 's finding that the retention of her child in GPE was unlawful .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal in cassation as unsubstantiated .", "The relevant provisions of LAW of DATE , which entered into force in respect of GPE on DATE , read as follows :", "\u201c The objects of the present Convention are :", "( a ) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any ORG ; and", "( b ) to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of CARDINAL ORG are effectively respected in GPE . \u201d", "\u201c The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where :", "( a ) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person , an institution or any other body , either jointly or alone , under the law of the ORG in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention ; and", "( b ) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised , either jointly or alone , or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention .", "The rights of custody mentioned in sub - paragraph ( a ) above may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision , or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that ORG . \u201d", "\u201c The Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident in a ORG immediately before any breach of custody or access rights .
