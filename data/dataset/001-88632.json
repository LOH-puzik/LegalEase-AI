They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", ", may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are all close relatives of PERSON . Until DATE he was married to PERSON , and a daughter \u2013 the first applicant DATE was born out of this marriage in DATE .", "Since DATE , ORG had an extramarital relationship with PERSON who fell pregnant in DATE . She decided to keep the child and informed GPE accordingly . On DATE , she gave birth to a boy , Y.", "In DATE , GPE informed GPE of the existence of NORP and told her that he was the father . GPE and NORP divorced shortly after . Their daughter stayed with A.", "On DATE , ORG died .", "On DATE , PERSON filed a request on behalf of CARDINAL with ORG ( rechtbank ) for a declaration of paternity in application of CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON , \u201c BW \u201d ) . She claimed that , PERSON since DATE \u2019s birth , PERSON had sent her flowers and that he had sent them postcards occasionally . He had visited them several times and had supported PERSON financially up to an amount of MONEY ( \u201c NLG \u201d ) per year . In support of her claims , PERSON submitted , inter alia , bank statements , correspondence from GPE mentioning payments to PERSON and CARDINAL photographs showing GPE with PERSON ( as well as PERSON ) .", "The applicants opposed the request , arguing that granting the requested declaration of paternity would constitute an unjustified interference with their rights under LAW . In their opinion , such interference would be justified only if there had been family life within the meaning of LAW between GPE and ORG , which was not the case .", "After a DNA test had indicated that ORG was indeed the father of Y. , ORG issued on DATE the requested declaration of paternity . It considered that section CARDINAL:CARDINAL BW did not require the existence of family life within the meaning of LAW between the begetter and his child . Furthermore , the applicants had not substantiated their claim that the declaration sought interfered with their rights under LAW , let alone that it would constitute an unjustified interference .", "The applicants lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) . In these proceedings on appeal , PERSON submitted further photographs , letters and postcards from GPE addressed to Y. and/or herself , as well as written statements from herself and her mother explaining the nature of the relationship between GPE , NORP and Z.", "On DATE ORG confirmed the impugned decision . With regard to the applicants\u2019 claim that the declaration violated their rights under LAW held that ORG \u2019s interest in obtaining the declaration of paternity outweighed the applicants\u2019 interests .", "The applicants\u2019 subsequent appeal in cassation was dismissed by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . ORG found that , contrary to the ORG assertions , section CARDINAL:CARDINAL BW was in conformity with LAW . It further held that , even if this domestic statutory provision offered more protection to the child than required by LAW , the legislator was free to do so . According to ORG , the unwelcome \u201c imposition \u201d of a new family member born out of wedlock could not be regarded as an unjustified interference prohibited by LAW . As in any event the interest of the child should always prevail over those of the begetter where it concerns establishment of paternity , this applied a fortiori to the begetter \u2019s relatives .", "No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "Section CARDINAL:CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL BW reads as follows :", "\u201c The paternity of DATE including when he has died DATE can be established by the court when the man is the begetter of the child or when the man as partner of the mother has consented to an activity which may have resulted in the child \u2019s conception . A request to establish paternity can be filed by :", "a. the mother , unless the child has reached DATE ;", "b. the child . \u201d", "The Explanatory Memorandum ( PERSON ) to this provision states that a declaration of paternity can be seen as the last resort to obtain the establishment of a legal family tie between a child and its father ; not only in a situation where the begetter does not want to recognise the child , but also in a situation where the begetter has died and is thus no longer capable of recognising paternity . A failure to provide in such cases for the possibility of obtaining a judicial declaration of paternity ( which exists in neighbouring legal systems ) in domestic law would be contrary to LAW in conjunction with LAW in that it would allow the paternity of a child to remain undetermined ( NORP ( Parliamentary Documents ) II , DATE session , CARDINAL , CARDINAL no .
