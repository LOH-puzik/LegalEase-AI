The current value of the land now by far exceeded its value at the time of confiscation .

On DATE the Commission granted the request , quashed the restitution order and the rectifying decision , and remitted the case for re - examination .

V.D.M. , PERSON , GPE and GPE were the former owners of the confiscated property of [ the company ] .", "... it is not in doubt that [ the applicant ] is the heir only of ORG , thus of only a notional CARDINAL of the confiscated property ...", "This is sufficient ( for the conclusion ) that the first - instance commission violated LAW at the expense of the ORG , and that it follows that the [ restitution order ] is invalid .", "As is evident from the expert report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which was drawn up DATE before the restitution order , the confiscated property was not at all identical to the existing property , specifically the buildings confiscated in DATE , the total surface area of which was QUANTITY . m , were supporting objects , while the current buildings , with a surface area of CARDINAL sq . m , are modern and solid constructions . Furthermore , the confiscated buildings no longer exist , but completely different buildings , which are CARDINAL times bigger , were constructed instead .

They had been rendered in proceedings in which ORG had failed to lodge an ordinary appeal , although entitled to do so . The quashing of the order had been based on alleged errors in the facts , which could not serve as a ground for the extraordinary remedy used in his case . Furthermore , ORG had not been entitled to intervene in the proceedings in order to protect the interests of third parties . The applicant argued that the Commission , by quashing the relevant decisions over DATE after they had been adopted , had violated the principle of legal certainty and irrevocability of final decisions . Lastly , he complained that the expert report of DATE , to which the Commission referred in the impugned decision , carried no stamp ; it had not been drawn up on the form in use at the time ; and ORG had not quoted it in the restitution order of DATE .

In the present case , the court underlines once more that there has been a violation of the imperative provisions of LAW , which made the enforcement of the final restitution order legally impossible , as specified under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "The court has examined [ the applicant \u2019s ] allegations that there was a violation of the fundamental principle of finality of decisions in administrative proceedings , as well as that the impugned decision contained no reasons that could fall within the ambit of section CARDINAL ( of LAW ) , but it considers them ill - founded .
