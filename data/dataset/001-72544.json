At the relevant time there was no specific provision governing detention on remand after the bill of indictment had been lodged with the competent court . Since DATE the courts have been and are bound by the maximum statutory time - limits for which detention on remand can be imposed during the entire course of the proceedings . However , at the material time , there was no provision stating that the lodging of a bill of indictment automatically prolonged or replaced a previous detention order , or that this event itself resulted in detention DATE which had originally been prolonged by a court for a fixed period at the investigation stage \u2013 being continued either for an unlimited period or until a first - instance judgment was given . Nor was there any case - law to that effect . Nevertheless , according to domestic practice , once a bill of indictment had been lodged with the court competent to deal with the case , detention was assumed to be prolonged pending trial even in the absence of any further judicial decision .", "CARDINAL . It was only on DATE that ORG , referring to the historical background of the amended criminal legislation , mentioned the practice of keeping an accused person in detention under the bill of indictment . It did so in a ruling on the interpretation of LAW . That ruling related to the LAW as amended with effect from DATE , where LAW as amended ) set out maximum time - limits for detention on remand not only at the investigation stage but at the whole pre - trial stage . In its ORG no . I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG replied DATE in the affirmative \u2013 to the question of whether , after the lodging of a bill of indictment with the competent court , that court was obliged to issue a decision prolonging the detention on remand which had , meanwhile , exceeded the period fixed ( or prolonged ) at the investigation stage . The relevant parts of the resolution read as follows :", "\u201c Under the provisions of LAW which applied before [ CARDINAL DATE , when ] the amendment of DATE took effect , an obligation to determine the period of detention imposed by a prosecutor at the investigation stage was laid down in LAW . However , it did not emerge explicitly from Article QUANTITY ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW that , at the investigation stage , a prosecutor or the court competent to deal with the case had each time to determine the point until which detention should last . It was deemed to be obvious that , when prolonging detention at the investigation stage , both the prosecutor and the court competent to deal with the case had to determine the time until which detention was to last under a given decision . It was therefore assumed that the obligation to determine the period of detention arose if a decision on that matter was given before the expiry of the maximum statutory terms applicable at a given stage of the proceedings .", "Comparing the old legislation with the present one leads [ this ORG ] to the conclusion that the legislator , when amending the LAW in DATE , simply extended [ the scope of ] the rules applicable to continuing and prolonging detention on remand DATE which had previously applied only at the investigation stage DATE to the phase of court proceedings .", "Before the amendment , the legislation was based on the idea that a suspect should not be detained indefinitely as long as his case was not being dealt with by an independent court . Now the starting - point is that a suspect ( and an accused person ) should not be detained indefinitely , as long as a first - instance judgment is not rendered .", "Under the previous legislation there was no need to determine the period of detention after a bill of indictment had been lodged with the court because at this point proceedings reached the phase in which there was no statutory time - limit [ on this measure ] . For this reason , the court concerned had no interest in [ knowing ] until when detention had been prolonged under the last decision [ ; ] detention could continue because \u2018 detention of limited ORG had become \u2018 detention of unlimited ORG . There was therefore only a need to ascertain whether there were grounds for continuing detention under LAW . \u201d", "In its further ORG no . I ORG CARDINAL of DATE , ORG confirmed that :", "\u201c If the case in which detention on remand was ordered has been referred to a court with a bill of indictment and the period of detention previously fixed has expired , the court has a duty to consider whether detention needs to be continued and to give an appropriate decision on this matter . \u201d", "Referring to its ruling of DATE , it also stressed that :", "\u201c ... the ratio legis of the amendments to the criminal legislation is based on the concept that a suspect ( accused person ) should in no case be detained indefinitely until the first - instance judgment is rendered in his case ...", "It should be noted that , from the point of view of procedural safeguards for an accused person , what is material is not how long his detention at the investigation stage has lasted and how long it has lasted at the stage of the court proceedings , but the total period of his detention and whether his detention and its length are subject to review . If there is such a review at the investigation stage ( LAW and CARDINAL ) , there is no reason why there should not be one at the stage of the court proceedings ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
