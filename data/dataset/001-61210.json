{"ITEMID": "001-61210", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF THE FORTUM CORPORATION v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a multinational company specialising , inter alia , in the wholesale of petrochemical products , as was ORG at the time of relevance to the case .", "CARDINAL . In light of submissions lodged by another company in the field \u2013 ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) DATE ORG ( kilpailuvirasto , konkurrensverket ) , on DATE , initiated proceedings before ORG ( kilpailuneuvosto , konkurrensr\u00e5det ) , requesting that ORG be ordered to cease abusing its dominant position on the NORP market for motor engine fuel . In the view of ORG the reductions in ORG 's wholesale prices discriminated against some of its clients , thereby violating the DATE Act on Competition Restrictions ( laki kilpailunrajoituksista , lag om konkurrensbegr\u00e4nsningar CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG therefore requested that ORG be ordered to cease and desist from applying certain pricing criteria .", "CARDINAL . In a further submission of CARDINAL DATE ORG requested that an administrative fine ( seuraamusmaksu , p\u00e5f\u00f6ljdsavgift ) be imposed . As a new fact ORG referred to ORG unwillingness to concede that it had been violating the relevant provisions and accordingly to change the price of fuel sold to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that ORG had abused its dominant position on the relevant market but found no reason to impose a fine on the company . ORG , ORG and ORG all appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) . ORG maintained that it did not hold a dominant position on the market in question and in any case had not been abusing it . ORG appealed in so far as ORG had accepted certain of ORG 's criteria for price differentiation . ORG contended that a fine should have been imposed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG forwarded to ORG its interpretation of ORG decision as to the pricing criteria to be applied in light of the latter 's decision . On DATE ORG replied that its interventions were limited to questions of principle . It could therefore not pronounce itself on ORG proposed interpretation regarding the acceptable pricing criteria .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG again drew ORG attention to its difficulties in interpreting ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . In a submission to ORG dated DATE ORG demanded equality of arms in the proceedings . Reference was made to a telephone conversation between ORG 's representative and a legal officer of ORG from which it had transpired that a secret memorandum of ORG dated DATE had been filed with ORG . The memorandum discussed ORG 's conduct following ORG decision . The document had been released to ORG itself on DATE in response to the company 's request .", "CARDINAL . In a further submission to ORG dated DATE ORG challenged the accuracy of ORG memorandum , including the conclusions drawn . PERSON again objected to ORG failure to hear it formally in respect of ORG observations and apparently other memoranda .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ( reported in its DATE ORG , p. CARDINAL ) ORG , without commenting on ORG 's procedural objections of DATE and DATE , upheld ORG decision in large part . The court found , inter alia , that ORG , being in a dominant position on the relevant market , could in principle have objectively justifiable grounds for treating its clients differently according to certain criteria . In the case under examination ORG had not , however , shown any convincing grounds for differentiating between its clients on any ground other than on the basis of the volume of fuel purchased . By applying other pricing criteria ORG had accordingly abused its dominant position .", "CARDINAL . Having concluded that a fine should have been imposed on ORG , ORG referred the fixing of its amount to ORG . It further ordered that ORG 's conduct after DATE , in respect of which the court had received \u201c substantial new information \u201d , was to be taken into account . The court declined to examine itself what significance should be given to that information .", "CARDINAL . ORG case - file indicates that it deliberated on DATE May as well as on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed to the parties that the sole question which remained to be decided was the size of the fine to be imposed on ORG . In DATE ORG proposed a fine in the amount of CARDINAL NORP Marks ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . This proposal was rejected by ORG . ORG then filed a new proposal in which the amount of the fine was maintained but on different grounds .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG 's representative found in ORG case - file a copy of further observations drawn up by ORG and dated DATE . They bore a stamp indicating that they had been received by ORG on DATE . ORG had forwarded a copy to ORG but not to ORG . The observations sought to refute ORG 's arguments by highlighting the salient points of a DATE decision of ORG in the case ORG v. PERSON which ORG argued supported ORG decision of DATE . ORG had not heard Neste in respect of those observations .", "CARDINAL . Following an oral hearing ORG , by decision of DATE , fixed ORG 's fine at FIM CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL ) . It noted that ORG 's pricing practice from DATE to CARDINAL DATE had clearly discriminated against ORG and had been found to be unlawful under LAW . While the prohibited pricing practice had not been significant in nature , it had not been so insignificant as to justify a waiver of the fine .", "CARDINAL . As regards ORG 's conduct from DATE to CARDINAL DATE ORG found that it had not deviated to such an extent from its decision of DATE as to justify the imposition of a fine . In addition , ORG 's attempts to obtain approval of its amended pricing practice had been in vain , since ORG had failed in its obligation to direct and supervise the implementation of that decision . Accordingly , no fine was imposed for ORG 's conduct during that period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused , in extraordinary proceedings , the applicant company 's request for an annulment of its decision of DATE in the ordinary proceedings under LAW . The court found that no procedural error had taken place and reasoned , inter alia , that in so far as it had ordered that the fine to be imposed on ORG should take account of its conduct between ORG decision of DATE and the court 's decision of CARDINAL DATE , it had not become evident that the court had based itself on material in respect of which ORG had not been heard . Moreover , the court had expressly declined to draw any conclusion as to whether the supplementary information received by it should be taken into account when considering the amount of the fine to be imposed .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the proceedings before ORG , domestic law contained no general provisions on the manner in which parties to administrative proceedings were to be heard in writing . Even in the absence of such provisions it was considered an essential feature of fair administrative proceedings that all parties were properly heard . The hearing requirement was considered to include the right of a party to be informed of a matter affecting him or her , of the progress of the proceedings and of any evidence adduced . It entitled a party to submit observations on any evidence adduced by other parties but only if that evidence could affect the outcome of the case . Whenever such evidence had been adduced , the court could not rely on it unless the other party had been heard . A party needed not be heard when a certain claim was not examined on its merits or was rejected immediately .", "CARDINAL . The Act on ORG ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provided , inter alia , that the court could request an opinion or other observations for the purpose of seeking evidence . The cases were dealt with by respecting \u201c lawful court procedure \u201d ( sections DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . As from DATE ORG ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) applies to proceedings before ORG . It contains explicit provisions on the hearing of parties . Provisions on parties ' right to be heard can also be found in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Suomen Hallitusmuoto , ORG ; section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the former LAW as amended by LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of the Act on Publicity of Official Documents ( laki yleisten asiakirjojen julkisuudesta , lag om allm\u00e4nna handlingars offentlighet CARDINAL ) , as in force at the relevant time , any document prepared and issued by an authority as well as any document sent or handed in to an authority and remaining in its possession was to be deemed an official document . Under section CARDINAL , however , a document could be ordered to be kept secret by Decree , for example when this was deemed necessary in order to safeguard business activities .", "CARDINAL . The Decree on Certain Exceptions to the Publicity of Official Documents ( asetus sis\u00e4lt\u00e4v\u00e4 er\u00e4it\u00e4 poikkeuksia yleisten asiakirjain julkisuudesta , f\u00f6rordning innefattande vissa undantag i fr\u00e5ga om allm\u00e4nna handlingars offentlighet CARDINAL ) stipulated , inter alia , that documents containing information about commercial or industrial activities , the pursuit of a trade or profession or about the financial position of a private person were to be kept secret , unless the concerned company or person consented to disclosure ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On the one hand , a party within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the Act on Publicity of Official Documents ( whose interest , right or obligation the matter concerned ) had the right to obtain information even from a document not designated as publicly accessible , if that information could influence , or could have influenced , the consideration of the case . On the other hand , it was possible to withhold from a party information appearing even in an document of the aforementioned nature , if disclosure thereof would have been contrary to a particularly important public or private interest .", "CARDINAL . The DATE LAW were replaced , on DATE , by a new LAW on LAW ( laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta , lag om offentlighet i myndigheternas verksamhet CARDINAL ) which contains comparable provisions on private economic interests and on parties ' right of access to documents .", "CARDINAL . According to the LAW on ORG ( DATE ) , the ORG shall publish its findings to the extent deemed appropriate . Information regarded as a business or professional secret shall not be disclosed , unless the concerned party has consented thereto ( section CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
