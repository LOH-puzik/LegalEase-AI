The facts in the cases of the other CARDINAL applicants cases are identical , apart from the claims for compensation , which were made and dealt with individually .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the parties , can be summarised as follows .", "On DATE a criminal investigation was started into suspected breaches of public - health regulations . All the proceedings concerning the breaches were joined and assigned to LAW , which divided the cases into CARDINAL separate groups of criminal proceedings , depending on whether or not the defendants were civil servants .", "The individual complainants were represented in the proceedings by various associations , including ORG ( hereafter \u201c ANASTO - LEGANES \u201d \u201d ) , which was formed on CARDINAL DATE with the object of securing full reparation for all damage sustained by victims of toxic syndrome . The first applicant is the president of that association .", "The proceedings began in DATE with a criminal complaint by the public prosecutor \u2019s office . A large number of complaints by victims and associations of victims , and the results of various police and judicial inquiries , were added to the investigation file . The investigation concerned individuals and companies from the private sector and public authorities and their servants . However , in a decision of DATE , the Audiencia Nacional decided to sever the proceedings against the civil servants . It does not appear from the case file that an appeal was lodged against that decision .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , LAW handed down prison sentences to various defendants for breaches of the public - health regulations , fraud arising out of the sale of denatured rapeseed oil , and professional negligence . In addition to imposing criminal penalties , FAC held that one of the defendants was liable in damages , while the codefendants and CARDINAL undertakings implicated in the distribution of the oil incurred secondary liability .", "The amounts due in damages by those held liable were assessed as follows :", "\u201c ( i ) to the heirs of each deceased victim : MONEY ;", "( ii ) to persons whose injuries lasted DATE : MONEY ;", "( iii ) to persons whose injuries lasted DATE : MONEY ;", "( iv ) to persons whose injuries lasted DATE : MONEY ;", "( v ) to persons whose injuries lasted DATE : MONEY ;", "( vi ) to persons whose injuries lasted DATE , but without disability : MONEY ;", "( vii ) to persons suffering from permanent disability preventing them from resuming some of their normal duties : MONEY ;", "( viii ) to persons suffering from permanent disability preventing them from resuming any of their normal duties : MONEY ;", "( ix ) to persons suffering from permanent disability preventing them from doing any work : MONEY ;", "to persons suffering from serious disability : MONEY .", "The compensation payable to the heirs of the deceased persons listed as victims in Appendix VII shall be assessed in accordance with the classification of the injuries when the judgment is enforced .", "( xi ) ...

On DATE , ORG reversed and quashed part of the Audiencia Nacional \u2019s decision . It overruled the impugned decision on quantum , holding :", "ORG also ruled that everyone who had suffered from toxic syndrome , whether or not a party to the proceedings , was entitled to compensation at the relevant rate , as the associations of victims were not acting on behalf of their members , but represented the \u201c wider interests \u201d of all the victims , whether or not they were represented .", "In a second judgment delivered DATE , ORG found CARDINAL of the defendant civil servants guilty of recklessly causing death and injury . It sentenced them to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment each and held them jointly and severally liable to pay damages at twice the levels ordered by ORG in its judgment of DATE , that is to say , the levels set out in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The remaining CARDINAL civil ORG acquittals were upheld . The ORG was ordered , as a civil party with secondary liability , to pay all the sums mentioned , less any amounts it had granted by way of aid , other than amounts for medical , social - security or other similar expenses to which the victims had a statutory entitlement . An order was made on DATE for the rectification of that judgment to confirm that the levels of compensation were those set out in the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "Once ORG judgment had become enforceable , the case was remitted to the First Section of the Audiencia Nacional for execution .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Audiencia Nacional laid down the procedure to be followed by individual victims in order to obtain payment of their compensation .", "On DATE the Audiencia Nacional declared the civil servants who had been found liable in damages insolvent and ordered execution of ORG judgment against the ORG as the party with secondary civil liability .", "On DATE it was decided that , with the exception of additional family allowance , special grants and housing benefit , all aid paid by the ORG to victims of toxic syndrome between the date of the decision to grant such aid and the date the compensation was paid would be deducted from the amount of compensation payable .", "On DATE the Audiencia Nacional directed that the payment process had begun and informed the victims of toxic syndrome that they could \u201c obtain the standard compensation payment request form and complete related software package to assist them in making their claims from ORG Audiencia Nacional \u201d .", "The standard form issued by ORG did not contain a section allowing claims to be made for default interest . Accordingly , ORG drafted a document claiming default interest at the official rate from CARDINAL DATE , DATE Audiencia Nacional \u2019s judgment in the first set of proceedings , to the date of actual payment . The document was appended to the first request for execution of the judgment ( which was submitted by the first applicant ) and , relying on the official consumer price index published by ORG , stated that prices had increased by PERCENT since the relevant date .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the Audiencia Nacional rejected the first applicant \u2019s claim for default interest accrued since the DATE judgment and assessed his entitlement to compensation at ESP CARDINAL ( after deducting aid received from the ORG ) . That amount was to bear interest at the rate prescribed in DATE , taken together with section CARDINAL , of ORG , which lays down that the authorities must pay interest at the statutory rate if they fail to make payment within DATE after being served with the relevant judicial decision .", "The Audienca Nacional gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c ... As to the payment of interest , it will be noted that , in the final judgment in the present proceedings , the authority , on account of its secondary civil liability , was ordered to pay unliquidated damages . The sum is unliquidated because , taking the amounts specified in the judgment for each category of person affected [ by the food - poisoning ] as the starting point , the victims are required to submit for examination any deductible amounts ... , the classification of their injuries and any changes thereto . Accordingly , as has already been pointed out in what are now final decisions in the enforcement proceedings , everyone concerned must set the claims procedure in motion so that the amounts due to him or her can be calculated . ... Consequently , the payment of interest is only conceivable once the quantum has been calculated , that is to say , once the claims procedure has been completed . Since the debtor is a public authority ... it is necessary to apply section CARDINAL of the General Finance Act ( GFA ) , taken together with section CARDINAL of that Act , and not LAW . ... Section CARDINAL ORG allows the authority DATE in which to make payment , as it provides that if the authority does not pay a creditor of the ORG within DATE after service of the relevant court decision or acknowledgement of the obligation , it is to pay interest at the rate stated in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) GFA \u2013 that is to say , at the statutory rate on the amount due DATE from the date the creditor makes a written request for performance of the obligation . \u201d", "On DATE the first applicant renewed his request for default interest in a s\u00faplica appeal to FAC . He argued that the compensation was a liquidated sum , as FAC had itself established in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE . As to the date from which default interest was to run , the applicant said that ORG had already construed section CARDINAL of the General Finance Act , when read in the light of Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , to mean that the judgment at first instance had to be taken into account .", "In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the s\u00faplica appeal and upheld the previous decision in its entirety . It stressed that the first applicant \u2019s case concerned secondary civil liability in the context of the procedure for processing the claims for compensation . On DATE the Audiencia Nacional issued an order requiring the authority to pay the sum of ESP CARDINAL .", "The first applicant and the applicants whose names appear on the appended list then lodged an amparo appeal with ORG , alleging a violation of ORG DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the LAW . They said that the manner in which ORG had applied section CARDINAL of the General Finance Act constituted unjustified discriminatory treatment , as ORG had previously held that that provision had to be read in the light of LAW . They also insisted that litigants were entitled to have final court decisions executed strictly in accordance with their terms .", "ORG dismissed the appeals in a series of decisions ( its decision in the first applicant \u2019s case being delivered on DATE ) , in which it held :", "\u201c ... There has been no breach of the rule prohibiting discrimination ( LAW ) . The [ ORG ] judgments relied on by the applicant concerned cases in which the court of first instance decided that the authority had an obligation ( to pay or to reimburse certain sums ) ; that was not the position in the instance case , as it was not until , firstly , the FAC Nacional \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE and , subsequently , ORG judgment of DATE that it was decided that the authority had secondary liability . Accordingly , to allow interest to run from the date of the Audiencia Nacional \u2019s judgment ( DATE ) would be tantamount to holding [ the authority ] responsible for delay in complying with a non - existent obligation .", "The right recognised in LAW to the effective protection of the courts has not been infringed either , as the [ Audiencia Nacional \u2019s ] classification of the compensation as unliquidated is an issue of law that is reserved to the ordinary courts as part of the judicial duties vested exclusively in them by LAW , provided that they do not act arbitrarily , irrationally or in manifest breach of a procedural rule , which they have not done ... \u201d", "and :", "\u201c ...

CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , provided they do not act arbitrarily , irrationally or in manifest breach of a procedural rule , which they have not done ... \u201d", "and further :", "\u201c ... Firstly , as regards the violation of the right to the effective protection of the courts ( LAW ) , the applicant has only raised questions of ordinary law , for which the ordinary courts have exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Constitutional Court judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , provided they do not act arbitrarily , irrationally or in manifest breach of a procedural rule , which they have not done ... Secondly , as regards the principle of equality before the law ( LAW ) , ORG judgments relied on by the applicant in support of his allegations relate to cases that can not in any way be assimilated to the instant case ... \u201d", "By DATE some CARDINAL victims of toxic syndrome , that is to say CARDINAL of those affected , had received compensation . The first applicant is CARDINAL of them .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW provides , that in order to assert their rights and freedoms under LAW , all citizens may make an expedited application to the ordinary courts and , if appropriate , lodge an amparo appeal with ORG .", "The right of property proclaimed by LAW is not one of the rights for which an amparo appeal to ORG lies .", "Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that judgment debts shall bear default interest at the statutory rate plus CARDINAL points from DATE after the judgment was delivered until the debt has been paid in full . Article CARDINAL applies only to liquidated awards . The rule applies to all judicial decisions , although exceptions are made in favour of the ORG under LAW .", "Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the General Finance Act , which govern ORG receipts and expenditure , provide that creditors of the ORG shall only be entitled to default interest at the statutory rate if the authority concerned fails to discharge the relevant obligation within DATE after service of the judicial decision imposing it . The sections do not , however , indicate whether the relevant decision for this purpose is the decision of the court of first instance or of the appellate court . LAW states that the authority has DATE in which to pay its debt and that a failure to pay within DATE after service of the relevant judicial decision or acknowledgement of debt will entitle the creditor to interest at the rate stated in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , that is to say statutory interest on the amount due from the date of a written request by the creditor for performance of the obligation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
