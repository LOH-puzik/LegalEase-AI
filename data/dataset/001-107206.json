The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He is a professor of history who researches and publishes extensively on the subject of the historical events of DATE concerning the NORP population in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published an editorial opinion in AGOS , a bilingual NORP - Armenian newspaper , entitled \u201c PERSON , CARDINAL \u201d . In this editorial opinion the applicant criticised the prosecution of PERSON , the late editor of AGOS , for the crime of \u201c denigrating GPE \u201d under LAW . He also requested , in an expression of solidarity , to be prosecuted on the same ground for his opinions on the NORP issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a complaint was lodged against the applicant with the Ey\u00fcp public prosecutor . The complainant , PERSON , alleged that the applicant \u2019s defence of PERSON in the editorial published in AGOS violated ORG , CARDINAL ( incitement to commit an offence ) , CARDINAL ( praising a crime and a criminal ) and CARDINAL ( incitement to hatred and hostility among the people ) of LAW . Following this complaint , the applicant was summoned to the PERSON public prosecutor \u2019s office to make a statement . He was informed that he would be brought to the public prosecutor \u2019s office by force , in accordance with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , if he did not comply with the summons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to the PERSON public prosecutor \u2019s office to submit his defence statement in relation to the criminal complaint against him . The applicant stated , in the presence of his CARDINAL lawyers , that he had indeed written the said article published in AGOS . He explained that the policy of the Ittihad ve GPE towards the NORP in DATE could well be defined as genocide within the meaning of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of ORG of DATE . He had written the said article in order to express his opinion on the NORP issue in the context of freedom of the press . He pointed out that he was a professor of history who had been working on this subject for DATE and that he had expressed his opinion several times in his books and articles . He had not written the impugned article in order to serve any association , organisation , race or ethnic group , or to denigrate a nation . The applicant \u2019s CARDINAL lawyers also argued that the applicant \u2019s statements did not amount to a crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation against the applicant was terminated by the PERSON public prosecutor , who noted that at all the scientific seminars he had taken part in and in his publications the applicant had expressed the opinion that the events that took place DATE could be described as genocide . Having examined the applicant \u2019s article published in AGOS , the public prosecutor concluded that the applicant \u2019s statements in his capacity as a professor of history came within the realm of protected expression under LAW and that as such they did not constitute denigration of GPE . Nor did they amount to incitement to commit a crime , or to praising a crime or criminal , or incitement to hatred and enmity amongst the people .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the complainant , PERSON , filed an objection against the above - mentioned decision of non - prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG dismissed the complainant \u2019s objection . Having examined the investigation carried out and the reasons given by the PERSON public prosecutor , the court held that the decision of non - prosecution was in accordance with procedure and law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judgment was issued by ORG against PERSON ( the editor of AGOS ) and PERSON ( the owner of AGOS ) whereby both were sentenced to DATE imprisonment under LAW for accusing the NORP nation of genocide via the press . Although the applicant was not a party to those proceedings , the court decided of its own motion that the PERSON public prosecutor had erred in discontinuing the investigation against the applicant on DATE and held that this matter should be duly investigated by the prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another complaint was lodged against the applicant , by a certain ORG , with ORG office in PERSON . The complainant alleged that the applicant \u2019s statements published in AGOS on DATE violated LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision of non - prosecution . He noted that a similar complaint by another complainant had been examined and dismissed by a non - prosecution decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made an urgent request for interim measures under Rule CARDINAL of ORG . He also requested that the respondent Government be notified of the introduction of the application in accordance with Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of Court and that the case be given priority under Rule CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s requests under Rules CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of ORG were rejected .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted to the ORG a decision of nonprosecution issued by ORG office on DATE . It appears from this decision that on DATE a criminal complaint was lodged by a certain PERSON , who alleged that the applicant had attempted to denigrate the Republic and to influence the trial of PERSON by his editorial opinion dated DATE published in the AGOS newspaper . The public prosecutor who examined the complaint concluded that the alleged offence was time - barred and therefore issued a decision of non - prosecution .", "CARDINAL . According to the information provided by the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE , no further investigation had been instigated against the applicant after the judgment of ORG dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted a list of CARDINAL books published by the applicant . It appears that these books are on sale in GPE and that they mainly concentrate on the NORP question . A selection of the books included is as follows :", "\u2013 \u201c The NORP question has been resolved ; NORP documents concerning the policies towards the NORP during DATE \u201d , DATE ;", "\u2013 NORP national identity and the NORP question : \u201c From ORG to ORG , DATE ;", "\u2013 \u201c Lifting the NORP taboo , is there any solution other than dialogue \u201d CARDINAL ; and", "\u2013 \u201c Human Rights and the NORP Question \u201d , DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government further noted that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s allegations that he had been prevented from pursuing his research on the NORP issue , he had been given permission to conduct research in ORG by ORG . DATE and DATE the applicant personally consulted the NORP archives and had been granted further permission to photocopy CARDINAL documents . On page CARDINAL of his book entitled \u201c The NORP question has been resolved \u201d the applicant thanked ORG for assisting him in his research .", "CARDINAL . In an annex to their observations , the Government have furnished the ORG with sample copies of non - prosecution decisions issued by public prosecutors and judgments of acquittal given by criminal courts in cases concerning prosecutions under LAW and LAW . In particular , the suspects were mainly accused of insulting or denigrating the army , the security forces , the judiciary or the Republic .", "CARDINAL . In these decisions and judgments , given DATE , the prosecuting authorities either dropped the charges against the suspects , considering that the necessary elements of the crime in question were not present , or terminated the proceedings on the grounds that ORG had refused permission to prosecute the suspects . In acquitting the suspects , the criminal courts relied on the case - law of ORG in cases concerning LAW .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned documents furnished by the ORG included CARDINAL judgments given by the ORG and ORG in respect of CARDINAL prominent writers , namely ORG and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In the criminal proceedings against ORG had examined a criminal complaint filed by a group of lawyers and an association called ORG , who alleged that ORG had denigrated \u201c FAC as a result of statements about the NORP issue in her book entitled \u201c GPE ve GPE \u201d ( \u201c The PERSON of GPE \u201d in LANGUAGE ) . In a judgment dated DATE , the court acquitted PERSON , holding that the book in question was fiction and that the impugned statements made by the characters in the novel could not be taken as constituting an offence of denigrating GPE . Having examined the novel written by the accused , the court concluded that the statements contained in the book should be examined in the context of freedom of expression . The court , however , observed that the limits of the concept of \u201c LOC \u201d should be determined and based on a solid ground by the legislator . It further remarked that opinions should only be compared with opinions . Otherwise , one could not talk of freedom of opinion and expression and would be forced to adopt uniform thoughts .", "CARDINAL . In the case brought against PERSON , ORG had examined a criminal complaint lodged by CARDINAL individuals who alleged that the writer had denigrated GPE in a speech he had given abroad . In a judgment dated DATE , the court decided to discontinue the proceedings on the ground that the requisite permission to press charges against the accused had not been obtained from ORG . It thus ruled that the lack of permission should be considered as a refusal and that the proceedings should be terminated .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted statistical information which indicated the situation by DATE . They noted that following the amendments made to LAW on CARDINAL DATE there had been a significant decrease in prosecutions under LAW . In this connection , of the CARDINAL authorisation requests made by public prosecutors to commence criminal proceedings under LAW , ORG had granted CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The Government further pointed out that DATE the number of sets of criminal proceedings instituted LAW ( Article CARDINAL/CARDINAL of the former Criminal Code ) was CARDINAL . Of those , CARDINAL cases had resulted in convictions and CARDINAL in acquittals ; CARDINAL cases were still pending following ORG decisions to quash the first - instance courts\u2019 judgments .", "CARDINAL . In their supplementary observations dated DATE , the Government noted that DATE and DATE ORG had received CARDINAL requests for authorisation to institute criminal proceedings under LAW . ORG had refused CARDINAL of these requests but granted CARDINAL . In this connection , the Government furnished the ORG with sample copies of decisions of refusal issued by ORG . It appears from these decisions that ORG extensively relied on the case - law of the ORG in cases concerning LAW when refusing public ORG requests for authorisation to institute criminal proceedings under LAW . The Government further noted that in CARDINAL cases where ORG refused authorisation to institute criminal proceedings , the criminal complaints mainly concerned publications in the press .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE Progress Report on GPE stated :", "\u201c Following the adoption of the amendments to LAW , NORP courts had forwarded , by DATE ] , CARDINAL cases to the Minister of ORG for prior authorisation . This requirement concerns cases at the investigation stage or for which judicial proceedings have started . By DATE , ORG had reviewed CARDINAL cases and refused to grant permission to proceed in CARDINAL cases .", "However , the wording of LAW remains largely the same and the prior authorisation requirement opens up the possibility that the article will become subject to political consideration . So far , the Minister of ORG authorised the criminal investigations to continue in CARDINAL statements made by a NORP writer on the NORP issue shortly after the assassination of the NORP journalist of NORP origin , PERSON . Furthermore , there is legal uncertainty as regards cases which had been granted authorisation by the Minister of ORG under the former LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant highlighted examples of post - amendment LAW cases with specific reference to the NORP issue . He noted that in DATE ORG had authorised the continuance of the trial of GPE for stating that PERSON had been killed not only for being an NORP , but also for raising the issue of genocide . Another example was ORG conviction and sentencing on DATE to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ( subsequently commuted to a fine ) under LAW for translating and publishing a book about the NORP genocide entitled \u201c The Truth Will Set Us Free \u201d , written by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , according to ORG DATE Human Rights Report on GPE , the Minister of ORG himself ( PERSON ) also made a statement that could be interpreted as instructions to the judiciary : \u201c I will not let someone call my state \u2018 murderer\u2019 . This is not freedom of expression . This is exactly what the crime of insulting the person of the state is . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant also submitted a report published by ORG of ORG , for DATE . According to this report a total of CARDINAL people , CARDINAL of whom were journalists , were prosecuted in CARDINAL freedom of expression cases .", "CARDINAL . In its editions of CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE the magazine PERSON published articles alleging that the applicant was a paid employee of the NORP intelligence service and that he had been commissioned to conduct research and write on the subjects \u201c Violence in NORP history \u201d , \u201c Torture in NORP history \u201d and \u201c the Armenian Genocide \u201d . These studies had been commissioned and financed by the NORP intelligence service and had been published in a book .", "CARDINAL . In its edition dated DATE the DATE newspaper PERSON published an article entitled \u201c The NORP Intelligence Chief and PERSON couple \u201d containing allegations that the applicant \u2019s studies were determined and financed by the NORP intelligence service .", "CARDINAL . In its editions dated CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , the PERSON newspaper published articles describing the applicant as an individual who had betrayed GPE and vomited hate towards GPE in all of his books and speeches .", "CARDINAL . By press releases , the applicant and his family condemned the allegations published by the PERSON newspaper and called for apology . They referred to the killing of PERSON and said that the press should act with responsibility and sensibility when publishing articles containing allegations labelling someone as a \u201c traitor \u201d . They further warned against GPE becoming a country where citizens could be lynched with the help of the press .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment dated DATE ORG Instance dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims for non - pecuniary damage . The court held that even though the words used and allegations made by the defendants were offensive they were within the limits of permissible criticism . This judgment was confirmed by a ORG decision dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action in ORG of First Instance requesting the court to order the PERSON newspaper to publish a letter of correction in response to the offensive articles published on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . By a decision dated DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . It held that even though the criticism contained in the impugned articles was harsh in tone , it was covered by the right to freedom of expression enjoyed by the press in a pluralist democracy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG newspaper published an article criticising the attitude of the judiciary in regard to the media campaign against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that he had received hate mail from unknown persons . He submitted a copy of an e - mail sent by a person insulting him and threatening him with death as a result of his views on the NORP issue .", "CARDINAL . DATE a number of articles were published on internet portals and in magazines and newspapers criticising the attacks against the applicant and expressing support for him .", "CARDINAL . Former LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A person who publicly denigrates GPE , ORG or ORG of GPE shall be sentenced to a penalty of imprisonment for a term of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

ORG DATE Progress Report on GPE stated the following , insofar as it concerns the use of LAW in cases concerning freedom of expression :", "\u201c ... [ CARDINAL NORP legal framework still fails to provide sufficient guarantees for exercising freedom of expression and , as a result , is often interpreted in a restrictive way by public prosecutors and judges . There are still some prosecutions and convictions based on LAW", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE Progress Report on GPE stated , insofar as relevant , the following :", "\u201c ... As regards freedom of expression , an increasingly open and free debate continued on a wide scale in the media and public on topics perceived as sensitive , such as the NORP issue , minority rights , the NORP issue and the role of the military .", "There are few cases initiated on the basis of LAW ( TCC ) after it was amended in DATE .", "According to the Ministry if ORG , since the amendment to LAW , a decrease in the number of cases opened has been observed .

Following his visit to GPE in DATE , the Commissioner expressed his concern regarding LAW , notwithstanding an amendment adopted in DATE which led to a decrease in the number of proceedings brought under this article . On DATE the ORG delivered its judgment in the case of Dink v. GPE in which it found a violation of LAW on account of PERSON conviction based on LAW . The Court held that PERSON conviction for denigrating NORP identity prior to his murder did not correspond to any \u201c pressing social need \u201d which is one of the major conditions on which interference with one \u2019s freedom of expression may be warranted in a NORP society . The Commissioner considers that the amendment adopted in DATE , which subjects prosecution to a prior authorisation by ORG in each individual case , is not a lasting solution which can replace the integration of the relevant ORG standards into the NORP legal system and practice , in order to prevent similar violations of the LAW . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
