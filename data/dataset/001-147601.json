The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was , at the time of the events , a lecturer at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local newspaper Republica Oltenia published an article entitled \u201c Feature story on sex - blackmail professor \u201d ( \u201c PERSON metraj cu un professor de sex - \u015fantaj \u201d ) . The article , written by PERSON , was illustrated by CARDINAL photographs showing a man and a woman naked and having sex . The man \u2019s face was not visible . On the photographs were the handwritten words \u201c the man in the photos is PERSON , university as.[sistant ] at the electrotechnical faculty \u201d . CARDINAL of the photographs also appeared at the top of the front page of the newspaper .", "CARDINAL . The article started by mentioning that the man in the photographs was a university professor , an important person in society , who was involved in bribery , blackmail , child sex abuse and sexual deviance , the details of which would be given in the article .", "CARDINAL . The article continued by stating that in DATE the applicant \u2019s students had complained to the university dean that he was not very friendly during sessions and used to demand money from them . The applicant was also branded as litigious , because he had CARDINAL trials pending before the courts , CARDINAL of them brought with the purpose of contesting decisions taken by his university superiors .", "CARDINAL . Further on , the article contained the following statements :", "In DATE a girl , so young that she was not even DATE , got pregnant . Abortion being illegal , she decided to ask her second cousin , a university assistant at the time , to help her find a doctor . The cousin took advantage of the girl \u2019s desperate situation . He might have told her that he would tell her mother if she did not let him \u201c taste \u201d her at least once . The atmosphere at the time may be inferred from the black and white photos attached . They were taken ... by the cousin himself . Apparently , even from a young age , PERSON had unorthodox habits . After satisfying his needs , ORG remembered that in fact he could not help his cousin , and advised her to sell some jewellery in order to raise money for a doctor . To develop the photos , ORG appealed to a repeat student and amateur photographer ... \u201c In your DATE you will have an exam with me and wo n\u2019t pass \u201d ORG said , according to the photographer . The student gave in to the blackmail , but after developing only gave ORG CARDINAL photos instead of CARDINAL . The gesture had its logic , because in DATE , when our student managed to proceed to DATE , ORG tried to raise the stakes , by asking for a non - reimbursable loan of CARDINAL [ NORP ] marks to pass an exam . The student was upset and went to the prosecutor \u2019s office : \u201c I made a complaint to the prosecutor \u2019s office in [ CARDINAL , accusing him of blackmail . I submitted the relevant evidence , namely the first [ set of ] photos , because he later came to me with CARDINAL more films , also porn ... the prosecutor said that we were dealing with a university professor and should leave him alone , not amplify the case .", "Why not amplify the case ? We \u2019ll tell you : because between ORG and ORG , ORG , there is a special relationship , which might also be based on blackmail ... We know that [ M.]I. sold ORG a flat , but this does n\u2019t say much . That would be another case of blackmail , because we heard that ORG \u2019s obsession with audio - video recordings remained unchanged ... As for the prosecutors who received a complaint from the blackmailed photographer , they were in no hurry to go to talk to the girl in the photos . That would have obliged them to open an investigation ex officio . Instead they sent the victim , the photographer - student , to take statements . And he obtained a statement signed by the girl \u2019s mother , while the actress in the photos wrote on them \u201c The man in the photo is PERSON , university as . [ sistant ] at the electrotechnical faculty . \u201d", "Of course such evidence obtained under these circumstances had no legal relevance . The case would normally be greeted with a gracious non - indictment . ... Our photographer can hardly wait for justice to be done and to finish his studies now , DATE after he proceeded to DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with ORG against the journalist PERSON and B.B.O. , editor - in - chief of the newspaper , accusing them of defamation , an offence under LAW in force at the time . The applicant alleged that the facts described in the article were not true and that , together with the photographs , they had seriously damaged his reputation . In this connection , the applicant claimed from the CARDINAL defendants MONEY ( ORG ) for non - pecuniary damage and RON CARDINAL for pecuniary damage . As to the compensation for pecuniary damage the applicant alleged that owing to the publication of the article and the photographs in question he could no longer be promoted to a higher position within the university .", "CARDINAL . R.C. and B.B.O. did not appear before the court , although they had been summoned on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL witnesses for the applicant were heard by the court . PERSON stated that as far as he knew the applicant , the facts described in the article in dispute were not true . PERSON made a statement in support of the compensation claimed by the applicant for pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the CARDINAL defendants . It decided that they had not intended to defame the applicant , since they had merely brought to the public \u2019s attention certain facts mentioned by other people , with whom the applicant did not have a good relationship . With respect to the photographs complained about , the court briefly held that \u201c ... it is not clear from the photos whether the person photographed is or is not the injured party [ the applicant ] \u201d . The court further rejected the applicant \u2019s compensation claim , stating that there was no connection between the GPE acts and the damage alleged .", "CARDINAL . An appeal on points of law ( recurs ) brought by the applicant against this decision was allowed by ORG on DATE . It ordered a retrial of the case , due to the fact that the CARDINAL defendants had not been identified and heard by the lower court .", "CARDINAL . A search conducted by the police concluded that B.B.O. had written the article in question under the alias of PERSON did not appear before the court , although he had been summoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted B.B.O. and rejected the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation . Quoting the ORG \u2019s caselaw on freedom of expression , ORG held that the applicant was a public figure and was hence exposed to criticism . The court also held that the defendant had not intended to defame the applicant , as he had just published information that he had collected from other people , such as students , professors , and so on . It also held :", "\u201c The publication of the compromising photos accompanied by comments concerning the ORG identity is a shocking way of exercising the freedom of expression guaranteed by LAW . ...", "Restricting the ability to publish documents because [ they ] might harm a person \u2019s dignity would not be a necessary measure in a NORP society where the journalist \u2019s sources were credible .", "As regards crimes against dignity committed through the media , a journalist \u2019s investigation is always important and is based on direct and indirect sources , official documents and documents collected through leaked information , official and private statements , some confidential , not all free from doubt . What must be proved beyond any doubt is the journalist \u2019s bad faith which , in the current case , has not been proved .", "The statements of witnesses ORG and PERSON , colleagues and friends of the applicant , with respect to his personality and professional reputation are credible , but strictly only prove the perception of these people . \u201d", "The court analysed the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation from the standpoint of LAW and decided to reject the claim for non - pecuniary damage since the defendant \u2019s guilt had not been proved , and the claim for pecuniary damage as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against this decision , alleging that the defendant had not been summoned at the correct address and that , in his absence , the judges could not have correctly established the facts or whether he had acted in good or bad faith . The applicant further submitted that B.B.O. had not acted in good faith . Firstly , because he had never contacted him for his version of the facts and secondly , because according to his criminal record attached to the file , the journalist had several previous convictions for slander and defamation . The applicant also alleged that the journalist had made accusations which attracted criminal sanctions , and therefore their truthfulness could and should have been verified by the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG finally dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded . The court held that , even though it may have been defamatory , having in mind the applicant \u2019s profession and the media \u2019s role in a NORP society , the article in question had just drawn attention to the behaviour of a public figure in the exercise of his functions . The court further held that the defendant journalist had wanted to \u201c expose certain backstage games and interests in a higher education institution ... with a view to remedying the situation and maintaining good educational process \u201d . The applicant \u2019s specific reasons for appealing on points of law , such as the incorrect summoning and the failure to hear the defendant \u2019s statement and verify the truthfulness of the allegations published by the defendant , were not analysed by the court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
