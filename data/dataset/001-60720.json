AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-2;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of attempted blackmail and unlawful possession of a firearm . Subsequently , he was taken into detention on remand . He was suspected of having tried to blackmail NORP restaurant owners in that he together with several accomplices , all being members of a NORP association , came to their restaurants and threatened them in order to obtain money for this association . Further , the applicant was suspected of unlawful possession of a firearm , which had been found in a car he used to drive . In these and the following proceedings the applicant was represented by counsel . On DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) , after its first judgment had been quashed on appeal , acquitted the applicant and his co - accused giving them the benefit of the doubt . The prosecution did not appeal against the acquittal . Therefore , in accordance with the relevant procedural provisions , it was not necessary to serve a written version of the judgment on the applicant , but it was sufficient to include its operative part without any reasons in TIME of the hearing ( so - called abridged version of TIME and judgment \u2013 PERSON und gek\u00fcrzte ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after a first decision on the applicant \u2019s compensation claim for detention on remand under LAW DATE ( ORG DATE , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) had been quashed on appeal , again dismissed the applicant \u2019s compensation claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandes - gericht ) , upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , quashed ORG decision on the ground that it did not contain sufficient reasons . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the decision violated the presumption of innocence it noted that ORG in the GPE v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) had not challenged the conformity with LAW ) of LAW . Following an acquittal it was still admissible to examine the question whether the suspicion had been dispelled as long as the assessment did not go beyond the reasons given for the acquittal . It , therefore , instructed ORG to state the reasons for the acquittal of the applicant , which were not included in the abridged version of TIME and judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon , ORG supplemented the TIME accordingly , stating that the evidence before it did not carry a finding of guilt . As to the charge of attempted blackmail it noted that in the second set of proceedings the witnesses , namely the restaurant owners concerned , had given a weakened version of their previous statements . They said in particular that the applicant and his accomplices had not directly menaced them and that they had only been frightened as the applicant and his co - accused clearly asked for money and announced that they would return . Although the witnesses now tried to describe the incidents at issue as favourably to the accused as possible and although their statements were insufficient for a conviction , they had disproved the defence of the applicant who had claimed that he had only come to the respective restaurants to distribute posters without ever having requested donations . As to the second charge the court found that the evidentiary basis was sufficient to prove only that the applicant had access to the car in which the firearm had been found .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s compensation claim under LAW . Its main line of argument ran as follows :", "\u201c For his part , the applicant stated that he had not collected any donations at the material time . However , in the light of the ORG testimony that point of his defence was revealed to be untrue . It follows that he lied in order to conceal something . Even if , in view of the very much weakened witness evidence , a conviction was no longer possible as the principle of the \u2018 benefit of the PERSON had to be applied in the accused \u2019s favour , it can not be said that the suspicion attaching to the applicant and the other defendants acquitted with him was entirely dispelled in the second set of proceedings . As stated in the full reasoning of the decision [ of DATE ] , the witnesses gave the impression that they now wished to exonerate the accused DATE particularly the applicant \u2013 but on the basis of their testimony the possibility that they felt threatened when the accused demanded money from them can not be excluded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision . He contested , in particular , that the suspicion against him had not been dissipated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , as in all the previous proceedings , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found in essence that ORG decision was duly based on the reasons given for the acquittal :", "\u201c As clearly emerges from the full reasoning of its judgment , the trial court acquitted the applicant solely because in the second set of proceedings the restaurant owners departed from their previous depositions , which had strongly incriminated him , in such a manner that the requisite standard of proof of guilt could not be met . However , in its reasoning , the trial court makes clear reference to a number of circumstances duly supported by the evidence in the case file DATE which meant that the suspicion attaching to the applicant had not been entirely dispelled . In particular the judge states that during the trial he formed the personal impression that , in view of the specific manner in which the applicant and his fellows had acted , the prosecution witnesses had good , objectively - founded reason to fear reprisals in the form of violent attacks if they did not make the donations demanded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following communication of the present application to the respondent Government , the Procurator General filed a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes ) with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the courts\u2019 failure to hold a public hearing and to pronounce their decisions publicly violated section CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act taken in conjunction with LAW . It , therefore , quashed ORG decision of DATE as well as the decision of CARDINAL DATE by ORG and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having held a public hearing , again dismissed the applicant \u2019s compensation claim . At the close of the hearing the judge pronounced the decision orally . In the written version of the decision the court used exactly the same wording for a reasoning as it had already used in its previous decision of DATE ( see above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It confirmed ORG view that the suspicion against the applicant had not been dissipated , using the same reasoning as in it previous decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see above ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of ORG DATE read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A right to compensation arises : ...", "( b ) where the injured party has been placed in detention or remanded in custody by a domestic court on suspicion of having committed an offence making him liable to criminal prosecution in GPE ... and is subsequently acquitted of the alleged offence or otherwise freed from prosecution and the suspicion that he committed the offence has been dispelled or the prosecution is excluded on other grounds , in so far as these grounds existed when he was arrested ; ... \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A court which acquits a person or otherwise frees him from prosecution ... ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) or ( c ) ) must decide either of its own motion or at the request of the individual in question or the public prosecutor \u2019s office whether the conditions for compensation under LAW b ) or ( c ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) have been satisfied or whether there is a ground for refusal under section CARDINAL . ...", "( CARDINAL ) Once the judgment rendered in the criminal proceedings has become final , the decision , which need not be made public , must , as part of the proceedings provided for in paragraph CARDINAL , be served on the detained or convicted person personally and on the public prosecutor ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE ( VfSlg CARDINAL ) ORG ruled on the constitutionality of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . It found that this provision in itself did not violate LAW which , under NORP law , had the force of constitutional law . In the light of the GPE v. GPE judgment ( of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) , it held that it was not the refusal of a claim for compensation which was contrary to the Convention , but the re - examination of the question of guilt after a final acquittal . In ORG view only the separate re - assessment of evidence on the basis of the contents of the whole court file was likely to infringe the presumption of innocence . Nevertheless , ORG observed that it would be desirable to amend section DATE ) of the DATE Act in order to clarify the law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
