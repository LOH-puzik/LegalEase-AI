On DATE , the applicant recovered possession of the flat .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the public authorities in GPE have frequently intervened in residential tenancy legislation with the aim of controlling rents . This has been achieved by rent freezes ( occasionally relaxed when the Government decreed statutory increases ) , by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the postponement , suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession . The relevant domestic law concerning the extension of tenancies , the suspension of enforcement and the staggering of evictions is described in the ORG 's judgment in the case of ORG GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINAL-V. Lastly , for some cases , a suspension of the enforcement of the orders for possession until DATE was introduced by Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , which became PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the control of the rents , the evolution of the NORP legislation may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first relevant measure was the PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE which provided machinery for \u201c fair rents \u201d ( the so - called equo canone ) on the basis of a number of criteria such as the surface of the flat and its costs of realisation .", "CARDINAL . The second step of the NORP authorities dated DATE . It was taken in the view of progressive liberalisation of the market of tenancies . Accordingly , a legislation relaxing on rent levels restrictions ( the so - called patti in deroga ) entered into force . Owners and tenants were in principle given the opportunity to derogate from the rent imposed by law and to agree on a different price .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE reformed the tenancies and liberalised the rents .", "CARDINAL . The tenant is under a general obligation to refund the owner any damages caused in the case of late restitution of the flat . In this regard , Article CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code provides :", "\u201c The tenant who fails to vacate the immovable property is under an obligation to pay the owner the agreed amount until DATE when he leaves , together with other remaining damages \u201d .", "CARDINAL . However , PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE set out , inter alia , a limit to the compensation claimable by the owner entitling him to a sum equal to the rent paid by the tenant at the time of the expiration of the lease , proportionally increased according to the cost of living ( LAW of DATE ) plus PERCENT , along the period of inability to dispose of the possession of the flat .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG was called upon to decide whether such a limitation complied with LAW . ORG held that it was compatible with the LAW with regard to periods of time during which the suspension of the evictions was determined by law . ORG explained that the introduction of that limitation was intended to settle the tenancies of the time of the emergency legislation , when the housing shortage made the suspension of the enforcement necessary . While evictions were suspended ex lege , the law predetermined the quantum of the reimbursement chargeable to the tenant , both measures being temporary and exceptional . Besides , the interests of the owner were counterbalanced by the exemption for him from the burden to prove the damages .", "CARDINAL . ORG declared the limitation to the compensation claimable by the owner unconstitutional with regard to cases where the impossibility for the owner to repossess the flat depended on the conduct of the tenant and was not due to a legislative intervention . Accordingly , it opened the way to owners for the institution of civil proceedings in order to obtain full reparation of the damages caused by the tenant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
