{"ITEMID": "001-93151", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2009, "DOCNAME": "DITZ v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicants\u2019 first child was born with severe physical disabilities , having , inter alia , no arms and hands , a shortened thigh and serious hip dysplasia .", "The applicants brought a civil action in ORG , seeking alimony and compensation for non - pecuniary damage from the attending gynaecologist . They argued that , had the mother been informed about the disability , she would have opted for an abortion .", "During a hearing , ORG conveyed to the parties its intention to first take evidence on the question of whether the gynaecologist had committed a grave diagnostic error . On DATE ORG informed the applicants that , contrary to its earlier intention , the taking of evidence would commence with the issue of whether an abortion would have been legally possible .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the action in its entirety . It considered that it could leave open the question of whether the gynaecologist had committed a grave diagnostic error as the alimony claim required proof of whether , had the parents been informed of the disability , an abortion would have been legally possible . The court found that , for the abortion to be legal , the applicants had to demonstrate that it would have been the only reasonable means to avert a risk for the mother \u2019s life or severe interference with her physical or mental integrity . Referring to an expert report , the court found that the mother had not demonstrated that an abortion could have been legally possible . The expert had noted in his report that the applicants had failed to submit sufficient documents and provide sufficient facts from the time of the pregnancy to allow him to come to the conclusion that the requirements for a legal abortion were met . The applicants appealed against the judgment .", "On DATE ORG notified the applicants of its intention to decide the appeal without conducting a hearing , giving the applicants DATE to make further submissions . It informed the applicants that it was of the opinion that ORG had correctly desisted from taking evidence on the alleged grave diagnostic error . As to their claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage , ORG considered that the applicants had failed to sufficiently substantiate it ; in particular , they had not explained how the shock had manifested itself and had not described the psychological condition of the mother after the birth of the child . With respect to the alimony claim , ORG also confirmed that ORG had been under no obligation to hear evidence on the alleged grave diagnostic error , as the lack of proof of the abortion \u2019s legality already meant that the claim was unfounded and that an expert opinion on the existence of the grave diagnostic error was redundant . It also rejected the ORG complaint that they had not been granted a hearing as to ORG decision to first take evidence on the question of whether the child could have been legally aborted . It observed that the applicants had had plenty of time to object to ORG decision of DATE , but had chosen not to . In so far as the applicants challenged the expert report , ORG held that the expert \u2019s conclusions , though not clearly distinguishing between issues of law and fact , had been sufficiently clear . The expert had found that no documents or indications existed that demonstrated an elevated risk of grave interference with the mother \u2019s mental integrity , either during the pregnancy or after the delivery . ORG noted in that context that the parents had failed to submit further documentation , despite having been asked by ORG to do so . Furthermore , the expert had sufficiently explained that an examination of the mother , DATE after the delivery of the baby , would have been inconclusive without further documentary proof .", "On DATE the applicants made further submissions to ORG .", "On DATE ORG , referring to the reasoning set out in its decision of DATE , dismissed the appeal without holding a hearing , also dismissing the ORG further submissions contesting the expert report .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an objection alleging a violation of the right to be heard ( Anh\u00f6rungsr\u00fcge ) as being manifestly illfounded . The applicants had been informed of the reasons why it intended to dismiss the appeal . It had addressed all the arguments put forward by the applicants , in particular the submissions concerning the claim for damages , the requirements of the legality of the abortion , the challenges against the expert report , and the alleged denial of the right to be heard .", "On DATE ORG held that the constitutional complaint by the applicants had no prospect of success as there was no appearance of a violation of the right to be heard or the principle of equality of arms ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
