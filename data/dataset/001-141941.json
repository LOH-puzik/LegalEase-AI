On DATE in GPE , the first applicant married the second applicant , whom he had met during CARDINAL of CARDINAL visits to GPE made in DATE prior to their marriage . The second applicant was born in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at ORG in GPE in GPE , the second applicant requested a residence permit for GPE with reference to her marriage to the first applicant . At that time she was DATE . She stated that she had not visited GPE . Her parents lived in GPE .

On DATE ORG upheld the decision by ORG of DATE to refuse to grant the second applicant a residence permit . It noted in particular that the second applicant had always lived in GPE and had family there , and that the first applicant had ties with GPE and had , among other things , attended school there for DATE . Finally , it found that the family could settle in GPE , as that would only require that the first applicant obtain employment there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before ORG of Eastern GPE ( PERSON ) , the applicants instituted proceedings against ORG and relied on LAW , alone and in conjunction with LAW , as well as LAW . They submitted , among other things , that it amounted to indirect discrimination against them when applying for family reunion , that persons who were born NORP citizens were exempt from the attachment requirement altogether , whereas persons who had acquired NORP citizenship at a later point in life had to comply with the CARDINAL-year rule before being exempted from the attachment requirement . In the present case that would entail that the first applicant could not be exempted from the attachment requirement until DATE , thus after DATE of NORP citizenship , and after having reached DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of Eastern GPE unanimously found that the refusal to grant the applicants family reunion with reference to the DATE rule and the attachment requirement did not contravene the Articles of the Convention or the European Convention on Nationality relied on . It stated as follows :", "\u201c ... the facts given in the decisions of the immigration authorities in the case are found not to be disputed .", "Hence , [ the second applicant ] who is a NORP national , was thus DATE when she applied for a residence permit on DATE , and she had no other ties with GPE than her recent marriage to [ the first applicant ] . [ The second applicant ] had always lived in GPE and had family there . [ The first applicant ] had some ties with GPE , where he had lived with his uncle while attending school in GPE for DATE . He entered GPE in DATE at DATE and became a NORP national on DATE . [ The applicants ] married in GPE on DATE and have lived in GPE since DATE with their child , born on DATE . [ The first applicant ] has told ORG that the family can settle lawfully in GPE if he obtains paid employment in GPE .", "It appears from a ORG judgment of DATE , reproduced on page CARDINAL in the NORP Weekly Law Reports ( ORG for DATE , that LAW does not impose on ORG any general obligation to respect immigrants\u2019 choice of the country of their residence in connection with marriage , or otherwise to authorise family reunion .", "In view of the information on [ the applicants\u2019 ] situation and their ties with GPE , ORG accordingly finds no basis for setting aside the Defendant \u2019s decision establishing that [ the applicants\u2019 ] aggregate ties with GPE were stronger than their aggregate ties with GPE and that [ the applicants ] therefore did not meet the attachment requirement set out in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW . In this connection , the High Court finds that the refusal did not bar [ the applicants ] from exercising their right to family life in GPE or in a country other than GPE . The fact that [ the first applicant ] is only able to reside in GPE if he obtains paid employment there is found not to lead to any other assessment . Accordingly , ORG holds that the decision of ORG did not constitute a breach of LAW .", "Although ORG has held that LAW has not been breached in this case , ORG has to consider [ the applicants\u2019 ] claim that , within the substantive area otherwise protected by DATE , the decision of ORG constituted a breach of Article CARDINAL read in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of the Convention .", "ORG initially observes that [ the first applicant ] had been residing in GPE for DATE when the ORG made its decision . Although he acquired NORP nationality in DATE , DATE after his entry to GPE , he did not meet the CARDINAL-year nationality requirement applicable to all NORP nationals pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW , irrespective of whether they are of foreign or NORP extraction . Nor did he have the comparable attachment to GPE throughout DATE which will generally lead to an exemption from the attachment requirement according to the preparatory works to the DATE statutory amendment .", "The CARDINAL-year rule is a generally worded relaxation of the attachment requirement based on an objective criterion . In practice , however , the rule may imply that a NORP national of foreign extraction will only meet the CARDINAL-year rule later in life than would be the case for a NORP national of NORP extraction . When applied , the rule may therefore imply an indirect discrimination .", "According to the relevant explanatory report , LAW must be taken to mean that LAW concerns the conditions for acquiring nationality while LAW concerns the principle of non - discrimination . According to the report , it is not a mandatory rule that GPE are obliged to observe in all situations . Against that background , LAW is considered to offer protection against discrimination to an extent that goes no further than the protection against discrimination offered by LAW .", "The assessment of whether the refusal of the ORG implied discrimination amounting to a breach of LAW read in conjunction with LAW is accordingly considered to depend on whether the difference in treatment which occurred as a consequence of the attachment requirement despite the nationality can be considered objectively justified and proportionate .", "According to the preparatory works to the LAW , the overall aim of the attachment requirement , which is a requirement of lasting and strong links to GPE , is to regulate spousal reunion in GPE in such manner as best to ensure the integration of immigrants in GPE , which aim must in itself be considered objective . In the view of ORG , difference in treatment between NORP nationals of NORP extraction and NORP nationals of foreign extraction can therefore be justified by this aim relative to the right to spousal reunion if a NORP national of foreign extraction has no such lasting and strong attachment to GPE .", "The balancing of this overall consideration relative to the specific circumstances in the case requires a detailed assessment . The High Court finds that the assessment and decision of the Ministry were made in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW and the preparatory works describing the application of the provision . Accordingly , and in view of the specific information on [ the first applicant \u2019s ] situation , the High Court finds no sufficient basis for holding that the refusal by the Ministry to grant a residence permit to [ the second applicant ] with reference to the attachment requirement of LAW implies a disproportionate infringement of [ the first applicant \u2019s ] rights as a NORP national and his right to family life . ORG therefore finds that the decision of ORG was not invalid , and that it was not contrary to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the judgment to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , which passed its judgment on DATE confirming the ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG found , unanimously , that it was not in breach of LAW to refuse the second applicant a residence permit in GPE . It stated as follows :", "\u201c By its decision of DATE , ORG refused the application from [ the second applicant ] for a residence permit on the grounds that the aggregate ties of herself and her spouse [ the first applicant ] with GPE were not stronger than their aggregate ties with GPE , see section CARDINAL , subsection DATE , of LAW .", "[ The applicants ] first submitted that the refusal was unlawful because it was contrary to LAW . If the refusal was not contrary to LAW , they submitted as their alternative claim that it was contrary to the prohibition against discrimination enshrined in LAW read in conjunction with LAW , for which reason they were eligible for family reunion in GPE without satisfying the attachment requirement set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act .", "For the reasons given by ORG , ORG upholds the decision made by ORG that it is not contrary to Article CARDINAL to refuse [ the second applicant \u2019s ] application for a residence permit . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the majority of ORG ( CARDINAL judges ) found that the DATE rule was in compliance with LAW in conjunction with LAW . They stated as follows :", "CARDINAL . A minority of CARDINAL judges was of the view that the DATE rule implied an indirect discrimination between persons who were born NORP citizens and persons who had acquired NORP citizenship later in their life . Since persons who were born NORP citizens would usually be of NORP ethnic origin whereas persons who acquired NORP citizenship at a later point in their life would generally be of foreign ethnic origin , the CARDINAL-year rule also entailed an indirect discrimination between ethnic NORP citizens and NORP citizens with a foreign ethnic background . More specifically , they stated :", "\u201c As stated by the majority , the requirement of section CARDINAL , subsection DATE , of LAW that the spouses\u2019 or ORG aggregate ties with GPE must be stronger than their aggregate ties with another country ( the attachment requirement ) does not apply when the resident person has been a NORP national for DATE ( the CARDINAL-year rule ) .", "The CARDINAL-year rule applies both to persons born NORP nationals and to persons acquiring NORP nationality later in life , but in reality the significance of the rule differs greatly for the CARDINAL groups of NORP nationals . For persons born NORP nationals , the rule only implies that the attachment requirement applies until they are DATE . For persons not raised in GPE who acquire NORP nationality later in life , the rule implies that the attachment requirement applies until DATE have passed after the date when any such person became a NORP national . As an example , [ the first applicant ] who became a NORP national at DATE , will be subject to the attachment requirement until he is DATE . The CARDINAL-year rule therefore implies that the major restriction of the right to spousal reunion resulting from the attachment requirement will affect persons who only acquire NORP nationality later in life far more often and with a far greater impact than persons born with NORP nationality . Hence , the CARDINAL-year rule results in obvious indirect difference in treatment between the CARDINAL groups of NORP nationals .", "The vast majority of persons born NORP nationals will be of NORP ethnic origin , while persons acquiring NORP nationality later in life will generally be of other ethnic origin . At the same time , the CARDINAL-year rule therefore implies obvious indirect difference in treatment between NORP nationals of NORP ethnic origin and NORP nationals of other ethnic origin regarding the right to spousal reunion .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , the attachment requirement may be disregarded if exceptional reasons make it appropriate . According to the preparatory works to LAW , this possibility of exemption is to be administered in such a manner that aliens who were born and raised in GPE or who came to GPE as small children and were raised here must be treated comparably to NORP nationals , which means that they will be exempt from the attachment requirement when they have lawfully resided in GPE for DATE . However , relative to persons who were not raised in GPE , but acquire NORP nationality later in life , this does not alter the situation described above concerning the indirect difference in treatment implied by the CARDINAL-year rule .", "When the attachment requirement was introduced by Act No . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , all NORP nationals were exempt from the requirement . Act No . CARDINAL of DATE made the attachment requirement generally applicable also to NORP nationals . Concerning the reason for this , the preparatory works to the LAW state , inter alia : \u201c With resident aliens and NORP nationals of foreign extraction it is a widespread marriage pattern to marry a person from their countries of origin , among other reasons due to parental pressure [ ... ] . The Government finds that the attachment requirement , as it is worded DATE , does not take sufficient account of the existence of this marriage pattern among both resident foreigners and resident NORP nationals of foreign extraction . There are thus also NORP nationals who are not well - integrated in NORP society and where integration of a spouse newly arrived in GPE may therefore entail major problems . \u201d By Act No . CARDINAL of DATE , the application of the attachment requirement to NORP nationals was restricted through the CARDINAL-year rule , and the preparatory works to the LAW stated that the purpose was , inter alia , \u201c to ensure that NORP expatriates with strong and lasting ties to GPE in the form of DATE of NORP nationality will be able to obtain spousal reunion in GPE \u201d . In the light of these notes , it is considered a fact that the indirect difference in treatment between NORP nationals of NORP ethnic extraction and NORP nationals of other ethnic extraction following from the CARDINAL-year rule is an intended consequence .", "Under LAW , the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognised by the LAW , including the individual \u2019s right under LAW for his or her family life , must be \u201c secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , association with a national minority , property , birth or other status . \u201d As mentioned above , the CARDINAL-year rule implies both indirect difference in treatment between persons born NORP nationals and persons only acquiring NORP nationality later in life and , in the same connection , indirect difference in treatment between NORP nationals of NORP ethnic extraction and NORP nationals of other ethnic extraction . Both these types of indirect difference in treatment must be considered to fall within Article CARDINAL read in conjunction with Article CARDINAL of the Convention . The QUANTITY types of indirect difference in treatment implied by the CARDINAL-year rule are therefore contrary to LAW unless the difference in treatment can be considered objectively justified and proportionate .", "LAW of DATE , which has been ratified by GPE , provides in LAW : \u201c ORG shall be guided by the principle of non - discrimination between its nationals , whether they are nationals by birth or have acquired its nationality subsequently . \u201d The memorandum of DATE made by ORG and the memorandum of DATE made by the working group composed of representatives of ORG , ORG and ORG state that the provision solely concerns issues on the revocation and loss of nationality . In our opinion it is dubious whether there is any basis for such restrictive interpretation as the provision , according to its wording , comprises any difference in treatment exercised as a consequence of how and when nationality was acquired . As appears from the explanatory report , the provision is not a prohibition from which no derogation may be made , and the provision must be taken to mean that it may be derogated from if the difference in treatment is objectively justified and proportionate . However , when assessing the CARDINAL-year rule relative to LAW read in conjunction with LAW , we consider it necessary to include the fact that , at least according to its wording , LAW comprises a general provision stating that any difference in treatment between different groups of ORG own nationals is basically prohibited .", "In an assessment made under LAW read in conjunction with LAW , another factor to be taken into consideration is the crucial importance of being entitled to settle with one \u2019s spouse in the country of one \u2019s nationality .", "As mentioned , NORP nationals were originally generally exempt from the attachment requirement . ORG established in a judgment reproduced on p. CARDINAL in the NORP Weekly Law Reports for DATE that discrimination relative to the right to spousal reunion based on whether the resident spouse is a NORP or foreign national is not contrary to the prohibition of discrimination laid down in LAW read in conjunction with LAW . In this respect , ORG referred to paragraphs CARDINAL of the judgment delivered by ORG DATE in ORG and NORP v. GPE . Difference in treatment based on nationality must be seen , inter alia , in the light of the right of NORP nationals to settle in GPE , and no significance can be attributed to the fact that such discrimination is not considered contrary to LAW CARDINAL when assessing whether it is permissible to implement a scheme implying difference in treatment between different groups of NORP nationals . In our opinion , no crucial significance can be attributed to paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Abdulaziz , Cabales and NORP judgment either in this assessment , among others because difference in treatment based on the length of a person \u2019s period of nationality is not comparable to difference in treatment based on place of birth .", "In the cases in which the attachment requirement applies , some of the factors emphasised are whether the resident spouse has strong links to GPE by virtue of his or her childhood and schooling in GPE . Such strong attachment to GPE will exist in most cases in which a person has held NORP nationality for DATE . However , when assessing whether the difference in treatment implied by the CARDINAL-year rule can be considered objectively justified , it is not sufficient to compare persons not raised in GPE who acquire NORP nationality later in life with the large group of persons who were born NORP nationals and were also raised in GPE . If exemption from the attachment requirement was justified only by regard for the latter group of NORP nationals , the exemption should have been delimited differently . The crucial element must therefore be a comparison with persons who were born NORP nationals and have been NORP nationals for DATE , but who were not raised in GPE and may perhaps not at any time have had their residence in GPE . In our opinion , it can not be considered a fact that , from a general perspective , this group of NORP nationals has stronger ties with GPE than persons who have acquired NORP nationality after entering and residing in GPE for DATE . It should be taken into consideration in that connection that one of the general conditions for acquiring NORP nationality by naturalisation is that the relevant person has resided in GPE for DATE , has proved his or her proficiency in the NORP language and knowledge of NORP society and meets the requirement of self - support .", "Against that background , it is our opinion that the indirect difference in treatment implied by the DATE rule can not be considered objectively justified , and that it is therefore contrary to LAW .", "The consequence of this must be that , when applying section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW to NORP nationals , the authorities must limit the CARDINAL-year rule to being solely an age requirement , meaning that the attachment requirement does not apply in cases in which the resident spouse is a NORP national and is DATE .", "Accordingly , we vote for ruling in favour of the [ applicants\u2019 ] claim to the effect that ORG must declare invalid the decision of DATE , thereby remitting the case for renewed consideration .", "In view of the outcome of the voting on this claim we see no reason to consider the claim for compensation . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
