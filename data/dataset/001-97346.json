As follows from the trial judgment and the trial record , the applicant contended at the trial that he had purchased the fuel on or DATE at a petrol station ; on DATE he had put the cans in his car intending to exchange it for firewood later and went to his work ; after DATE he was stopped by the police on his way home ; when stopped he had not told about the purchase of the fuel because he felt intimidated and had no receipt to prove the purchase . He contended that PERSON , who was in his car on DATE , had seen the applicant purchase the fuel at the petrol station . At the trial the applicant was asked if the inspection record had been drawn up on the spot or in Birofeld . The applicant replied as follows :", "\u201c [ The police ] started to draw up the inspection record on the spot . Then a bus arrived . There was a tense situation so we left . The bus was also inspected ...", "The inspection record was signed in Birofeld . It was started on the spot but was not finished there . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to the court an invoice for the purchase of diesel . The court refused to accept the invoice in evidence considering that the applicant did not specify why he had not adduced that evidence at the initial stage of the questioning by the police or at the opening of the trial . The applicant , however , indicated that the invoice had been kept by his wife . It also appears that he specified the name and location of the petrol station where he had allegedly bought it and asked the court to verify this fact . It appears that the court did not follow up his request .", "CARDINAL . The trial court heard the applicant 's wife , who claimed that she had purchased the fuel and had given one petrol can to the applicant and that the applicant had purchased the remainder . The court also questioned PERSON who claimed to have seen the applicant purchasing diesel . PERSON was with the applicant on DATE and told the court that he had not witnessed any threats to the applicant from the police officers . The trial court refused to take those testimonies into consideration , considering that those persons were in close or friendly relationship with the defendant and that their testimonies would therefore be prejudiced .", "CARDINAL . Instead , the trial judge relied on the inspection record and the written statement made by the applicant on DATE , testimonies from the attesting witnesses who had been present during the inspection and seizure of fuel from the applicant 's car . The court also examined a Mr F who explained there had been cases of workers pouring out diesel from their service vehicles , and thus the company 's director had asked the competent authorities to carry out checks . The applicant 's car was apparently stopped during one of the checks .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the evidence , the judge considered that as followed from the inspection record , the applicant had admitted to \u201c have stolen \u201d the diesel from the company LOC . By a judgment of DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of theft and sentenced him to a suspended sentence of DATE imprisonment . The court held as follows :", "\u201c It follows from the inspection record that CARDINAL cans of diesel ( QUANTITY ) were seized from [ the applicant 's ] car ... The applicant explained that he had stolen the diesel from the company LOC ...", "Assessing the defendant 's testimony at the trial , the court considers that it is made - up with a view to avoiding criminal responsibility for the crime committed ; this testimony has not been supported by any objective evidence . The court takes into account his pre - trial testimony , from which it follows that on DATE after the end of his working day he had poured out fuel from his service vehicle and was stopped on his way back home . This testimony is logical and corresponds to witness statement by Mr F , PERSON and Mr P , as well as to the materials in the case file . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his counsel appealed alleging that there was no proof that any diesel had been stolen from the company and that the applicant had not been apprised of the privilege against self - incrimination while the court then relied on his admissions made on DATE . In his appeal , the prosecutor considered that the applicant 's acts should be reclassified as misappropriation of property . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals and upheld the judgment . The court confirmed that the applicant had been convicted on the basis of his own pre - trial admission and other evidence obtained by lawful means , including the inspection record . The applicant 's allegation of self - incrimination had been rightly rejected as unfounded .", "CARDINAL .

If no preliminary inquiry or investigation was required in the case , counsel could participate in the proceedings from DATE when the case was submitted for trial ( LAW ) .
