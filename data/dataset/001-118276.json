The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave birth to a healthy baby boy in ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , a ORG - run hospital .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , while still in the ORG , the applicant had regular contact with her son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed by the doctors that both she and her son would be discharged DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was with her son until TIME on DATE , when he was taken to a separate room for newborn babies . This was standard procedure and the applicant \u2019s son had experienced no medical problems up to that point .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the duty doctor informed the applicant that \u201c her baby ha[d ] died \u201d . Upon hearing this , the applicant immediately ran down the corridor towards the room where her son had spent TIME . She was physically restrained by CARDINAL orderlies , however . A nurse even tried to inject her with a sedative , but the applicant successfully resisted the attempt . Ultimately , having no other option and being in a state of shock , the applicant checked out of the ORG . Her relatives were subsequently told that the autopsy of the infant would be performed in GPE , which was why his body could not yet be released to the parents . The applicant and her family remained confused as to why the autopsy would have to be carried out in GPE , as this was clearly a departure from the ORG \u2019s normal practice .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , and particularly from DATE , the NORP media started reporting extensively on numerous cases similar to the applicant \u2019s ( see , for example , http://www.kradjabeba.org , accessed on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a request to the ORG , seeking all relevant documentation relating to her son \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed by the ORG that her son had died on DATE , at TIME , and that his death had occurred from an unknown cause . The ORG maintained that no other information was available because its archives had been flooded in the meantime and many documents had been destroyed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the applicant \u2019s request , ORG informed her that her son \u2019s birth had been registered in the municipal records but that his death had not .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s husband ( the child \u2019s father ) lodged a criminal complaint with the PERSON municipal public prosecutor \u2019s office against the medical staff of the ORG , whom the applicant deemed responsible for \u201c her son \u2019s abduction \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG municipal public prosecutor \u2019s office rejected the complaint as unsubstantiated , since \u201c there was evidence that [ the applicant \u2019s ] son had died on DATE \u201d . No further reasoning was offered and there was no indication as to whether any preliminary investigation had been carried out .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE reaffirmed the content of its letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG provided the applicant with its internal records in support of its letter dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE confirmed that the death of the applicant \u2019s son had never been formally registered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE provided the applicant with copies of her son \u2019s birth certificate , in response to her earlier demand , together with the ORG \u2019s request for registration of the birth .", "CARDINAL . The body of the applicant \u2019s son was never released to the applicant or her family . Nor were they ever provided with an autopsy report or informed as to when and where he was allegedly buried .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the ORG regularly treated the applicant for , inter alia , various depression - related symptoms dating back to DATE and especially DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a meeting organised by ORG on DATE on the burial of newborn babies who had died in hospital it was decided , inter alia , that the bodies could only be released to the parents if the latter signed a special form designed for this purpose .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a specific request sent to them by the ORG - run funeral company ( ORG PERSON ) on DATE , all GPE - based public health - care institutions also agreed , inter alia , to implement a procedure whereby a special declaration would have to be signed ( a ) by the parents , or other family members , stating that they had been informed of the death by the hospital and that they would personally be making the funeral arrangements , or ( b ) by a legal entity , or its representative , to the effect that it would be making these arrangements because others had refused or were unable to do so . In the absence of such declarations , the ORG - run funeral company would refuse to collect the bodies from the hospitals .", "CARDINAL . In DATE CARDINAL of parents in the same situation as that of the applicant , namely , whose newborn babies had \u201c gone missing \u201d following their alleged deaths in hospital wards , especially in DATE , DATE and DATE , applied to ORG seeking redress .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG formally adopted a report prepared by ORG established for this purpose . The findings of this report concluded , inter alia , that ( a ) there had been serious shortcomings in the applicable legislation at the relevant time and in the procedures before various ORG bodies and health authorities ; ( b ) the situation justified the GPE doubts or concerns as to what had really happened to their children ; ( c ) no criminal redress could now be effective in view of the applicable limitation periods ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; and ( d ) a concerted effort on the part of all government bodies , as well as changes to the relevant legislation , were therefore necessary in order to provide the parents with adequate redress .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local media reported that the President of ORG had stated that a parliamentary working group was about to be formed in order to prepare new legislation aimed at providing redress to the parents of the \u201c missing babies \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following an extensive investigation into the issue , the ORG found , inter alia , that ( a ) at the relevant time , there were no coherent procedures and/or statutory regulations as to what should happen in situations where a newborn baby died in hospital ; ( b ) the prevailing medical opinion was that parents should be spared the mental pain of having to bury their newborn babies , which was why it was quite possible that certain couples were deliberately deprived of the opportunity to do so ; ( c ) any autopsy reports were usually incomplete , inconclusive , and of highly dubious veracity ; ( d ) it could not therefore be ruled out that the babies in question were indeed removed from their families unlawfully ; ( e ) turning to more recent times , the government response DATE had itself been inadequate ; and ( f ) the parents therefore remained entitled to know the truth about the real fate of their children , which could only be arrived at through the enactment of a lex specialis .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the findings and recommendations of ORG of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , a working group was set up by ORG on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Its task was to assess the situation and propose any appropriate changes to the legislation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the working group submitted its report to ORG . Following a detailed analysis of the current , already amended , legislation , it concluded that no changes were necessary except as regards the collection and use of medical data , but that a new piece of legislation concerning this issue was already being prepared ( nacrt PERSON o evidencijama u oblasti zdravstva ) . The working group specifically noted , inter alia , that LAW made it impossible to extend the limitation period for criminal prosecution in respect of crimes committed in the past or , indeed , to introduce new , more serious , criminal offences and/or harsher penalties applicable to crimes committed in the past ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The existing Criminal Code already envisaged several criminal offences of relevance to the issue , however , and the new LAW set out a detailed procedure making it impossible for parents to have their newborn babies unlawfully removed from hospital wards ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c No one shall be convicted on account of any act which did not constitute a criminal offence under the law or any other regulation based on the law at the time when it was committed .

Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL further provides that if the damage in issue has been caused as a result of the commission of a criminal offence , the civil limitation period may be extended so as to correspond to the applicable criminal statute of limitations .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) held that civil limitation periods concerning various forms of non - pecuniary damage ( see paragraphs DATE above ) would not start running until the situation complained of had come to an end ( kada su pojedini vidovi neimovinske \u0161tete dobili oblik kona\u010dnog stanja ) .", "CARDINAL .
