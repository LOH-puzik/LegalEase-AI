On DATE the applicant lodged a counterclaim seeking to have her title to the flat recognised by the court . She contended that she had purchased the flat in good faith ( as a bona fide buyer ) and that she had not known that Mr S. had had no right to sell it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) granted the claim of ORG . The court found that , since PERSON had died on DATE , the flat exchange and all the subsequent transactions in respect of the flat should be declared null and void . The court refused to recognise the applicant as a bona fide buyer , having found that she could and should have known of the \u201c informational ban \u201d imposed on the flat , of which the registration service had informed her representative on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By an additional judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the counterclaims lodged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the judgments of DATE and DATE on appeal and remitted the case to ORG for a fresh examination by a different bench . In particular , the court held that ORG refusal to recognise the applicant as a bona fide buyer had not been based on sufficient grounds . Furthermore , having recognised ORG as the owner of the flat and having found that the flat had left GPE \u2019s possession without the latter \u2019s intention to divest itself of it , ORG had not taken into consideration that the flat exchange had not stripped the owner of its title , and that the subsequent transfer of the flat to Mr S. under the privatisation scheme had taken place with the participation of ORG . Therefore , in violation of the principle of equality of arms ORG had failed to examine why , in transferring the title to the flat to Mr S. on DATE , ORG had failed to check the circumstances under which Mr S. had acquired the right to own the flat . The court further noted in this connection that by DATE Mr P. had no longer been registered as living in the flat , as the information on his death had already been available .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the claim of ORG and dismissed the applicant \u2019s counterclaims . The court found the flat exchange and all the subsequent transactions in respect of the flat null and void . It refused to recognise the applicant as a bona fide buyer , holding that she should have known of the existence of the \u201c informational ban \u201d imposed on the flat , as it had caused a DATE \u2019s delay in the registration of her title with the ORG . The court also pointed out that the flat had been owned by Mr S. for DATE before being sold to the applicant and that the applicant had bought it below the market price , which should have raised reasonable doubts as to the legal status of the acquired property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in appellate proceedings , upheld the judgment , having endorsed ORG reasoning . It appears from the record of the appeal hearing that the plaintiff explicitly stated that it had no grounds to doubt that the applicant had bought the flat in good faith .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to institute cassation proceedings , having found no violations of material or procedural norms in the previous proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested a suspension of the execution of the judgment of DATE in so far as it concerned her eviction . On DATE ORG dismissed her request . On DATE ORG upheld that decision on appeal .", "CARDINAL .
