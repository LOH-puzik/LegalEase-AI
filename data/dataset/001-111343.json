According to the medical opinion given on DATE by PERSON , ORG own medical doctor ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsl\u00e4kare ) , it was not probable that the applicant \u2019s brain damage was connected to his work .", "By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , claiming that he had a right to life annuity .

After having examined several medical certificates and opinions , included in the applicant \u2019s case file and submitted by both parties , the court found that the medical evidence did not show that the applicant was more sensitive to solvents or that such shortterm work with solvents would have exposed him to brain damage such as he had suffered . His condition could thus not be considered as a work - related condition and he had therefore no right to life annuity .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE and maintained what he had claimed before the first instance court .

At the relevant time , it had to be \u201c highly probable \u201d that a certain factor in the working environment could cause a person \u2019s injuries and , thereby , be considered to constitute a harmful factor . The view that a certain factor is very likely to cause an injury has to be relatively generally accepted ( Govt . PERSON , pp . CARDINAL and DATE ) . This is the case where substantial knowledge exists , within medical or other science , that a certain factor has such harmful effect . If there is a lack of such support , such as , for example , profound differences in expert opinion , this requirement can not be considered fulfilled . Thus , the opinion of a specific researcher or medical doctor should not constitute a sufficient basis for a positive decision on the issue of harmful effect .", "Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW , as in force at the relevant time , was worded as follows :", "\u201c The procedure shall be in writing .", "Where it may be assumed to be advantageous for the investigation or promote the expeditious determination of the case , the processing may include an oral hearing regarding certain issues .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "In a case concerning social insurance , leave to appeal was required for ORG to consider an appeal against a decision enacted by ORG .
