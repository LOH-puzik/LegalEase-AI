The applicant was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a man who is intellectually disabled . On DATE he was taken , with his CARDINAL brothers , into public care by the child welfare authorities and placed temporarily with a foster family with whom they had already been living since DATE . The foster family lived in a village situated QUANTITY from the applicant \u2019s home town , which is in LOC .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the foster family , the applicant and one of his brothers moved to a village in GPE . The removal of the children was not authorised by the competent child welfare authority . In DATE the applicant finished his compulsory school education as a special needs student integrated into a normal school . Thereafter his foster parents planned to place him in a vocational school QUANTITY away from their village , without authorisation by the competent child welfare authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent child welfare authority decided to remove the applicant from the foster family and to place him in a disabled children \u2019s home in his home town in southern GPE . The authority found that the foster care had not been satisfactory in the light of the fact that the foster parents had made important decisions without consulting the child welfare authorities , such as moving north and planning to place the applicant in a vocational school QUANTITY away from their home . The foster parents brought an appeal in court against that decision , but the decision was upheld by ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) on DATE and subsequently by ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed in a children \u2019s home in his home town in southern GPE . CARDINAL of his brothers was placed in the same home in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant turned DATE . On DATE he began studying at a local vocational school . On DATE a mentor ( edunvalvoja , intressebevakare ) was appointed for the applicant for matters other than those pertaining to his person . The applicant could thus freely make his own decisions in matters pertaining to his own person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the social welfare authorities requested ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) to appoint a mentor for the applicant also for matters pertaining to his person . The request was , inter alia , based on the fact that a conflict had emerged between the child welfare service and the applicant \u2019s former foster parents as to where the applicant should live . The appointment of an external mentor was therefore needed in order to assess the applicant \u2019s best interests and settle the matter accordingly . The applicant as well as his biological parents were heard before the court and none of them objected to the appointment of such a mentor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the former foster parents took the applicant to the North of GPE , invoking his decision to move there to live with them . He considered them to be his real family . DATE , the social welfare authorities arrived with the police to fetch the applicant and to take him back , against his will , to his home town . He was placed in his home town in a special living unit for intellectually disabled adults .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on the basis of LAW , appointed a mentor for the applicant in matters concerning his property and economy , as well as matters pertaining to his person to the extent that the applicant was unable to understand their significance . The court found that , owing to his diminished mental faculties , the applicant was incapable of looking after his own interests and taking care of his personal affairs . The decision was based on medical records concerning the applicant \u2019s level of development and on submissions according to which the applicant was gullible and keen on small children \u2019s play . The appointed mentor was an official of the local public legal aid office entrusted with functions of this kind .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having received a psychologist \u2019s report dated DATE on the applicant , the appointed mentor decided , against the applicant \u2019s will , that it was in his best interests for him to live in his home town , where his family members also lived . He had better educational and work opportunities there than in the village in GPE , where he only knew his elderly former foster parents . The applicant was given a possibility to go for holidays to his foster parents in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to discharge the mentor appointed for him from her duties as far as matters pertaining to his place of residence and education were concerned . He requested that another person of his choosing be appointed as his mentor in those matters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having heard the applicant in person , as well as witnesses including the applicant \u2019s mentor , his former foster mother , his brother and CARDINAL staff members from his housing service , refused his request . In its judgment , the court put on record the various testimonies . According to the record of the testimony of the applicant \u2019s mentor , she had discussed with the applicant his plan to move prior to her decision . The mentor was of the view that the applicant did not understand all the consequences of the plan , and did not realise that the good things in his present situation would not be relocated with him . In the light of all the circumstances , the mentor considered that the move would have been against the applicant \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL . As regards the facts , the court recalled the background of the previous decision , taken on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The court further noted that , according to an expert evaluation dated DATE and established by a psychologist , the applicant \u2019s decision - making skills were equal to those of a child aged DATE . Consequently , the evaluation concluded that the applicant was not able to consider whether his plans about future were realistic and what consequences or implications they would have . The court noted that the applicant had told the court that he had no particular complaints about his current situation and that according to the witness statements he enjoyed his apartment and work in his home town . There was no evidence that the applicant \u2019s situation in his home town was not good . The court found that the applicant clearly did not understand what it would be like to live in a remote part of the country , especially as he had previously lived there for DATE , and what the implications of the move would be for his situation . Moreover , the court found it uncertain how clear or strong the applicant \u2019s will actually was , taking into account the evidence regarding his gullibility . It was likely that his opinion was influenced by that of the former foster parents . The applicant \u2019s development had improved in his home town and he had been able to live in a special unit for intellectually disabled adults , to go to work and to cycle independently around town . The applicant had in his home town a support network consisting of relatives , friends and staff of the social welfare authorities , a job , hobbies and educational possibilities . Due to the remote and isolated location of the former foster GPE home , the applicant would miss out on all these possibilities if he were to move there . The court further noted that according to the plan , the applicant would attend a vocational school far away from his new home , requiring DATE long - distance trips DATE , more specifically a QUANTITY taxi ride to a bus station followed by a QUANTITY bus transport , and the reverse after school . The court was in doubt as to whether it was reasonable to expect that the applicant could cope with such demands on a DATE basis .", "CARDINAL . As matter of law , ORG stated that as , on the evidence , the applicant was not able to understand the significance of the envisaged decision , the mentor was not required , or even permitted , to resolve the question of the applicant \u2019s place of residence in accordance with the applicant \u2019s own wishes . Under such circumstances the mentor was required to take the decision on the basis of an assessment of the applicant \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . Taking into account the evidence and the factual findings referred to above ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG concluded that it was in the applicant \u2019s best interests to remain in his home town . The mentor had not acted in breach of her powers and ORG found no reason to replace the mentor by another person as regards matters concerning the applicant \u2019s place of residence and his education .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) . He pointed out that LAW guaranteed everyone the right to choose their place of residence . Moreover , a mentor had to enjoy the confidence of his or her client , which was not so in the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after holding an oral hearing , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld ORG decision by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . ORG found no reason to deviate from the assessment of the evidence as conducted by ORG and affirmed the conclusions reached by the latter . The dissenting judge found that the former foster mother had been the only adult with whom the applicant had had a long - standing and safe relationship in his life . The applicant had clearly understood the importance of this relationship in his life , he knew the former foster family and what life with them entailed , although he might not be able to understand all the implications of the envisaged move . When the applicant had been removed from the former foster family in DATE and placed in a children \u2019s home in LOC , no specific reasons had been given as to why this measure had been in the applicant \u2019s best interests . The decision taken subsequently by the mentor in DATE had merely confirmed the earlier decision . These decisions had created distrust between the applicant and his mentor . As both the present mentor and the proposed replacement were equally competent , the one who had the applicant \u2019s trust should be chosen .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already submitted before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to the information provided by the Government , in DATE the applicant learned that his foster father had died and he attended his funeral in GPE . From DATE to DATE the applicant resided in his home town in a block of flats providing special care for persons with intellectual disability . Since DATE he has been residing in sheltered accommodation , in a small CARDINAL - room flat . He is employed by his home town , undertaking work DATE a week in a shelter for intellectually disabled people . He is a talkative , efficient and well - liked employee and fits in very well in the working community .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s former foster mother is in contact with the applicant via telephone but the frequency of their contact is not known . She moved to the eastern part of GPE before DATE and invited the applicant to spend DATE with her , but in the end he decided not to visit her . Instead , the applicant spent DATE with his brother and other relatives . According to the Government , the applicant has not discussed the possibility of moving elsewhere for a long time . He is happy with his work and plays floorball twice DATE as a hobby . The applicant states that he has stopped talking about his desire to move since there is no point in doing so , given the fact that the social welfare authorities do not want him to leave his home town . Although he now has a girlfriend in his home town , he maintains that his true and most sincere wish is still to live with or near to his former foster mother . There is nothing in his home town that keeps him there or makes him want to stay there ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8", "P4"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1", "P4-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P4-2-1"]}
