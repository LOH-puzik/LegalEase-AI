He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant was convicted of attempted rape which had taken place on DATE . Given his history as a serial sexual offender , he was sentenced to life imprisonment . His DATE tariff expired in DATE and he was released on life licence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , while on day release from that sentence , the applicant purchased a ticket for ORG . He won a sum in the region of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP The news reached the victim of the DATE rape , PERSON had been unable to sue the applicant for damages at the time of the offence because he was impecunious . She had , however , received a sum in the region of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation from ORG .", "CARDINAL . Upon hearing the news , PERSON proceeded to seek damages against the applicant for trespass to the person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON issued her claim form seeking damages . The applicant sought legal advice from his solicitors and Counsel .", "CARDINAL . His barrister , a Queen \u2019s Counsel , warned the applicant that there was a risk of his losing , as in any litigation . Given the well - established case - law on the matter , as explained by his legal representatives , however , the applicant felt that he could rely on the certainty of the law in this area to pursue his defence that PERSON claim was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , on an unspecified date , the applicant rejected an offer made by PERSON to settle the action for a sum in the region of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON action was struck out by PERSON on the ground that it was time - barred pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The general rule , contained in section CARDINAL of LAW , was that the period of limitation for an action in tort was DATE from the date on which the cause of action accrued ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In Mrs A \u2019s case , the cause of action had arisen DATE before the issue of the claim form and so was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , PERSON was granted leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Before the High Court judge , the argument focused on the question whether PERSON action was one to which LAW applied . LAW of LAW , upon which PERSON sought to rely , covered actions for damages based on negligence , nuisance or breach of duty where the damages were in respect of personal injuries ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The limitation period for such actions was DATE , either from the date on which the cause of action accrued or the date of knowledge of the person injured , as defined in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . In addition , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act gave the court a discretion to extend that DATE period when it appeared that it would be equitable to do so ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was the applicant \u2019s case that section QUANTITY applied and was a bar to Mrs A \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON sitting in ORG dismissed PERSON appeal . He concluded that , following ORG decision in PERSON v PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , PERSON claim was covered by LAW rather than LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his judgment , PERSON recalled that ORG in PERSON had held that claims for injuries arising from complaints of deliberate assault or trespass to the person , such as PERSON , were subject to the nonextendable DATE limitation period imposed by section CARDINAL . As regards the meaning of the words \u201c breach of duty \u201d contained in LAW , he noted that in his speech , Lord PERSON had held that these words were not to be construed as including actions based on intentionally inflicted injuries , such as rape or indecent assault .", "CARDINAL . PERSON further rejected PERSON contention that her right of access to court contained in LAW had been breached . In particular , he relied on the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and Others v. GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , in which a majority had found no violation of LAW ground that the limitation period contained in LAW , as interpreted by ORG , constituted a proportionate restriction on the right of access to court .", "CARDINAL . Finally , PERSON referred to the comprehensive review of the law of limitation carried out by ORG and laid before ORG in DATE : Limitation of Actions ( Law Com No CARDINAL ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . He noted however that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG Report has not yet been implemented . I have no information as to what the ORG \u2019s intentions may be . There is a hint in paragraph CARDINAL of ORG judgment in PERSON that , if Member States - that is primarily their legislatures , do not act , ORG would at DATE take a second look at the issue with possibly a different outcome . If that moment arrived for ORG , a national court considering the issue would be in no different position . On this analysis the issue for me is whether that moment has arrived . I do not consider that the passage of DATE since the ORG is so long a period that what was within the \u2018 margin of appreciation\u2019 has ceased to be so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , PERSON ordered that PERSON A should pay the applicant \u2019s costs in defending PERSON appeal . PERSON appealed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG heard PERSON appeal together with CARDINAL other appeals , namely H v ORG and X and Y v ORG , which both concerned schoolboys who had been sexually abused by their teachers . The common feature of these appeals was that the claim in each case had been brought DATE after the sexual abuse in question ( or , in H and X and Y , after the schoolboys who had been abused had reached DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed all the appeals . ORG began with a detailed review of the background to LAW ; it examined both the respective decisions of ORG and ORG in PERSON as well as subsequent cases . As to ORG report on the law of limitation of DATE , ORG observed that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The remedy has now been in ORG \u2019s hands for DATE following a comprehensive law reform study conducted at considerable public expense . Although the ORG \u2019s recommendations would not have affected cases in which the defendant already possessed an accrued limitation defence under existing legislation , justice would be far more simply achieved in claims like this in future if ORG were to simplify the law along the lines the ORG recommended . In the meantime , ORG itself may be able to remedy some of the very serious deficiencies and incoherencies in the law as it stands DATE in a way that we can not . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the argument that ORG had been wrongly decided by ORG , ORG held that it was bound by that decision of the ORG . ORG noted however that both the cases decided since ORG and the detailed analysis of ORG in its comprehensive DATE report pointed to some very unsatisfactory features of the law as it applied to sexual abuse cases ( at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further held , after a detailed examination of the relevant authorities , that because the DATE limitation period had expired before LAW ( \u201c HRA \u201d ) came into force appellants could not rely on the provisions of that LAW for assistance ( at paragraphs CARDINAL of the judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . As for the application of the law to PERSON appeal , ORG held , per Sir PERSON :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If ORG enacted the PERSON Commission\u2019Stubbings v PERSON to hold that the claim is statute barred , and for the reasons we have set out in paras CARDINAL to CARDINAL above the ORG can not come to A \u2019s assistance because the defendant possessed an accrued right to a limitation defence long before the ORG became law . For these reasons we must dismiss A \u2019s appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the event , ORG ordered that PERSON A should pay the applicant \u2019s costs of the appeal and that she be allowed to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In ORG , PERSON appeal was joined with CARDINAL other appeals which concerned the alleged sexual abuse of children / young persons by members of staff at schools which were managed by the local council . CARDINAL of the appeals , ORG ) and ORG , also involved allegations of sexual abuse by a member of staff in a detention centre operated by ORG . The appeals were heard on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL conjoined appeals all raised the question whether claims for sexual assaults and abuse which took place DATE before the commencement of proceedings were barred by LAW . The appeal in PERSON also raised an issue under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act which deals with the date of knowledge and what knowledge may or may not be attributed to a claimant .", "CARDINAL . In a unanimous judgment which was delivered on DATE , their Lordships concluded that LAW of LAW , which traditionally applied to negligence and breach of duty actions , also applied to actions arising out of intentional torts where personal injuries were sustained . Accordingly , all the appeals were allowed .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , with whom all the other Law Lords agreed , gave the leading speech , explaining why the ORG should depart from its earlier case - law in PERSON v Webb . After having given a detailed account of the history of LAW , he went on to note that , although ORG had not given rise to too much difficulty at first , the position had radically been changed with ORG decision in PERSON v ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL . In that case , their Lordships had decided that sexual abuse was not necessarily outside the scope of an employment . After that , a considerable number of claims had been brought against the operators of schools , detention centres and the like for sexual abuse by employees . This , in the words of Lord PERSON , \u201c threw into relief the anomalies created by PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . His Lordship referred in particular to the case of LOC v W ( Child Abuse : Damages ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL FLR CARDINAL , a pre - PERSON case , in which the plaintiff had sued her father and mother for sexual abuse by the father . The action had been commenced DATE after the last act of abuse . As the cause of action against the father was intentional assault , the claim had been struck out . The cause of action against the mother was negligent failure to protect the plaintiff against the father . As this fell CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act and was subject to a discretionary extension under LAW , which had been granted by the judge and affirmed by ORG , the action against the mother had been allowed to proceed . Lord PERSON recorded the court \u2019s finding , per Sir PERSON at p.CARDINAL , that the result was \u201c illogical and surprising \u201d and deserving of the attention of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Indeed , Lord PERSON went on to note that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The matter was considered by ORG as part of a comprehensive review of the law of limitation of actions which was presented to ORG in DATE : Limitation of Actions ( DATE ) ( Law Com No CARDINAL ) . The effect of PERSON was described as anomalous , with particular reference to S v W ( Child Abuse : Damages ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL FLR CARDINAL : see para CARDINAL of the ORG . The ORG recommended a uniform regime for personal injuries , whether the claim was made in negligence or trespass to the person : see the summary at para CARDINAL . There has not yet been any implementing legislation , possibly because the ORG \u2019s recommendations were not confined to the ORG anomaly but proposed a completely new law of limitation of actions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Lord PERSON \u2019s observation [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , ORG that unsatisfactory decisions of the highest court can cause uncertainty because lower courts tend to distinguish them on inadequate grounds is also pertinent to the consequences of ORG . Claimants who have suffered sexual abuse but need to seek the discretion of the court under LAW are driven to alleging that the abuse was the result of , or accompanied by , some other breach of duty which can be brought within the language of LAW . Thus , in addition to having to decide whether the claimant was sexually abused , the courts must decide whether this was the result of \u2018 systemic negligence\u2019 on the part of the abuser \u2019s employer or the negligence of some other person for whom the employer is responsible . In the appeals before the ORG , the appellants put forward CARDINAL alternative theories of liability on which they wish to rely if the rule in PERSON is upheld . These are , in increasing degree of artificiality ( CARDINAL ) breach of a direct duty of care owed by the employer to the claimant ; ( CARDINAL ) breach of a duty of care by other employees ; ( CARDINAL ) breach of a duty of care by the abuser himself and ( CARDINAL ) breach of a duty by the abuser to notify the employer of his own wrongful acts . In ORG v ORG [ DATE ] QB CARDINAL , para CARDINAL ORG said that the need to frame a claim in CARDINAL or other of these ways when the real cause of complaint was sexual abuse for which the employer was vicariously liable was causing \u2018 arid and highly wasteful litigation turning on a distinction of no apparent principle or other merit.\u2019 I therefore think that it would be right to depart from ORG and reaffirm the law laid down by ORG in PERSON v ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL QB CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON of PERSON - under - Heywood concurred . As regards the exercise of the court \u2019s discretion under LAW of LAW , he commented that , by no means everyone who brought a late claim for damages for sexual abuse , however genuine , could reasonably expect the court to exercise the section CARDINAL discretion in his favour .", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON appeal , he stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ( ... ) It would not ordinarily be sensible to sue an indigent defendant . How then should the court approach the exercise of its section CARDINAL discretion in a case like A where suddenly , after DATE , the prospective defendant becomes rich . The ORG is not , of course , itself exercising this discretion . I would , however , suggest that it would be most unfortunate if people felt obliged ( often at public expense ) to bring proceedings for sexual abuse against indigent defendants simply with a view to their possible future enforcement . ( Judgments , although interestbearing for DATE , are enforceable without limit of time . ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment effectively meant in the applicant \u2019s case that the section CARDINAL limitation period of DATE became applicable to the circumstances of his case with the possibility of an extension of that period at the discretion of the court under LAW of LAW . Indeed , their Lordships remitted the case to ORG to consider whether it ought to exercise its discretion under LAW of that LAW . As for the question of costs , their Lordships ordered the parties to lodge written submissions on this issue within DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a Judgment Order of DATE , ORG awarded PERSON A her costs both before the ORG and ORG , with the ORG costs to be determined by the judge hearing PERSON application on LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , sitting in ORG , exercised his discretion in favour of PERSON and allowed her to sue the applicant in damages .", "CARDINAL . Among the factors taken into account by the learned judge were the following : ( i ) the nature and seriousness of the underlying tortious wrong ; ( ii ) the fact that one of the consequences of that wrong was the applicant \u2019s impecuniosity ( because he was unable to earn money by which he could otherwise have met a judgment for damages ) ; ( iii ) the fact that , prior to his lottery win , the applicant was simply not worth pursuing in an action for damages \u2013 this being the principal reason for PERSON delay ; and ( iv ) the fact that Mrs A acted promptly following the defendant \u2019s release from prison and his lottery win .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the applicant \u2019s argument that , if he exercised his discretion in favour of PERSON in the present case , there would be a risk that parties in all aspects of civil litigation would seek to get round the applicable limitation periods by relying on the defendant \u2019s impecuniosity , PERSON added that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... I consider this to be a wholly exceptional case . It will be very rare for a claimant to bring a claim against a defendant for a tortious wrong , in circumstances where that wrong was so serious that it caused the defendant to be sentenced to life imprisonment ( thereby creating the impecuniosity which prevented the claimant from bringing proceedings against him in the first place ) or brought with it in some other way a financial catastrophe for the defendant which meant that he would not be in a position to meet any judgment against him . It will be even rarer for such a defendant , DATE , to buy a lottery ticket , which wins him \u00a3 MONEY , or otherwise comes into an unexpected fortune , which makes him suddenly worth pursuing after all . Thus , even if it was appropriate to conclude that section CARDINAL was only applicable in exceptional cases , I am in no doubt that this is indeed such a case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the event , the applicant was ordered to pay the costs of all the proceedings before the lower courts in addition to the costs before ORG and ORG . In total , in addition to his own costs of ORG the applicant was ordered to pay ORG in legal costs and ORG in compensation to PERSON", "CARDINAL .

In its report , LAW ( DATE ) ( Law Com No CARDINAL ) , ORG carried out a comprehensive review of the law of limitation . As regards sexual abuse cases , the Commission identified the following problems :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL Traditionally , the limitation period has started from DATE the cause of action accrued , whether or not the claimant knows of the potential claim . This caused injustice where the injury suffered by the claimant did not become apparent for DATE . Provision has been made for such cases of latent damage in actions for personal injuries , under LAW DATE and in some other cases . However , the provision for latent damage does not extend to most causes of action . Outside the areas of personal injuries and consumer protection , the limitation period will only run from the date the claimant knows the relevant facts if the claim is brought in negligence . Even where the claim is for personal injuries , provision for latent damage does not extend to deliberately caused injuries . Here the limitation period remains DATE , running from the date of accrual of the cause of action . This has led to the anomalous result that a claimant who has been sexually abused by her father may have longer to bring a claim for damages against her mother for negligently failing to prevent the abuse than to bring a claim against her father for actually committing the abuse .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL It is necessary to balance the interests of the claimant ( who wishes to have as long as possible to bring a claim ) and the defendant ( who must be protected from stale claims ) in setting a limitation period . It will never be possible to achieve complete fairness between the parties ( indeed the imposition of any limitation period could be regarded as doing \u2018 rough justice\u2019 to the claimant ) . However the balance struck under the present law does not give sufficient recognition to the interests of the claimant ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
