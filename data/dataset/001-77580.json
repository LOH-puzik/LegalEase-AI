He asked the authorities to find the perpetrators of this crime .", "CARDINAL . The preliminary enquiries led the ORG public prosecutor to issue a continuous search warrant on DATE , which was valid for DATE . The investigation file was forwarded to the ORG public prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE since the bodies were found within his area of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . As it had not been possible to establish the identities of the perpetrators , on DATE the ORG public prosecutor issued a permanent search warrant for the perpetrators of the killings , which would remain valid for DATE pursuant to LAW .

He was prepared to indicate those issues in respect of which it might be possible to find documents . Among his submissions , which were recorded in a CARDINAL - page statement , Mr PERSON stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c The ORG and ORG ( PERSON , hereinafter ORG ) became concerned about the financial assistance being provided to the ORG from certain members of the NORP community , which they felt accounted for its increased activity DATE . They did not feel that they had enough evidence to bring charges and consequently some officers from the Police , ORG and ORG started talking about using different methods of dealing with certain members of the NORP community . A special team was formed for this purpose by , inter alia , the Chief of Police , PERSON and the Chief of ORG , PERSON . This team consisted both of members of ORG and certain civilians , including PERSON . The activities of this special team were known to other members of the ORG and the Intelligence Branch of the ORG ( the GPE ) . The kidnapping and the killing of PERSON and his friends formed part of such activities . It was established that these persons were helping the ORG financially . The way they were kidnapped and killed did not bear any resemblance to the activities of a ORG or other underground organisation known to us . Police identity cards and policing methods were used during the kidnapping of PERSON and his friends , otherwise it would not have been possible to kidnap them and to kill them as there are checkpoints on the roads along which they would have been stopped . To go through these checkpoints could only have been possible by making use of an official title \u201d .", "On DATE PERSON was interrogated once again in GPE at the request of the GPE public prosecutor . In his statement , he stated that he did not know how and by whom the killings were carried out .", "CARDINAL .

In the laboratory report , dated DATE , it was stated that the photo - fits did not have the necessary facial characteristics to make a positive comparison .", "CARDINAL . The photo - fits were also compared with the photograph of ORG , another suspect detained in connection with the GPE investigation . The report of the criminal laboratory dated DATE concluded that CARDINAL of the photo - fits bore resemblances to the photograph and that the person in the photo - fit could be PERSON . Accordingly , on DATE ORG issued an arrest warrant for PERSON . On DATE PERSON gave a statement to the public prosecutor . He stated that he was not in GPE DATE and DATE and that he did not know who had carried out the kidnapping on DATE . He further stated that he did not fit the description of any of the abductors as he had had a beard at the time of the kidnapping . He explained that this fact could be easily verified because he had given an interview to a local television channel in PERSON at around the time of the kidnapping .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal of ORG against the decision ordering his arrest for the kidnapping and killing of the applicants ' relative and the other CARDINAL persons . On CARDINAL DATE an identity parade was held in the prison where PERSON was being detained on remand . Both ORG , the doorman at FAC , and PERSON , the taxi driver who had witnessed the kidnapping on DATE , stated that PERSON , who was included in a line - up of QUANTITY persons , was not one of the men who had carried out the kidnapping . On DATE PERSON was questioned by the public prosecutor . Mr PERSON was a watchman working at ORG , which was on the road to FAC .

CARDINAL person had left the car and filled a container with water from a fountain . When he was shown pictures of PERSON , the witness stated that the person he had seen did not look like PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor took a decision of non - jurisdiction in respect of ORG . The prosecutor sent the investigation file to ORG which , in the prosecutor 's opinion , was the competent court to prosecute PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG wrote to the management of ORG and requested that the video recordings of the security camera for TIME DATE be transmitted to them . In reply , on DATE the casino management informed the security department that the video recordings were kept for DATE and then erased . They further stated that as the casino was closed as of CARDINAL DATE , all video recordings were deleted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor attached to ORG took a decision of non - jurisdiction in respect of PERSON . The prosecutor concluded that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the killings had been carried out by or on behalf of an illegal organisation . He therefore concluded that ORG did not have jurisdiction in this matter . The file was sent to the PERSON public prosecutor , who later transferred the file to the ORG public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor , noting that ORG had been arrested and put on trial for the killings , decided to continue the search for the other perpetrators . The prosecutor also asked the PERSON public prosecutor to charge PERSON , who , according to the evidence gathered by the ORG public prosecutor , was CARDINAL of the perpetrators of the kidnappings and subsequent killings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with ORG . The prosecutor alleged that the evidence justified the prosecution of PERSON for the murder of the applicant 's brother and his CARDINAL friends .", "CARDINAL .

ORG noted that , according to this indictment , PERSON was a notorious international drugs trafficker who held CARDINAL official service passports , CARDINAL of which were in the names of PERSON and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The D\u00fczce Assize Court finally noted that ORG name had been implicated in ORG which had concluded that the fight against terrorism had gained momentum in DATE when PERSON was appointed head of ORG in GPE .

The ORG further stated that the killings of FAC , PERSON , ORG , ORG and ORG formed part of such activities .", "CARDINAL . Recalling that PERSON , PERSON and ORG had been kidnapped by CARDINAL persons and then killed in the area between GPE , Adapazar\u0131 and Bolu , ORG held that these killings resembled the above - mentioned killings in the same area . Considering that the defendant was already facing prosecution before another court for membership of an organisation which was allegedly responsible for killing persons who had much in common with the deceased persons in the present case and as there was no other evidence to suggest that these killings were carried out for personal reasons , ORG concluded on DATE that it was precluded from examining the merits of the case for reasons of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The case file was transferred to ORG which had jurisdiction to deal with cases involving organised crime . On DATE the court concluded that it too did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case . It held that , according to the PERSON public prosecutor 's indictment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG was charged with multiple murders . The indictment had made no reference to organised crime and the court did not have jurisdiction to examine this allegation ex officio . The case file was sent to ORG in order to resolve the dispute over jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , upholding the decision of ORG , ruled that ORG had jurisdiction to deal with the case .", "CARDINAL . Seven hearings were held before ORG in the course of the criminal proceedings against ORG . The applicants joined the proceedings as a civil party . PERSON told the court that there was no evidence to link him to the killings and that the only reason for putting him on trial was to prove to the NORP courts that the killings were being investigated . QUANTITY eyewitnesses , who had either seen the QUANTITY men being put into the cars outside the hotel in GPE or had seen the CARDINAL cars near the spot where these persons were killed , stated during the hearings that they had never seen PERSON before .", "CARDINAL .

After receiving the report in DATE , the Prime Minister made it available to the public , although CARDINAL pages and certain annexes were withheld .", "CARDINAL . The introduction states that the ORG was not based on a judicial investigation and did not constitute a formal investigation report . It was intended for information purposes and purported to do no more than describe certain events which had occurred mainly in south - east GPE and which tended to confirm the existence of unlawful dealings between political figures , government institutions and clandestine groups .", "CARDINAL . The ORG analyses a series of events , such as murders carried out under orders , the killings of well - known figures or supporters of the NORP and deliberate acts by a group of \u201c informants \u201d supposedly serving the ORG , and concludes that there was a connection between the fight to eradicate terrorism in the region and the underground relations that formed as a result , particularly in the drug - trafficking sphere . In the ORG , reference is made to the killing of the applicant 's brother :", "\u201c All the relevant ORG bodies were aware of these activities and operations . ... When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined , the difference between those NORP supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay in the financial strength the latter represented in economic terms . These factors also operated in the murder of PERSON , a smuggler and pro - ORG activist . ( page CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG concludes with numerous recommendations , such as improving co - ordination and communication between the different branches of the security , police and intelligence departments ; identifying and dismissing security force personnel implicated in illegal activities ; limiting the use of \u201c confessors \u201d ; reducing the number of village guards ; terminating the use of the Special Operations Bureau outside the south - east region and incorporating it into the police force outside that area ; opening investigations into various incidents ; taking steps to suppress gang and drug - smuggling activities ; and recommending that the results of ORG inquiry be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for the relevant proceedings to be undertaken .", "CARDINAL .
