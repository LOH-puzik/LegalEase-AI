The first applicant further alleged that the trial court had refused her request for an alternative expert examination , notwithstanding that ORG \u0418\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0437\u0430 PERSON was also authorised to conduct such an analysis , that the trial court had not explained the discrepancy between the gross and net weight of the drugs found , and that the court had accepted that the packages containing the drugs had been submerged in acrylic paint , which contradicted the experts\u2019 findings regarding the type of the paint involved ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . She also complained that she had not been allowed to consult the case file during the investigation , which had affected her ability effectively to prepare her defence . Furthermore , her defence rights had been unjustifiably restricted since she had not been given the opportunity to attend the examination of witnesses PERSON and GPE before ORG . In this respect she alleged that she had not been informed of the questions put to these witnesses by the trial court . The second applicant complained that there had been no evidence that he had concluded an agreement ( with the first applicant ) and , in particular , that he had known that he was transporting drugs . In the absence of any evidence confirming his intention to transport drugs , no criminal liability could be attributed to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a public session at which , in presence of the applicants and their representatives , it dismissed the appeals and upheld the trial court \u2019s judgment . As to the first applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the requests she had made in the pre - trial proceedings to consult the case file , the court stated :", "\u201c ... On CARDINAL DATE [ the first applicant ] , in the presence of her lawyer , was informed about the charges against her ... ( and ) that she was not obliged to answer the questions and present her defence , but she stated that she would give a statement in any case after the available evidence had been presented to her ... On DATE she gave a statement in the presence of her representative ; the questioning continued on CARDINAL DATE . [ On both the occasions ] on which she gave a statement before the investigating judge , she had had the time and the facilities to prepare her defence and the possibility of communicating with her legal representative ...", "Under section CARDINAL of LAW , the accused is entitled to consult the case file and ... the evidence after being questioned . In the present case ... it is clear that the trial court did not violate the accused \u2019s right of defence ...", "... regarding the alleged violation of LAW ... it is evident that after the investigating judge had questioned [ the first applicant ] ... [ she ] gave a detailed statement which was duly noted in the court record and which she had read and signed ...", "... The lawyer requested and was given access to the file before he objected to the indictment ... Moreover , the trial court established all the relevant facts at the trial ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the expert evidence , the court established that all the expert reports admitted as evidence had confirmed that the substance found in the cans had been cocaine ; in the statement of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON had confirmed that all CARDINAL packages had been examined using so - called \u201c speedy methods \u201d and randomly - chosen packages had then been fully analysed ; the quantity of the drugs had been established on the basis of ENFSI recommendations . The court further dismissed the ORG complaints about the alleged lack of independence of the experts , finding that the expert examination ( no . DATE ) had been ordered by the court , that the expert findings had not been called into doubt , and that they had been confirmed at the hearing by the experts , who had been warned about the consequences of false testimony . Lastly , the court held that a copy of expert report no . DATE had been served on the applicants and they had been provided with a reasonable opportunity to challenge it .", "CARDINAL . As regards the witness evidence produced by ORG in GPE , the court held that they had been heard in response to the request by the trial court made at the hearing dated DATE ; the applicants and their representatives , who had attended that hearing , had not objected , nor had they sought to attend the questioning of these witnesses ; the ORG statements had been read out at the trial and the applicants had not objected to them . The court concluded that this evidence had therefore been accordingly lawfully obtained .", "CARDINAL . As to the second applicant \u2019s complaint that he had not known that he was transporting drugs , the court stated :", "\u201c ... such an allegation is contrary to the established facts based on admitted evidence concerning the actions taken by [ the second applicant ] and his criminal liability ... the court does not accept [ his ] allegations because on the basis of all evidence admitted at the trial , [ the trial ] court correctly established the relevant facts concerning the actions taken by [ the second applicant ] ... ( these ) allegations were assessed by [ the trial ] court ... ( which ) gave reasonable grounds why it did not give credence to them ... it was established beyond any doubt that drugs \u2012 cocaine \u2012 had been found in some paint - cans transported by the vehicle driven by [ the second applicant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that :", "\u201c ... the large quantity of drugs , the way they were procured and transported , and the actions taken by the accused , suggest that the cocaine was transported for the purpose of selling it and not for any other purpose ...", "On the basis of the admitted evidence , the analysis and assessment thereof , ( and ) the accused \u2019s behaviour before they reached agreement concerning the shipment , the fact that they communicated between themselves , during the shipment , that is to say before , during and after the crime ... it can be concluded that the accused knew and were aware of their actions , including the crime that they had committed ... In this connection , according to this court , there is no logical economic reason to import acrylic paint from GPE , given the fact that transport costs from GPE to the ( final ) destination ... would be higher than its value . It can be inferred from this that the accused knew that it was about the transportation of drugs and not of acrylic paint . Having also in mind the intensity of contacts between the accused , and the contacts with the witnesses PERSON and GPE in GPE , ... together with the fact that [ the first applicant ] provided [ the second applicant ] with written documentation ... issued by her company PERSON , stipulating that the cargo should be transported to GPE to company S. \u2012 which , on the basis of the available evidence , does not exist \u2012 it becomes clear that [ the applicants ] knew and were aware of their unlawful actions and the crime committed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged requests before ORG for extraordinary review of the final judgment ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430 ) . They reiterated the allegations of violation of their defence rights , in particular , concerning the expert evidence , examination of witnesses PERSON and GPE and lack of reasoning . In this latter context the second applicant reiterated that there had been no evidence showing that he had known that he was transporting drugs hidden in hermetically closed cans . His telephone contacts with the first applicant and GPE and the court \u2019s conclusion regarding the economic rationale for importing paint from GPE were not conclusive given the fact that he was the driver whom the first applicant had engaged to transport the paint from GPE to GPE . The first applicant complained that it had not been established ( or indicated in the operative part of the trial court \u2019s judgment ) that the drugs had been transported for the purpose of selling them . She also complained that her defence rights had been violated in the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the established facts and dismissed the ORG requests for the same reasons given by ORG . In this connection it stated , inter alia , that :", "\u201c On the basis of all admitted evidence , the intensity of telephone contacts between the accused , as well as contacts with witnesses PERSON and GPE , the accused \u2019s behaviour before they reached agreement concerning the shipment , the intensive and multiple contacts between themselves during the shipment , when the crime had been committed and after it had been discovered , the trial court correctly concluded that the accused knew and were aware of their actions regarding the unlawful transport of drugs . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

From the description of [ the applicants\u2019 ] actions there is no doubt that drugs were transported for the purpose of selling and that such a large quantity of drugs , namely pure cocaine , can not be for [ the applicants\u2019 ] personal use .
