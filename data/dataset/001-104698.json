The court allowed her request , notwithstanding the objection of ORG", "CARDINAL . At a hearing held on CARDINAL DATE counsel for the applicant stated , without further explanation , that she wished to withdraw the request for an expert report on the divisibility of the house . It seems that the withdrawal was based on the fact that the applicant had failed to pay the required fees for the report to be drawn up .", "CARDINAL . The last hearing was held on DATE . The court presented to the parties a draft division proposal . The applicant objected to it , arguing , among other things , that the house was indivisible .

Evidentiary requests at such a late stage were possible only if truly indispensable for the proper determination of the case .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG set the lower court \u2019s judgment aside . It decided , among other things , to disregard the initial expert reports on the divisibility of the house and to rely on DATE , observing that it was objective and that the CARDINAL experts who had drawn it up were unanimous . It rejected the applicant \u2019s objections against that report , noting , among other things , that she had been allowed to request a further expert report but had failed to pursue that possibility . It found that the house was divisible , because it was technically possible to do so and there was a blueprint approved by the municipal administration . It further found that the division could be effected by drawing lots without great inconvenience . Accordingly , the court divided the properties into CARDINAL lots , the first comprising the first storey of the house in GPE and the plot in PERSON , and the second comprising the second storey of the house and the CARDINAL fields .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law . On DATE the ORG instructed her to specify her grievances . She did so on DATE , arguing that the court had erred in finding that the house could be divided . The expert report on which it had relied had not taken into account the applicable construction rules .

It noted that counsel for the applicant had withdrawn the request for a further expert report . The applicant could not therefore validly complain that she had been denied the opportunity to adduce evidence concerning the divisibility of the house . Her objections concerning the plan for the division had been discussed and rejected by the lower court . The court went on to observe that the experts and the municipal administration had found that the division could be effected without too much inconvenience and without infringing the applicable construction regulations . Therefore , the lower court \u2019s conclusion that the house was divisible was not contrary to the substantive law .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings then resumed before GPE . At a hearing held on DATE the applicant and ORG drew lots to determine which of the divided properties should go to whom . ORG received the first storey of the house in GPE and the plot in PERSON , and the applicant received the second storey of the house and the CARDINAL fields . The court confirmed the division , ordered the applicant to pay ORG a small sum to equalise their respective shares , and terminated the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the proposed division . On DATE the ORG instructed her to specify her grievances and pay the requisite fee . The court \u2019s instructions were served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE . On DATE he requested an extension of time , citing the applicant \u2019s being abroad .
