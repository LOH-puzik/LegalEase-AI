The second applicant was the editor in chief of the magazine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON published an article referring to an advertising campaign by a company , ORG , for its potato crisps . On the first page of the magazine there was a cartoon showing a boy holding a packet , with the name \u201c ORG \u201d on it , saying to PERSON a little dog , a popular cartoon character for children \u2013 \u201c Do n\u2019t worry ! I would be a murderer too if I ate this muck ! \u201d ( \u201c PERSON martw si\u0119 \u2013 te\u017c bym by\u0142 morderc\u0105 , gdybym jad\u0142 to \u015bwi\u0144stwo ! \u201d ) . Above the cartoon , there was a large heading reading \u201c NORP children shocked by crisps advertisement , \u2018 PERSON is a murderer\u2019 ( PERSON to morderca ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

The above quoted article on the second page was accompanied by a small cartoon featuring CARDINAL cats holding a packet with the word \u201c crisps \u201d on it and the dog PERSON in the background . CARDINAL cat holds a piece of paper with the slogan \u201c PERSON murderer \u201d apparently taken out from the packet and says to the second cat - \u201c surely , he is sometimes unpleasant , but a murderer ? ! \u201d ( \u201c GPE , nieraz bywa przykry , ale \u017ceby od razu morderc\u0105 ? ! \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the plaintiff \u201d ) lodged against both applicants a civil claim for protection of personal rights . The company sought an order requiring the defendants to publish an apology in ORG and ORG for publishing a cartoon discrediting , without any justification , ORG products . They further sought reimbursement of their legal costs and payment by the applicants of MONEY ( ORG ) to a charity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) found for the plaintiff . The court ordered the applicants to publish apologies as sought in the statement of claim and to pay ORG MONEY to a charity . The applicants were also ordered to pay the plaintiffs ORG MONEY to reimburse the costs of the proceedings . The court considered that the cartoon in question had breached the personal rights of the plaintiff and discredited the products of the company . The words used by the applicants had an unambiguous meaning relating to disgust and repulsion and were strongly pejorative . Accordingly , the court concluded that the applicants had overstepped the threshold of permissible criticism , in particular in a magazine aimed at children . The court dismissed the applicants\u2019 arguments that the cartoon had aimed to criticise the advertising campaign run by ORG and not their product . It considered that such an attack on the plaintiff \u2019s personal rights could not have been justified even by the argument that their campaign was ill - considered .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal and ordered the applicants to pay the plaintiffs ORG MONEY to reimburse the costs of the appellate proceedings . It agreed with the lower court \u2019s assessment that the critical statement had not concerned the style of advertisement adopted by ORG . Calling the product of the company \u201c muck \u201d was surely not a critical assessment of their advertising campaign but had been aimed at the product , the brand , and the good name of the company . The statement in question \u201c I would be a murderer too if I ate this muck \u201d contained an obviously negative assessment of the taste and quality of the product . Thus , the applicants\u2019 action aimed to discredit , without justified grounds , the product of ORG and as such could not enjoy the benefit of legal protection . The appellate court also observed that the applicants had repeatedly relied on the interests of children to justify their actions , while they themselves had repeated , in the supplement for children , the slogan that in their opinion had had a negative impact on children \u2019s emotions and had terrified them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to examine the cassation appeal lodged by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . DATE the Civil Code contains a non - exhaustive list of the rights known as \u201c personal rights \u201d ( dobra osobiste ) .
