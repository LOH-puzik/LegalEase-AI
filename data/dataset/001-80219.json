The ORG welcomes the opening of secret service files for public examination in some former NORP totalitarian countries . It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine , upon their request , the files kept on them by the former secret services ...", "CARDINAL . Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL , but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them , the ORG notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures , such as lustration or decommunisation laws . The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they can not be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles , as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stresses that , in general , these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met . Firstly , guilt , being individual , rather than collective , must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual , and not collective , application of lustration laws . Secondly , the right of defence , the presumption of innocence until proven guilty , and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed . Revenge may never be a goal of such measures , nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed . The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy .", "CARDINAL . The ORG thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law , and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process .
