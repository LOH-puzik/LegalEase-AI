The applicant was born in DATE in GPE , GPE and is currently detained in a remand facility in GPE awaiting extradition to GPE . He holds a valid NORP passport and is considered to be a national of GPE by both the NORP and NORP authorities . The applicant , however , also claims to be an NORP national ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's father , PERSON , of NORP ethnic origin , was born in DATE in GPE , GPE . The applicant 's mother , PERSON , of NORP ethnic origin , was born in DATE in GPE , GPE . The applicant had an elder brother , PERSON , and a younger sister , PERSON . The family was living in GPE , GPE at the time the events described below took place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's entire family , including himself and his then DATE sister , were arrested in GPE on suspicion of killing QUANTITY persons and mutilating their corpses . It appears that prior to the arrest the NORP law - enforcement authorities found remains of mutilated human corpses inside the house of the applicant 's family and in a rubbish dump near their house . The applicant 's mother was the primary suspect , while all the other family members were suspected of being accomplices . The applicant claimed to have been out of town at the time the alleged crimes were committed .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the case file that their arrest generated much media coverage in GPE . The media reports also allegedly included false rumours that the applicant 's family had been engaged in the trafficking of human organs and even cannibalism . The ethnic origin of the applicant 's father and his children was also usually mentioned .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , while in detention he and all his family members had been constantly subjected to torture and other forms of illtreatment with the aim of extracting confessions from them . They were kept in separate cells for most of the time . The applicant provided a very detailed account of the types of ill - treatment to which he had been subjected , which included , inter alia , various forms of beating , deprivation of food and drink , and suffocation .", "CARDINAL . It appears that , initially , no charges were brought against the applicant or most of his family members in connection with the murders and on various dates they were all released , with the exception of his mother , owing to lack of evidence . However , after the release all of the family ( except the applicant 's sister ) were arrested again on various grounds .", "CARDINAL . After DATE in detention , the applicant was released on DATE owing to lack of evidence in connection with his involvement in the murder . However , TIME after his release , the applicant was stopped on the street by other police officers , who asked him for identity documents . The applicant was then taken to a police station where , after a body search , the police allegedly found some heroin concealed in his shoes . The applicant argued that the drugs had been planted on him by the police , as he had been released from detention TIME and would not have been able to acquire any heroin and hide it in the soles of his shoes during this extremely short time period , especially while suffering from the effects of ill - treatment and having had nothing to eat or drink since his initial arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG of GPE convicted the applicant of possession of illegal drugs and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . He was not provided with legal assistance during these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on DATE following a presidential pardon .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he left GPE with his sister and has lived in GPE since then .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , by a decision of ORG of DATE , the applicant was charged with the murder of CARDINAL persons and the mutilation of their corpses , under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( aggravated murder ) and CARDINAL ( abuse of corpse ) of LAW of GPE . Moreover , by the same decision , ORG ordered the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody in respect of the applicant without fixing any term for detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG suspended the pre - trial investigation , finding that the applicant was at large , and declared a search for him in order to secure his presence at the place of investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's father was released from detention on DATE but was arrested again on DATE for alleged possession of heroin , in circumstances similar to the applicant 's second arrest . On DATE the ORG convicted him of possession of illegal drugs and certain other offences and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , ORG convicted the applicant 's mother and brother of murdering QUANTITY persons and mutilating their corpses , and sentenced each of DATE imprisonment under ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of GPE . The court found that the applicant 's mother , with the assistance of her eldest son and with the purpose of enrichment at the expense of the victims , had invited a family of her acquaintance to her home , poisoned and killed them , and thereafter dismembered and otherwise mutilated the corpses so that it would be easier to dispose of them .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant 's father was also convicted under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of GPE . It was found that he had aided and abetted his wife and eldest son in the killings and mutilation of the victims ' corpses . After a series of appeals , his conviction under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL was quashed and the conviction under LAW upheld , and taking into account his previous conviction he was sentenced to a combined sentence of DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant 's brother died in prison on DATE from heart and lung failure . According to the applicant , his brother 's death was a consequence of many years of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant 's mother was released from prison in DATE , also following a presidential pardon , and moved to GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . As mentioned above , the applicant has been living in GPE since DATE . It appears from the case file that the applicant entered the territory of GPE legally with his NORP passport . However , he had been entitled to stay in GPE for DATE only and it appears that after this period he continued to live there without a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police in PERSON on the basis of a search warrant issued by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant 's detention with a view to extraditing him . ORG relied on ORG detention order of DATE and confirmed its findings . No fixed term for detention was specified , and it was noted that the applicant would be detained until an extradition decision had been given . The decision of ORG was subject to an appeal within DATE of its delivery . However , the applicant did not appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General of GPE made a formal request for the applicant 's extradition relying on LAW of DATE ( \u201c the DATE Minsk Convention \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor General of GPE issued a decision on the applicant 's extradition to GPE under the DATE Minsk Convention . Inter alia , the decision stated that , according to the information provided by the NORP authorities , the applicant was a national of GPE and that , according to the information received from ORG of GPE , he was not considered to be an NORP national in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE ORG of GPE asked the NORP authorities to give assurances in respect of the applicant 's criminal case . By a letter of DATE signed by ORG , the NORP authorities gave assurance that the criminal case against the applicant did not have any political or racial motivation , that the applicant would not be subjected to torture or any other inhuman treatment and that the applicant 's defence rights would be ensured . It stated that , by a law of DATE which entered into force on DATE , the death penalty had been abolished in GPE . It also added that the applicant would be allowed to leave GPE after serving his sentence and that he would not be handed over to a third State without the consent of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant was involved in CARDINAL separate sets of proceedings by means of which he attempted to have the extradition order quashed .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant 's father returned to GPE , he applied for an NORP national 's identity card on the basis of the fact that he had been born in PERSON , in the GPE SSR , and had lived in the GPE SSR until DATE . On DATE the applicant 's father was issued with an identity card confirming his citizenship .", "CARDINAL . Following his arrest on DATE , the applicant attempted to apply , through his representative , for an identity card of a national of GPE , on the basis that his father was an NORP national . His application was rejected as he was obliged to apply for this identity card in person .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an action with ORG , requesting the court to order LOC to issue him with an NORP national 's identity card . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant 's request , noting that under the domestic law the applicant qualified as an NORP national by right of blood and instructed ORG to issue him with an identity card .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this judgment , and pending its entry into force , on DATE the applicant was issued with a temporary identity document valid until DATE . It appears that , following the appeals mentioned below , the term of validity of this temporary identity document was not extended and that the applicant was never issued with an identity card of an NORP national .", "CARDINAL . The Absheron ORG lodged an appeal against the judgment of DATE , noting that the applicant was a national of GPE and that the only reason for his application for an identity card of an NORP national was to avoid extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE , finding that the applicant was a foreign national and that he could not be issued with an NORP national 's identity card unless he was granted NORP citizenship by the President of the Republic , under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against ORG judgment of DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal and upheld the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( with an addendum on DATE ) , the applicant appealed to ORG against the detention order of DATE and the extradition order of DATE . In his appeal he argued , inter alia , that ( a ) his detention had no basis under the domestic law and the detention order of DATE had unlawfully authorised his detention for an indefinite period ; ( b ) he faced an imminent risk of torture and other forms of ill - treatment if extradited to GPE ; ( c ) despite the authorities ' unlawful refusals to issue him with citizenship documents , under the domestic law he was an NORP national by right of blood ( as the son of an NORP national ) and that therefore his extradition to a foreign country would be contrary to NORP law and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed ORG extradition order of DATE , having had regard to ORG judgment of DATE which confirmed the applicant 's claim to NORP citizenship ( although ORG judgment never entered into force , by this time it had not yet been quashed by ORG ) . ORG noted that ORG could appeal against this decision within a DATE period and , in order to allow time for such an appeal , ordered the applicant 's release DATE from the delivery of the decision ( on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was not released on DATE , DATE after the delivery of the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged an appeal against ORG decision of DATE . Accompanying the appeal was a request to restore the DATE appeal period owing to the fact that ORG did not receive the decision until DATE . The applicant protested , arguing that the law on criminal procedure did not allow for restoration of the missed threeday period for appeals by the prosecution against court decisions concerning remand in custody . The applicant also claimed that the request for restoration of the DATE appeal period was unsubstantiated , because the representative of ORG had been present in the courtroom at the time the decision of DATE was announced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the request to restore the appeal period was granted and the appeal of ORG was accepted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of DATE . ORG held that the applicant was a national of GPE and that he had not been formally granted NORP citizenship . It noted that in upholding the applicant 's citizenship claims the lower court had incorrectly relied on ORG judgment of DATE , which had not entered into force . Therefore , ORG upheld the validity of the extradition order of DATE and quashed ORG decision on the applicant 's release . However , ORG decision was silent as to the existence of the risk of torture or ill - treatment in the event of the applicant 's extradition and as to the lawfulness of his detention with a view to extradition .", "CARDINAL .

Even though only a small number of torture cases can be proved with absolute certainty , the copious testimonies gathered are so consistent in their description of torture techniques and the places and circumstances in which torture is perpetrated that the pervasive and persistent nature of torture throughout the investigative process can not be denied .
