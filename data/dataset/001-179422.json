Secondly , the applicant contested the argument that ORG had provided sufficient guarantees , stating that they were identical to the ones that had already been analysed by ORG in the case of GPE v.

In this sense , are the appeal , pardon and other review mechanisms referred to in the note verbale of DATE the ones described in the case of GPE v. GPE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government submitted their response and attached a document issued by ORG of ORG called \u201c supplemental information to GPE on Sentencing Issues in Relation to PERSON , a / k / a \u2018 PERSON Flores\u2019 ( hereinafter , \u201c the GPE report \u201d ) . The report stated the following :", "\u201c By way of introduction , PERSON extradition is sought in order for him to stand trial on federal narcotics offenses in LOC of GPE . In essence , PERSON , a veterinarian , is charged with having been a member of a conspiracy DATE and DATE , the goal of which was to import heroin into GPE for subsequent distribution , in which PERSON role was to surgically implant packages of liquid heroin into the bodies of dogs that later were transported to GPE . The charges followed the search , in DATE , of a farm PERSON operated in GPE , GPE , in which law enforcement authorities seized CARDINAL puppies into which QUANTITY of liquid heroin had been surgically implanted . The CARDINAL puppies were bound for GPE , and the heroin they carried was surgically removed . After the search of his farm , PERSON fled GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the first question put to the Government , the GPE report argued that there were pretrial factors that could affect the applicant \u2019s sentencing . In particular , the report noted the following :", "\u201c Before any trial , PERSON could , with the advice of his lawyer , decide to give up the right to a trial and plead guilty to the charges in the indictment , with or without the agreement of the prosecution . See Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure CARDINAL(a ) . A timely admission of guilt is a factor which could reduce the sentence the judge decides to impose following a conviction . In GPE , the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved by guilty pleas . PERSON may seek to reach an agreement with the prosecution wherein he would plead guilty in exchange for certain favorable actions , such as an agreement to allow him to plead guilty to fewer than all the charges in the indictment ( with the remainder of the charges to be dismissed at sentencing ) , or even to lesser charges , or in exchange for the government \u2019s promise to affirmatively recommend to the court that a particular lesser sentence be imposed . The agreement may also include the parties\u2019 recommendation as to the appropriate sentence that - depending upon the type of plea agreement that is negotiated - may or may not bind the judge regarding the sentence that will be imposed . Such agreements are within the discretion of the government to enter into , and the judge may also decline to approve an agreement she or he does not believe to be in the interests of justice . The agreement may include , inter alia , an agreement to cooperate with GPE authorities . Thus , if PERSON were willing and able to provide substantial assistance to GPE in the investigation or prosecution of another person who had committed a crime , a plea agreement might include a promise by the government attorneys , in exchange for his guilty plea , to file a motion with the court asking that PERSON cooperation be taken into account and permitting the ORG to impose a lower sentence that it might otherwise impose . LAW , LAW , Section CARDINAL(e ) ; ORG , Section CARDINALKCARDINAL.CARDINAL . In such cases , it is not atypical for a judge to impose a sentence that is significantly less than the Guidelines recommendation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It also observed that \u201c [ i]f , however , PERSON decides not to plead guilty and instead exercise his right to a trial , and if he is found guilty of CARDINAL or more charges , his sentencing exposure will vary , depending on the nature of the charges on which he is found guilty . Moreover , the judge will have broad discretion to determine the appropriate sentence [ ... ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards the estimated sentence that the applicant could face , the GPE report stated firstly that , \u201c In imposing a sentence in a federal criminal case , the judge must consult ORG Federal Sentencing Guidelines \u201d . It added that the Guidelines were advisory since the judge had \u201c the discretion to impose a sentence outside the applicable LAW long as the court states \u2018 with specificity,\u2019 both at sentencing and in the written judgment and commitment order , its reason for doing so \u201d . It additionally stated that , \u201d . Moreover , the decision whether to sentence a person convicted of multiple counts concurrently or consecutively was at the discretion of the court . Section CARDINAL of LAW of LAW , states , in part , that \u201c [ m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively \u201d . The report further stressed the following :", "\u201c Prior to sentencing , a probation officer will prepare a presentence report that contains information about the defendant \u2019s offense , his criminal history , other background information , and a calculation of the advisory sentencing range under LAW . The defendant has the right to object to the information and conclusion in the present report . Later , during the sentencing phase of the proceedings , defense counsel will be able to present to the judge various mitigating factors to consider that may result in the reduction of his sentence . Specifically , under LAW , LAW , Section CARDINAL(a ) , in determining the particular sentence imposed on a defendant , the court shall consider : ( CARDINAL ) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant ; ( CARDINAL ) the need for the sentence imposed to promote respect for the law , punishment for the offense , deter the defendant or others from committing similar criminal conduct , and the need to protect the public ; ( CARDINAL ) the kinds of sentences available ; ( CARDINAL ) the applicable guideline range ; ( CARDINAL ) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training , medical care , or other correctional treatment ; ( CARDINAL ) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities ; and ( CARDINAL ) the need to provide restitution to the victims of the offense(s ) . In assisting the court in considering the above CARDINAL factors , defense counsel will be able to present to the court in detail any mitigating factors relating to these criteria . This would enable the defense to provide to the sentencing court information regarding PERSON background and circumstances , including : his family environment and relationships , the environment in which he was raised , his work history , ... socioeconomic factors including educational opportunities or lack thereof , his physical and psychological well - being and any past or current treatment , prior criminal conduct , if any , and any resultant rehabilitative programs and periods of probation , incarceration , and parole , as well as PERSON longterm educational , vocational , and sociological goals \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report noted that there were many factors that contributed to the imposition of a sentence and that it was \u201c impossible to address every conceivable permutation that could occur or every possible scenario that might arise \u201d . However , the report indicated that according to ORG , the advisory sentencing range was \u201c CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE incarceration , far less than the possible life sentence provided for under the statutes with which he was charged \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the report stated that under section CARDINAL(a ) of Title CARDINAL of LAW , there was a \u201c need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities \u201d . In that regard , the report stated that several of the applicant \u2019s co - conspirators had already been sentenced in a related case before the same judge who had been assigned to the applicant \u2019s case . CARDINAL of the co - conspirators \u201c faced a Guidelines range of CARDINAL to DATE and received a sentence of DATE incarceration \u201d , another \u201c faced a Guidelines range of DATE and received a sentence of DATE incarceration \u201d and a third had \u201c faced a Guidelines range of DATE and received a sentence of ORG Served ( DATE incarceration ) \u201d . The GPE report also noted that none of those defendants had entered into cooperation agreements with the government . Consequently , the sentences imposed on the applicant \u2019s co - conspirators by the same judge who had been assigned to the applicant \u2019s case \u201c [ could ] be of value in assessing the sentence that will be imposed on him \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The report concluded that while it was possible that any available maximum sentence could be imposed for an offence , under the circumstances present in this case , \u201c the risk of PERSON receiving such a sentence is low \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards the second question , the GPE report stated that if the applicant was sentenced to a life term , he could benefit from a variety of mechanisms to seek to have the sentence invalidated or reduced or to obtain early release .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the applicant \u2019s right to invalidate or reduce his sentence , the ORG stated that the applicant would have the right under GPE law to lodge an appeal with ORG , asking for a reversal of his conviction \u201c based on an error in the proceedings \u201d . The applicant would also be able to \u201c ask ORG to review the appropriateness of his sentence \u201d . He could argue that a life sentence was \u201c unreasonable \u201d in the circumstances of his case . The report also stated that even after the applicant had exhausted his rights at trial and on appeal , he could under GPE law file \u201c a motion in the trial court claiming that his life sentence was imposed \u2018 in violation of the LAW or the laws of ORG , or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence , or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law , or is otherwise subject to collateral attack \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the applicant \u2019s right to obtain early release , the report specifically stated that \u201c since DATE , there has been no federal parole system in GPE \u201d . The applicant , however , could ask for early release if he provided substantial assistance after his conviction and the imposition of his sentence . In addition , GPE law also allowed for compassionate release under section ORG of Title CARDINAL of LAW . The report specifically stressed that ORG could reduce the applicant \u2019s sentence if it found that there was \u201c an extraordinary and compelling reason to do so ; for example , if a medical condition arose with PERSON that would warrant such a modification \u201d . Finally , the applicant could also seek executive clemency in the form of commutation ( reduction ) of his sentence . The report noted that in cases similar to the applicant \u2019s , commutation of life sentences was not \u201c a rare occurrence \u201d . It gave as an example that of CARDINAL DATE , when President PERSON had commuted the life sentences of \u201c CARDINAL persons who had been convicted of drug related offenses \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the interim measures under Rule CARDINAL were extended and the ORG requested that the ORG stay the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE while the proceedings were pending before the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
