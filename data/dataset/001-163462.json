On DATE ORG quashed that ruling and remitted the case to the same court for fresh examination . In particular , it ruled that the issue under examination did not just concern a dispute between CARDINAL legal entities as to the ownership of LOC .

On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s appeal in cassation and upheld the ruling of DATE , finding no grounds for quashing it . In particular , it held that the LOC had become communal property on DATE and thus ORG was the competent body to transfer title to property owned by it . Therefore , it was only within the competence of ORG to decide and order return of such LOC .
