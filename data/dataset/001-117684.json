The applicant , a NORP national of NORP origin , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant left GPE for GPE and GPE in DATE , with his mother . They arrived in GPE in DATE and lodged an asylum request there .", "CARDINAL . He claimed in his asylum proceedings that in DATE his father had been shot before his eyes . The applicant \u2019s father had worked in the security services of former President PERSON , a separatist leader , which was why he and his family had been persecuted . Furthermore , the applicant had been arrested CARDINAL times and only released after the payment of a ransom . The applicant stated that he had been ill - treated during those arrests and also that in DATE NORP soldiers had brutally beaten him in the course of an identity check .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s asylum request as unfounded . It found the applicant \u2019s story contradictory and unconvincing and also found that he had failed to substantiate the existence of any real risk to himself .", "CARDINAL . It seems that the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s asylum request was also dismissed , for the same reasons .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and his mother appealed . However , after an oral appeal hearing , the applicant withdrew his appeal on DATE due to allegedly wrong legal advice he received at the time .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Asylgerichtshof ) allowed the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s appeal and granted her the status of a recognised refugee . As regards her flight story it found as follows :", "\u201c The following has been established concerning the appellant and her reasons for fleeing :", "The appellant claims to be a GPE national of NORP ethnic origin and , prior to fleeing , lived in the village of GPE in GPE .", "It is credible that in the event of her return to her country of origin , the appellant would be under threat from ORG authorities or third parties on account of her membership of a particular social group . The appellant alleged that she was under threat from NORP and NORP security forces because of her husband \u2019s previous activities .", "It has been found plausible that the appellant \u2019s husband was an officer for a NORP security agency and was murdered by the security forces on DATE in the village of GPE .", "The findings as to the appellant and her reasons for fleeing result from the descriptions given by the persons examined at the hearing , which \u2013 in this respect \u2013 are consistent and credible . The appellant was able to give a description of her husband \u2019s murder that was clear and consistent with her previous statements , thereby conveying the impression of having actually experienced what she was talking about . The witness ORG gave a convincing statement confirming that the appellant \u2019s husband worked for a NORP security agency . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After referring to a number of general country reports on GPE and the north GPE region , ORG continued its legal assessment of the facts of the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s case , as follows :", "\u201c Regard being had to the findings concerning the situation of NORP in GPE , the appellant faces an objective risk of persecution in view of the facts established as to her reasons for seeking asylum . The appellant \u2019s husband was murdered in his homeland because of his work for a NORP security agency . Accordingly , the appellant is already known to the NORP and pro - NORP authorities and has come specifically to their attention . This means that she is in particular danger of being arrested by the security forces in GPE , and in such an eventuality there is a significant probability that she would be at risk of suffering human rights violations . Moreover , in view of the situation in GPE and the fact that the appellant is known by name to the authorities , it can not be assumed with sufficient certainty that she would not be exposed in other parts of GPE , for example , to attacks of any kind warranting asylum or that she could expect effective protection from the authorities against such attacks . Accordingly , the appellant \u2013 who , moreover , is suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder \u2013 has no reasonable internal flight alternatives available either . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a new asylum request . In interviews conducted in the course of those asylum proceedings , the applicant repeated the initial reasons he had given for leaving GPE , and informed the authorities that he had married a NORP national in DATE and that the couple had QUANTITY children together , born in DATE and DATE . When asked if his mother was alive , the applicant stated his mother \u2019s name and that she lived with him and his family in the same apartment . He explained that his family therefore all lived in GPE and that he would like to be with them and work there . When the applicant was notified that he had not lodged any new facts , he stated that he knew that , but that he did not have any new facts to offer or information in that regard .", "CARDINAL . The applicant confirmed that he still had relatives and friends in GPE and that a cousin of his had returned to GPE from GPE in DATE . A brother of his father lived in ORG . Referring to his criminal convictions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) the applicant stated that he regretted his mistakes . Finally , in the interview on DATE the applicant stated , when asked whether he was taking any medication at the moment , that he was not .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s subsequent asylum request as res judicata . It established the applicant \u2019s identity and reiterated the proceedings in his respect . In the context of the applicant \u2019s private and family life in GPE , ORG referred to his mother , wife and children , confirming that they were all recognised refugees in GPE and citing their file numbers . Indicating various country reports , inter alia by ORG of DATE , ORG on GPE of DATE , ORG GPE ) , LAW , ORG of ORG ) and the country of origin information available to ORG , it noted that the general security situation and the protection of human rights in the north GPE region had deteriorated again in DATE and DATE . In some cases of individuals who had decided to follow rebel groups , the authorities were reported to have retaliated by burning down the houses of their relatives . The numbers of abductions had also increased again , to CARDINAL cases in DATE . ORG further referred to the amnesty regime introduced in DATE and the surge of house burnings in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion and as regards the applicant \u2019s submissions , ORG stated that the applicant \u2019s initial reasons for leaving had already been considered unconvincing in the first proceedings and that the applicant had not forwarded any new relevant information in the new proceedings .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant against this decision was granted suspensive effect . In his appeal the applicant claimed deficiencies of the proceedings and a wrong legal assessment of the established facts by ORG . He claimed that , because he was still at real risk of persecution if he returned to GPE and because of the deterioration of the security situation there , his subsequent asylum request could not be considered a res judicata .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as unfounded . In the summary of the facts of the case , it referred to the applicant \u2019s mother , wife and children , while again citing the file numbers of their asylum proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As regards the nature of a res judicata , it reiterated that a new decision on the merits of an application could only be based upon a change of circumstances which was significant enough to allow the conclusion , either alone or in combination with other facts , that those reasons for which the former application had been dismissed were to be evaluated differently in the present proceedings . Referring to long - standing administrative jurisprudence , it further stated that the credibility of the alleged new facts had to be evaluated anew in the context of all former investigation results in the event that those alleged new facts could prima facie lead to a different outcome of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on and established that the applicant \u2019s reasons for leaving GPE presented in the subsequent proceedings had already been deemed unconvincing by the previous final decision . It therefore confirmed that the applicant had not presented any relevant new information with regard to his asylum request . Furthermore , the applicant was not suffering from any severe psychological or physical illness , and still had friends and family living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his family life , it considered that the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE would constitute an interference with his family life , since the applicant lived with his mother , wife and CARDINAL minor children , who were all recognised refugees , but found that the applicant had never had secure residence status in GPE , even when he had married , and that he had not shown that he had substantially integrated into NORP society . On the other hand , the applicant had been convicted CARDINAL times of criminal offences such as theft and aggravated bodily harm , and an exclusion order in respect of residence until DATE had been issued in DATE , which had led to the conclusion that the public interest in the applicant \u2019s removal outweighed his private interest in respect of his family life in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Verfassungsgerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for legal aid to enable him to lodge a complaint . That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted of theft and attempted theft on DATE and DATE , fined MONEY ( ORG ) and sentenced to DATE imprisonment , suspended with probation . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( ORG ) convicted the applicant of trafficking under the DATE LAW ( Fremdenpolizeigesetz ) and of aggravated bodily harm , and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . Finally , on DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) again convicted the applicant of aggravated bodily harm and sentenced him to an additional CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) issued an unlimited residence ban ( unbefristetes PERSON ) against the applicant . Due to an amendment of the DATE LAW , the validity of the residence ban was later reduced to DATE , i.e. until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG summoned the applicant to arrange for his removal . It seems that a travel certificate had been requested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG applied an interim measure under Rule CARDINAL and requested ORG to stay the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE until further notice .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE the applicant was treated as an inpatient at ORG in GPE for a depressive episode . The discharge letter of DATE stated that he had been admitted suffering from a severe depressive episode and suicidal thoughts , so that his medication could be adjusted . He was prescribed NORP and GPE when he was released . For his health to continue to improve it was recommended that he should continue to have his family \u2019s support and that removal to GPE would be irresponsible from a psychiatric point of view .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and after one consultation , ORG confirmed that the applicant was suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder and a medium - level depressive episode and recommended pharmacological and psychotherapeutical treatment . It also advised against removing him to GPE .", "CARDINAL . A diagnostic letter from ORG in GPE dated CARDINAL DATE stated that a GPE scan had shown a facial bone conversion in his right ventral maxilla that would correspond with the applicant \u2019s statement that he had been physically abused in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of General Administrative Procedure ( Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz ) provided that submissions from individuals who request modification of a ruling which is not , or is no longer , subject to appeal , shall be rejected as res judicata . In this context the DATE LAW ( DATE ) included in its section QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL a reference to section CARDINAL of LAW that", "\u201c Decisions rejecting or dismissing a request under the [ former versions of the ] Asylum Act ... shall constitute res judicata in proceedings under LAW concerning the same facts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has observed in its jurisprudence as follows ( see judgment of ORG of DATE , no . CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c An alleged change in circumstances may entitle and require the authority to give a fresh decision on the merits \u2013 once it has carried out any necessary investigations of its own motion under LAW of LAW \u2013 only where such a change , by itself or in combination with other facts , would be of legal relevance to the question of asylum ; a different legal assessment of the request must not be prima facie inconceivable . Furthermore , the alleged change in circumstances must have at least a credible basis which is relevant to the question of asylum and to which to the above - mentioned prospect of a positive decision can be linked . To that end , as soon as it begins to examine the admissibility of the ( fresh ) asylum request , the authority must address the credibility of the asylum - seeker \u2019s allegations and , where appropriate , the evidential value of any certificates . Should the authority \u2019s investigations conclude that , contrary to the party \u2019s allegations , a change in circumstances which is prima facie capable of giving rise to a different assessment has not in fact occurred , the asylum request must be rejected in accordance with section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see decision of DATE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL , with further references ; see also the case - law recapitulated in PERSON , Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetze I , CARDINALnd ed . , notes CARDINAL et seq . on section CARDINAL of LAW ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This section gives a short overview of selected reports from various easily accessible sources on the security and human rights situation in GPE available at the time of the applicant \u2019s subsequent asylum proceedings in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner stated that the north GPE has been a region of major interest and concern from the very beginnings of the office of the Commissioner of Human Rights in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner noted that the lifting of the DATE - long counterterrorist operation in GPE had not been accompanied by a diminution in the activities of illegal armed groups . Federal and NORP authorities had carried out CARDINAL special operations in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL ) . The report further noted an increase in the number of abductions and disappearances in GPE since DATE . In some cases , the involvement of law - enforcement officials had been alleged ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) . Finally , the lack of effective investigations of repeated human rights violations , the alleged involvement of law - enforcement officials in crimes , and the deficiencies of the judiciary , were concerns which had been raised by both the current Commissioner and his predecessor ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . He concluded the report with regret , in view of the fact that stability in the north GPE region had yet to be achieved . Increased activity by illegal armed groups , the lack of effective investigations of disappearances and killings , and murders of human rights activists were of particular concern . Patterns of impunity persisted , even though there were indications of serious efforts to reinforce the rule of law . The difficult economic situation was one of the destabilising factors , and the need for economic development and further social reconstruction was evident ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . This report described the north GPE region of GPE as remaining an area of particular concern . The government \u2019s poor human rights record in the north GPE worsened as the government fought insurgents , NORP militants , and criminal forces . Local government and insurgent forces reportedly engaged in killing , torture , abuse , violence , politically motivated abductions , and other brutal or humiliating treatment , often with impunity . In GPE , PERSON and ORG , the number of extrajudicial killings and disappearances increased markedly , as did the number of attacks on law - enforcement personnel . Authorities in the north GPE appeared to be acting outside federal government control . Although the NORP government announced a formal end to counterterrorist operations , there was an increase in violence during DATE , which continued through the remainder of DATE . Federal and local security forces in GPE , as well as the private militia of NORP president PERSON , allegedly targeted families of suspected insurgents for reprisals and committed other abuses . There were also reports of rebel involvement in bombing civilian targets and of politically motivated disappearances in the region . Some rebels were allegedly involved in kidnapping for ransom . According to the PERSON news agency ORG , CARDINAL members of law - enforcement agencies lost their lives and CARDINAL were injured during DATE in actions involving insurgents . CARDINAL of internally displaced persons were living in temporary centres in the region : the centres failed to meet international standards .", "CARDINAL . Under the heading \u201c Use of Excessive Force and Other Abuses in Internal Conflicts \u201d , it was noted that during DATE complex and inter - connected insurgencies caused continuing instability in the north GPE , with a marked upsurge in incidents committed by government and insurgent forces during DATE . Overall , there were increases in disappearances , killings , and other abuses . There were reports that federal and local security forces seeking to quell the insurgencies were continuing to use excessive force and to engage in human rights abuses , including torture , summary executions , disappearances , and arbitrary detentions . Authorities in the north GPE were reportedly acting with impunity , and some observers alleged that the federal government had ceded de facto control of the region to local authorities . Rebels were also continuing to commit human rights abuses , including major acts of terrorism and summary executions .", "CARDINAL . As regards abductions , the report stated that Government personnel , rebels and criminal elements were continuing to engage in abductions in the north GPE . Officials and observers disagreed on the numbers involved . Human rights groups believed that the numbers of abductions were under - reported , due to the reluctance of GPE relatives to complain to authorities for fear of reprisals . ORG reported that during DATE there were CARDINAL kidnappings in GPE , while the MAShR NGO reported CARDINAL disappearances in GPE and CARDINAL disappearances in ORG . It stated that there was no accountability for government forces involved in abductions . There were continued reports that abductions were followed by beatings or torture to extract confessions , and that abductions were conducted for political reasons . Criminal groups in the region , possibly with links to rebel forces , frequently resorted to kidnapping .", "CARDINAL . Finally , under the heading \u201c Physical Abuse , Punishment and Torture \u201d , it could be read that armed forces and police units were reported to have frequently abused and tortured people in holding facilities where federal authorities took them to separate fighters and those who were suspected of aiding rebels from ordinary civilians .", "CARDINAL . The ORG report stated that there were continuing reports of human rights violations , including arbitrary detention , torture and ill - treatment , and extrajudicial executions , by law - enforcement officials in GPE , PERSON and ORG . There was also an ongoing concern that investigations of these violations were not effective , resulting in widespread impunity .", "CARDINAL . The present report was an update to the organisation \u2019s report of DATE and used sources from human rights organisations , such as FAC of the NORP ORG , ORG , as well as the results of a meeting with CARDINAL human - rights activists from the north GPE and a NORP human - rights specialist . The report stated that the security situation in the whole north GPE region had deteriorated . In DATE the number of those killed in \u201c special operations \u201d conducted by security services or in terrorist attacks had doubled . ORG reported CARDINAL deaths DATE in the whole region ( see page CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The report cited arbitrary arrests , secretive detention , torture and ill - treatment , disappearances and abductions , death in detention and extrajudicial executions , the burning of houses , displacements and forced recruitments as the most severe violations of human rights ( see page CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "CARDINAL . Members of non - governmental organisations , journalists , members of the political opposition , victims and their relatives , witnesses and lawyers , relatives of armed rebels or of members of the security services , young religious men and internally displaced persons were considered to be those most at risk of being subjected to serious human rights violations in the region . Furthermore , returnees from abroad were , according to a member of ORG , at particular risk . They were under suspicion of having fled because of their membership of the armed opposition and of having returned with considerable financial resources .", "CARDINAL . In this context the report referred to a letter from the NORP office of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) of CARDINAL DATE that stated , as regards asylum requests by refugees from GPE , that while the military and security situation in GPE had significantly improved , there were still instances of human - rights violations that could lead to well - founded asylum requests by NORP . Such requests should therefore be fairly and efficiently examined by the authorities . As regards those who had already been recognised as refugees , the ORG recommended that they should in any event be able to keep their legal status . Any return to ORG should be done on an exclusively voluntary basis ( see page CARDINAL , including a link to the cited document by the ORG office in GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG summarised newer relevant country reports only recently in its judgement GPE v. GPE ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . FAC , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL et seq , DATE ) . Where available , updated information once more depicts the following situation :", "CARDINAL . The report for DATE identified as CARDINAL of the most significant problems during DATE in its executive summary that the rule of law was particularly deficient in the north GPE , where the conflict between the government and insurgents , NORP militants and criminal forces had led to numerous human rights abuses by security forces and insurgents , who were reportedly engaging in killing , torture , physical abuse and politically motivated abductions . In addition , the government of PERSON in GPE was continuing to violate fundamental freedoms , engage in collective retribution against families of suspected militants , and foster an overall atmosphere of fear and intimidation .", "CARDINAL . More precisely , the report stated under the heading \u201c Use of Excessive Force and Other Abuses in Internal Conflicts \u201d that violence was continuing in the north GPE republics , driven by separatism , inter - ethnic conflict , jihadist movements , vendettas , criminality and excesses by security forces . PERSON continued to be the most violent area in the north GPE ; GPE - Balkaria also saw an increase in violence compared with DATE , while violence continued to decrease in GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . It further noted that government personnel , rebels and criminal elements were continuing to engage in abductions in the north GPE . The head of the prosecutor general \u2019s office for the north GPE stated in DATE that CARDINAL disappearances remained unsolved in the north GPE republics . Security forces in GPE , PERSON and ORG frequently abducted or detained individuals for DATE without immediate explanation or charge . Human rights groups believed the number of abductions was under - reported because ORG relatives were reluctant to complain to authorities due to fear of reprisals . Generally , there was no accountability for government security personnel involved in abductions . Memorial reported at DATE that CARDINAL NORP citizens from the north GPE had been kidnapped since DATE . According to PERSON , in DATE there were CARDINAL disappearances , CARDINAL of which took place in LOC , CARDINAL in GPE , CARDINAL in ORG and CARDINAL in Kabardino - Balkaria . Human rights groups alleged that security forces under the command of PERSON played a significant role in abductions , either on their own initiative or in joint operations with federal forces , including abductions of family members of rebel commanders and fighters .", "CARDINAL . Under the heading \u201c Physical abuse , punishment and torture \u201d the paper mentioned that armed forces and police units in the region reportedly abused and tortured both rebels and civilians in holding facilities . The burning of homes of suspected rebels , a mechanism of collective punishment in use since DATE , was reportedly continuing .", "CARDINAL . As regards the security situation in the north GPE , the report found that it remained volatile , and serious human rights abuses were being committed by both armed groups and security officials . The rapid post - conflict reconstruction of GPE continued with high levels of federal funding , though unemployment remained a problem . Activity by armed groups declined compared to other regions in the north GPE . Law - enforcement operations continued to give rise to reports of serious human rights violations . In a letter to the human rights NGO The Interregional Committee Against Torture , a senior NORP prosecutor acknowledged that investigations of enforced disappearances in GPE were ineffective .", "CARDINAL . As regards the north GPE the report stated that according to official statements , the number of insurgent attacks in the north GPE doubled in DATE compared to DATE . In DATE the NORP insurgency remained on the rise , especially in GPE . The authorities\u2019 use of torture , abduction - style detention , enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in the course of their counter - insurgency campaign , coupled with impunity for these abuses , had antagonised the population of the north GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP law - enforcement and security agencies under Ramzan ORG de facto control were continuing to resort to collective punishment of relatives and suspected supporters of alleged insurgents . PERSON documented CARDINAL abductions of local residents by security forces DATE . CARDINAL of those abducted subsequently \u201c disappeared \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Increasingly , victims refused to speak about violations due to fear of official retribution . In a letter to a NORP NGO in DATE federal authorities stated that police in GPE sabotaged investigations of abductions of local residents , and sometimes covered up for perpetrators . The letter marked the first public acknowledgment of the importance of federal investigative authorities in investigating abuses in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
