The applicant was very active in this position and , in particular , he demanded the use of clean sheets for conductors who had to stay TIME in the trains . He made several proposals of this kind to the internal proposals department ( betriebliches GPE ) and complained that the existing pricing system of train tickets was confusing . His superiors did not take up these proposals or complaints .", "As of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was transferred from his post as conductor and worked instead as a switch cleaner ( Weichenreiniger ) .", "On DATE the applicant distributed leaflets with the following contents at FAC ( Wiener GPE ) .", "< Translation >", "\" These are the ways of the railways !

I will keep the PERSON informed about my activities . \"", "Thereupon disciplinary proceedings were instituted before ORG ( PERSON ) against the applicant .", "On DATE ORG found that the applicant had infringed LAW ) in that he had distributed leaflets in public which were likely to harm the reputation of ORG and its employees , that he had taken a journalist in dangerous circumstances to the area of the switches , and that he had discussed internal matters in a letter to the publisher of a magazine . Under Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Regulations , an employee of ORG has to respect and pursue the interests of the service , refrain from disparaging his superiors , must keep confidential all issues relating to the service and must not publish in the media or otherwise matters relating to his service without prior authorisation . ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s dismissal as a disciplinary sanction .", "On DATE ORG ( Disziplinaroberkammer ) confirmed the applicant \u2019s dismissal on disciplinary grounds .", "On DATE the applicant filed an action for the annulment of his dismissal with ORG ( Arbeitsgericht ) . He requested the court to declare that his employment contract was still valid , that ORG had to re - employ him under the previous conditions and had to pay the outstanding salary . The applicant submitted that he was a staff representative and therefore could not be dismissed without the prior consent of a court .", "Subsequently court hearings took place on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE , the court decided to obtain expert evidence on the question whether the applicant had full capacity to act . The expert reports which answered this question in the affirmative were submitted on DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "In a court hearing which took place on DATE , the parties concluded a friendly settlement . DATE , however , the applicant revoked the settlement .", "In the subsequent hearing on DATE , the court suspended the proceedings pending the decision of ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) in a similar case dealing with the question of whether LAW were applicable to employment relations within ORG . ORG considered this decision relevant because the applicant \u2019s dismissal would not have been lawful if ORG rejected the applicability of LAW . ORG undertook to inform the applicant about the outcome of those proceedings . The present proceedings were only to be continued upon the request of CARDINAL of the parties . The parties waived their right to appeal against this decision .", "By letter of DATE , ORG informed ORG about ORG findings in the parallel proceedings . The applicant received this information on DATE . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG had found that the employment relationship between an employee and ORG was of a private nature and that LAW were part of the employment contract . The matter was remitted to ORG in that case .", "On DATE the applicant requested the continuation of the proceedings instituted by him . On DATE a further court hearing took place .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action on the ground that his claims had become time - barred . It found that the applicant had not requested the continuation of the proceedings in time after DATE . It was irrelevant that the final decision in the parallel case had been taken on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the applicant appealed against this judgment and on DATE the defendant company submitted its observations .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) granted the applicant \u2019s appeal , quashed the above decision and remitted the case to ORG . It found that ORG decision to suspend the proceedings pending the outcome of other proceedings had not been formulated with sufficient precision , so that the applicant may have had the impression that the relevant event was the final termination of those other proceedings and not the judgment of ORG . The applicant could not therefore be blamed for not having requested the continuation of the proceedings earlier .", "On DATE , after further court hearings on DATE and DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . ORG stated that ORG ) , providing special protection for members of the works council ( NORP ) against their dismissal , did not apply to employees of ORG . ORG found that the mere distribution of leaflets to employees did not constitute a breach of professional duties . However , in the present case the contents of the leaflet which the applicant had distributed constituted a breach of the professional duty of loyalty , because it was written in a polemical and unobjective manner and , in particular , contained an incitement to other employees to breach their professional duty not to disseminate the company \u2019s internal matters to the public . Furthermore , the applicant had contributed to the publication of an article by a magazine , in which the defendant company had been criticised in a polemical manner . He had not only tolerated the publication of this article but had also approved of it in a letter to the publisher . The applicant \u2019s conduct therefore constituted a serious breach of his professional duty of loyalty vis - \u00e0 - vis his employer and justified his dismissal .", "On DATE the applicant appealed . He criticised the assessment of evidence and submitted that ORG had based its finding that the dismissal was justified on grounds which had not been invoked in the disciplinary decision . He also complained that his freedom of expression was restricted on the ground that he was an employee of ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It found that ORG had correctly assessed the evidence taken . Furthermore , ORG had correctly taken into account the published article and the applicant \u2019s letter to the editor , as the disciplinary decision dismissing the applicant also related to those events . In any case , the applicant \u2019s conduct constituted a violation of his professional duties , a fact which he himself had never denied . Although an employee \u2019s freedom of expression must not be unduly restricted by the employer , the expression of opinion must nevertheless not impair the employer \u2019s justified interests . This was especially true in the case of ORG , since its reputation as a company offering a public service easily suffered from unjustified criticism , in particular when voiced by a company employee .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( Revision ) with ORG in which he complained , inter alia , about a restriction on his freedom of expression .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that the dismissal was justified by the applicant \u2019s conduct , which constituted a breach of his professional duties . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that his freedom of expression was restricted , the ORG found that the right to freedom of expression has its limits where the legitimate interests of others are impaired . It was beyond any doubt that the unqualified , disparaging statements made by the applicant in the leaflets impaired the legitimate interests of ORG .", "PERSON Relevant domestic law", "According to the constant case - law of ORG = GPE .

It is basically an employment contract ( NORP ) under LAW of LAW ( ORG ) . There exist various regulations issued by ORG concerning the service , remuneration , pensions and disciplinary proceedings . These regulations , although some of them are published in ORG , are not administrative acts but general contract schemes which define the contractual relationship ( PERSON ) . By accepting the employment contract , an employee also accepts these regulations as a part of it .", "In performing the duties under the contract , an employee is subject to instructions from the employer , which specify the manner in which the duties must be performed . Employment contracts may also provide a possibility for the employer to impose disciplinary sanctions . This element must be explicitly mentioned in the contract .", "Employment contracts may provide that their termination ( PERSON ) is not subject to the general rules of LAW ( Sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , but may further restrict the right of the parties to give notice , i.e. by requiring specific or important reasons . This possibility does not impair the parties\u2019 right to terminate the contract without notice for important reasons under LAW , i.e. dismissal ( PERSON ) or notice to quit ( PERSON ) . Important reasons for a dismissal are , inter alia , breaches of the obligations under the employment contract , in particular a breach of the duty of loyalty ( PERSON ) . A breach of the duty of loyalty may include inciting other employees to breach their professional duties , the unfavourable public presentation of employment conditions or other deficiencies in the economic undertaking , or supplying information to the press which runs counter to the economic interests of the employer ( see PERSON , ABGB GPE , GPE DATE , Section CARDINAL , Marginal Notes CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL with references to the case - law of the labour courts ) .", "As regards disciplinary proceedings provided for in labour contracts ( betriebliche ORG ) , ORG in a leading decision ( DATE , CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Collection of the Judgments of ORG in Civil Law Matters = SZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL = ORG . DATE ) found that the ordinary civil courts ( labour courts ) are competent to decide on disputes relating to disciplinary measures taken by the internal bodies of business undertakings ( ORG ) . The courts have to examine whether such disciplinary measures are in conformity with the law and the specific employment contract . They are in no way bound by the decision taken by the disciplinary body , but must verify the facts on which the disciplinary body has based its decision , and determine whether those facts constitute a breach of the employee \u2019s contractual duties . It might be helpful for businesses to have internal disciplinary procedures , but they would have no influence on the subsequent court decisions , since such internal procedures necessarily lack the guarantees of ordinary court proceedings . Internal disciplinary bodies have no powers corresponding to those of the ordinary courts since they can not compel witnesses to appear or tell the truth under oath ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
