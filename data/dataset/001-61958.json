The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national born in DATE . When lodging his application , he was detained in GPE , GPE . He is presently living in PERSON , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in PERSON . On DATE the ORG issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant on the ground that he was strongly suspected of having committed , with others , robbery connected with attempted murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant with attempted murder , aggravated robbery , grievous physical injury and unauthorised carrying of weapons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG admitted the indictment without modifications and decided to open the trial against the applicant and CARDINAL other accused . The trial started on DATE and took place on DATE with an average duration of TIME . On CARDINAL DATE a lay assessor fell ill . As the additional lay assessor who was supposed to replace her had also fallen sick earlier on , the trial had to begin anew .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the arrest warrant against the applicant . It found that irrespective of the delay occasioned by the FAC illness , the applicant \u2019s continued detention was proportionate given the serious nature of the crimes he was accused of .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial reopened with CARDINAL additional lay assessors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision to uphold the arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s renewed request to suspend the warrant of arrest of DATE on the ground that the applicant remained under strong suspicion of having committed the crimes that he was accused of . On DATE ORG , upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , reconsidered and confirmed its decision of DATE . It held that the delay in the trial had been caused by exceptional circumstances such as the difficulty in taking evidence , which required further investigations during the trial , and the illness of a lay assessor as well as the temporary illness of the presiding judge . The strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the serious crimes he was accused of had not been invalidated during the trial . As the applicant \u2019s partner and son lived in GPE , the applicant was also likely to abscond if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the decision of the lower court , stating that although the applicant had at that point already been in custody for DATE , this did not justify his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s new request to suspend the warrant of arrest of DATE on the ground that the allegedly new evidence submitted by the applicant did not justify such a suspension . It found that if released , the applicant was very likely to abscond , given the circumstances of his arrest and the sentence which he risked incurring if found guilty as charged . ORG noted that the applicant was residing illegally in GPE and that an expulsion order had been issued against him . The length of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand did not compare to the risk mentioned above . ORG included a detailed account of the trial , explaining the continued conduct of the proceedings , which disclosed that on several occasions witnesses could not be questioned by the court because they either did not come to the hearing or made use of their right not to testify . Furthermore , the applicant and his co - accused had , often later than necessary , filed numerous motions for evidence to be taken . It observed that at the present time , it was not possible to disjoin the applicant \u2019s case from those of the other accused , as they were accused of committing the offences jointly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG confirmed its original decision . It pointed out that the prolonged investigations by way of letters rogatory in GPE and the summoning of witnesses from abroad , which were necessitated by the belated alibi produced by CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - accused , did not warrant the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further request to suspend the arrest warrant on the grounds that contrary to his allegations , the suspicion persisted that he had committed the crimes he was accused of and was still likely to abscond if released , especially considering the high prison sentence he risked incurring if found guilty according to the indictment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG pronounced its judgment after having held an average of CARDINAL hearings per month with an average duration of CARDINAL and a half hours each . It convicted the applicant of attempted murder , aggravated robbery and grievous physical injury as well as of unauthorised carrying of weapons and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . In fixing the length of the applicant \u2019s sentence , ORG took into consideration the inordinate length of his detention and of the criminal proceedings , in particular the delay occasioned by the sickness of the lay assessor and the ensuing suspension of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant appealed against ORG judgment . In the negotiations that followed between the applicant \u2019s legal counsel and ORG , the latter eventually consented to the applicant \u2019s expulsion to his country of origin in lieu of serving his prison sentence in GPE . In exchange for this , and due to the increasing length of his detention on remand , which would have continued during the appeal proceedings , the applicant agreed to withdraw his appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant withdrew his appeal . On DATE ORG made an order for costs following the applicant \u2019s withdrawal of the appeal . On DATE , ORG suspended the further execution of the applicant \u2019s prison sentence and agreed to his expulsion to GPE . A new arrest warrant was issued to the effect that , upon returning to GPE before DATE , the applicant would be arrested and imprisoned instantly in order to complete his prison sentence . On DATE , the applicant was expelled to GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
