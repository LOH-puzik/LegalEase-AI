{"ITEMID": "001-22334", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ESP", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "MATA ESTEVEZ v. SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national . He was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicant lived with another man , Mr PERSON , for DATE . During that period the applicant and Mr PERSON ran a joint household , pooling their income and sharing their expenses . The applicant considered that the nature of their relationship reflected their right to respect for their private and family life since , being homosexual , they could not sanction it by marrying because under NORP law only heterosexual couples could marry .", "On DATE Mr PERSON died in a road accident . The applicant claimed the social - security allowances for the surviving spouse , arguing that he had cohabited with the deceased for DATE . ORG ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) granted the applicant \u2019s claim in respect of an allowance for death expenses , which amounted to MONEY . However , in a decision of DATE , it refused to grant him a survivor \u2019s pension on the ground that since he had not been married to PERSON , he could not legally be considered as his surviving spouse for the purposes of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG . The applicant appealed against that decision , but his appeal was dismissed .", "The applicant then appealed to ORG no . CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , delivered after a hearing deemed to be inter partes , the court dismissed the appeal . It based its decision on , among other things , the case - law established by a number of judgments of ORG dismissing appeals lodged by heterosexual applicants whose claims for a survivor \u2019s pension had been dismissed on the ground that they had been able to marry but had freely decided not to . The court held that the case - law in question could be extended to de facto partnerships between homosexuals living together as a married couple in so far as that type of relationship could not be equated with the traditional concept of family and marriage protected by the legislature and LAW . The court also stated that Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of LAW did not guarantee equality of treatment between de facto homosexual partnerships and heterosexual marriages .", "The applicant appealed against that judgment to ORG . In a judgment of DATE that court dismissed the appeal and upheld the reasoning of the lower court . ORG added , however , that it was for the legislature and not for the courts to take a decision regarding the extension of survivors\u2019 pensions to stable de facto partnerships , be they heterosexual or not . Accordingly , ORG held that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG was compatible both with the LAW and the international treaties to which GPE was a party .", "Relying on Articles CARDINAL ( principle of non - discrimination ) and CARDINAL ( social , economic and legal protection of the family ) of the LAW , the applicant lodged an application for the protection of fundamental rights ( an amparo appeal ) with ORG . In a decision of DATE , in which it referred to its established case - law , that court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it was ill - founded .", "The relevant Articles of the LAW provide :", "\u201c NORP shall be equal before the law and may not be discriminated against in any way on account of birth , race , sex , religion , opinion or any other condition or personal or social circumstance . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG authorities shall ensure that the family is afforded social , economic and legal protection .", "... \u201d", "Under section CARDINAL non - marital relationships between men and women do not entitle the survivor to a survivor \u2019s pension even where the persons concerned have lived together . Accordingly , the award of a survivor \u2019s pension is conditional on the existence of a lawful marriage between the deceased and the claimant . Marriage shall be deemed to be \u201c lawful \u201d where it has been celebrated in accordance with CARDINAL of the forms established by LAW . The only exception to the above rule is that the surviving partner of an unmarried couple who could not marry each other because there was no divorce before DATE may claim a survivor \u2019s pension ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
