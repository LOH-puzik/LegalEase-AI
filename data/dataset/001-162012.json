ORG in its judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , in a case concerning manslaughter , agreed with the lower court that had awarded the victim \u2019s next - of - kin non - pecuniary damages .

As regards the connection between the criminal and civil proceedings in alleged medical malpractice cases , ORG in its decision of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) confirmed ORG Office \u2019s decision that failure of a doctor to comply with the duty of notification about medical treatment or keeping a documentary record of the treatment can be unlawful under civil law , but can not entail a criminal liability . ORG stressed that the violation of a duty under LAW entails liability under civil law , but that type of liability falls outside the scope of criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As regards civil liability , ORG in its judgment of DATE ( no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) noted that a victim may claim compensation for the damage caused by the non - conforming health care service first and foremost on the basis of a breach of the health care services contract . In addition , in the case of causing health damage to a person as a result of a violation of contractual obligations the health care provider may also be liable under the provisions concerning compensation for unlawfully caused damage ( non - contractual liability ) ( section CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In such a case , the victims may submit their claims alternatively and the legal basis of the claim has to be determined by a court regardless of the arguments of the parties .", "CARDINAL . ORG in its judgment of DATE ( case no .

The absence of the causal link must be proved by the defendant . In that case , the plaintiff was awarded compensation for non - pecuniary damage .

CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ORG dealt with the liability related to the provision of health care services . The court relied , inter alia , on the opinion of ORG . It noted that breach of the duty to notify the patient or to obtain the patient \u2019s consent did not serve as sufficient grounds for awarding damages if the patient had not sustained health damage as a result thereof . In that case the plaintiff had been granted legal aid .", "CARDINAL . ORG in its judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) noted that a person who had unlawfully been the victim of a bodily injury or health damage but who had only died later due to this also acquired the right to claim monetary compensation for non - pecuniary damage under section ORG ) of LAW . Under the conditions provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , such claims could be transferred or bequeathed , that is the successors of the deceased person could also file such a claim . In this case , the plaintiff had not acted as a successor in claiming compensation for the possible non - pecuniary damage caused to her spouse . ORG further noted that under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW the next - of - kin of a person who had died or sustained a serious injury or health damage could also claim compensation for non - pecuniary damage if payment of such compensation was justified by exceptional circumstances . Analysing the notion of \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d , ORG found that these did not comprise causing of death or serious health damage as such and noted that grief inevitably accompanied the death of a close person . Rather , a compensation claim of next - of - kin was justified in case of spatial proximity with the next - of - kin at the time of causing of the damage or being a direct witness of an accident or its consequences as well as subsequent distress caused by seeing the injuries or suffering of the died or injured next - of - kin .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ORG dealt with a claim against the hospital for compensation for damage due to the causing of the death of the plaintiff \u2019s mother . The court , inter alia , considered that an opinion of ORG was admissible as documentary evidence . Relying on the said opinion , expert assessment ordered by the first - instance court and other evidence , the courts found that there was no causal link between the provision of the health care service and the death of the plaintiff \u2019s mother . As regards the damage , ORG noted that under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW the next - of - kin of the deceased also had an independent right of claim but held that the plaintiff had to substantiate and prove the existence of \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
