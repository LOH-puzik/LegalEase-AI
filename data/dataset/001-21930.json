THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a NORP national of NORP origin , born in DATE and , at the time of introduction of the application , he was detained in the GPE for expulsion purposes . He is represented before the ORG by Ms G.E.M. Later , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , the applicant entered the GPE where he stayed until his expulsion to GPE on DATE . He returned to the GPE on DATE . On DATE , the NORP consular authorities in the GPE issued a new NORP PERSON identity card to the applicant .", "On DATE , the applicant applied for asylum or , in the alternative , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . He based his claims , inter alia , on the argument that as a person of NORP origin he did not wish to perform his military service in GPE as he might be sent to south - east GPE where he would be made to fight his own people .", "The applicant 's requests were rejected by the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) on DATE and the applicant was ordered to leave the GPE . The applicant 's objection ( bezwaarschrift ) against this decision was rejected by the ORG Secretary on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) sitting in GPE against the ORG Secretary 's decision of DATE . He further requested ORG to issue an injunction on his expulsion pending the appeal proceedings .", "On DATE , ORG rejected both the applicant 's request for an injunction and his appeal against the decision of DATE . This decision was notified to the parties on DATE .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary issued an order for the applicant 's expulsion from the GPE . At some unspecified point in time the applicant was expelled to GPE . He returned to the GPE at a later unspecified point in time .", "On DATE and on the basis of a change in the case - law concerning NORP - NORP asylum seekers who had evaded military service in GPE , the applicant requested the ORG Secretary to reconsider ( heroverwegen ) his case . On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed the applicant that his request was in essence a new request for asylum and that such a request should be filed at CARDINAL of the reception centres for asylum seekers or the aliens ' department ( vreemdelingendienst ) in the applicant 's place of residency . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection against the ORG Secretary 's letter of DATE .", "On DATE , the NORP consular authorities in the GPE issued a NORP passport to the applicant with a validity of one year .", "On DATE , the applicant was apprehended as an illegal alien when he presented himself to the GPE aliens ' department in order to obtain certain documents required for his intended marriage to his NORP partner PERSON When his particulars , as stated in his passport , were verified in ORG ( Vreemdelingen Administratie Systeem ) , it appeared that he was registered as a person who , on the basis of a decision taken by ORG on DATE , was no longer entitled to stay in the GPE .", "Although the applicant held a registration card indicating that , as from DATE , he had reported himself DATE to the aliens ' department in the asylum seekers ' reception centre in PERSON ( a town near GPE ) , his residence status could nevertheless not be sufficiently established and as there were apparently no proceedings pending on a request by the applicant for a residence permit , the applicant was placed in aliens ' detention for the purposes of his expulsion ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) under LAW ( a ) of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) on DATE .", "Also on DATE , the applicant requested ORG to issue an injunction on his expulsion pending the determination by the ORG Secretary of his request for a reconsideration of his first request for asylum . He further filed a second request for asylum or a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and , on this basis , was placed in aliens ' detention under LAW ( c ) of LAW .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG against his placement in aliens ' detention and he requested compensation for the time spent in aliens ' detention .", "On DATE and DATE the applicant was interviewed by an official of ORG in relation to the grounds for his request for asylum . He claimed , inter alia , that he had been summoned to report for military service in GPE and that he feared that , as a conscript in the NORP army , he would be deployed against his own people .", "On DATE , after a hearing held on DATE in the course of which the applicant was represented by his lawyer , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal of CARDINAL DATE as well as his request for compensation . It did not find it established that the applicant 's placement in aliens ' detention was in violation of LAW or that , after having balanced the interests involved , it could not reasonably be regarded as justified .", "ORG noted that , when the applicant had presented himself to the aliens ' department on DATE in connection with his intended marriage , it had appeared that he was no longer allowed to stay in the GPE . It held that this was sufficient indication that the applicant was an illegal alien . The court agreed with the ORG Secretary that public order required the applicant 's placement in aliens ' detention given the fact that he had resided illegally in the GPE for DATE , had returned to the GPE after having been expelled , had applied for asylum DATE after he had returned to the GPE in DATE and had failed to leave the GPE after this request for asylum had been rejected .", "ORG also held that it did not automatically follow from the fact that the applicant reported himself to a reception centre for asylum seekers DATE in order to obtain his benefits under the Regulation on Reception of Asylum Seekers ( Regeling Opvang Asielzoekers ) that he would respect an obligation to report to the authorities on a regular basis , given that he had evaded control for DATE and that he was now aware of the fact that the authorities were actively pursuing his expulsion . Insofar as the applicant relied on his relationship and cohabitation with his NORP partner , ORG noted that , according to the record of the applicant 's interview held on DATE , he had been unable to state her name correctly .", "ORG further held that the argument , advanced by the applicant , to the effect that it could no longer be excluded that persons of NORP origin , while doing their military service in GPE , would be deployed in south - east GPE , by no means increased the chances of success of his second request for asylum , since additional conditions needed to be fulfilled for that to be the case . Finally , ORG accepted that the ORG Secretary had valid reasons to suspect that the applicant would seek ways to avoid his expulsion .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary rejected the applicant 's request for asylum or a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and ordered his expulsion from the GPE . As a result , the legal basis for the applicant 's placement in aliens ' detention was changed to LAW ( a ) of LAW .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG sitting in GPE against the ORG Secretary 's decision of DATE . As he had been placed in aliens ' detention he was not required , like asylum seekers not placed in such detention , first to file an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) with the ORG Secretary of ORG before filing an appeal with ORG .", "As the ORG Secretary had failed to respond to the applicant 's objection of DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG sitting in GPE on DATE against this failure to determine his objection timely .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a second appeal with ORG against the measure of his placement in aliens ' detention and he requested compensation for the time spent in aliens ' detention .", "On DATE , after a hearing held on DATE , ORG decided on the applicant 's appeal of CARDINAL DATE against his placement in aliens ' detention . Insofar as relevant , it held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG considers from the outset that the lawfulness of the measure of placement in aliens ' detention has , as such , already been decided in this court 's decision of DATE which has obtained the force of res iudicata . The only issue to be examined now is the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in aliens ' detention in the circumstances of the present case .", "CARDINAL . ... The < applicant 's > representative has ... submitted that the expulsion of NORP / NORP aliens has been suspended in connection with an incident in GPE , in which an expelled NORP / NORP alien is alleged to have been killed , so that there are no prospects for expulsion and , for this reason , the continuation of the placement in aliens ' detention is unlawful .", "CARDINAL . ...", "CARDINAL . ORG considers , with reference to the letter of CARDINAL DATE of the ORG Secretary addressed to the ORG ordinator for ORG of ORG , that in any event as from that date there are no prospects of expulsion of < the applicant > within a delay that can be regarded as reasonable . On this point , ORG notes that ORG , upon a request by the ORG Secretary of ORG , has conducted an investigation into the backgrounds of the above mentioned incident . Since it was initially assumed that this investigation would only take a relatively short period of time , ORG did not previously see any reason to conclude that there were no longer any prospects for expulsion within a reasonable time . From the aforementioned letter of CARDINAL DATE it has , however , become clear that the investigation by < ORG has been delayed , as a consequence of the heavy earthquake in GPE , to such an extent that expulsion within a reasonable time can no longer be envisaged . The court considers , therefore , that the continuation of the placement in aliens ' detention as from DATE is unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the above < considerations > , ORG sees no reason to award compensation . \u201d", "ORG did , however , find reasons to order that the applicant 's legal costs incurred be compensated and , consequently , issued an order for costs against the ORG Secretary . The applicant was released from aliens ' detention DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant applied for a residence permit on the basis of a temporary regulation on the legalisation of illegal aliens who had been residing in the GPE for a long period of time ( PERSON regeling witte illegalen ) .", "On DATE , the applicant married PERSON and , on the basis of his marriage to a NORP national , applied on DATE for a residence permit on grounds of \u201c stay with NORP spouse \u201d .", "On DATE , ORG sitting in GPE declared well - founded the applicant 's appeal of CARDINAL DATE against the ORG Secretary 's failure to determine timely the applicant 's objection of DATE and ordered the ORG Secretary to decide on the objection within DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant was informed that he had failed to submit some of the required documents in respect of his request of CARDINAL DATE . He was invited to complete his application within DATE .", "In its decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG declared the applicant 's appeal well - founded , quashed the ORG Secretary 's decision of DATE and ordered the ORG Secretary to take a new decision on the applicant 's request of DATE within DATE . ORG noted that there had been a change in the case - law concerning NORP - NORP asylum seekers on the basis of , inter alia , an official report ( ambtsbericht ) of the Minister of Foreign Affairs ( Minister PERSON ) . ORG found that the conclusion set out in this official report , to the effect that there had apparently been an increase in the chances of NORP young men being deployed in south - east GPE as members of the NORP armed forces , constituted a relevant new fact in relation to the examination of the applicant 's first request for asylum and that , therefore the substance of his second request for asylum had to be examined in full . It was further found established that the applicant had been summoned to report for military service in GPE and that an order for his apprehension had been issued by the NORP authorities .", "On DATE , the applicant informed the ORG that , in the meantime , he had been granted a residence permit on grounds of his marriage to a NORP national .", "LAW , insofar as relevant , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the interests of public order , public policy or national security so require , the following categories of aliens may be detained :", "a. aliens whose expulsion has been ordered ;", "b. aliens in respect of whom there are serious ground to believe that their expulsion will be ordered ;", "c. aliens who are not allowed to reside in the GPE by virtue of any of the provisions contained in ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL < of LAW > , pending the decision on an application for a residence permit , a permanent residence permit or leave to enter as refugees .", "CARDINAL . An alien shall not be detained when , and detention shall be terminated as soon as , he intimates that he wishes to leave the GPE and is in fact in a position to do so .", "CARDINAL . Detention for the reasons set out in the first sentence of paragraph CARDINAL and for the categories referred to under b. or c. of that paragraph shall not be of longer duration than DATE .... \u201d", "An alien whose expulsion has been ordered can , in principle , remain in aliens ' detention for an unlimited period of time . The lawfulness of a placement in aliens ' detention can , however , be challenged before a court . Where the court is of the opinion that there are no prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time , it can order that the measure of placement in aliens ' detention be terminated .", "It has been established in the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) of ORG that the interest of an alien to be released from aliens ' detention increases with the passage of time . Where a placement in aliens ' detention exceeds a period of DATE , it is generally held that the alien 's interest in being released is greater than the interest to keep him in detention for the purposes of expulsion . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , this point in time may also be reached before or after DATE have passed . It may be later where the alien frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality and it may be earlier where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his control .", "Although no appeal lies against a decision by ORG in proceedings concerning requests for release from detention for expulsion purposes , an appeal to ORG ( Gerechtshof ) is available in relation to a decision taken in the context of such proceedings on a request for compensation for the time spent in detention for expulsion purposes .", "There is no time - limit for the filing of an appeal against a decision of placement in aliens ' detention and in principle a person placed in aliens ' detention may file as many appeals against this decision as he sees fit . When the lawfulness of a decision of placement in aliens ' detention has been determined for a first time , the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in aliens ' detention as from DATE last judicial decision taken on this point .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG requested ORG to suspend the examination of appeals , including requests for injunctions on expulsions , filed by asylum seekers of NORP origin , as it had appeared that CARDINAL such asylum seekers had encountered serious problems after they had been expelled to GPE .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that , in view of reports on what had happened to CARDINAL asylum seekers who had been expelled to GPE , a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
