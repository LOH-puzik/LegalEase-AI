The investigator found that M.M. had suffered from epilepsy and that the fire had begun after his cigarette had fallen onto the bed during a seizure . The investigator relied on a statement written by PERSON after the incident , which stated that the fire had broken out because he had had an epileptic seizure while smoking . The investigator found that the prison guards had acted immediately in order to extinguish the fire . The investigator also referred to a statement from ORG that he had seen PERSON after the incident , at TIME on DATE , and that ORG had told him that he had had a seizure and that he had not known how the incident had happened . The investigator \u2019s decision also referred to post - mortem forensic report no . CARDINAL dated DATE , which confirmed the existence of extensive burns on ORG \u2019s body .

The investigator also noted that handwriting report no . CARDINAL dated DATE had indicated that the statement written on DATE had been signed by ORG However , he also noted in the decision that forensic expert report no . CARDINAL dated DATE had stated that PERSON had not been able to move , speak or write immediately after the incident as he had been in a state of shock as a result of his burns . The decision also recorded that chemical analysis report no . CARDINAL of DATE had concluded that there had been no trace of oil products in samples taken from the cell walls or of carbonised particles . The investigator also pointed out that it was not possible to carry out a forensic fire examination because the scene of the incident had not been preserved and repairs had been carried out in the cell in question . As regards the statements by some inmates that the fire had broken out at TIME , that it had taken TIME for the prison guards to open the door of the cell and that PERSON had died as a result of their negligence , the investigator noted that the cells of the inmates in question were situated far from ORG cell and that therefore their statements could not be considered as reliable . The investigator also questioned ORG paramedic ( feld\u015fer ) ( GPE ) who had given first aid to PERSON after the fire . GPE stated that he had been informed by telephone at home about the incident at TIME on DATE . He had taken a taxi to the prison and had arrived TIME . He had given first aid to PERSON but his condition had worsened at TIME and he had requested his transfer to a hospital .

In that connection , the investigator referred to letter no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE from ORG , confirming that the car transporting FAC to the hospital had arrived at TIME and that the delay in his transfer had been due to the fact that the car had broken down on its way to the hospital .

The court also found that the investigation had failed to examine whether ORG conditions of detention had been appropriate for a person suffering from epilepsy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator in charge of the case again refused to institute criminal proceedings . The wording of the decision was identical to that of CARDINAL DATE , except the last few paragraphs , which concerned the conditions of detention of inmates suffering from epilepsy .

On DATE ORG overruled the investigator \u2019s decision of DATE and remitted the case to the prosecuting authorities . The court held that the investigator had failed to examine the reason for the delay in PERSON \u2019s transfer to hospital .

The court further found that it had not been established whether ORG conditions of detention had been compatible with his illness and that an inquiry should have been carried out as regards the necessary security and medical measures for a person like PERSON , whose condition was likely to give rise to sudden seizures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor at ORG again refused to institute criminal proceedings , using wording that was almost identical to the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The prosecutor found that it had been PERSON \u2019s fault that the fire had broken out and that he had died as a result of his burns . He further held that the prison guards had taken immediate action and there had been no negligence on their part . The prosecutor noted that there was no special rule for the detention of inmates suffering from epilepsy . He also confirmed that there had been a delay in taking FAC to hospital because the car had broken down . He further found that it had not been possible to carry out a forensic fire examination as the scene of the incident had not been preserved . Lastly , the prosecutor referred to a statement made by a forensic expert , TIME , that there had been no causal link between ORG death and his delayed transfer to hospital .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant was provided with a copy of that decision only on DATE , following intervention by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint against the prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE , arguing that the prosecuting authorities had failed to investigate the questions raised by the previous court decisions .
