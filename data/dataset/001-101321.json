The applicant was born in DATE and is currently serving life imprisonment in FAC no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) outlined the factual background of this case as follows . On DATE the applicant and an acquaintance , PERSON , stopped a taxi and asked the driver , PERSON , to take them to a destination out of town . According to the applicant , they were planning a robbery and carjacking . The applicant had a knife hidden in his sleeve , which he had prepared in advance , and PERSON had a rope with him . Once the car reached a forest , the applicant and PERSON ordered the driver to stop . PERSON put the rope around the driver 's throat while the applicant threatened him with the knife . The applicant got into the driver 's seat and drove further into the forest , where they removed PERSON , unconscious by that time , from the car . Later in DATE the dead body of PERSON was found in the forest with multiple stab wounds .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant and PERSON had unsuccessfully tried to sell PERSON 's car , it was found and seized by the police on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that he had been arrested on DATE . According to the arrest report , he was arrested on DATE on suspicion of the murder of PERSON , which the investigator classified as falling under LAW ( a premeditated murder ) .

The case file also contains a waiver of legal assistance by the applicant dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by a doctor , who found his right wrist to be injured . The applicant explained that he had sustained the injury as a result of a fall during his arrest .", "CARDINAL . As confirmed in a note by the town hospital , on DATE the applicant was taken there by the police for an examination of the aforementioned injury . An X - ray revealed that he had a closed fracture of a bone in his right wrist , and the wrist was put in plaster .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was held in LOC ( \u201c the police station \u201d ) , after which he was moved to ORG no . CARDINAL ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) . During that period , in the absence of a lawyer and allegedly after being subjected to beatings and threats , the applicant signed a confession , which was further confirmed in the course of a reconstruction of the events . He confessed that , acting together with PERSON and by their prior conspiracy , he had robbed and murdered PERSON The applicant admitted , in particular , that he had stabbed L. once with a knife . Later on , apparently after moving to another place of detention , the applicant withdrew his confession to murder , stating that it had been given under duress . He continued , however , to admit to the robbery and carjacking throughout the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote a note to the investigator , in which he stated that he had injured his wrist on DATE after accidentally falling down some stairs .

On an unspecified date , after the applicant 's confession and after the reconstruction of the events , a lawyer was appointed for him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant 's complaint regarding his alleged ill - treatment by the police . The applicant did not challenge that decision . At some stage of the pre - trial investigation the charges against the applicant were reclassified to premeditated murder for profit , robbery , and carjacking , carried out by an organised group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as a first - instance court , found the applicant and PERSON guilty of premeditated murder for profit , robbery , and carjacking , carried out by an organised group , and it sentenced each of them to DATE imprisonment with confiscation of all personal property .

The court examined the applicant 's allegation of ill - treatment and found it to be no more than defence tactics . The police officer responsible for the applicant 's arrest was questioned at the hearing and denied having coerced him in any way . The court noted that the applicant 's injury could not be considered evidence of his ill - treatment in custody since he had given several inconsistent explanations as to its cause .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor appealed against the aforementioned verdict in the part regarding the applicant , considering that it was too lenient given the seriousness of the crimes committed and in the light of the applicant 's personality .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant also introduced an appeal in cassation , in which he complained that the trial court had wrongly relied on a confession allegedly extracted by coercion , as well as on PERSON 's allegedly contradictory statements about him .

On DATE the applicant added a supplement to his appeal in cassation , complaining that he had not been legally represented during the initial stages of the pre - trial investigation , contrary to LAW , and requesting the court not to accept his confession as evidence in the case .

On DATE ORG upheld the verdict subject to a minor amendment , namely , the removal of the reference to the repeated offence of robbery as an aggravating circumstance , since it had already been included in the classification of the crimes of which the applicant had been found guilty . ORG noted that the finding of guilt had been \u201c based on evidence obtained in compliance with the requirements of the criminal procedural legislation and which had been explored at the hearings and properly evaluated by the court \u201d . Furthermore , it saw \u201c no indication of any gross violations of the provisions of LAW during the investigation , or any misapplication by the court of the criminal law \u201d .
