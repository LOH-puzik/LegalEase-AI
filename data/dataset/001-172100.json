On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand . This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . Both courts referred to the original grounds , also noting that the applicant \u2019s case had not yet reached the trial stage since proceedings against him before a different criminal court were pending at the time and there was a need to obtain an expert report which , in turn , required him to undergo psychiatric observation in a specialist institution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected an application by the applicant to have his detention on remand replaced with a different preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as the period of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was approaching DATE , the trial court lodged an application with an appellate court under LAW of LAW ( Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego hereinafter , \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , seeking to extend the preventive measure for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) declared that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred the applicant \u2019s remand file to ORG .", "The appellate court referred to the uniform and well - established line of interpretation given to LAW by ORG . It reiterated that the statutory time - limit of DATE for detention on remand was considered to run only in so far as a person had been effectively deprived of his or her liberty in the particular case in the framework of which the preventive measure had been applied ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "The appellate court concluded that since the applicant had been deprived of his liberty , either on remand or after conviction , from DATE in the first criminal case , the term of his \u201c effective detention on remand \u201d in the second criminal case had not yet begun .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG once more extended the applicant \u2019s detention . On DATE the ORG upheld that decision . Both courts held that the CARDINAL original grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention and the need for him to undergo psychiatric observation were sufficient to extend the preventive measure in question even though the proceedings had not yet reached the trial stage . In addition , the second - instance court addressed the arguments which had been raised in an interlocutory appeal brought by the applicant against ORG decision . To that effect , ORG reiterated the view of ORG that the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was not effective because he had been first deprived of his liberty within the framework of the first criminal case . It also considered that only the most severe preventive measure and not bail , as the applicant had suggested , could ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the proceedings pending the enforcement of the court \u2019s decision of DATE ordering the applicant to undergo psychiatric observation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE the ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal brought by him against this decision . It was observed that he could not at that stage be placed under psychiatric observation because his presence was necessary in the court before which his other criminal case was pending and because that court had not authorised the measure .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG once again extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand , referring to the risk that he might attempt to obstruct the proceedings if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed that decision and ordered the applicant \u2019s release from custody . The court found that the grounds for his detention were no longer valid in the light of the fact that the proceedings had been stayed .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that on DATE the applicant had actually been released to his home . He on the other hand maintained that he had remained in custody as he had concurrently been in detention on remand in connection with his first criminal trial , pending at the time before GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG barred the applicant from leaving the territory of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ordered that the applicant undergo psychiatric observation in the psychiatric wing of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG resumed the proceedings in the applicant \u2019s case in view of that decision and the fact that the psychiatric observation could be scheduled to start in DATE . On the same date the court again remanded him in custody on the grounds that the evidence showed a significant probability that he had committed armed robbery . It also had regard to the severity of the punishment that could be expected and the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed an interlocutory appeal brought by the applicant against this decision . The appellate court acknowledged that the applicant had not to date attempted to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings . Nevertheless , the likelihood that a severe punishment would be imposed if he were convicted was considered to be sufficient reason for his continued detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for the preventive measure to be changed . On DATE the court dismissed his request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG further extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand . The court gave the argument that strong evidence had been obtained against him , that it was likely that a severe sentence would be imposed in the case , and that , if released , he would attempt to persuade witnesses to give false evidence or would , by other unlawful means , try to obstruct the proceedings , especially in the light of the fact that the psychiatric observation was underway .", "CARDINAL . Appealing against the latter decision , the applicant \u2019s lawyer argued that his client had already been detained for DATE and that ORG did not have jurisdiction to decide on the preventive measure . Moreover , it was argued that since the applicant had never attempted to obstruct the proceedings , there was no risk that he would try to do so in the current stage of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed that appeal . It was observed that the actual period of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand in the case in question had not reached DATE because he had been concurrently deprived of his liberty in the framework of the first set of criminal proceedings . As to the grounds for extending his detention on remand , the appellate court held that , even though he had not attempted to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings , the likelihood that a severe punishment would be imposed if he were to be convicted was sufficient reason to uphold the preventive measure in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again decided to extend the applicant \u2019s detention on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed armed robbery and the severity of the punishment that could be expected . This decision was upheld on DATE by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected a request by the applicant for release , relying on the same grounds as in the decision described above .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was extended by ORG on DATE and DATE and DATE and DATE . The decisions were upheld by ORG on DATE , on an unspecified date and on DATE and DATE respectively .", "All the decisions in question were based on the grounds that there was strong evidence against the applicant , that a severe punishment would be imposed if he were convicted and , since the court proceedings were only at the initial stage , that if released , he would attempt to persuade witnesses to give false evidence or , by other unlawful means , obstruct the proper course of the proceedings . It was also stressed in the earlier decisions that the trial court had not yet started its examination of the applicant \u2019s case on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The period he had already spent in detention on remand , namely DATE and DATE ( from DATE until DATE ) , was deducted from his sentence . The remainder of his incarceration was considered to have comprised the prison sentence which had been imposed by the Jaros\u0142aw ORG in the separate criminal case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "It appears that the first - instance court held DATE and adjourned CARDINAL hearings . It decided applications by the applicant challenging the judges , opposing the psychiatric observation and requesting a fresh examination of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and remitted the case to the first - instance court , ordering it to gather additional evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention . That decision was upheld on DATE . The domestic courts considered that the actual period of detention on remand in the framework of the second case had only started running on DATE , when he was no longer deprived of his liberty in connection with the first criminal case . The courts also referred to the CARDINAL original grounds for the applicant \u2019s continued detention , namely a reasonable suspicion that he had committed armed robbery and the severity of the punishment that could be expected . In the courts\u2019 view , the latter element in turn created a presumption that the applicant would attempt to obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG fully adhered to the reasoning of the first - instance court and upheld the above - mentioned decision .", "DATE . On DATE the case was transferred to ORG as the competent court because , in the meantime , the charges against the applicant had been modified .", "CARDINAL . Pending trial the applicant \u2019s detention was extended by ORG on DATE and DATE , on an unspecified date and on CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The decisions were upheld by ORG .", "The domestic courts reiterated the original grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention on remand and stressed that the preventive measure in question had not lasted DATE , regard being had to the fact that from DATE to DATE he had been serving a prison sentence imposed in the first set of criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . It appears that the court held CARDINAL hearings in the case . The period the applicant had already spent in detention on remand , namely DATE , DATE and DATE ( from DATE until DATE ) was deducted from his sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment , lifted the preventive measure and remitted the case to the lower courts . The following day the applicant was released from the remand centre . He has remained at liberty ever since .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant on a number of charges and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . It held CARDINAL hearings in the case . DATE of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand ( from DATE to DATE ) were deducted from his sentence . It appears that he was not ordered to serve the remainder of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date before DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not wish to take his case to ORG , believing that a cassation appeal would not have any prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . He did not lodge a complaint about the length of the second set of criminal proceedings under the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a constitutional complaint ( skarga konstytucyjna ) under LAW , read in conjunction with LAW of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , asking for Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE of the Code ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to be declared unconstitutional ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . He alleged that the provision infringed , inter alia , the right to personal inviolability and security under LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . On DATE the applicant finalised his complaint .", "The applicant challenged CARDINAL aspects of Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , he alleged that Article QUANTITY and CARDINAL were unconstitutional in so far as , under the legal principle ( zasada prawna ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , they concerned only effective detention on remand , that is to say only the actual period of deprivation of liberty on the basis of a detention decision issued in a particular case because they denied a detainee sufficient protection of his liberty if he had earlier been convicted or otherwise deprived of his liberty on the basis of decisions issued in another set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the applicant challenged Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL in so far as it defined a maximum statutory period for the length of detention on remand only until the delivery of a first judgment by the trial court . Consequently , people such as him who remained in detention while their criminal proceedings were pending de novo after the quashing of the first judgment of the first - instance trial court , were not protected against unreasonably lengthy detention on remand . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code was silent in that respect and because of that , the authorities could extend the preventive measure for an indefinite period following the quashing of the first judgment of a trial court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG joined the proceedings , asking that LAW of the Code be declared unconstitutional in so far as it left a legal loophole which was filled in by an erroneously developed wellestablished court practice not to include in the calculation of the statutory DATE period of detention on remand ( prior to the first judgment of the first - instance court ) periods of the detainee \u2019s concurrent deprivation of liberty on the basis of a criminal sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG discontinued the application under section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , which provided for such a possibility in the event a ruling was considered to be redundant ( zb\u0119dne ) .", "CARDINAL . It was observed that , despite the obvious differences in scope , the essence of the first part of the applicant \u2019s complaint , concerning Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had already been examined on the merits by ORG in case no . ORG CARDINAL . The provision had been declared unconstitutional in so far as it was interpreted to the effect that the statutory maximum period of DATE allowed for a person \u2019s detention on remand prior to the first judgment of the first - instance court had not comprised the term of the prison sentence the detainee was serving in another case , concurrently to his detention on remand , thus allowing for an extension of the preventive measure beyond DATE by a first - instance court on general grounds ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the second part of the complaint ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG held that the applicant did not have the standing to challenge LAW of the Code because this provision had not been applicable to his detention in the relevant period . The preventive measure in question had been extended during the proceedings which had been pending before the first - instance court de novo , after the original judgment had been quashed by the appellate court . In these circumstances , the legal basis for extending the applicant \u2019s detention was Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the NORP prosecutor \u2019s office about an offence allegedly committed by staff of ORG . He claimed that they had been selling alcohol , cigarettes and drugs to prisoners . On DATE the Przemy\u015bl prosecutor \u2019s office discontinued the criminal investigation against the alleged culprits . This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . When , on DATE , the applicant lodged his application with the ORG he had been detained on remand in relation to the first and second sets of criminal proceedings against him . On DATE and DATE and on CARDINAL and DATE he sent letters to his defence lawyer , PERSON The envelopes bear the stamp \u201c LOC \u201d and a handwritten note stating \u201c censored on ... \u201d ( ocenzurowano dn . ) .", "DATE . On DATE ORG discontinued criminal proceedings against several judges of ORG who , in the applicant \u2019s view , had monitored his correspondence with his lawyer . The court held that none of the individuals concerned had opened and read the applicant \u2019s correspondence . This decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . The court found that the applicant \u2019s correspondence had not been read and the words \u201c censored \u201d had been automatically stamped on the applicant \u2019s letters .", "CARDINAL .
