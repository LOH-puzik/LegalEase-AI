{"ITEMID": "001-71529", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "BALLERSTEDT AND OTHERS v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON Rink , PERSON and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who live in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicants are heirs of associates of a limited partnership ( Kommanditgesellschaft ) which owned land in GPE on the territory of the former GPE ( neue Bundesl\u00e4nder \u2013 hereinafter called ORG ) . The land comprised forests and a quarry . On DATE the property was expropriated by the authorities of GPE ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) pursuant to LAW ( Aufbaugesetz ) in order to create a recreational area ( NORP ) . Compensation amounting to MONEY of the GPE was fixed under LAW on Compensation for Expropriation under LAW \u201d ( PERSON \u00fcber die Entsch\u00e4digung bei FAC ) . However , that sum was never paid out , as it was charged up against claims the ORG had against the limited partnership .", "Following NORP Unification the applicants requested restitution under LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) on DATE . On DATE the Office for ORG ( Amt zur Regelung offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen ) rejected their request , stating that the requirements for restitution were not met . On DATE ORG for ORG ( Landesamt zur Regelung offener Verm\u00f6gens - fragen ) rejected the applicants\u2019 opposition . Subsequently they brought an action in ORG .", "The court rejected the claim for restitution confirming that the requirements of sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW were not fulfilled .", "Firstly , the court held that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW was not applicable , as the applicants\u2019 predecessors had been expropriated and compensated . It was irrelevant that the compensation had actually not been paid out , as section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW applied only to expropriations for which no compensation was provided under GPE law . It referred to the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "Secondly , the court found that the requirements of section CARDINAL(CARDINALb ) of LAW were not met . It explained that according to ORG case - law that provision had to be interpreted restrictively . Contrary to its wording , the amount of compensation alone was not decisive . It applied only to those expropriations which had been carried out by the GPE authorities pursuant to a discriminatory ORG practice . As an example the court mentioned the decision of the GPE cabinet ( ORG ) of DATE , which had fixed a lesser amount of compensation for real estate which was owned by persons residing in GPE and other \u201c capitalist GPE \u201d . The court found no indication for such a discriminatory ORG practice in the present case .", "Lastly , the court elaborated on the requirements of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . At the outset it noted that , according to ORG case - law , \u201c arbitrary \u201d or \u201c manipulative \u201d expropriations also fall within the ambit of that provision . However , \u201c arbitrary \u201d or \u201c manipulative \u201d meant more than a mere violation of GPE law . The court recalled that an expropriation was arbitrary if there had been either no legal basis for the purpose of the expropriation under GPE law or if the GPE authorities had falsely indicated a purpose while secretly pursuing a different one . Regarding the present case , the court acknowledged that LAW did not , according to its wording , allow expropriations for creating recreational areas . Its purpose was rather to reconstruct or maintain housing . However , the court pointed out that the GPE authorities had applied LAW extensively , as had already been held by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . Furthermore , the court referred to several resolutions by ORG ( Rat des Bezirks Magdeburg ) dating back to the expropriation era , which had called for the creation of additional recreational areas . The court found that the authorities then involved had , possibly wrongly , assumed that LAW was a blanket clause for expropriations which served important social projects . The court also referred to a GPE textbook on LAW in which the author indicates that LAW was not only used for the creation of housing , but also for other projects such as cemeteries or farm stables . The court therefore concluded that in GPE practice such expropriations under LAW were possible and common . It further found that the expropriation had been considered to fall within that purpose . Furthermore , the court found that the authorities had acted in accordance with the \u201c basic ideological ideas \u201d ( ideologische GPE ) on which the GPE legal system was based . The court therefore concluded that there was no indication of a \u201c manipulative \u201d or \u201c arbitrary \u201d expropriation within the meaning of LAW and refused the applicants leave to appeal on points of law .", "The court rejected the ORG complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law , confirming the lower court \u2019s reasoning in respect of the application and interpretation of sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "In particular , the court stressed that in GPE law and practice LAW was interpreted broadly . It held that even if LAW had not provided for expropriation in the present case , this mistake would not constitute a grave and evident violation of the principles of LAW . Therefore , the expropriation could not be considered arbitrary or manipulative within the meaning of LAW .", "ORG refused to admit the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint .", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . Expropriated real estate is in principle to be returned to the former owners or their heirs , having regard to the type of case specified in sub - paragraphs ( a ) and ( b ) below .", "( a ) It is not possible to restore rights of ownership over land and buildings whose use or purpose has been altered , in particular by being dedicated to public purposes , used for housing developments , for commercial purposes or incorporated into new business units .", "Compensation will be paid in these cases , in so far as it has not already been made pursuant to the laws and regulations applicable to citizens of GPE .", "( b ) In so far as citizens of GPE have in good faith acquired ownership or rights of user in rem ( dingliche PERSON ) over real estate , socially acceptable indemnification ( sozialvertr\u00e4glicher PERSON ) is to be made to the former owners by substituting real estate ( ORG ) of a comparable value or by paying compensation . ... \u201d", "ORG , also known as LAW , entered into force on DATE and was also part of LAW . Under the terms of the LAW , LAW was to continue to subsist in the unified GPE after the unification of the two GPE on DATE . The aim of the LAW was to resolve disputes over property in the territory of the GPE in a way that was socially acceptable in order to achieve permanent legal order in GPE . The pertinent provisions read as follows .", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This Act settles claims to property ,", "( a ) which was expropriated without compensation and transferred to public property ( ORG ) ;", "( b ) expropriated for a lesser amount of compensation than citizens of GPE were entitled to ; ... \u201d", "( CARDINAL ) This act shall also apply to rights in or over immovable property and usufructary rights acquired by unfair dealings , such as abuse of power , corruption , duress or deception by the purchaser , the ORG authorities or third parties . \u201d", "In its annotation of the bill ORG made the following comments on LAW purpose and meaning .", "\u201c ... For the time after the foundation of GPE ( DATE ) this LAW provides for restitution , if owners were deprived of their property assets ( PERSON ) in a way which is incompatible with the rule of law . This Act does not intend to amend every interference with private means ( PERSON ) which took place during DATE pursuant to GPE law on the basis of a socialist economic and social order . ... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c Administrative Acts of GPE which were issued before the accession takes effect remain in force . They can be revoked if they are incompatible with the rule of law of the provisions of this treaty . ... \u201d", "Regarding the interpretation of LAW held that restitution was excluded , even if the prescribed compensation , although provided under GPE law , had not been fixed , had not been paid out , had been charged up or had been withheld for other reasons by the GPE authorities . Furthermore , the court elaborated that LAW provided only for the revocation of certain cases of expropriations . It pointed out that the first sentence of LAW stipulates that all administrative acts of the GPE authorities remain in force . Only administrative acts which were incompatible with the principle of the rule of law ( rechtsstaatliche Grunds\u00e4tze ) and the principles of LAW were to be revoked . The court held that the legislator had not intended to grant restitution in a case in which the compensation payment was actually not made , but only in cases in which GPE law did not provide for compensation at all . Only those expropriations reached a level of injustice that justified restitution .", "In a second judgment of DATE ORG elaborated the following on the scope of LAW ) of LAW . It stated that , contrary to its wording , that provision required more than just an expropriation for a lesser amount of compensation than citizens of the GPE were entitled to . The court held that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) had to be read in conjunction with section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) . The court said that , if the fact that compensation was fixed , but not paid out , did not entitle to restitution under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , it could not be that a lesser amount of compensation was in itself sufficient under LAW ) to justify restitution . It followed that only those expropriations fell within the ambit of LAW ) which had been conducted pursuant to a discriminatory ORG practice . As an example for such a discriminatory ORG practice the court mentioned the decision of the GPE cabinet ( ORG ) dated DATE which fixed a lesser amount of compensation for real estate which was owned by persons residing in GPE and other \u201c capitalist GPE \u201d .", "Regarding the interpretation of LAW , ORG held that \u201c manipulative or \u201c arbitrary \u201d expropriations also fall within the ambit of that provision . However , it is not sufficient that the expropriation was unlawful under GPE law . It is necessary that the threshold of arbitrariness was crossed . ORG stated that an expropriation was arbitrary or manipulative if the GPE authorities had falsely indicated a legitimate purpose for the expropriation , but secretly pursued a different purpose . Furthermore , an arbitrary or manipulative expropriation was given if there had been no legal basis for it under GPE law .", "ORG repeated that CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW demanded an examination on a case - by - case basis and required an elevated level of injustice in each case ( qualifiziertes Einzelfallunrecht ) . Such a level of injustice was not reached if an expropriation had been conducted in accordance with GPE legal provisions and pursuant to the basic ideological ideas ( ideologische GPE ) on which those provisions were based .", "In this judgment ORG held the following regarding the application and interpretation of LAW by the GPE authorities . It stated that the GPE authorities were of the view that LAW had a very broad scope . Expropriations for the benefit of inter alia ORG - owned enterprises , co - operatives , parties and mass organisations had been allowed . In the case which was decided by ORG , the expropriation had been carried out for the benefit of the unified trade union ( FDGB ) . ORG doubted whether that expropriation , as a matter of principle , fell within the scope of LAW , but found that even if the GPE authorities had wrongly applied LAW , this would not constitute a grave and evident violation of the basic principles of LAW . Therefore , the measure in issue could not be considered an arbitrary expropriation within the meaning of LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
