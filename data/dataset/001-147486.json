In the resumed proceedings , ORG held hearings on DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and on DATE , DATE and DATE . On DATE it obtained a combined expert opinion from court experts in psychology and psychiatry , and on DATE a fresh opinion and report from the local social welfare centre .", "CARDINAL . According to the combined expert opinion from experts in psychology and psychiatry the first applicant was mentally unstable and had demonstrated signs of a personality disorder , whereas her former husband , PERSON , had shown no such signs and was sufficiently emotionally stable to take care of the children . In particular , the experts established that the first applicant lacked self - critical awareness and was unable to recognise and respond to the emotional needs of her children . They therefore recommended that custody of the second and third applicants be awarded to their father . Having regard to the importance of the role of a mother in the development of a child , and the fact that both children were very emotionally attached to her , the experts also suggested granting the first applicant extensive access rights , provided that she agree to seek psychiatric treatment .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply , the first applicant submitted an opinion by a psychiatrist who had been treating her since DATE . The opinion , dated DATE , stated that she had been systematically abused by her former husband and , although mentally fragile , was not suffering from any mental illness , much less a personality disorder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local social welfare centre , acting partly upon the opinion and court experts\u2019 recommendations and partly of their own motion , instructed the first applicant to commence psychiatric treatment and to take the second and third applicants for psychotherapy . It also imposed various supervision measures in order to monitor the exercise of parental authority by her and PERSON", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG awarded the first applicant custody of the second and third applicants , and granted PERSON access ( contact ) rights . Following an appeal by PERSON , on DATE the ORG quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON for ORG where the second and third applicants had been receiving psychiatric treatment \u2013 informed the local social welfare centre that it suspected the second and third applicants\u2019 mental health was being neglected and that they were being emotionally abused by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . According to a fresh expert opinion obtained by ORG in the resumed proceedings in DATE from CARDINAL different court experts ( a psychologist and psychiatrist ) , both the second and third applicants were very traumatised as a result of their GPE DATE especially their mother \u2019s \u2013 behaviour , and were in urgent need of psychotherapy . The experts also established that , although both parents were responsible for the situation , the first applicant , whose behaviour they regarded as \u201c emotional abuse \u201d , was more responsible . The inefficiency of the authorities had also contributed to the situation , by making it possible for the mother to manipulate the children . The experts further found that both parents had limited parenting capacities , but that the first applicant \u2019s capacity was more limited . They initially could not recommend which parent should be awarded custody DATE handing the children to their father would worsen their mental state , whereas keeping them in their mother \u2019s custody would intensify their hostility to their father and her influence over them . Thus , they first suggested that both parents undergo counselling to try to improve their own relationship and their relationship with their children , later proposing to award custody of the children to their mother for DATE and grant the father extensive access rights .", "CARDINAL . On that basis , on DATE the court made an interim order whereby it awarded the first applicant custody of the children on a temporary basis and granted PERSON access rights , allowing him contact with the second and third applicants CARDINAL times a week for TIME , every other weekend and for CARDINAL of the school holidays .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that for DATE , the father was unable to exercise his access rights because each time he went to collect the children they refused to go with him , a behaviour which the first applicant allegedly encouraged .", "CARDINAL . The last expert opinion obtained by the court in DATE , which was prepared by the same psychologist and psychiatrist who had prepared the opinion of DATE , recommended placing the second and third applicants into care . The experts suggested that the children be removed from their mother because she was harming their emotional development . Even though their father had better parenting capacity , for the time being he could not take over custody as the children , because of their mother \u2019s influence , had a very negative attitude towards him , so any forced situation would have a negative impact . The experts therefore recommended placing the children into foster care , attending psychotherapy in a designated clinic , and granting each parent supervised access once DATE . It was proposed that the measures would last for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local social welfare centre lodged a motion seeking that the second and third applicants be temporarily removed from the first applicant for DATE , the child protection measure laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE it appointed CARDINAL of its employees , PERSON , to act as their guardian ad litem and represent their interests in the proceedings , as required by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a judgment depriving the first applicant and PERSON of custody of the second and third applicants for DATE and awarding custody to ORG House for ORG sv .

S.K and the first applicant were granted access ( contact ) rights , to be exercised on the LOC of ORG in the presence of CARDINAL of its employees . PERSON was entitled to see the children DATE from TIME and the first applicant every DATE from DATE p.m. The court also decided that the judgment would be immediately enforceable , accordingly ordering the first applicant to entrust the second and third applicants to ORG immediately following service .", "CARDINAL . In making its decision the court , apart from relying on the abovementioned expert opinions , also took into account the fact that the first applicant had refused to act upon the instruction of the local social welfare centre to seek psychiatric treatment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , had taken the children for treatment at the designated clinic only once , and had been obstructing execution of the supervision measures imposed by the centre , by refusing to cooperate with the social worker assigned to her case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the court found that the mother \u2019s refusal to seek psychiatric treatment ( which was a precondition for the successful psychotherapy of her children ) , her and PERSON \u2019s fixation on their mutual problems and their lack of communication and unwillingness to adapt and change , were making them insensitive to the emotional needs of their children . That was harmful for the physical and mental development of the children , who had been traumatised and manipulated by their GPE attitude and behaviour . The parents had thus significantly neglected their duty to raise and educate them , as they had not taken sufficient care of their health within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court therefore concluded that the first applicant and her former husband could not properly take care of their children and that temporarily depriving them both of custody was warranted .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against the court \u2019s decision , arguing that she had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , albeit in a different clinic from the one recommended by the court experts . The reason she had refused to undergo counselling with her husband , as recommended by the court experts , was because he had been convicted of domestic violence against her ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . Furthermore , she had taken her children for psychotherapy but in a different clinic from the one recommended by the experts and endorsed by the local social welfare centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG PERSON ) dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . As DATE set forth in the judgment of DATE was about to expire , on DATE ORG adopted a decision containing the same custody and access arrangements as those in that judgment . The court found that the fact that the judgment had remained unenforced ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) suggested that the circumstances that had warranted the imposition of the child protection measure ordered therein still existed . It thus refused to take ( into account ) any new evidence . The decision was immediately enforceable .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the first applicant and upheld the firstinstance decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not lodge a constitutional complaint against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a day before the period of one year fixed in its decision of CARDINAL DATE was due to expire ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG adopted identical decision with similar reasoning . It again refused to take any evidence . This decision was also immediately enforceable .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the first applicant and upheld the first - instance decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then lodged a constitutional complaint , alleging violations of their constitutional rights to a fair hearing and to respect for their family life . In so doing , they relied on LAW paragraph CARDINAL and LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) and Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found a violation of the applicants\u2019 rights to a fair hearing and to respect for their family life , quashed the second - instance decision of CARDINAL DATE and first - instance decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In particular , ORG found a violation of the procedural aspect of the right to respect for family life and a breach of the principle of equality of arms in that ( a ) the first - instance court , without giving valid reasons , had not held a hearing or taken any evidence before reaching its decision ; ( b ) the ordinary courts had paid no heed to the first applicant \u2019s argument that CARDINAL of the court experts was her former husband \u2019s therapist ; ( c ) the first - instance court had not heard the children , even though their age and maturity permitted that they be heard ; and ( d ) an employee of the local social welfare centre ( the public authority that proposed the contested child protection measure , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , who had assumed a rather passive role in the proceedings and had not even contacted the children , had been appointed as the second and third applicants\u2019 guardian ad litem , thus creating a conflict of loyalty between her employer and her wards ( children under her care ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG explained that taking new evidence had been particularly warranted in the circumstances , as children grew quickly and thus it could not have been assumed , as the first - instance court had done , that there had been no relevant developments in DATE that had passed between the first - instance judgment of DATE and the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The best interests of the children required that evidence be taken to establish the current situation as regards the second and third applicants , which had been crucial for deciding whether to maintain or lift the impugned child protection measure of their temporary placement into care .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , as the first applicant refused to entrust the second and third applicants to the children \u2019s home , on DATE the local social welfare centre applied to ORG to have the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) enforced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a writ of execution ( rje\u0161enje o ovrsi ) ordering the first applicant to entrust the second and third applicants to ORG within DATE of service , or face a fine of CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG fined the first applicant HRK CARDINAL for disobeying the court order to entrust the second and third applicants to the children \u2019s home , and ordered her to do so within DATE of service , or face an additional fine of HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Since fining the first applicant with a view to forcing her to comply with the above judgment and entrust the children to the children \u2019s home had no effect , on DATE ORG , following an application by the local social welfare centre , issued a new writ of execution . This time it ordered an enforcement officer , with the assistance of the police , to physically remove the second and third applicants from the first applicant or a third party and place them in the care of GPE Joseph \u2019s House .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the enforcement officer and CARDINAL policemen attempted to remove the second and third applicants from their mother . The children resisted by screaming , crying and shouting that they did not want to go to a home and wanted to remain living with their mother . Given the children \u2019s reactions , the enforcement officer eventually decided to adjourn the intervention . Immediately afterwards the first applicant took the second and third applicants to a doctor , who referred them to a psychiatrist . The psychiatrist who examined them DATE found that they were suffering from shock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during a meeting held at the local social welfare centre , the first applicant promised to cooperate with the relevant authorities and undergo counselling with a view to improving her relationship with her former husband .", "CARDINAL . Following a motion by the centre , on CARDINAL DATE ORG postponed enforcement until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the centre lodged another motion to postpone enforcement , which ORG granted on DATE by postponing enforcement until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the centre lodged a third motion to postpone enforcement . This time ORG , on DATE , dismissed the motion , because under the domestic law it was not possible to postpone enforcement for DATE at the request of the party seeking enforcement . Furthermore , since the centre as the party seeking enforcement had not applied for a continuation of enforcement in DATE , as was required by law , the court discontinued the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE ORG ( Prekr\u0161ajni sud u ORG ) found PERSON guilty of domestic violence , after an incident against the first applicant on DATE .

The first applicant appealed , and it would appear that the proceedings are currently pending before ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u GPE ) as the second - instance court .", "CARDINAL . Following a petition by the first applicant , on CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Pravobraniteljica za ravnopravnost spolova ) advised the local social welfare centre that in instructing her to undergo various treatment and expert assessments , it had failed to take into account the fact that she was a victim of domestic violence . In particular , the ORG noted that , by insisting that the first applicant attend counselling with her former husband , who had been convicted of domestic violence against her , the centre had treated the victim and the perpetrator equally . That constituted secondary victimisation and amounted to discrimination against her as a victim of domestic violence . The Ombudsman therefore suggested that the centre reformulate its recommendation to the court in the proceedings regarding custody and access rights , basing it on a fresh expert opinion from a different expert and bearing in mind the fact that the first applicant was a victim of domestic violence .", "CARDINAL .
