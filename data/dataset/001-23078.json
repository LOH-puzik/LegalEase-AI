SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr E. Str\u00f6mblad , is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr O. GPE , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the father of CARDINAL children born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The children live permanently with their mother from whom the applicant is divorced . Since they did not live with both their parents , each of his children were entitled under LAW ( lagen om underh\u00e5llsst\u00f6d , lag CARDINAL:CARDINAL -hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d , which entered into force on DATE ) to a DATE maintenance allowance ( underh\u00e5llsbidrag ) of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL from ORG . LAW obliged the parent who under civil law was liable for maintenance to repay , in whole or in part , the community \u2019s costs for the maintenance support provided to the children . The amount to be repaid was determined as a percentage of the income of the person liable for maintenance . If the liable parent had CARDINAL children , as was the applicant \u2019s case , he should repay PERCENT of his income for each child .", "On DATE ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan -hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) of GPE decided that the applicant should repay a total sum of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL every month for the community \u2019s costs for the maintenance support with respect to his CARDINAL children . In other words , the applicant should repay SEK CARDINAL per month for each child . In accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW ( as in force at the relevant time ) , the ORG determined the amount of the applicant \u2019s income as specified in the most recent tax assessment decision .", "By letter of DATE the applicant requested the ORG to reconsider its decision . He argued that the ORG had failed to estimate correctly his ability to pay the amount in question and should have based its calculations on his current income , not that indicated in the most recent tax assessment decision . On DATE the ORG found that there was no ground for altering its earlier decision .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . He maintained that his income was insufficient for paying the amount fixed by the ORG . He pointed out that since the calculations regarding his ability to repay maintenance support were based on his income before LAW came into force , the decision had a retroactive effect and was thus incompatible with LAW ( Regeringsformen ) . Furthermore , the ORG had calculated his income erroneously thereby obtaining a result which did not reflect his real ability to repay the maintenance support .", "In his appeal the applicant also requested ORG to hold an oral hearing in the case . He wished to participate in person at an oral hearing in order to present arguments on the issue of principle in the case and on the great economic impact a judgment could have on him . He underlined that his main argument in the case was the unconstitutional retroactive application of LAW by the ORG .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant as follows :", "\u201c The proceedings before [ the court ] consist of a written procedure . They may include an oral hearing with regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that such a measure would be to the benefit of the proceedings or that it promotes a speedy determination of the case . An oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , if such a hearing is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against it ...", "... It appears that you do not wish to submit any new information at the hearing but rather conduct a legal argumentation about the retroactivity of the legislation concerned and on how your deficit from earlier GPE taxation should be taken into account when determining the amount that should be repaid . Having regard to these circumstances [ the court ] finds that the examination of the case is limited to issues concerning the application of the law . Therefore , [ the court ] finds an oral hearing unnecessary .", "[ The court ] hereby gives you the opportunity to submit , no later than DATE , your final observations in the case . If no response is submitted to [ the court ] , the case will be determined on the basis of the material available . \u201d", "The applicant made further submissions in the case and reiterated his request for an oral hearing , claiming that the court had failed to give any special reasons for dispensing with an oral hearing .", "On DATE ORG delivered its judgment confirming the ORG \u2019s decision . It found that the calculation of the applicant \u2019s income was done in accordance with the rules set out in LAW . While it was true that the calculation of the applicant \u2019s income was based on the most recent tax assessment decision , the amount that he was obliged to repay concerned future maintenance support . Therefore , the court did not consider the decision as retroactive within the meaning of the LAW .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing the ORG held :", "\u201c The court can not omit to hold an oral hearing without having found after careful consideration that this is unnecessary or that there are special reasons against doing so . Considering [ the applicant \u2019s ] arguments in the case , [ the court ] finds that its examination is limited to issues concerning the application of the law . In view of this [ the court ] considers an oral hearing unnecessary . \u201d", "The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , complaining about the lack of an oral hearing before ORG and maintaining all his other submissions and requests . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( regeringsr\u00e4tten ) which , on DATE , also refused leave to appeal .", "LAW , which entered into force on DATE , applied in relation to maintenance support and duty of repayment . LAW replaced previous legislation in the relevant area .", "According to LAW ( as in force at the relevant time ; DATE ) a child was entitled to maintenance support , at a rate of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL per month , if the parents did not live together . The parent who was liable under civil law for maintenance should repay to the ORG , in part or in whole , the amount corresponding to the maintenance support . According to its sections CARDINAL and DATE , the duty of repayment was determined as a certain percentage of the liable parent \u2019s income according to the most recent tax assessment decision after a deduction of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . If the liable parent had CARDINAL children who received maintenance support , he or she should repay PERCENT of his income for each child . The duty of repayment should be reviewed when a new decision on DATE tax assessment had been taken and when there was a change in the grounds for the applicable percentage .", "In the event that the liable parent considered that he or she was unable to to repay the amount fixed , he or she could appeal for respite for discharge of the duty . If there were exceptional reasons relating to the liable parent \u2019s economic or personal circumstances , ORG could remit the debt , entirely or partially , upon application from the liable parent .", "A decision by ORG under LAW may be appealed against to ORG and from there on to ORG and ORG . Appeals to the CARDINAL latter courts are subject to leave to appeal proceedings .", "The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of ORG ( f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen , lag CARDINAL:CARDINAL -hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings are in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "According to the preparatory documents to LAW , an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in CARDINAL situations in particular : firstly , when it is necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of section CARDINAL , that a party \u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . Still , other circumstances may be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party \u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
