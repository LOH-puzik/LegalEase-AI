The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the town of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE convicted the applicant of theft and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the President of ORG to apply for supervisory review of the above judgments on a number of legal grounds . After leave had been granted , on DATE the ORG of ORG upheld the conviction but reduced the applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE and DATE because of an error in the calculation of the term . The applicant was not brought to the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made further attempts to obtain a review of his conviction and sentence . Apparently in reply to CARDINAL of those applications , by a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG notified the applicant that they had applied for supervisory review of the judgments of DATE and DATE . It appears that the scope of the application for review was limited to an argument that the trial court had erred in determining the prison regime to be applied to the applicant without having regard to the cancellation of his conviction in DATE for another offence . The applicant received that letter on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on DATE the applicant submitted his observations in relation to that request . However , in the meantime , on DATE the ORG of ORG had already examined the supervisory review application and found that the DATE conviction had been cancelled in DATE and should not have been taken into consideration when the trial court decided whether there had been a repeated commission of a criminal offence ( recidivism ) . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s acts had constituted dangerous rather than \u201c particularly \u201d dangerous recidivism , and changed the type of the correctional facility in which the applicant was to serve his sentence . The ORG upheld the judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE in the remaining part . The applicant was not brought to that hearing . On DATE he was told that the review had taken place , but a copy of the decision was not given to him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his sentence in correctional colony no . LAW situated in the village of PERSON in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE the colony administration informed the detainees that a special - purpose squad would be brought to the colony \u201c to discipline detainees \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL officers of the special - purpose squad arrived at the colony in order to \u201c render practical assistance in carrying out searches and prophylactic measures \u201d . On DATE the wardens and the officers of the squad searched the applicant \u2019s cell . The applicant objected to the search and the officers intimidated him , beat him up and damaged his personal belongings . The applicant received no medical assistance and the colony doctor refused to record his injuries . The colony administration subsequently refused to dispatch his complaints to the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the Director of ORG of ORG ordered a series of searches in detention facilities with a view to seizing unauthorised items kept by detainees in their cells which could be used for an escape .", "CARDINAL . Searches were carried out in the applicant \u2019s cell on DATE . According to a report dated DATE , the use of force was accounted for by the applicant \u2019s insults to officers . A report drawn up on DATE indicated that the applicant had uttered insults and threats of reprisals . The Government submitted copies of reports by CARDINAL officers to their superior , stating that during the search on DATE the applicant had uttered insults and threats of reprisals to the officers . Another officer stated that the applicant had objected to the search and had swung his hands ; because of his refusal to stop after a warning , his hand had been held behind his back , he \u201c had been held in a posture preventing resistance \u201d and had been placed in a separate room pending the search in his cell . A report drawn up by the colony medical assistant indicated that no injuries had been detected on the applicant \u2019s body .", "CARDINAL . Several detainees complained to ORG , in charge of supervising penitentiary institutions , about the events of DATE . They alleged that they and certain other detainees , including the applicant , had been beaten up by the squad members , with the tacit agreement of the colony administration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bratsk Penitentiary Supervising Prosecutor \u2019s Office refused to initiate criminal proceedings against the squad members . The assistant prosecutor indicated that the squad intervention had been duly authorised by ORG on DATE ( decrees nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The squad officers wore camouflage with their ORG numbers and balaclava masks . On DATE during the search of his cell the applicant had refused to comply with orders ( to stay in the corridor against the wall ) , and had threatened the officers with reprisals , insulting them and pushing them away . Therefore , on an order from the colony chief officer the applicant was immobilised . During another cell search on DATE the applicant behaved in the same way and also incited other detainees to riot . In order to put a stop to his actions he was immobilised . Special means and weapons were not used . The assistant prosecutor interrogated the complainants and other detainees , some of whom however had stated that special means or weapons had been used against detainees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on a complaint by the applicant , an official of ORG informed him as follows . On DATE CARDINAL officers of the special - purpose squad had arrived in the colony . The applicant prevented the wardens from carrying out searches and assaulted them verbally and physically . Following the searches , the doctor visited the detainees to find out if they had sustained any injuries . The detainees did not make any complaints or requests .", "CARDINAL . Detainees and the premises where they live may be searched ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Physical force , special means or weapons may be used against detainees if they offer resistance to the officers , persistently disobey lawful demands of the officers , engage in riotous conduct , take part in mass disorders , take hostages , attack individuals or commit other publicly dangerous acts , escape from the penitentiary institution or attempt to harm themselves or others ( LAW ) . The procedure for application of these security measures is determined in NORP legislation ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . When using physical force , special means or weapons , the penitentiary officers must :", "( CARDINAL ) NORP state their intention to use them and afford the detainee(s ) sufficient time to comply with their demands unless a delay would imperil life or limb of the officers or detainees ;", "( CARDINAL ) NORP ensure the least possible harm to detainees and provide medical assistance ;", "( CARDINAL ) report every incident involving the use of physical force , special means or weapons to their immediate superiors ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW of LAW of Criminal Procedure , in force at the material time , a prosecutor took part in a hearing before a supervisory review court . A convict and his or her counsel could be summoned if the court found it necessary . If summoned , they were to be afforded an opportunity to take cognisance of the application for supervisory review and to make oral submissions at the hearing . By its ruling of DATE , ORG declared LAW unconstitutional in so far as it allowed a supervisory - instance court to examine the case without providing the convicted or acquitted person and their counsel with an opportunity to know the contents of the request for supervisory review lodged by the prosecutor , if the latter sought annulment of the final judgment on grounds unfavourable to that person . ORG made the same findings in respect of the lack of a legal requirement to notify the convicted or acquitted person and their counsel of the time when and place where the supervisory review hearing would take place . Failing that , the above persons would be unable to state their position to the court .", "CARDINAL . A supervisory review court was not bound by the scope of the application for supervisory review and was under an obligation to review the criminal case in its entirety ( LAW . It could uphold , amend or quash any of the earlier judgments , vary the sentence , discontinue the criminal proceedings or remit the matter for a new consideration by the trial or appeal court . It could not , however , increase the sentence or re - categorise the defendant \u2019s actions as a more serious offence ( ibid . ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
