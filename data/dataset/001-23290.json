THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Mark Villiger;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , born in DATE , and he is currently in prison in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted on CARDINAL counts of robbery , CARDINAL of attempted robbery , CARDINAL of carrying an imitation firearm and CARDINAL of using a firearm to resist arrest . He was sentenced to CARDINAL concurrent sentences amounting to DATE imprisonment .", "On DATE he was convicted of CARDINAL charges of robbery and CARDINAL of carrying imitation firearms . He received a life sentence pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE and his tariff was fixed at DATE . In sentencing , the judge stated that DATE would have been the appropriate determinate sentence in his case and referred to the terror experienced by the victims of the robberies and the long - term traumatic effects .", "The applicant did not seek leave to appeal against sentence . His application for permission to appeal against conviction was refused by ORG on DATE .", "The DATE Act came into force on DATE . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) provide as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This section applies where -", "( a ) a person is convicted of a serious offence committed after the commencement of this section ; and", "( b ) at the time when that offence was committed , he was DATE or over and had been convicted in any part of GPE of another serious offence .", "( CARDINAL ) The court shall impose a life sentence , that is to say -", "( a ) where the person is ORG over , a sentence of imprisonment for life ; ( b ) where he is DATE , a sentence of custody for life under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ,", "unless the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances relating to either of the offences or to the offender which justify its not doing so .", "( CARDINAL ) Where the court does not impose a life sentence , it shall state in open court that it is of that opinion and what the exceptional circumstances are . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) listed the offences considered \u201c serious \u201d for the purposes of the section . The offences listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) were already punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment and they include rape .", "In this case , decided after the entry into force of LAW DATE , ORG adopted a more flexible interpretation of the words \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d in section DATE CARDINAL Act .", "The appellants contended that section CARDINAL was incompatible with , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . ORG agreed that the manner of interpreting section DATE meant that that section could clearly operate in a disproportionate manner , it not being difficult to find examples of situations where it would be wholly disproportionate to impose a life sentence even for a second serious offence .", "Noting that in the earlier case of PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL an appeal had already been allowed where on the evidence it could not be concluded that the defendant did not present a serious and continuing danger to the public such as could justify the imposition of a life sentence , it considered that the problem would disappear if the words \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d in CARDINAL were construed in a manner which accorded with the policy of ORG in adopting the section . That policy was to protect the public . Accordingly , a finding that an offender does not constitute a significant risk to the public should be considered to constitute \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d which approach , ORG considered , would accord with parliamentary intent and with the provisions of the Convention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
