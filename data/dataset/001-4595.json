{"ITEMID": "001-4595", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "CHIORI v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and charged with the burglary of a house in the GPE area on DATE . The arrest followed the discovery of fingerprints at the scene which were later found by ORG at ORG to match those of the applicant . The responsible fingerprint officer , Mr S. Harris , concluded that he had no doubt about the fact that the fingerprint evidence provided a correct positive identification of the applicant having regard to the number of concordant ridge characteristics between the applicant \u2019s fingerprints and those found at the scene .", "The fingerprint evidence was the only evidence linking the applicant to the burglary . The applicant maintained that he was innocent of the offence .", "On DATE the applicant was remanded in custody by ORG . He was eventually released on bail on DATE .", "While on bail the applicant \u2019s solicitor commissioned an independent fingerprint expert , PERSON , to consider the evidence against the applicant and to prepare a report . The expert attended at different police offices to examine various aspects of the fingerprint file in relation to the fingerprint evidence . PERSON concluded that he was unable to agree with the findings of PERSON . On DATE PERSON arranged a meeting with PERSON PERSON and another fingerprint officer from ORG . At that meeting the fingerprint officers demonstrated how PERSON had reached a positive identification of the applicant by comparing the fingerprints . Being dissatisfied with the explanations PERSON sought confirmation of his findings from another independent expert . The latter agreed with PERSON view that the positive identification was incorrect .", "The applicant \u2019s trial was listed for DATE despite the concerns being voiced by the applicant \u2019s lawyer about the shortcomings in the fingerprint evidence . The trial was in fact adjourned when the applicant failed to attend court . On DATE the prosecution notified the applicant \u2019s lawyer that it would be offering no evidence . On DATE before ORG the prosecution formally offered no evidence , explaining that the police fingerprint officer had made an error of judgment when comparing the fingerprints . The charges against the applicant were dropped .", "In a further expert report commissioned by the applicant \u2019s lawyer in a letter dated CARDINAL DATE and submitted on DATE , PERSON stated that this was the only case known to him where an attempt has been made to produce an erroneous identification to a court as evidence of identification . In his view , it should have been apparent to an experienced fingerprint officer that there could have been no genuine identification of the applicant on the strength of the fingerprint evidence . He concluded that there had been a serious flaw in the checking procedure . Had the procedure been rigourously adhered to , a false identification would have been excluded at an early stage . In his view , there was compelling evidence of gross negligence and incompetence on the part of members of ORG . However , from the information available to him he was unable to find anything to suggest that the mistake had been made with any malicious intent towards the applicant .", "On DATE counsel advised the applicant \u2019s solicitor that an action for false imprisonment would be unlikely to succeed and that the facts did not give rise to a cause of action in negligence under domestic law , either with respect to the police or the fingerprint officer .", "The applicant has applied to the Secretary of ORG for ex gratia payment of compensation for the time spent in custody . There is no information as to whether his request was successful ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
