On DATE and DATE , PERSON , a Minister from ORG , wrote to the applicant 's Member of ORG confirming that as a man he was not entitled to claim widows ' benefits .", "CARDINAL . The following history of ORG ( \u201c WP \u201d ) is taken from Lord PERSON 's speech in NORP v. Secretary of ORG ex parte ORG [ DATE ] UKHL CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL :", "\u201c [ ORG was ] first introduced by the Widows ' , ORG ' and ORG DATE . The LAW provided a pension of MONEY a week to any widow whose husband had paid sufficient contributions . There was no age qualification or time limit on payment . Widows were as such entitled to support . But during the Second World War , large numbers of women worked in the armed forces or civilian employment , replacing men on active service . Public attitudes to widowhood changed . Sir PERSON said in his DATE Report on ORG and ORG ( Cmd CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) that there was no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life . If she was able to work she should do so . He recommended that all widows should be paid DATE transitional allowance to help them adjust to their new circumstances but that longer term pensions should be confined to widows with dependent children . The Government did not accept this advice in full . It considered that an older widow , who had in accordance with convention stayed at home during a long marriage to look after husband and children , would often be severely disadvantaged if she was required to earn her own living . LAW DATE therefore not only gave effect to PERSON 's recommendations by introducing [ Widowed Mother 's Allowance : ' PERSON ' ] and a widow 's allowance for DATE after bereavement but also provided ORG for widows who were CARDINAL at the date of the husband 's death or who ceased to qualify for ORG when they were over DATE .", "The secular trend in the position of women in employment over DATE reinforced PERSON 's view that being a widow should not , as such , entitle CARDINAL to a pension . More and more women entered the labour market . But the trend was a slow one and crude comparisons of the numbers of economically active men and women are misleading . Far more women than men worked part - time and the great majority of women were ( and remain ) unable to escape from the traditional low - paid activities of cooking , caring and cleaning . So the trend to equality was counteracted by political pressure from groups representing widows who claimed that , as GPE became more prosperous , benefits for widows should be increased rather than reduced . The policies pursued by successive governments were therefore not entirely consistent . ORG National Insurance Act DATE raised to CARDINAL the age at which a woman could claim ORG after ceasing to be entitled to ORG . On the other hand , ORG persons ' and widows ' pensions and attendance allowance ) Act DATE reduced to CARDINAL the age at which ORG would be payable ( at a reduced rate ) , whether as a result of bereavement or the cessation of ORG .", "In DATE the government published a ORG on ORG which pointed out ( in paragraph CARDINAL ) that the current system of benefits dated DATE when far fewer married women worked :", "' DATE CARDINAL of all married women with children over school age , and over a CARDINAL of widows CARDINAL , go to work . The present pattern of benefits nonetheless provides support without regard to widows ' other income , in many cases long after they have ceased to be responsible for bringing up children . The ORG 's view is that it is right to give greater emphasis to providing for widows of working age who have children to support , and for older widows less able to establish themselves in work . '", "Despite this acknowledgement of changes in social conditions , LAW DATE made relatively modest adjustments to the system . DATE transitional widow 's allowance was abolished and the lump sum [ Widow 's Payment : ' WPt ' ] of \u00a3 MONEY substituted . The age at which ORG became payable , whether on bereavement or cessation of ORG , was raised to CARDINAL and entitlement to the full rate postponed until CARDINAL . These provisions were subsequently consolidated in the DATE Act .", "The DATE changes were opposed by a strong lobby on behalf of widows . But no one suggested in the course of the Parliamentary debates that ORG should be extended to men . It is true that ORG , a non - governmental organisation for ' the widowed and their children ' , which had taken widowers on board in DATE , said in their DATE report :", "' We ... continued to press for a widower 's pension , based on his wife 's national insurance contributions , and for an allowance to be paid to widowed fathers . '", "But this pressure does not appear to have persuaded anyone to raise the question of ORG for widowers in ORG . The first serious suggestion that widowers should in principle be paid the same benefits as widows came from ORG . There had been a ORG in DATE on ' the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security ' which expressly excluded survivors ' benefits . In DATE the Commission produced a proposal for a new Directive ( Com ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL Final ) . It drew attention in an explanatory memorandum to a statement of ORG in GPE and ORG of ORG ( Cases CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , [ DATE ] ORG , DATE , para CARDINAL ( a case concerning survivors ' pensions under the ORG 's own ORG ) that the principle of equal treatment of men and women ' forms part of the fundamental rights the observance of which the court has a duty to ensure . ' DATE of the draft Directive provided that there should be no discrimination on grounds of sex in the payment of survivorship benefits :", "' and to this end :", "( a ) either the recognition on the same terms for widowers of entitlement to the pensions and other benefits provided for widows ;", "( b ) or the replacement of widows ' benefits by the creation or extension of a system of individual rights open to all surviving spouses regardless of sex . '", "ORG on ORG ( ORG ) held an inquiry into the proposal in DATE . Miss PERSON , a writer on social security matters , said in evidence to the ORG that there was no case for paying older widowers the same pensions as older widows . The only way to produce equality was to level down . But hasty action would cause real hardship to large numbers of older widows who had chosen DATE to follow the conventional path of staying home to look after husband and children :", "' the effect of earlier social patterns on women still have to be worked through . This suggests the need to phase out the older widow 's pension over a long period \u2014 in the order of DATE . Without this , there would be a serious risk of poverty among older widows who had followed the social norms of DATE and now find themselves at a severe disadvantage in a changed world as a result . '", "ORG accepted Miss PERSON 's evidence and reported ( Session DATE , CARDINALth Report , ORG ) :", "' In GPE ... there might be reluctance to reproduce for widowers the pension a childless widow can receive under the national insurance scheme , irrespective of her earnings , if she is aged DATE or more when her husband dies . This is in recognition of the difficulty the widow may find in re - establishing herself in the labour market \u2014 whereas a widower 's earning ability would not ordinarily be prejudiced in this way .", "The ORG consider that , despite these difficulties , the concept of equal treatment must require that , eventually , men and women should be provided with survivors ' benefits on the same terms . Employment patterns are changing and , if it becomes the norm for married couples to be dependent on the earnings of both partners for most of their working lives , it will make sense for equal survivors ' benefits to be available . There is also a need to avoid putting families at a disadvantage if the mother , rather than the father , becomes the principal breadwinner . It would , however , be perverse to deprive widows of benefits they still need in the interests of sex equality . To reduce this danger , a substantial period should be allowed \u2014 DATE before Member GPE are obliged to equalise survivors ' benefits . Community law recognises a principle of ' legitimate expectation ' which would support this approach . '", "The Government published its response on DATE ( Cm CARDINAL ) . It said at para CARDINAL :", "' Within the state social security system the Government do not think there is any merit in introducing a universal state insurance benefit for widowers on a par with those currently provided for widows . To extend the current provisions for widows to widowers would cost MONEY a year . The available evidence indicates that widowers are more likely to be in full time work than widows , are more likely to have higher earnings than widows and are less likely to have dependent children . As a consequence the ORG have made it clear to the ORG that the equalisation of survivors ' benefits should be removed from this draft directive entirely . '", "In DATE the ORG withdrew the draft directive pending further consultation with Member GPE and there has been no further ORG initiative on the question .", "... [ O]ver DATE the question of paying PERSON to widowed fathers was raised on CARDINAL occasion ( see , for example , a Private Member 's PERSON introduced by Mr PERSON MP on DATE ( ORG ( CARDINALth Series ) vol CARDINAL , cols CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and a Written Answer by the Secretary of ORG ( ORG Deb ( CARDINALth Series ) vol CARDINAL , DATE , col CARDINAL ) ) . No one suggested paying ORG to widowers or , unsurprisingly , abolishing ORG for widows . ORG said in evidence in these proceedings that Mr PERSON 's decision to confine his Private Member 's PERSON to PERSON was ' tactical ' but the need for such tactics suggests that there would have been little support for anything more .", "The abolition of ORG came as part of a wider reform of survivorship and other social security benefits in LAW . It was preceded in DATE by a ORG which drew attention to the fact that , in DATE , CARDINAL out of CARDINAL married women worked compared with CARDINAL in CARDINAL in DATE . CARDINAL of widows under CARDINAL worked and PERCENT of widows now had income from occupational pension schemes . The Government took the view that widows without dependent children no longer needed long term support . The extension of ORG to men was ' not acceptable ' : it would cost MONEY a year and would mean giving help to people who were , as a class , unlikely to need it .", "But the abolition of ORG was strongly opposed by some members of ORG , partly on the ground that elderly widows were still disadvantaged compared with men or younger widows and partly on the ground that ORG was a contributory benefit and that it would be a breach of faith to deny it to the widows of men who had made contributions and arranged their affairs on the assumption that it would be available . An opposition amendment deferring the abolition of ORG until DATE was defeated but the ORG agreed that the changes should not come into force until DATE and that the rights of women bereaved before that date should be preserved . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the DATE Act , a woman who had been widowed was entitled to a ORG if her husband satisfied the contribution conditions set out in a Schedule to the LAW ; and", "( i ) at the date of her husband 's death she was over DATE ( CARDINAL for deaths occurring before DATE ) , but under DATE ; or", "( ii ) she ceased to be entitled to a ORG at a time when she was over DATE ( CARDINAL for deaths occurring before DATE ) , but under DATE .", "CARDINAL . This benefit was not payable for any period after the widow remarried or in which she and a man to whom she was not married were living together as husband and wife , or for any period in which she was entitled to a ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) came into force on DATE . Section CARDINAL introduced ORG which replaced PERSON . The same conditions applied , except that the new payment was available to both widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after DATE . Section CARDINAL introduced ORG . Identical conditions applied as for Widowed Mother 's ORG , except that the new allowance was available to ( i ) widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after DATE and who were under pensionable age ( CARDINAL for women and CARDINAL for men ) at the time of the spouse 's death , and ( ii ) widowers whose wife died before DATE , who had not remarried and were still under pensionable age on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL replaced ORG with ORG for widows and widowers over DATE but under pensionable age at the spouse 's death , where no dependent children existed . The deceased spouse had to have satisfied the relevant contribution conditions and died on or after DATE . ORG is payable for DATE from the date of bereavement , but is not payable for any period after the survivor reaches pensionable age or remarries or lives with another person as husband and wife , or for any period for which the survivor was entitled to Widowed Parent 's ORG .", "CARDINAL . Widows ( but not widowers ) whose husbands died before DATE , and who fulfilled the other conditions of entitlement , continued to be eligible for ORG .", "CARDINAL . For details of the relevant legislative provisions , see PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and Geen v. the GPE , nos . CARDINAL , GPE , GPE and GPE , judgment of DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL - CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a unanimous judgment ( cited in paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in which it found , inter alia , that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards ORG from CARDINAL October CARDINAL ( when LAW DATE came into force ) onwards was objectively justified and involved no breach of Convention rights .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , with whom the other Law Lords agreed , observed that ORG had , for reasons of administrative economy , never been means - tested , but had been paid to older widows because it was thought that , as a class , they were likely to be disadvantaged because it had been the custom for women to give up work when they got married . The same did not apply to widowers . The question was not , therefore , whether there was justification for not paying ORG to men , but rather whether there was justification for not having moved faster in abolishing its payment to women . The history of ORG ( set out in paragraph CARDINAL above ) demonstrated that the decision to achieve equality between men and women by levelling down survivors ' benefits , subject to vested rights , was by no means easy or obvious . It was true that by DATE the proportion of older women ( CARDINAL ) who were \u201c economically active \u201d was PERCENT against PERCENT for men . But those figures had to be adjusted to reflect greater part - time working by women ( PERCENT as against PERCENT ) and the concentration of women in low - paid occupations . The comparative disadvantage of women in the labour market had by no means disappeared .", "CARDINAL . It was permissible under LAW to treat groups unequally in order to correct \u201c factual inequalities \u201d between them , and the ORG enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in determining social and economic policy . Once it was accepted that older widows were historically an economically disadvantaged class which merited special treatment but were gradually becoming less disadvantaged , the question of the precise moment at which such special treatment was no longer justified was a matter of legislative judgment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
