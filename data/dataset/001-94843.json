On DATE the ORG of the Primorskiy Region granted Mr PERSON 's action against the applicants .

On the other hand , the applicants had failed to show that the inclusion of the department in the number of forest operators had given rise to \u201c irregularities \u201d .

Therefore , in the court 's opinion , it was incumbent on the applicants to verify the truthfulness of the information before publishing it .
