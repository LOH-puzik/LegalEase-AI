GPE had asked him to secure the acquittal of a third person and had offered him a bribe of MONEY ( ORG ) in return . The applicant had initially refused but had later agreed after GPE had reiterated the offer a number of times .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE GPE gave the applicant a further USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor General instituted a criminal investigation in respect of the applicant for accepting a bribe , an offence punishable under LAW in force at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant from his post as a prosecutor on grounds relating to corruption . Referring to the relevant provisions of LAW , ORG stated that the applicant had been dismissed for a disciplinary offence and for activities discrediting the prosecuting authorities .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the pre - trial investigation was concluded and the case was referred to ORG . During the trial the applicant pleaded guilty but alleged that he had succumbed to undue pressure from GPE in committing the offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General authorised a judge of ORG to disclose the details of how the model had been implemented \u201c provided that this [ did ] not harm the interests \u201d of the individuals and authorities involved in the operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of accepting a bribe of USD MONEY from GPE , in breach of Article CARDINAL of LAW then in force , and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment .

NORP The court \u2019s conclusions were mainly based on the evidence given by GPE and on secret recordings of his conversations with the applicant . The court had also examined ORG , a prosecutor working in the same regional office as the applicant , whose evidence had not gone beyond confirmation that the applicant had dealt with the criminal case against the third person ( GPE ) indicated by GPE . PERSON was not summoned to appear at the trial as his place of residence was unknown , but a statement by him , which had been recorded by the pre - trial investigators , was read out in court . However , ORG did not take it into account in determining the applicant \u2019s guilt . The court \u2019s judgment did not contain any discussion of the authorisation and implementation of the model .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on an appeal by the applicant , finding that there had been no incitement and that the authorities had not put any active pressure on the applicant to commit the offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a cassation appeal . Relying in particular on ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he argued that there were no statutory provisions allowing the authorities to incite or provoke a person to commit an offence . In that connection , he submitted that on several occasions he had unsuccessfully requested the first - instance and appeal courts to consider the influence exerted by GPE and PERSON on his predisposition to commit the offence . He further complained that the lower courts had not taken into account the fact that GPE was a police officer and not a private individual . He argued that GPE had incited him to accept the bribe . Furthermore , he stated that the authorities had had no valid reason to initiate an undercover operation in his case and that they had overstepped the limits of their ordinary investigative powers by inducing him to commit an offence . He also submitted that VS had not been examined during the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal in a decision which included the following passages :", "\u201c There is no evidence in the case file that [ the applicant \u2019s ] free will was denied or otherwise constrained in such a way that he could not avoid acting illegally . [ GPE ] neither ordered [ the applicant ] to intervene in favour of the person offering the bribe , nor did he threaten him . He asked him orally for help in securing the discontinuation of proceedings [ against the third person ] ... PERSON understood that the request was unlawful ... [ and ] ORG was therefore correct in finding him guilty ...", "[ The applicant ] contests the lawfulness of [ the model ] ... , stating that the case discloses a manifest example of incitement ( kurstymas ) by the officers of the special services to accept the bribe ... [ He submits that , by law ] , authorisation to simulate a criminal act can not be given in the absence of evidence of the preparation or commission of an offence . Therefore , in his view , such a procedure can not pursue the aim of inciting a person or persons to commit a crime . If the model were used for that purpose , it would be unlawful [ and ] the information thereby obtained could not be admitted in evidence ... [ The ] model can not be authorised and implemented unless a person has planned or started to commit an offence , evidence of which should be submitted to a prosecutor ... It appears from the case file that [ the authorities ] were contacted by [ VS ] and [ GPE ] after [ their initial ] meetings with PERSON , during which he had agreed in principle that he would perform the requested actions for ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ... Accordingly , in authorising the use of the model , [ the authorities ] merely joined a criminal act which was already in progress .", "...", "The case file contains no evidence that [ VS ] is an employee of the special services ... [ GPE ] works at the ORG as a police driver ... but this does not mean that he is prohibited from acting in a private capacity . There is no evidence that [ VS ] and [ GPE ] negotiated with PERSON on police instructions . It has , however , been established that [ VS ] and [ GPE ] handed money to him on the police \u2019s orders .", "The court considers that provocation ( provokacija ) to commit a crime is similar but not equivalent to incitement ( kurstymas ) ... Provocation is a form of incitement consisting in encouraging a person to commit an offence ... entailing his criminal responsibility so that he can then be prosecuted on that account . While such conduct is morally reprehensible , the term \u2018 provocation\u2019 is not used either in criminal or procedural law or in LAW of DATE ... From a legal standpoint , provocation does not constitute a factor exempting from criminal responsibility a person who has thereby been induced to commit an offence ...", "Since the case file contains contradictory evidence as to the conduct of [ VS ] and [ GPE ] before the criminal conduct simulation model was authorised , it is difficult to establish who was the instigator ( iniciatorius ) of giving and accepting the bribe , or , in other words , who incited whom to give or accept the bribe . [ VS ] ... stated that , after he had contacted PERSON to ask him to intervene in securing the discontinuation of the criminal case [ against the third person ] , PERSON had been the first to say that he could settle the matter for CARDINAL . For his part , [ GPE ] ... stated that PERSON Ramanauskas had said that the discontinuation of the case would cost CARDINAL . In his testimony PERSON alleged that [ VS ] had asked him if ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL would be enough to ensure that the case was discontinued . In these circumstances , it can not be said with any certainty who was the instigator of the bribery , nor can it be inferred that [ VS ] and [ GPE ] incited PERSON to accept the bribe . Furthermore , there is no reason to conclude that [ VS ] and [ GPE ] provoked the offence committed by ORG in accepting the bribe . It can only be said unequivocally that the initiative ( iniciatyva ) to apply to PERSON in order to have the case [ against the third person ] discontinued came from [ GPE ] .", "However , the court considers that the answer to the question whether a person has actually induced ( palenk\u0117 ) or otherwise incited ( sukurst\u0117 ) another to offer or accept a bribe is of no consequence as far as the legal classification of [ the applicant \u2019s ] conduct is concerned . Incitement ( kurstymas ) to commit an offence is one of the various forms of complicity . Under the branch of criminal law dealing with complicity , incitement is a form of conspiracy . A person who commits an offence after having being incited to do so incurs the same criminal responsibility as a person who acts of his own volition ... Even assuming that PERSON was incited by [ VS ] and [ GPE ] to accept a bribe , it must be emphasised that the incitement took the form of an offer , and not of threats or blackmail . He was therefore able to decline ( and ought to have declined ) the illegal offer ... It follows from the testimony of PERSON that he understood the nature of the acts he was being asked to carry out , and accepted [ the bribe ] of his own free will ...", "At the same time it must be noted that it is a specific feature of bribery as an offence that one side is necessarily the instigator ( kurstytojas ) . A ORG official soliciting a bribe is an instigator within the meaning of LAW [ of LAW then in force \u2013 \u2018 the ORG ] in that he incites ( kursto ) another to pay him a bribe , in breach of that Article . [ A person ] offering a bribe to a ORG official is necessarily an instigator within the meaning of LAW since , by making the offer , he incites the official to accept a bribe , that is , to commit the offence provided for in that Article ... Both the person giving and the person accepting a bribe exercise their free will ... and may therefore choose between possible forms of conduct . A person who intentionally chooses the criminal option while having the possibility of resisting the incitement rightly incurs criminal responsibility , regardless of the outside factors that may have influenced his choice ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant began serving his prison sentence . He remained in prison until DATE , when he was released on licence .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the prohibition on his working in the legal service was lifted in DATE . In DATE his conviction was expunged .", "CARDINAL . The Criminal Code applicable at the material time punished the acts of accepting a bribe ( Article CARDINAL ) , offering a bribe ( Article CARDINAL ) and breaching currency and securities regulations ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW in force at the time and LAW ( in force since DATE ) provide that incitement is CARDINAL of the possible forms of complicity in an offence and is punishable alongside other forms of assistance ( aiding and abetting , organising , executing ) in the commission of an offence . These provisions define an instigator ( kurstytojas ) as a person who induces ( palenk\u0117 ) another to commit an offence . The term kurstymas ( which can also be translated as \u201c incitement \u201d or \u201c instigation \u201d ) is normally used in domestic legal doctrine to define the notion of complicity .", "CARDINAL .

The application for authorisation had to include , among other things , a reference to the limits of the conduct intended to be simulated ( that is , the legal characterisation under a specific provision of LAW of the actions to be taken ) and the purpose of the operation , including its interim and ultimate aims .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the LAW required the authorities to protect persons from active pressure to commit an offence against their own will .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Act afforded the right to contest the lawfulness of evidence obtained by means of special techniques .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings which gave rise to the case of PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , struck out of the ORG \u2019s list of cases on DATE ) , ORG gave judgment on DATE , holding , inter alia :", "\u201c LAW defines [ the criminal conduct simulation model ] as a set of actions entailing the elements of an offence , authorised with a view to protecting the best interests of the ORG , society or the individual . ... The model may be authorised only for operations by [ the police ] and does not apply to individuals who commit offences .", "The request [ by the police for authorisation of the model in this case ] referred to the aim of the intended operation , namely identification of all persons involved in a [ human ] trafficking network .", "Of course , the [ police ] officers could not foresee who would take part in this crime ... CARDINAL of the aims of [ the prosecution ] in authorising the model was to establish the identities of members of a criminal organisation . \u201d", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the same case , ORG held as follows regarding the use of police undercover agents :", "\u201c [ The applicants ] were not aware of the ongoing operation at the time they committed the offence . They were convinced that they were trafficking persons who had illegally crossed the NORP border . As Article CARDINAL of LAW provides that the offence in question is committed where direct intent has been established , [ the applicants\u2019 ] error as to the nature of the act they were committing is of no relevance to the legal classification of their conduct . Since they were convinced that they were trafficking [ human beings ] , their acts fell objectively within the scope of the offence defined in LAW ... Their conduct was therefore rightly classified as a completed offence . The authorisation given to the authorities [ to use the model ] served the sole purpose of legitimising the actions of the police officers taking part in the trafficking . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that LAW was generally compatible with LAW . It held in particular that the model constituted a specific form of operational activity using intelligence and other secret measures in order to investigate organised and other serious crime . It emphasised that the use of clandestine measures , as such , was not contrary to LAW , or indeed the LAW , as long as such measures were based on legislation that was clear and foreseeable in effect and were proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued . ORG found that the LAW provided a clear definition of the scope and procedure for the use of various forms of operational activities , including the model .", "Referring in particular to the Teixeira de Castro v. GPE case ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-IV ) , the ORG emphasised that a criminal conduct simulation model could not be used for the purpose of incitement ( kurstoma ) or provocation ( provokuojama ) to commit an offence that had not already been initiated . It further held that this investigative technique did not allow officials to incite the commission of an offence by a person who had abandoned plans to commit the offence . It added that , by authorising and implementing the model , the investigative authorities and their undercover agents were restricted to \u201c joining criminal acts that [ had ] been initiated but not yet completed \u201d . ORG emphasised that it was for the courts of ordinary jurisdiction dealing with allegations of incitement or of other forms of abuse of the model to establish in each particular case whether the investigating authorities had gone beyond the limits of the legal framework within which the model had been authorised .", "ORG also stated that authorisation of the model did not amount to a licence for a police officer or third person acting as an undercover agent to commit a crime but simply legitimised DATE from the point of view of domestic law \u2013 the acts which the agent might be required to carry out in simulating an offence . The main aim of operational activities , including the model , was to facilitate criminal investigations , and on that account they came within the sphere of competence of both the prosecuting authorities and the courts . Accordingly , the model did not require judicial authorisation but simply authorisation by a prosecutor . ORG further noted that secret audio and video recordings of conversations taking place in the context of operational activities under LAW were not subject to judicial authorisation and that this was compatible with LAW .
