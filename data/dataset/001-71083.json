The applicant and his wife had not undertaken a commitment to leave GPE vis - \u00e0 - vis that country .", "On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG .

They had consented to settle in GPE and they had been granted a flat in GPE in DATE . The appellants could not have had any legitimate expectation that their residence permits would be extended , as the impugned provision had been introduced into LAW in DATE , that is , before the appellants had submitted their request for extension of their residence permits .
