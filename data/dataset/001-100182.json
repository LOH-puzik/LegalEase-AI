The applicants , retired military officers , sued the military commissariats of GPE and GPE for recalculation of their pensions . CARDINAL group of the applicants sought adjustment of the pension to the minimum wage and claimed arrears for DATE in line with the increase in the latter . Another group of the applicants claimed recalculation of their pensions on account of the increase of the monetary compensation paid in respect of the food allowance . Several applicants raised both types of claims before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On the dates listed in ORG I the domestic courts found in the applicants ' favour . As regards the case no . CARDINAL by PERSON , the judgment of DATE was issued by the Justice of the Peace of the CARDINALth ORG . The judgment of CARDINAL DATE in favour of PERSON , as well as all the judgments in favour of the remaining DATE applicants , were issued by ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court ordered in respect of the first type of the claims that the pensions be adjusted to the minimum wage and that the arrears be paid to the applicants . As concerns the second type of the claims , the court held that the pensions should be increased in line with the increase of the DATE food allowance and awarded the applicants the respective lump sums in arrears . The awards were made against ORG of GPE , while the respective claims against the commissariat of GPE had been dismissed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The representatives of ORG of GPE were present at the court room on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In several cases the respondent authority introduced the grounds of appeal with ORG . However , on various dates in DATE the respondent authority revoked their applications . For example , in case of Mr Turutin ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) the grounds for appeal were revoked on DATE . As a result , none of the judgments was appealed against . They entered into force DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants took various steps to obtain execution of the judgment . In particular , the Government submitted that in DATE Mr Sobolev , PERSON and DATE other applicants sent the writs of execution to the respondent authority . It follows from the incoming correspondence log of the Rostov ORG that the latter received the writs .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the military prosecutor 's office started an inquiry into lawfulness of proceedings concerning military pension arrears throughout GPE and detected several instances of fraud . In particular , they found out that the respondent commissariat on several occasions had made payments against forged writs of execution issued in the similar but unrelated proceedings . On various dates the enforcement proceedings in the cases at hand were suspended pending the region wide inquiry , because the prosecutor 's office had to establish authenticity of the writs of execution issued in the applicants ' cases . It appears that the investigation did not reveal any evidence of fraud in the present cases .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , in DATE judge A. who had issued the judgments in question was dismissed by the decision of ORG of GPE . At some point several high officials of ORG of GPE had been charged with and convicted of embezzlement .", "CARDINAL .

On various dates in DATE the respondent commissariat applied for the supervisory review of the judgments .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG 's observations , CARDINAL requests for review were lodged outside the DATE time - limit from the date of the judgment 's entry into force . In such cases , the respondent authority also applied for extension of the time - limit for application for supervisory review arguing that it had not received copies of the respective first instance judgments in time and had only been informed of the judgments in DATE , when the prosecutor 's inquiry had been opened . On various dates ORG allowed these applications . In particular , in case of PERSON ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) the ORG on DATE accepted the authority 's argument that they had been unaware of the judgment , having found , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c There is no evidence in the case materials to the effect that a copy of the judgment of DATE ... had been sent to ORG of GPE . It follows from the above that the [ respondent commissariat ] had a real opportunity to avail itself of its right to apply for supervisory review within DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On various dates in DATE ORG allowed the applications for supervisory review of the judgments lodged by the military commissariat of GPE and remitted the matter for examination on the merits to the Presidium of the Rostov Regional Court .", "CARDINAL . On the dates specified in GPE I the Presidium of the Rostov ORG quashed the judgments in the applicants ' favour and remitted the cases for a fresh consideration . In each case the ORG concluded that the first - instance court had erroneously applied the substantive law . They also found that ORG had lacked territorial jurisdiction to examine the cases . The arrears were awarded against ORG of GPE and thus the cases should have been examined by a court in LOC of GPE - on - Don where the respondent commissariat was located .", "CARDINAL . NORP The cases were considered afresh by ORG of PERSON - on - Don .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , PERSON ( application no .

Judicial decisions may be appealed against to a court exercising supervisory review within DATE after they became legally binding ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . By its ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG interpreted LAW as allowing the above - mentioned persons to apply for supervisory review only after having exhausted all available ordinary appeals", "CARDINAL .
