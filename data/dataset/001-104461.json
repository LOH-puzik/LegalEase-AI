During their escape from the crime scene at high speed the applicant , who was under the influence of alcohol and drugs , shunted the car of the security guard who was trying to stop them . Some time later the police arrived with CARDINAL vehicles and tried to stop the applicant by shunting his car off the road , CARDINAL vehicle hitting the car sideways and one at the rear .

When he was QUANTITY from the applicant \u2019s car , the applicant managed to free his car from the bushes and drove suddenly towards PERSON quickly side - stepped in order not to be run over and fired a total of CARDINAL shots at the car in an attempt to stop the applicant .
