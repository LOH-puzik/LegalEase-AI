{"ITEMID": "001-22021", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "AUT", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "VOGL and VOGL v. AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are father and son , both NORP nationals , residing in GPE and PERSON , respectively . They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE a banking institution ( hereafter \u201c NORP \u201d ) filed a counterclaim against the first applicant and his wife requesting repayment of a mortgage loan , the validity of which had been contested by the couple in another set of proceedings ( \u201c the main proceedings \u201d ) . On DATE the second applicant joined the main proceedings as the first applicant and his wife had meanwhile transferred part of the real estate affected by the mortgage to the second applicant . On DATE the first applicant filed a statement of defence ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE the court suspended the counterclaim proceedings until the delivery of a final judgment in the main proceedings . They were terminated by ORG judgment of DATE .", "On DATE NORP filed a motion with ORG for the continuation of the proceedings . By a written submission of DATE , the first applicant gave notice of the proceedings ( PERSON ) to the second applicant .", "At the hearing of DATE the applicants challenged the judge for bias . They contended that she had made subjective statements about the first applicant \u2019s son and the second applicant \u2019s brother , PERSON , in the judgment given in the main proceedings and had accused the first applicant and his wife of delaying the proceedings . By a decision of DATE , ORG rejected the motion , finding that the applicants\u2019 allegations did not suffice to bear out a challenge for bias . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE ORG appointed an expert .", "On DATE the first applicant requested the reopening of the main proceedings . On DATE ORG dismissed this request after it had been examined at CARDINAL lower instances .", "On DATE the court file was transmitted to the expert for the preparation of his opinion . The expert submitted his opinion on DATE . The court ordered the parties to submit their comments and requests thereto within DATE . Both parties asked for an extension of the timelimit , which was granted . On DATE the applicants submitted their observations .", "On DATE another hearing took place at which the applicants were present . A further hearing was scheduled for DATE , to which the first applicant and the applicants\u2019 counsel were summoned . On DATE the ORG counsel filed a motion for an adjournment . He stated that he was unable to attend the meeting because of a clash with other appointments , that the first applicant had already scheduled DATE holiday in GPE , and the second applicant had planned to take part in a fair in GPE . The request was refused .", "The court ordered them to submit certain documents within DATE . On DATE the applicants requested an extension of this time - limit , which was not granted . Thereupon , the applicants filed another motion challenging the judge for bias . They contended that the refusal of their requests proved that she was not willing to grant them a fair trial . They further complained that the judge had in an emotional manner conducted the hearing of DATE , which might have been caused by the fact that she had learned about the ORG submission of a complaint to ORG relating to the main proceedings .", "The hearing of DATE was held as scheduled in the presence of the applicants\u2019 lawyer , but in the absence of the applicants . At the hearing counsel further amended the motion for bias after the judge had objected to the allegation that she was not willing to grant the applicants a fair trial and after she had mentioned that she had a problem with the applicants\u2019 counsel .", "After the expert had given his opinion , the judge closed the hearing and announced the delivery of the written judgment following the final decision on the applicants\u2019 motion for bias .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the motion challenging the judge for bias . It held that the applicants had raised their argument as regards the alleged emotional conduct of the judge at the hearing of DATE too late and that the remainder of the motion did not disclose any indication of bias .", "The applicants appealed , arguing in essence that the hearing held on DATE had been scheduled too late . Therefore , they had not had enough time to prepare their pleadings . Further , the period fixed for the delivery of documents had been too short . The refusal of an adjournment resulted in their exclusion from the proceedings . Finally , they contended that the judge had conducted the hearing in an emotional manner , and that ORG had failed to deal with the respective amendments of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the appeal was dismissed by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) . It noted that the summons had been served early enough to respect the DATE preparation - time guaranteed by NORP law . The lower court had lawfully refused the adjournment request as the first applicant was represented by a lawyer and his absence was for reasons of private holidays . As regards the absence of the applicants\u2019 counsel , he had not submitted reasons why he was unable to attend the hearing or why he could not be represented by another lawyer . In any event , the second applicant had not been summoned in person . Therefore , the applicants had not been excluded from the procedure as they had been represented by a lawyer throughout , particularly at the hearing on DATE . As to the order to submit documents within DATE , ORG found that , pursuant to LAW , documents which were relied upon by a party in order to establish the truth of its allegations had to be submitted by that party if not otherwise provided . No sanction could be imposed in case of non - compliance with that order . As to the applicants\u2019 allegations concerning the judge \u2019s emotional manner of conducting the hearing of DATE , ORG confirmed the lower court \u2019s decision that this complaint should have been raised already at the hearing and was therefore belated . The judge \u2019s objection to the allegation that she had denied the applicants a fair trial did not disclose any lack of impartiality on her part . Her further statement that she had a problem with the ORG counsel was not conducive to a constructive atmosphere in respect of the proceedings and might have been taken as a personal statement . However , in the context of counsel \u2019s repeated but unfounded motions for bias , it was understandable that she perceived counsel \u2019s actions to be problematic . This would not justify any fears that the judge would act and decide other than on objective grounds .", "In its judgment dated DATE , ORG granted the R. \u2019s claim , referring to the submissions of the parties , the evidence of witnesses and experts , as well as the documentary evidence and the case - files of the proceedings . The judgment was served on DATE .", "On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE claiming in particular that the first instance court had refused to take evidence proposed by them .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on grounds of nullity and confirmed the lower court \u2019s decision , but allowed their complaint as regards part of the sums involved . It held that ORG had correctly refused the ORG requests for the further taking of evidence since their numerous requests were aimed at delaying the proceedings . Moreover , at the hearing of DATE and for the first time , the applicants stated the opposite of what they had claimed in the main and in the counterclaim proceedings . Their further requests related to issues of law and facts that were already dealt with and finally determined in the main proceedings . On the whole , ORG found that the lower court had carefully assessed the evidence submitted to it .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed the appeal . The decision was served on DATE .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) , which has been in force since DATE , provides as follows .", "\" ( CARDINAL ) If a court is dilatory in taking any procedural step , such as announcing or holding a hearing , obtaining an expert \u2019s report , or preparing a decision , any party may submit a request to this court for the superior court to impose an appropriate time - limit for the taking of the particular procedural step ; unless sub - section ( CARDINAL ) of this section applies , the court is required to submit the request to the superior court , together with its comments , forthwith .", "( CARDINAL ) If the court takes all the procedural steps specified in the request within DATE after receipt , and so informs the party concerned , the request is deemed withdrawn unless the party declares within DATE after service of the notification that it wishes to maintain its request .", "( CARDINAL ) The request referred to in sub - section ( CARDINAL ) shall be determined with special expedition by a chamber of the superior court consisting of CARDINAL professional judges , CARDINAL of whom shall preside ; if the court has not been dilatory , the request shall be dismissed . This decision is not subject to appeal . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
