{"ITEMID": "001-22811", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "X v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP national , who was born in DATE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG . The respondent Government were represented by Ms I. GPE , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant arrived in GPE at DATE . Allegedly , he intended to apply for asylum immediately and , as he only speaks his mother tongue , he went to his brother in GPE to seek his assistance . The brother was ill and unable to help him , however , so he left for ORG where , apparently , some friends of his live . He arrived in ORG on DATE and allegedly intended to file his asylum application on DATE , after the PERSON DATE . However , during DATE , on DATE , he assaulted a NORP national and was arrested and detained by the police . Initially , he presented a false NORP passport but , eventually , he disclosed his true identity and requested asylum .", "On DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of ORG decided to detain the applicant on suspicion of assault .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG convicted the applicant for assault and use of a false document ( brukande av falsk urkund ) and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "Following his release from prison on DATE the applicant was taken into custody in accordance with a decision of ORG ( Migrationsverket ) of DATE , as there was a risk that he would otherwise disappear . The applicant was moved to the ORG 's custody LOC at LOC .", "In his asylum application , the applicant stated that , following the completion of his military service in DATE , he had returned to his home town . After DATE he had been approached by members of the organisation ORG ) who had threatened his life and told him that he had to work for the organisation . DATE he had regularly transported ORG members in his minibus and also delivered oil and gas to the ORG . On several occasions , ORG members had visited him in his home and threatened to kill him and his family should he not cooperate . Towards DATE the NORP police had also been looking for him at his home . He had never sought the help of the police for fear of reprisals from the PERSON and the police who , allegedly , would not have believed that he had been forced to help the ORG . Following the visit by the police , the applicant had got scared and left for GPE where his sister lived . Someone had helped him out of the country ; he had travelled to GPE , GPE by plane and from there to GPE by truck . He had stayed in GPE for DATE and eventually travelled to GPE by boat . Allegedly , he had not left GPE earlier , as he had been unable to make up his mind and had not known where to go . Moreover , had it not been for the threats from the PERSON , he would not have left the country . According to his parents in GPE , the PERSON and the police had come to look for him several times after his escape . However , he had never been politically active and had not had any difficulties with the NORP police or other authorities .", "On DATE ORG rejected the asylum application and ordered the applicant 's expulsion from GPE . It also decided that the applicant should remain in custody . ORG noted that the general situation in GPE was no longer such as to constitute a reason for granting asylum . As regards the applicant 's personal situation , ORG did not find the applicant 's allegations credible . It noted that he had not applied for asylum until he was arrested by the police , DATE after his arrival in GPE , although the alleged reason for his travelling to GPE was to seek asylum . Even when arrested he first lied about his true identity . The ORG therefore considered that the applicant could not have thought that his need for protection was particularly great . ORG also found it peculiar that he had worked for the ORG under threats to his life for as long a period as DATE without having tried to escape . Allegedly , as he had a valid NORP passport and had completed his military service he should have been able to leave GPE without any difficulties at an earlier date . As an alternative , he could have left for GPE to live with his sister . For these reasons , ORG concluded that it was not plausible that , upon return to GPE , the applicant would be subjected to treatment contrary to LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , agreeing with the reasons given by ORG , upheld the above decision . It decided also that the applicant should remain in custody . ORG had at its disposal an \u201c incident report \u201d , dated DATE , from the LOC custody , according to which the applicant had tried to hurt himself in custody . He was given medication and put under constant surveillance .", "According to another \u201c incident report \u201d of DATE the applicant , on that date , after having been informed of ORG decision , had collapsed in violent spasms and had again tried to hurt himself by banging his head against the floor . The responsible physician , PERSON , a specialist in general medicine , concluded that the applicant was panic - stricken . As there was a great risk that the applicant would suffer from another similar attack and as the LAW custody did not have the necessary resources , PERSON considered that further custody at ORG was inappropriate . As the applicant could not be considered mentally ill , he could not be admitted to a psychiatric ward . Instead , Dr PERSON recommended that the applicant be moved to the detention centre at GPE which had sufficient personnel and medical resources to take care of him . Accordingly , the applicant was moved to that detention centre in TIME of DATE .", "At GPE the applicant was examined , at the request of his lawyer , by PERSON , a specialist in psychiatry from ORG f\u00f6r tortyr- och traumaskadade ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) in GPE . According to the opinion of PERSON , issued on DATE , the applicant feared that the ORG would kill him if he were returned to GPE . His fear was based on previous threats to him and his family . On account of that fear , he was unable to communicate properly with other people and had reduced bodily functions . PERSON concluded that the applicant was , most likely , seriously ill due to a lengthy state of fear , that he had reacted like a person facing execution and that the risk of a suicide attempt was very serious . Thus , he should be taken to a psychiatric ward for further examination .", "On DATE a new application for asylum , based on the new medical information , was lodged with ORG . DATE the ORG decided not to suspend the enforcement of the expulsion order .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE rejected the applicant 's appeal against ORG decision not to release him from custody .", "On DATE , following the ORG 's indication under LAW , ORG stayed the execution of the expulsion order and released the applicant from custody .", "On DATE the applicant was taken to hospital and was then transferred to a psychiatric ward .", "On DATE Dr PERSON from the ORG again examined the applicant . According to his medical certificate , issued DATE , the applicant was feeling fairly well and safe and was able to give a detailed account of his situation . The applicant showed no signs of depression and did not meet all the criteria for a post - traumatic stress syndrome . According to PERSON , the applicant 's status at the time of the earlier examination , at GPE , could only be seen as an expression of great fear reasonably based on his previous experiences . The detention at GPE and the threat of expulsion from GPE had involved a serious risk of a lasting impairment of the applicant 's health and also a risk of a suicide attempt .", "The new application for asylum is still pending before ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
