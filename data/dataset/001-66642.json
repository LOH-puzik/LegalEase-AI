POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant filed with ORG ( s\u0105d rejonowy ) an action in which she requested the eviction of PERSON from a flat she owned . She also claimed payment of overdue rent , in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) . She submitted that she had given notice of termination of the lease contract after ORG 's recurrent failure to pay the rent on time . J. had been occupying the flat on the basis of an administrative decision , given under a so - called special lease scheme ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL below ) . This administrative decision had created a protected tenancy contract between the parties , on the basis of which controlled rent was to be paid by the tenant and the tenancy could not be terminated by the owner .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , having offered PERSON an alternative flat , added a new eviction application , which was based on article QUANTITY of the Law on ORG ( LOC o najmie lokali mieszkalnych i dodatkach mieszkaniowych ) . Subsequently , she withdrew the claim related to her tenant 's failure to pay the rent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court gave judgment . It ordered PERSON to pay overdue rent in the amount of PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL and dismissed the eviction application . The court admitted that the applicant had offered J. an alternative flat before seeking her eviction . It pointed out , however , that LAW DATE PERSON on ORG provided that a flat offered to a tenant as alternative lodging had to be owned by the person seeking eviction ( see \u00a7 DATE below ) . However , the flat which the applicant had offered PERSON was owned by a housing co - operative and the applicant had only a limited right to it . The court considered that :", "\u201c The plaintiff has a co - operative quasi - proprietorial right to that flat , which , although relatively extensive , is yet limited by a number of provisions of the Co - operative PERSON and can not be equated with ownership . This court is bound by laws , and the relevant provision of the PERSON on the Lease of Dwellings [ concerning the requirements that an alternative dwelling had to meet ] is unequivocal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court further considered that it was not empowered to assume that the legislature had made the reference to mandatory ownership of the alternative accommodation by mistake . Neither could it accept that this reference should be understood as covering also the quasi - proprietorial cooperative right to an apartment .", "CARDINAL . The court finally considered that , pursuant to the DATE PERSON on ORG , eviction of a tenant , if preceded by the offer of an alternative flat , was an exception to the general rule that an owner could not evict a tenant who complied with his or her statutory duties . Accordingly , the provisions covering such exceptions could not be given an extensive interpretation .", "CARDINAL . In the same judgment ORG discontinued the proceedings in so far as they related to the withdrawn application .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . She submitted that the PERSON on the Lease of Dwellings should not have been interpreted in her case in the literal manner proposed by ORG . She argued that the main objective of the provisions concerning eviction of tenants was to protect the property rights of owners . On the other hand , those provisions were also aimed at guaranteeing tenants an effective right to continued and peaceful enjoyment of accommodation and thus required the owners to secure alternative flats for them . In the light of that aim of the PERSON , the interpretation made by the court had been too restrictive . As a result , only the rights of the tenant were protected by the judgment under appeal , to the detriment of the owner 's rights . The applicant pointed out that the alternative lodging which she had offered PERSON made it possible for her to enjoy peaceful accommodation . The purpose of the provision applied in the case was essentially to secure the position of tenant in an alternative dwelling and to prevent him or her being evicted from it . The apartment offered by the applicant guaranteed such certainty , notwithstanding the fact that she did not own that apartment , but had another right in rem to it , close in its nature to ownership . For those reasons the applicant considered that the dismissal of her eviction application , which made it impossible for her to live in her own apartment , amounted to an infringement of her property rights .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also resubmitted a declaration of the housing co - operative by which it had agreed that the applicant 's apartment be let to PERSON until DATE , i.e. until the time - limit set by the DATE Law on Lease of Dwellings for the prolongation of the system of protected tenancies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( s\u0105d okr\u0119gowy ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It pointed out that the underlying purpose of a law could be examined as an aid to its interpretation only if an analysis of a literal meaning of its text proved ineffective . Having regard to the clear wording of the provision at issue and to an unequivocal reference to ' ownership ' of the alternative accommodation , the court found that this was not the case . The provision on which ORG had relied conferred special rights on the owner , in that she was entitled to offer alternative accommodation to the tenant who had been fully complying with the conditions of the tenancy contract . These special rights could not be interpreted in an open - ended manner to the detriment of the tenant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal against the judgment of DATE , as it was not provided for by law in that case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed her appeal against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE on , under successive acts of housing legislation , housing matters were subject to state control . The most important characteristics of this system , called the ' special lease scheme ' under the provisions of LAW , was that tenancy contracts were created by administrative decisions . For all practical purposes , such decisions replaced civil law contracts between landlords and tenants . Under this system owners could not choose their tenants as they were imposed by the administrative authorities , tenants paid controlled rent and owners could not terminate leases by giving notice on a tenancy contract .", "CARDINAL . The \u201c special lease scheme \u201d was abolished by the Law of DATE on ORG . However , the system of protected tenancies was maintained in that the PERSON provided for protection against termination of leases concluded on the basis of administrative decisions .", "CARDINAL . Under transitional provisions of this PERSON , protected tenancies which had originated in administrative decisions given in the past under the special lease scheme were to be regarded as contractual leases concluded for indefinite period and governed by the provisions of the DATE Law . Until DATE rents paid for these leases were to remain controlled .", "CARDINAL . The Law of DATE on ORG provided , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c Article CARDINAL . CARDINAL . ...
