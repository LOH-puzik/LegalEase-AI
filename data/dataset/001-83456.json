The applicant is a registered association of landowners ( pozemkov\u00e9 spolo\u010denstvo ) . It is a legal person with its registered office in LOC . It was entered in the official register with effect from DATE . PERSON , its president , lodged the application on the applicant 's behalf .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the communist regime in GPE owners of land were in most cases obliged to put their land at the disposal of ORG - owned or cooperative farms . They formally remained owners of the land but in practice had no possibility of availing themselves of the property .", "CARDINAL . Some of the land in question was , for various reasons , not cultivated by the farms . It was the ORG policy to promote the use of such land for gardening . For that purpose allotment gardens ( z\u00e1hradkov\u00e9 osady ) were established , mainly in the vicinity of urban agglomerations . Individual plots of land were put at the disposal of persons belonging to GPE ORG ( Slovensk\u00fd zv\u00e4z z\u00e1hradk\u00e1rov ) , who were allowed to cultivate the land as a pastime activity for their individual needs .", "CARDINAL . In the context of GPE 's transition to a market - oriented economy following the fall of the communist regime , ORG adopted LAW CARDINAL ( for further details concerning the relevant law and practice see point LAW below ) , the purpose of which was to mitigate certain wrongs and to improve the care of agricultural and forest land .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW CARDINAL the plots of land on which allotment gardens had been established were not to be restored in natura to the original owner where ownership of the land had passed from the original owners to the ORG or a legal person . In such cases the original owners were entitled to compensation in kind or in pecuniary form . In this category of cases the legislator gave precedence to legal certainty for the existing users of the property , as the use of land for gardening was considered to be of greater public interest than restoring the land in natura to its original owners .", "CARDINAL . In the second category of cases , where the original owners maintained their ownership rights , albeit in name only ( nuda proprietas ) , LAW DATE established conditions enabling the owners to enjoy their property rights to a greater extent . In particular , it provided for the land to be let to the existing users , with a notice period expiring on the date when the temporary right to use the land came to an end . The tenants were , however , entitled to have the lease extended by DATE unless an agreement to the contrary was reached between the parties . The landowners were also entitled to request , within DATE of the coming into effect of the CARDINAL Act , the exchange of their property for a different plot of land owned by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The above approach , permitting the owners to recover full possession of their land after the expiry of DATE for which the tenants had the right to have the lease extended , was modified with the adoption of LAW . As a result , owners have only a limited possibility of terminating the lease , mainly on the grounds of the tenants ' failure to comply with their obligations . The position of the tenants has been strengthened in that they are entitled to acquire ownership of the land they use for gardening . As to the owners , Act CARDINAL gives them the right to obtain either a different plot of land or pecuniary compensation .", "CARDINAL . In introducing LAW the legislator abandoned the philosophy of giving general priority to the rights of the owners of plots of land on allotment sites and took the position that it was in the general interest that the rights of persons who had been using the land for gardening should prevail .", "CARDINAL . The land owned by the predecessors of the members of the applicant association was put at the disposal of the agricultural cooperative in GPE . The owners ' formal title to the land remained unaffected , but they had no possibility of using it in practice .", "CARDINAL .

The contract was to expire on DATE unless the parties reached an agreement on its extension . The tenant was to return the land to the lessor in its original state on termination of the lease .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the authorities approved the establishment of the \u201c GPE \u201d allotment gardens on the land in question , located in an industrial area on the outskirts of the town of PERSON . The project envisaged the apportionment of CARDINAL individual plots with a surface area of QUANTITY on which garden huts with a surface area of QUANTITY would be built . Re - cultivation of the land and communal facilities such as a road and a parking area , water supply and a fence at the allotment site 's boundaries were also planned .", "CARDINAL . The local branch of the gardening association subsequently concluded separate contracts with its members . Individual plots of land were thereby put at the latter 's disposal until DATE . The gardeners obtained a permit to build huts . Unless the lease contract was extended before DATE , the huts were to be entirely removed by the gardeners .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the present members of the applicant association inherited the title to the land where the GPE allotment gardens had been established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association submitted a draft rent contract to a representative of the gardening association . On CARDINAL DATE the president of the PERSON allotments rejected the proposal as being unacceptable . Reference was made to negotiations about a DATE contract under Act CARDINAL pending a decision on the ownership of the land .", "CARDINAL . DATE the Tren\u010d\u00edn municipality charged the applicant CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL NORP korunas ( SKK ) DATE in real property tax in respect of the land used by the gardeners . The tax was based on municipal regulations fixing the tax on gardens at SKK QUANTITY per square metre .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant submitted copies of bank statements indicating that GPE and ORG had paid to it , following the entry into force of Act CARDINAL , SKK CARDINAL as a yearly rent for the use of QUANTITY of land . That amount corresponds to FAC per square QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . The applicant association unsuccessfully attempted to recover possession of the land . For that purpose it offered to compensate the gardeners for their existing property attached to the land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the allotment gardeners initiated proceedings under LAW with a view to having the ownership of the land transferred to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the request to start proceedings under LAW . ORG upheld this decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an action which the vice - president of the applicant association and several other persons had lodged against the above decision of ORG . ORG found that the statutory requirements for bringing proceedings under sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW had been met .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE made public the consolidation project pursuant to LAW CARDINAL . The president of the applicant association as well as all the other landowners whose address was known were notified of the project and informed that the data contained therein could be challenged within DATE .", "CARDINAL . The letter stated , in particular , that CARDINAL part of the applicant 's land ( QUANTITY ) had been valued at FAC per square metre and the other part ( QUANTITY ) at FAC per square metre . The major part of the land to be provided to the applicant in compensation was valued at SKK QUANTITY . The valuation had been carried out in accordance with the relevant administrative regulation . It was based on the classification of the land and its quality at the time when the tenants had acquired the right to use the land .", "CARDINAL . Some of the allotment gardeners submitted their comments on the project . The authorities approved the project on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a decision was issued to carry out the consolidation project . On DATE ORG in GPE dismissed the appeal lodged by the landowners .", "CARDINAL . The gardeners subsequently paid the purchase price for the QUANTITY of the applicant 's land to ORG . On DATE the applicant association received QUANTITY of different land in compensation . On DATE ORG in GPE approved the manner in which the consolidation project had been implemented . Its decision became final on DATE . On DATE the ownership of the relevant plots of land passed formally to the persons involved .", "CARDINAL . The zoning plan in respect of the area in which the GPE allotments are situated was approved in DATE . It indicates that the whole area forms part of a \u201c production and services zone \u201d . The zoning plan does not foresee that the land on the allotment site will be used for its current purpose in the future . At present an industrial park is in the process of being established in the vicinity of the allotments . The land within the allotment site has not been included in the project at this stage .", "CARDINAL . According to information in the land register , CARDINAL gardeners from the GPE allotments sold their plots to other persons DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE , at the ORG 's request , explained that the PERSON allotment gardens in GPE were situated on land which , at the time of their establishment , had been derelict and had served as a municipal dump . The surface area of the applicant 's land which fell under LAW was QUANTITY . The surface area of the land which the applicant had received in compensation was smaller as it was arable land of higher quality and value . The document further indicated that the value of the applicant 's land taken into account in the consolidation proceedings had been the value on DATE when the allotments were established . The same regulation relating to the value of real property for administrative purposes had been applied in valuing the substitute land .", "CARDINAL . In DATE CARDINAL of the representatives of the applicant association sold to a company a plot of land in the vicinity of the GPE allotments for SKK CARDINAL per square metre . Prior to the sale , an expert had valued the land at SKK FAC . On DATE , the same company offered to buy different plots belonging to the applicant association in the area for SKK QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , at the ORG 's request , an expert established the value on DATE of both the land on the allotment site and the land which the applicant association had received in compensation . The expert calculated the value for general purposes of the land on the allotment site at SKK CARDINAL per square metre . The location of the land in an industrial zone increased its value considerably according to the opinion .", "CARDINAL . The same expert assessed the general value of the other plot of land at SKK CARDINAL.CARDINAL per square metre . The opinion stated that the substitute plot of land was situated between a motorway and a slip road and that a highvoltage line was erected above it . As a result , multiple restrictions applied to the use of the plot . No construction activity was envisaged in the area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a different expert , at the ORG 's request , established the value in DATE of the applicant 's land at SKK CARDINAL , or QUANTITY . The expert calculated the value of the land on DATE at SKK CARDINAL , that is , CARDINAL per square metre . The gardeners ' investments ( huts , fence , wells , permanent vegetation , etc . ) were tentatively valued at SKK CARDINAL per square metre of land in DATE . The general value of the land including the gardeners ' investments was thus SKK QUANTITY . Finally , the expert assessed the general value in DATE of the arable land which the applicant association had obtained in compensation at SKK CARDINAL per square metre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the applicant 's request , a private company assessed the value on DATE of the applicant 's land on the allotment site at FAC . That sum corresponds to approximately SKK QUANTITY . In a document dated DATE , at the applicant 's request , the company in question submitted comments on the above opinion of DATE . The view was expressed that the expert 's conclusion was probably not in line with local market prices . Plots of land similar to those used by the gardeners , including gardeners ' investments , were most frequently sold for CARDINAL and QUANTITY , whereas free plots of land outside allotments were being sold at FAC per square metre in that area . The use of the land by gardeners had rather a negative impact on its general value . Land in the area in question could be let out for CARDINAL per square metre yearly , its value for general purposes being between SKK CARDINAL and QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL .

Gardening served as relaxation and provided a partial supply of fruit and vegetables to CARDINAL town dwellers in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the report , there was a public interest in land consolidation in GPE . In that context , it was in the general interest to transfer the ownership of land in allotment gardens to the existing tenants as it would provide greater legal certainty for both the gardeners and the owners .", "CARDINAL . The tenants would obtain ownership of the land which they used and would not risk losing the surplus value which they had added to the land through their work and investments . As to the owners , they were likely to continue to have their rights to avail themselves of the property restricted for a considerable period of time ; the allocation of appropriate alternative plots of land to them would resolve that problem . According to the explanatory report , compensation based on the surface area and quality of the land at the time when the owner had lost the possibility of using the land was appropriate .

GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE ) , arguing that there existed no genuine public interest in the interference with the landowners ' rights and that the compensation which the landowners were to receive under the relevant provisions of Act CARDINAL was not appropriate .", "DATE . Both petitions were examined jointly at a plenary meeting of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG concluded that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW was contrary to , inter alia , the constitutional protection of ownership rights . It dismissed the remainder of the submissions .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the regulation of relations in respect of land used for gardening in allotments mainly concerned , as in the case of restitution laws , the undoing or mitigation of the wrongs which had occurred in the past when the principle of the rule of law had not been respected . The legislator had a certain margin of appreciation when deciding on the relevant issues , provided the constitutional guarantees were upheld .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the compulsory letting of the land to the gardeners under LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL , it was merely a temporary measure pending the transfer of its ownership to the gardeners in accordance with the provision of that LAW . It pursued the aim of providing the users with legal certainty and of ensuring optimal use of the land in question with due regard to the requirements of the landscape and the environment . It was as such in the public interest . The measure was limited in duration and it was not disproportionate as it filled the gap which arose following the quashing of section GPE ) of LAW DATE . ORG , by obliging the owners to let the land to the gardeners , had not overstepped its margin of appreciation and had struck a fair balance between the general interest and the protection of individuals ' rights . Section CARDINAL was therefore not contrary to LAW or its constitutional equivalent .", "CARDINAL . As to the argument that the rent payable under LAW CARDINAL was disproportionately low , ORG held that LAW No . CARDINAL imposed on the Contracting Parties to the Convention no specific obligations as regards compensation for the use of property in the general interest . There was no appearance that the relevant provision was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiffs also argued that the transfer of ownership of the land to the gardeners under sections CARDINAL et seq . of Act MONEY was not in the general interest as it restricted the rights of the owners to the benefit of a different group of individuals without any relevant justification .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , that transfer of ownership was to be seen in the broader context of land consolidation , the purpose of which was set out in section CARDINAL of LAW DATE and in section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW DATE . Consolidation pursued the aim of setting up integrated land entities in accordance with the needs of individual owners , with their consent , and with due regard to general requirements as regards the creation of the landscape , the environment and investment development . Land consolidation was also justified with a view to adjusting the existing relations between owners and users and eliminating any obstacles which had arisen as a result of past developments . Sections CARDINAL et seq . of Act CARDINAL in no way affected the above general interest in land consolidation .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiffs further alleged that the compensation for land under LAW CARDINAL was inappropriate as it was substantially lower than the market value of the land .", "DATE . ORG noted that the owners had the choice between alternative plots of land and financial compensation . The gardeners could not be held liable and they should not be penalised for the fact that the owners had been deprived of the possibility of enjoying their property under a regime which had disregarded democratic principles . Furthermore , the users , by cultivating the land , had substantially increased its value . ORG therefore accepted as just the relevant provisions under which compensation to the owners should be based on the value of the property at the time when the gardeners had started using it . The compensation under LAW was therefore appropriate and compatible with the requirements of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG found that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW was unconstitutional as there was no justifiable public interest in transferring ownership of land to the ORG in cases where the user had failed to pay the amount due .", "CARDINAL . In a separate opinion CARDINAL judges stated that the compulsory letting under LAW CARDINAL was unconstitutional and that the compensation payable under LAW was not appropriate as it was based on the value of the property at the time when the gardeners had acquired the right to use the land .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting judges expressed the view that the parties to proceedings under LAW were in an unequal position . In particular , the applicable law did not permit the administrative authorities or courts called upon to review their decisions to balance the interests of the persons involved , assess whether the transfer of ownership was justified or examine the question whether the compensation provided to the owner was appropriate .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with its established practice , the Constitutional Court lacks jurisdiction to examine a complaint lodged by natural or legal persons when the determination of the point in issue involves the preliminary question of conflict of legal rules ( see , for example , I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE ; II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE ; NORP . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , decision of DATE ; or PERSON . \u00daS CARDINAL , decision of CARDINAL DATE ) .
