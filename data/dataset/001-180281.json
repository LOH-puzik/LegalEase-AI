IRELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Reasonable time);Violation of Article 13+6-1 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy) (Article 6 - Right to a fair trial;Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Reasonable time)", "JUDGES": "Nona Tsotsoria;S\u00edofra O\u2019Leary", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . She has been receiving treatment for a pituitary brain tumour since DATE . In DATE , she underwent surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible . In DATE she received a variety of treatments for her condition . In DATE she became the patient of PERSON , a consultant endocrinologist . He referred her for an MRI scan of the tumour , performed DATE , and monitored her condition in DATE . In DATE , at the request of PERSON , the applicant underwent another MRI scan . This indicated that there had in fact been no significant change since DATE , but the tumour remained large . The applicant also underwent CARDINAL types of test to determine her level of growth hormone .", "CARDINAL . Dr B received the result of the first test on DATE . He spoke by phone with the applicant , telling her that the tumour was very unsatisfactory . Prior to that conversation , the applicant was under the belief that the operation in DATE had removed almost the entire tumour . She therefore understood the information given to her by Dr B about the tumour to mean that it was growing rapidly , gravely endangering her health .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was prescribed a newly - available drug to treat her condition , to be injected by her general practitioner on a DATE basis from DATE . As the drug led to severe gastrointestinal side effects within a short time , Dr B reduced the dosage by half . It appears there were no side effects following the injections of DATE and DATE . At DATE the applicant was unwell , and was hospitalised in DATE suffering from vomiting , diarrhoea , severe exhaustion , headaches , cramps and muscular spasms in her arms and legs . A blood test indicated that she was also severely hypothyroid . It was later established that this was a side - effect of the drug , not known at the time .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had further discussions with Dr B about her condition and treatment . Dr B proposed to defer the next injection until DATE . The applicant received CARDINAL more injections , in DATE . From DATE she became the patient of another endocrinologist .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant commenced civil proceedings in ORG against PERSON and the hospital . Her case in negligence was that PERSON B had failed in his duty of care towards her in the prescribing of the drug and the monitoring of its administration to her . She further argued that her consent to the treatment was vitiated for lack of sufficient information , or for misinformation , about her condition and the appropriateness of the medication proposed to her .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s statement of claim was served on the defendants in DATE . Dr B entered his defence in DATE , seeking further and better particulars from the applicant , which the applicant \u2019s solicitor provided in DATE . The hospital entered its defence in DATE , and also sought further and better particulars .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , DATE TIME motions seeking various forms of interim relief were brought before ORG and decided in relation to the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the case was included in a procedure before a judge of the ORG known as a \u201c positive callover \u201d . The purpose of this was to assign hearing dates to cases that had already been waiting for a considerable period of time . A hearing date in DATE was set for the case .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitor replied to the request for further and better particulars made by the second defendant in DATE . The hearing commenced on DATE and took place over DATE . CARDINAL expert witnesses appeared for the applicant and CARDINAL for the defence . The hearing concluded on DATE . Judgment was given on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The High Court ruled against the applicant on all grounds . The judge preferred the evidence given by the witnesses appearing on behalf of the defence , deeming their qualifications to be more relevant to this specialised area than those of the experts retained by the applicant . He found that Dr B had complied with the therapeutic indications on the data sheet of the drug . The doctor \u2019s decision to place the applicant directly on the long - acting form of the drug was supported by the expert opinion given on his behalf . The judge did not accept that Dr B had failed to monitor adequately the effects of the drug on the applicant during DATE that she received it . Likewise , he rejected the claim that the doctor had failed in his duty of care in the manner in which he had explained the proposed course of treatment to the applicant and the possible side effects .", "CARDINAL . On the question of consent , the judge considered that while the applicant had misunderstood the exact state of her tumour , this was not to be blamed upon PERSON , who had fulfilled his legal duty by giving her accurate and appropriate information about her condition . The applicant \u2019s mistaken impression was neither caused nor contributed to by the doctor \u2019s explanations . He found that Dr B had not been aware of the applicant \u2019s misunderstanding and could not be blamed for the deficiencies in her knowledge of her condition . Moreover , he had given sufficient warning to the applicant regarding the gastro - intestinal side effects of the drug . Other potential side - effects ( gallstones , hepatic dysfunction ) had not been raised , but as they had not in fact materialised there were no grounds for complaint . The judge concluded that the applicant had given her valid , informed consent to the treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment , advancing numerous grounds . The appeal was filed on DATE . It remained pending before ORG until it was transferred to the newly - established ORG on DATE . The hearing of the appeal took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . ORG addressed CARDINAL issues . First , regarding the treatment of the applicant with the particular drug , it saw no basis to criticise the findings of the trial judge . His preference for the evidence of the GPE experts was rationally grounded , and his rejection of the applicant \u2019s criticisms of PERSON was based on careful consideration of the evidence .", "CARDINAL . Second , on the issue of consent , ORG reviewed the evidence about what Dr B knew of the applicant \u2019s understanding of her condition . It rejected her claim that ORG had made a clear error on this point . It considered that PERSON actions had been in keeping with the relevant domestic legal principles . It noted that PERSON opinion at the time was that the applicant had a serious condition that required treatment . As surgery was not possible , the only alternative was medication . It was , ORG held , reasonably open to him to hold that view . He had explained to the applicant the expected benefits of the drug prescribed , as well as the unpleasant side effects . As for the argument that the doctor should have also presented a \u201c do nothing \u201d option , ORG described this as \u201c somewhat unreal \u201d . Where a person seeks referral from a general practitioner to a specialist , it could be reasonably assumed that they wished to receive treatment , and that they had excluded the non - treatment option .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal . On DATE ORG refused ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
