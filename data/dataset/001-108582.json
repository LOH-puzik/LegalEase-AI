A word that presupposes respect . But how out of place coming from the mouth of a father who kicked his CARDINAL-year - old daughter with his bare feet until several of her ribs were broken .

Its text is identical to the above article .", "CARDINAL . On DATE C , represented by ORG , filed a claim for compensation against the first applicant company , relying on section FAC of LAW on the ground that the first applicant company had caused her suffering by revealing her identity as the victim of a criminal offence by publishing her first name , the full names and pictures of A and B in CARDINAL articles which had appeared on CARDINAL and DATE . C also filed a compensation claim against the second applicant company relying on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW for revealing her identity as the victim of a criminal offence and for violating her right to protection of her strictly private life ( h\u00f6chstpers\u00f6nlicher PERSON ) in CARDINAL articles published on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) granted both requests for compensation . As regards the first applicant company it found that the CARDINAL articles published in the newspaper ORG on DATE and DATE had violated ORG right to protection of her identity as the victim of a criminal offence under section ORG of LAW and ordered the first applicant company to pay MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation to C for each of the articles , altogether ORG CARDINAL . It also found that C was entitled to compensation from the second applicant company as the articles published on its website on CARDINAL and DATE , including photos of her , had violated her right to protection of her identity as the victim of a criminal offence and had also interfered with her strictly private life in a manner which exposed and compromised her in public , thereby breaching her rights under section CARDINAL of LAW . ORG ordered the second applicant company to pay ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation to C for each of the articles , altogether ORG CARDINAL . It also ordered the applicant companies to publish a summary of its judgment .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant ORG argument that D , C \u2019s biological mother , had consented to the disclosure of ORG identity and the publication of photos of her , ORG , having heard as witnesses D , her husband , and PERSON , a journalist writing for the applicant companies , considered that at the time of the publication of the impugned articles there had been no valid consent as neither the person with custody of C nor any other reference person ( PERSON ) had consented to the disclosure of C \u2019s identity or the publication of pictures of her . Even considering that D had validly consented to the applicant companies\u2019 reporting on the case of C and to publishing pictures of her back in DATE , that consent could not automatically cover publications DATE in the context of the trial of A and B. After such a long period of time had passed , confirmation of D \u2019s consent should have been sought as in case of doubt nobody can be deemed to have consented to an interference with his or her personality rights for an indefinite period of time . Moreover , in DATE D had explicitly refused to give her consent to reporting in which ORG identity would be revealed to the public .", "CARDINAL . As regards the compensation claim under section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG found that a person was entitled to compensation if his or her strictly private sphere had been discussed in the media in a manner which was apt to expose and compromise him or her in public . Into this strictly private sphere fall the inner circle of one \u2019s private life ( engster ORG menschlichen Intimsph\u00e4re ) , emotions and physical sensations , one \u2019s sexual life , and contacts with one \u2019s closest persons of confidence ( FAC engsten ORG ) . The lurid presentation of the publications at issue , which made public highly sensitive details of the ill - treatment and sexual abuse to which C had been subjected and which were particularly humiliating , had interfered with ORG most intimate personal sphere . In weighing the interests of the applicant companies against those of C , ORG considered that the offensive details had not been necessary for informing the reader even in a detailed manner on the case of C , while on the other hand , a minor victim of crimes of this kind was entitled to particularly strong protection . ORG concluded that ORG interests protected by LAW had not been respected and that she was therefore entitled to compensation .", "CARDINAL . As regards the compensation claim under section ORG of LAW found that by mentioning the first name of the victim , her age , the full names of the offenders , indicating their family relationship to the victim , by publishing pictures of the father and the stepmother and in CARDINAL articles even publishing photos of her , the victim became recognisable to a wide number of persons beyond the circle of those directly informed .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view there was no predominant public interest which would have made revealing the victim \u2019s identity permissible . Such a predominant public interest must relate to the identity of the person , and that particular information should have a genuine news value . A merely general interest in appropriate press reporting on criminal cases was not sufficient . C was not a public figure and the mere fact that she had become the victim of a crime which attracted considerable public attention was not sufficient to consider her a person connected with public life . Also , the fact that the media had already reported on her in DATE , in some cases revealing her identity , did not make her a person connected with public life because a considerable amount of time had passed in the meantime and a newspaper \u2019s readership changed constantly . A genuine interest in the identity of the victim could not be established . There was no predominant public interest in revealing the identity of the offenders as the public could be informed on the psychological dynamics of crimes of violence and sexual abuse committed within the family without revealing the identity of the victim . Therefore , these articles , which had described in detail the severe illtreatment of the victim , constituted an intrusion into the victim \u2019s strictly private life and violated her interest in remaining anonymous . She was therefore entitled to compensation on this ground as well .", "CARDINAL . As to the amount of the compensation , ORG stated that it had taken into account the particular gravity of the interference and the particularly large dissemination of the applicant ORG media . As regards the second applicant company , a higher amount had to be awarded as the compensation was based on CARDINAL grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant companies appealed . They argued that there had been a predominant public interest in being informed of the identity of the offenders . The role of the media as public watchdog meant in the present case that they had the task of informing the public about a defenceless child who had become the victim in a family drama and to warn the public through giving a detailed report including personal details of the offenders and the victim , which was necessary for a public discussion of these events . They argued further that the reporting had been allowed because D had given her consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It found that according to section ORG of LAW the identity of the victim of a criminal offence could only be revealed if there was a predominant public interest in that specific item of information . The permissibility of revealing the identity of an offender did not mean that the identity of the victim could also be disclosed . This question had to be examined separately and carefully . C was not a public figure nor was she a person otherwise connected with public life . Even accepting that there was a public interest in being informed of crimes of violence and sexual abuse committed within the family , that interest could be met without revealing the victim \u2019s identity . Also , the conditions for compensation under section CARDINAL of LAW had been met because the articles at issue contained a detailed description of the criminal acts committed , in particular of the injuries caused including the defloration of the victim , and thereby had discussed her strictly private life in a manner that was apt to expose and compromise her in public . As to the alleged consent of D to the applicant ORG publications , ORG found that ORG had properly examined this matter and had concluded that there had been no valid consent . Given that the maximum amount of compensation was ORG CARDINAL , the sums actually fixed were moderate .", "CARDINAL .
