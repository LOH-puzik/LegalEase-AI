Following changes in property law , this right was later transformed into the right of ownership .", "The plot is located in the municipality of ORG and registered as no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The nearest public road is FAC . Another nearby public road is FAC .", "The municipality is connected to the electricity and gas networks but has no access either to a public water supply or to sewage and water cleansing systems .", "The area where the plot is located was subject to a development plan ( zoznam pozemkov na v\u00fdstavbu ) issued in DATE under the DATE Decree on territorial - planning documentation ( Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) . This plan was later transformed into a zoning plan ( \u00fazemn\u00fd pl\u00e1n ) under LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) . It designated the relevant area for systematic individual construction of residential houses . The construction of a public road to connect FAC and FAC and a connection to the public utility system were envisaged on land that had previously been expropriated and purchased for that purpose . If constructed , the road would provide access to the LOC house and the electricity and gas networks would run CARDINAL from the house .", "Later in DATE the applicants were granted a permit to construct ( stavebn\u00e9 povolenie ) a family house on the assigned plot and commenced the construction work .", "On DATE ORG ( Obecn\u00fd \u00farad ) held a public meeting to debate the issue of the construction of the new road . The owners of all the plots concerned were invited to attend and the majority of them stated that they were not interested in having the road constructed .

The land included the plots on which the new road and the public utility connection were to be located . The sale deprived the applicants\u2019 plot of direct access to FAC . The road and utility connections envisaged in the original plan have never been constructed . Alternative solutions were explored instead ( see below ) .", "The applicants requested to be granted , by way of an administrative decision , a right of access to their plot via the plots separating their house from FAC . In a letter of DATE the ORG ( ORG \u00farad \u017eivotn\u00e9ho prostredia ) informed the applicants that in the circumstances no such right could be granted in administrative proceedings and that they should assert it in the ordinary courts .

They received a similar response from ORG in a letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "In the meantime the applicants finished the construction of their house and requested that the construction be approved ( kolauda\u010dn\u00e9 rozhodnutie ) . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG \u201c returned \u201d the request to the applicants and informed them that the construction could not be approved as , contrary to sections DATE CARDINAL of the DATE Decree on general technical requirements for constructions ( Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) , the house was not connected to the land communications or public utilities networks . There is no indication that the applicants formally pursued the request after receiving this letter .", "Since then the applicants have been unable to use the house . In order to minimise its dilapidation they have had to carry out maintenance work . They had to stay in another flat which they eventually had to sell to be able to pay the costs of maintenance of the house . At the same time , the applicants have been liable to pay real - estate ownership tax in respect of the plot of land , but not in respect of the house .", "On DATE ORG passed a resolution approving a new zoning plan for the period until DATE . It does not envisage the construction of any land communications or utilities connections in the area and is still in place .", "The applicants eventually acquired title to the property of the first applicant \u2019s family and acquired consent from the owner of another neighbouring plot which allows their plot to be connected to the gas and electricity networks from another street a distance of QUANTITY away . They had the gas and electricity connection installed at their own expense , the cost being substantially higher than it would have been under the old zoning plan .", "DATE and DATE the applicants on numerous occasions raised the issue of the construction of the access road and the connection to the public utility system with ORG ( GPE kontroly ) , ORG , ORG ( ORG \u00farad \u017eivotn\u00e9ho prostredia ) , ORG ( ORG \u00farad ) and ORG ( GPE \u017eivotn\u00e9ho prostredia ) . In response , they were informed that the matter primarily fell within the responsibility of the NORP municipal authorities and that they were free to bring their claims before a court .", "On DATE a commission convened under the auspices of ORG ( Pozemkov\u00fd \u00farad ) observed that it was the duty of the ORG municipal authorities to construct an access road to the applicants\u2019 plot of land and called on ORG to reconsider its above resolution of DATE .", "On DATE , at the ORG request , ORG lodged a complaint against the resolution of DATE . He considered that the municipality was under an obligation to construct an access road to the applicants\u2019 plot and to secure a connection to the public utility system for them . The DATE sale was arbitrary and had prevented the construction of the applicants\u2019 house from being approved . Further to the complaint , on DATE the ORG quashed the resolution of DATE but its decision was later overturned by ORG on appeal .", "On DATE the applicants brought a civil action challenging the DATE sale of the land adjacent to the applicants\u2019 plot to third parteis . On CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively the ORG and , on appeal , ORG dismissed the action .

In response the applicants applied to ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) , challenging the way in which the municipal authorities had handled their request and claiming a violation of their property rights as protected under LAW . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . It held that ORG reaction to the ORG request did not take the form of a decision and , as such , could not constitute a violation of individual rights .

ORG held that there was no legislation providing a basis for a privatelaw obligation to construct a road . The construction of roads fell within the field of construction law and , as such , could not be ordered under the general civil law .", "The applicants challenged the judgment of DATE by means of an appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) . They argued that the municipality was the sole entity responsible for the construction of local communications facilities on its territory . The applicants relied on LAW and maintained that the municipal authorities had the power to initiate expropriation proceedings in respect of the land for the access road and proceedings for establishing an easement in their favour . The applicants also relied on the protection of their property rights under LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) dismissed the appeal on points of law .
