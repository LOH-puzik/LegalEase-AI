{"ITEMID": "001-73193", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "CZE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2006, "DOCNAME": "JANATA v. THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr J. Buzalka , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the former ORG ( m\u00edstn\u00ed n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor ) assigned a CARDINAL - room flat to PERSON and his wife , PERSON , in a ORG owned apartment house .", "On DATE ORG ( bytov\u00fd podnik ) brought proceedings against PERSON and a certain Ms Z before the Prague CARDINAL ORG ( obvodn\u00ed soud ) asking that their tenancy be terminated and that PERSON and Ms Z be ordered to leave the flat . It alleged that the tenants had failed to pay the rent for DATE .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG terminated the tenancy of PERSON and Ms Z , and ordered them to leave the flat within DATE of the allocation of a substitute flat by the competent national council . The judgment was served on the parties at DATE . On DATE it became final .", "On DATE Mr X commenced divorce proceedings against Ms Y. The judgment declaring the divorce was notified to the latter at her new address in DATE . The judgment of DATE was served on her in DATE .", "In DATE the applicant became the owner of the apartment .", "On DATE he introduced a civil action in ORG , seeking a declaration that the eviction of PERSON should not be conditional on the allocation of alternative accommodation . The applicant claimed that the former tenant had not paid the rent and maintenance contributions for DATE . He submitted that the flat had been assigned to PERSON and his wife , PERSON , on DATE and that after their divorce , PERSON had been provided with a substitute flat , PERSON having continued to occupy the common flat . The applicant further submitted that ORG had terminated the tenancy of PERSON and his wife , and had ordered them to leave the flat within DATE of the allocation of a substitute flat by the competent national council .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action finding , inter alia , that the fact that PERSON owed rent for DATE , or that he had caused disorder in the house , did not substantiate the applicant \u2019s argument that the circumstances , on which the original judgment of CARDINAL DATE had been based , had changed , thereby justifying its modification .", "On DATE ORG ( m\u011bstsk\u00fd soud ) quashed the first instance judgment , finding that the former tenant \u2019s continued unlawful behaviour , which had constituted the reason for the termination of the tenancy , had to be considered as an alteration of the circumstances ( zm\u011bna pom\u011br\u016f ) on which ORG had originally based its judgment of DATE . It ordered ORG to clarify the circumstances in which PERSON had defaulted on the payment of his rent .", "On DATE ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s action on the ground that the applicant had not proved that PERSON had violated his tenancy obligations . It further held that the amount of rent which the applicant had asked PERSON to pay was contrary to the national law .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment applying , inter alia , section III(CARDINAL ) of Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL which amended LAW . The court modified , however , the reasons for the decision . It held that the judgment of DATE had not become final and could not , therefore , be modified upon the applicant \u2019s request . It found that the eviction order had not been directed against the same persons , to whom the flat had originally been allocated in DATE . It further found that Ms Y had not been a party to the DATE proceedings , and the fact that the DATE judgment had been notified to her in DATE was irrelevant .", "On DATE ORG ( Vrchn\u00ed soud ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law ( dovol\u00e1n\u00ed ) . The court , considering that the judgment of ORG was a decision which had modified the first instance judgment , applied section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) of the Code of Civil Procedure ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d , below ) . It shared ORG opinion that , if the original decision ordering the tenant \u2019s eviction upon the allocation of a substitute flat had not become final , the applicant could not evict him without alternative accommodation being provided . The court added that the relevant judgment had clearly referred to Ms Z and not PERSON , and that this had not been rectified , at least under LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed as being manifestly ill - founded the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal ( \u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost ) , in which the applicant had alleged a violation of Articles QUANTITY and LAW z\u00e1kladn\u00edch pr\u00e1v a svobod ) , as well as LAW .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) provides that a judgment , which has been duly served and which can no longer be appealed , becomes final . Once a case has been adjudicated and the decision has become final , it may not be reconsidered .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL ) , the president of a chamber may rectify anytime and , if necessary ex officio , clerical errors or any other evident incorrectness in a judgment .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) , an appeal on points of law is admissible against a judgment of an appellate court , whereby the first instance judgment was modified .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) , an appeal on points of law may be filed on the ground that a decision was based on the incorrect legal consideration of the matter .", "Section III , containing the concluding and interim provisions , provides in its sixth sub - section that final judgments ordering an eviction from an apartment which were adopted before the entry into force of this LAW , and which made the eviction conditional on the allocation of a substitute flat or other accommodation , retain their conditional nature . The beneficiary may nevertheless request a court , which is competent to execute the judgment , to modify that order and declare that the party leaving the flat should only be provided with substitute accommodation rather than a flat , or that no alternative housing need be allocated at all .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that everyone may assert his or her rights before an independent and impartial court of justice or , in specified cases , before another authority .", "Under LAW , everyone is entitled to have his or her case considered in public without unnecessary delay , in his or her presence , and to express his or her opinion on all the submitted evidence . The public may be excluded only in those cases specified by law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
