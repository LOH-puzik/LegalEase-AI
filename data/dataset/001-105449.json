NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently serving his sentence in ORG ( kazneno - popravni zavod ) . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE , GPE , found the applicant guilty of murder and illegal possession of firearms , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter this judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started serving his sentence in GPE , but on DATE and upon his own request he was transferred to the ORG , pursuant to the Agreement concluded between GPE and ORG in GPE ( hereinafter \u201c the Agreement \u201d ; see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred once again , this time to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant filed a request to be transferred back to a prison in GPE based on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Directorate for ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the Directorate \u201d ) , as a department within ORG ( see LAW at paragraph CARDINAL below ) , rejected this request , noting that it had been based on family - related and health reasons . The ORG firstly observed that the applicant had only complained about the pain in his ankles , in which respect he had been duly provided with adequate medication . Secondly , ORG had its own prison hospital and , if needed , the applicant could also be taken to other medical institutions outside of the penitentiary . Thirdly , ORG was the closest prison to GPE , which was where the applicant \u2019s family lived . Fourthly , ORG was best placed to secure the applicant \u2019s rehabilitation . Finally , the Agreement did not establish the applicant \u2019s \u201c right to be transferred \u201d to a prison of his choice . On the contrary , any transfer depended on the consent of the parties to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a fresh request to be transferred to GPE . Therein he explained that his entire family lived there and could not afford to visit him on a regular basis in LOC , nor for that matter , in view of the postal costs involved , even send him packages . The applicant further maintained that the quality of medical services provided in ORG was not adequate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected this transfer request . For the most part , it restated the reasons given on DATE , adding , inter alia , that the applicant had had regular contact with his family , albeit with some \u201c technical \u201d difficulties recently . Lastly , the ORG noted that family reasons could not be decisive in the assessment of a transfer request , and recalled that the applicant had initially been transferred from GPE upon his own request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , not having yet received the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE and relying on LAW DATE and LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , the applicant filed an appeal with the Minister of ORG wherein , inter alia , he complained about the failure of the ORG to consider his request of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having been served with the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , on DATE the applicant filed an appeal with the Minister of ORG against it . Therein he stated that : ( i ) the ORG was not competent to consider the transfer request ; ( ii ) it should instead have properly been examined by another department within ORG ; ( iii ) the ORG had not complied with the procedures set forth in the ORG ; and ( iv ) the impugned reasoning was incoherent since the applicant \u2019s family lived in GPE , QUANTITY from LOC , and had had to negotiate a certain administrative procedure whenever leaving its territory .", "CARDINAL . It would seem that on DATE the applicant filed another submission with the Minister of ORG in support of his appeal of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , and in view of the ORG \u2019s ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal of CARDINAL DATE , deeming it moot . The appeal of DATE is apparently still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant started a hunger strike , seeking his transfer to a prison in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As of CARDINAL DATE the applicant also refused to take any water .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant discontinued the strike altogether .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again started a hunger strike , seeking his transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL .

NORP However , on DATE , having received the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant decided to resume the strike , which included his refusal to take either food or water .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant thereafter apparently lost consciousness on several occasions , received an infusion and experienced kidney pains .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed his lawyer that , fearing even more serious consequences , he had started taking water and would discontinue his hunger strike shortly .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer informed the court that his client had indeed discontinued the strike altogether .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant maintained that throughout the strikes referred to above , he had been examined by the prison doctor on a DATE basis , but that when he had needed urgent medical assistance no such assistance had been provided .", "CARDINAL . The applicant seems to have also been subjected to blood tests periodically , as well as to blood pressure and weight monitoring .
