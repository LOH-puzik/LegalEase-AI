On DATE the Attorney General lodged an appeal on legal grounds with ORG against the judgments of DATE and DATE , proposing that the applicant \u2019s conviction be quashed as being unlawful and that the applicant be acquitted . On DATE ORG followed this proposal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG claiming restitution of his property . He further claimed compensation as a victim of a miscarriage of justice . On DATE ORG awarded him MONEY ( ORG ) as compensation for damage suffered as a consequence of his imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the restitution proceedings , between DATE and DATE ORG held several hearings . Moreover , given that both the confiscated car and real estate had been sold and that , therefore , only compensation was feasible , the court took expert evidence as to the value of this property . ORG prepared an opinion on that question .", "CARDINAL .
