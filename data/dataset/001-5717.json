SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Baka", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . She is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , their Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant claimed before ORG ( Pozemkov\u00fd \u00farad ) , pursuant to LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , restitution of real property which had been confiscated from a person who had been in the applicant \u2019s care . She submitted further information in support of her claim on DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicant informed ORG that an agreement on the restitution of the property had not been reached . As a result , ORG was called upon to decide on the applicant \u2019s claim in accordance with PERSON ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the claim on the ground that the applicant lacked standing to claim the restitution . The applicant sought a judicial review of this decision .", "On DATE ORG ( Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad ) quashed ORG decision as being erroneous .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG ( ORG \u00farad ) , to which the case had fallen to be examined , to decide on her claim speedily .", "On DATE ORG found , with reference to LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , that the land claimed by the applicant could not be restored as it had been transferred to other individuals . The decision further stated that on DATE proceedings had started pursuant to ORG with a view to updating documentation relating to the plots in the area concerned . ORG concluded that it would be able to decide which plots could be restored to the applicant and for which plots she could receive other property in compensation only after the relevant entries were updated and after the existing property rights in respect of the relevant plots were ascertained . It therefore stayed the proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s claim pursuant to LAW ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW pending the outcome of the administrative proceedings brought on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint in which she challenged the ORG decision to stay the proceedings . She argued that there existed no relevant documents showing that the land in question was owned by individuals . The applicant complained that she was discriminated against as other ORG restitution claims had been granted prior to the entry into force of ORG . She further complained that the persons using the land at issue were in a more favourable position as they could possibly become its owners by prescription pursuant to LAW ( CARDINAL) of ORG .", "On DATE ORG informed ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) that in DATE and in DATE the land confiscated from the applicant \u2019s relatives had been allocated to other persons . As there existed numerous lacunas in the relevant documents including the entries in the land registry , ORG considered it appropriate to ascertain the existing rights in respect of the land in question prior to deciding on the applicant \u2019s claim .", "In her submissions to ORG of DATE the applicant argued , inter alia , that the decision to stay the proceedings was contrary to LAW ( CARDINAL) ( b ) of ORG .", "On DATE ORG found that there had been no violation of the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights . It noted that the decision to stay the proceedings was of a procedural nature and that it did not determine the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . ORG referred to the documents submitted to it by ORG and held it for established that the land in question had been allocated to other persons who had thereby become its owners . In ORG view , ORG decision to stay the proceedings brought by the applicant pending the determination of the existing titles in respect of the relevant property was therefore justified .", "ORG considered it irrelevant that in other cases the existing documentation permitted to decide on similar claims without the determination of any preliminary issues . Finally , ORG found erroneous the applicant \u2019s view that her claim should have been given priority by virtue of LAW ( CARDINAL) ( b ) of ORG .", "The proceedings brought under LAW on DATE appear to be still pending .", "LAW of DATE", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) in conjunction with LAW of DATE ( PERSON o spr\u00e1vnom konan\u00ed ) provides that an administrative authority shall stay proceedings before it when other proceedings concerning a preliminary issue are pending .", "Land Ownership Act of DATE", "Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW of DATE ( PERSON o \u00faprave vlastn\u00edckych vz\u0165ahov k p\u00f4de a in\u00e9mu po\u013enohospod\u00e1rskemu majetku ) , land owned or lawfully used by individuals can not be restored .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides that in such cases other land of comparable size and quality owned by the ORG is to be transferred to the persons entitled to restitution .", "Plots Ownership Adjustment Act of DATE", "ORG of DATE ( PERSON o niektor\u00fdch opatreniach na usporiadanie vlastn\u00edctva k pozemkom ) provides for certain measures aiming at , inter alia , updating documentation concerning the size of plots and the relevant legal titles where the data available is incomplete . For this purpose , the competent administrative authorities shall bring proceedings with a view to gathering the existing data and drawing up a new inventory of the plots . After its approval by a special commission such an inventory entitles the persons concerned to have their titles formally entered in the land registry .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG provides that in the course of the proceedings an administrative authority may issue , at the proposal of a party , a decision confirming that the claimant acquired the ownership of a plot by prescription . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) of the same Section , such a claim can not be granted when the ownership of the plot is claimed by another person in the same proceedings or when it is the subject - matter of different proceedings brought , for example , under LAW .", "Complaints Act of DATE", "The Complaints Act ( Z\u00e1kon o s\u0165a\u017enostiach ) was enacted on DATE and entered into force on DATE .
