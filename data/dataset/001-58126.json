{"ITEMID": "001-58126", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 1997, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF HELLE v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "N. Valticos;Pieter Van Dijk;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , PERSON PERSON , is a retired verger of the NORP - Lutheran parish of ORG . According to the applicant his family have for CARDINAL generations provided a verger to the parish .", "CARDINAL . Although he had performed duties for the parish since DATE , it was only on DATE that a decision ( hereinafter , \u201c the DATE decision \u201d ) was taken by ORG ( kirkkovaltuusto , kyrkofullm\u00e4ktige ) to establish officially the post of verger and to confirm the applicant as the verger ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In creating the post , ORG noted that ORG ( kirkkohallintokunta ) had proposed that the verger be paid PERCENT of the salary on the Grade CARDINAL salary scale for employees of ORG . However ORG ultimately decided that the verger \u2019s post was to be considered as the main occupation ( p\u00e4\u00e4toimi ) of the post holder and the holder remunerated according to Grade ACARDINAL of the salary scale . In salary terms , this in fact amounted to the same level of remuneration as suggested by ORG . However , there was no indication as to whether it was a full - time or part - time post . ORG further decided that Mr GPE , as the post holder , should not be remunerated for the performance of any extra duties and that he should be authorised , as was proposed by ORG , to manage a funeral home .", "CARDINAL . As from DATE a new collective agreement for ORG employees came into force . Under that agreement a new salary scheme was introduced under which salaries were fixed in respect of the various posts and the terminology was clarified so that a main occupation of a ORG employee could henceforth either be full - time or part - time . The new salary system was applied in DATE to ORG employees of the parish of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision taken on DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the DATE decision \u201d ) in the context of the application of the new collective agreement arrangements to its employees , ORG ( ( kirkkoneuvosto , kyrkor\u00e5det ) noted that the decision of ORG of DATE creating the post of verger ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) did not specify whether that post was full - time or part - time . The view was taken that since ORG at the relevant time had proposed that PERSON GPE be granted permission to manage a funeral home it was probable that his post was a part - time main occupation .", "ORG confirmed that the verger \u2019s TIME were thirtyfive DATE and that his salary was PERCENT of that payable to a full - time verger on the revised salary scales . The applicant \u2019s salary however remained the same as before . Further , ORG authorised Mr GPE to manage a funeral home alongside his duties as verger .", "CARDINAL . From the moment of taking up his employment as verger , the applicant carried out his duties on the understanding that his post was in fact a full - time one . He was never informed of the DATE decision and its implications were not apparent to him since he continued to receive the same salary and to work TIME per week .", "CARDINAL . It was only in DATE when he enquired about his pension rights that he reached the conclusion that ORG had in DATE considered his post to be part - time and that some of his salary - related entitlements including pension rights were as a consequence lower than those of a full - time post holder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the DATE decision to ORG claiming arrears of salary owed to him as a full - time parish verger and other lost benefits .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG noted that , according to the decision of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , PERSON PERSON \u2019s post was a part - time main occupation . ORG considered that it was not legally obliged to grant the applicant any pecuniary benefits in addition to those he already received on the basis of the DATE decision of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It nevertheless decided on an ex gratia basis that the applicant should be paid the difference between his part - time salary and a full - time salary as from DATE . It also increased his pension benefits and awarded him a compensatory lump sum .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had also lodged an appeal with ORG ( tuomiokapituli , domkapitlet ) of the Helsinki Diocese ( hiippakunta , stift ) , complaining that ORG DATE decision amounted to a unilateral change by ORG to the nature of his post and had prejudiced him financially . Under section CARDINAL of the Church Act DATE ( kirkkolaki , kyrkolag CARDINAL ) , the Cathedral Chapter acted as \u201c a court of first instance \u201d in cases concerning salary claims of parish officials .", "On DATE , following ORG decision of DATE , the applicant lodged a supplementary appeal with ORG , complaining about the low level of the benefits granted to him in that decision and claiming , inter alia , compensation .", "CARDINAL . The Cathedral Chapter joined the CARDINAL appeals . In its decision of DATE it stated that the applicant had locus standi and that the appeal could not be considered as time - barred since the applicant had not been notified of the DATE decision as required by NORP law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As regards the merits , ORG noted that , in its opinion , the DATE decision of ORG was primarily a decision on TIME for the verger \u2019s post . It had not been possible to ascertain from the documents produced in the case whether the post in question was created in DATE as a full - time or part - time main occupation . In any event , ORG lacked the competence to convert a full - time post into a part - time one since ORG was solely competent in DATE to take such a decision . On the other hand , ORG specification of the working TIME for the post had been the basis for the revised method of calculating salaries under the new collective agreement arrangements .", "On these grounds the Cathedral Chapter found that the DATE decision had not altered the applicant \u2019s post from a full - time to a part - time one . In view of the fact that the parish had sole competence to decide on TIME for a post , ORG dismissed the verger \u2019s appeal in that regard . It further considered that it was not competent to examine his claims for compensation and dismissed this part of the appeal without examining the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the Cathedral Chapter \u2019s decision to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , claiming that the decisions of ORG , ORG and ORG should be repealed and that he should be compensated for the financial loss suffered since DATE through not being recognised as a full - time verger .", "At ORG request , ORG submitted on CARDINAL DATE an opinion in which it stated that the appeal should be rejected . The applicant filed his comments on the opinion on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , without having held an oral hearing , upheld the Cathedral Chapter \u2019s decision as regards the effects of the DATE decision , finding no reason to alter it . On the other hand , ORG considered that ORG did have jurisdiction to examine the dispute regarding his compensation claim and therefore referred the case back for fresh examination .", "The Cathedral Chapter \u2019s decision of DATE was appended to the decision of ORG but the latter decision did not refer to ORG opinion or to the applicant \u2019s comments thereon .", "CARDINAL . In a fresh appeal of CARDINAL DATE to ORG the applicant maintained his previous complaints in respect of both the DATE decision and the level of compensation set by the earlier decision of ORG . Moreover , he maintained that in the event of ORG not being satisfied that his post had been full - time since its creation , he requested LAW to hold an oral hearing and hear witnesses on the matter .", "In this connection , the applicant submitted a written statement by CARDINAL former members of ORG who had participated in the creation of his post in DATE . In their view , ORG had been aware of the fact that the anticipated number of TIME clearly sufficed for the purposes of a full - time post and it had therefore rejected a proposal to establish a part - time post .", "The applicant also submitted a written statement of his trade union to the effect that the parish had never contested the fact that he had worked TIME per week , although he had only been paid a salary based on TIME . The fact that he had ( in DATE ) been granted permission to have a secondary occupation ( to manage a funeral home ) had not entitled the parish to amend his employment contract unilaterally .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of CARDINAL DATE the Cathedral Chapter took account of the various written statements submitted in support of the applicant \u2019s claims . Having regard to the evidence adduced and to the fact that it had not been possible to submit further evidence concerning his working TIME especially as the applicant had a secondary occupation closely related to his duties as verger , ORG upheld the decision of ORG of DATE and rejected his other claims for compensation for lack of sufficient evidence . The applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing was not mentioned in the decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG against the decision of ORG , claiming that the compensation had been fixed at too low a level .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Cathedral Chapter , at the request of ORG , submitted a further opinion to the court in which it stated that the applicant \u2019s appeal should be rejected . The applicant filed his comments on the opinion on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without holding an oral hearing , upheld the Cathedral Chapter \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , finding no reason to alter it . The decision referred to section CARDINALb of the Church Act DATE as well as to the Regulations on Posts and Salaries of the parish as adopted by ORG in DATE . According to section CARDINALb the terms of employment for posts within ORG were to be specified in regulations adopted by ORG ( kirkolliskokous , kyrko - m\u00f6tet ) , to the extent that they were not indicated in already existing regulations and collective agreements .", "The decision of the Cathedral Chapter of CARDINAL DATE was appended to the decision of ORG but the latter decision did not refer to ORG opinion or to the applicant \u2019s comments thereon .", "CARDINAL . Under the Church Act DATE ( kirkkolaki , kyrkolag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) a decision by ORG could be appealed against to ORG by any person claiming that the decision entailed a violation of his or her private rights ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) as in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . The Cathedral Chapter is both an administrative and a judicial body of the LOC ( section CARDINAL ) . At the relevant time its members included the ORG , as the chair , CARDINAL ORG assessors and CARDINAL legal assessor . CARDINAL of the ORG assessors was ORG ( tuomiokirkko - seurakunnan tuomiorovasti , domkyrkof\u00f6rsamlingens domprost ) and also Vice - Chairman of ORG . The CARDINAL others were elected by the priests and curates of the LOC from among its permanent priests . The ORG assessors sat for DATE . As long as they were priests in the same parish or parish confederation they could not sit on FAC CARDINAL periods . The legal assessor was a lawyer appointed by ORG ( sections DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The statutory rules on the disqualification of judges extended to the members of ORG ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . Before taking up their duties , the members had to swear a judicial oath ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In determining cases brought before it , the Cathedral Chapter was to base itself on the case file . If it was deemed necessary to hear witnesses , evidence was to be taken by an ordinary court of first instance on request by ORG submitted via ORG ( section CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE the CARDINAL Act was replaced by the DATE LAW ( kirkkolaki , kyrkolag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) which expressly provides that ORG may hold oral hearings ( LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINALhallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslag DATE \u201c the DATE LAW , which entered into force on DATE ) ORG must hold an oral hearing if a private party has requested this , but may nevertheless refuse this in certain circumstances ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The instrument of ratification of the Convention deposited by ORG on DATE contained the following reservation , made in accordance with LAW , in respect of the right to a public hearing guaranteed by LAW :", "\u201c For the time being , GPE can not guarantee a right to an oral hearing insofar as the current NORP laws do not provide such a right .
