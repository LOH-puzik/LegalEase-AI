The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ( \u201c the Council \u201d ) approved guidelines for the operation and management of ORG . The ORG tape recordings would be retained initially for DATE , this period to be reviewed from time to time and reduced to a minimum , and the tapes would be erased on completion of the storage period . In the section headed \u201c privacy to neighbouring properties \u201d , it was noted that the ORG system should ensure adequate provision for the avoidance of unwarranted intrusion in areas surrounding those under surveillance . In the event of it becoming apparent that privacy was being violated , it was foreseen that the ORG would take such steps as to ensure that \u201c either an electronic ( digital ) screening or physical screening is taking place \u201d . In DATE the ORG installed a ORG surveillance system in GPE . It was fully operational by DATE . The ORG 's monitoring operator had a direct visual and audio link to the police so that if it was considered that an incident warranting police intervention was taking place , the images being captured could be switched through to the police .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was suffering from depression as a result of personal and family circumstances . On DATE at TIME he walked alone down the high street towards a central junction in the centre of GPE with a kitchen knife in his hand and he attempted to commit suicide by cutting his wrists . He stopped at the junction and leaned over a railing facing the traffic with the knife in his hand . He was unaware that a ORG camera , mounted on the traffic island in front of the junction , filmed his movements . The ORG footage later disclosed did not show the applicant cutting his wrists , the operator being solely alerted to an individual in possession of a knife at the junction .", "CARDINAL . The police were notified by the ORG operator and arrived . They took the knife from the applicant , gave him medical assistance and brought him to the police station . He was detained under LAW DATE . His custody record refers to the self - inflicted injuries to his wrists on arrival and notes that he was examined and treated by a doctor , after which he was released without charge and taken home by police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG working party of the ORG agreed to authorise the release of regular press features on the ORG system . The ORG also decided to cooperate with third parties in the preparation of factual programmes concerning their ORG system .", "CARDINAL . The ORG 's first press feature , ORG , was released on CARDINAL DATE and included CARDINAL photographs taken from the ORG footage of the applicant to accompany an article entitled \u201c Defused \u2013 The partnership between ORG and the police prevents a potentially dangerous situation \u201d . The applicant 's face was not specifically masked . The article noted that an individual had been spotted with a knife in his hand , that he was clearly unhappy but not looking for trouble , that the police had been alerted , that the individual had been disarmed and brought to the police station where he was questioned and given assistance for his problems . The article included the name of a ORG employee in the event that readers wished to obtain copies of the pictures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG used a photograph of the incident involving the applicant on its front page to accompany an article on the use and benefits of the ORG system . The applicant 's face was not specifically masked .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an article entitled \u201c Gotcha \u201d appeared in ORG , a local newspaper with a circulation of CARDINAL . The article was accompanied by a photograph of the applicant taken from the ORG footage . The newspaper article referred to the applicant having been intercepted with a knife and a potentially dangerous situation being defused as a result of the ORG system . It was noted that the applicant had been released without charge .", "CARDINAL . As a result ORG sought , and the ORG provided , footage of the incident involving the applicant . On DATE extracts from that footage were included in its news programme about the ORG system , a local broadcast to an average audience of CARDINAL . The applicant 's face had been masked at the ORG 's oral request . However , that masking was later considered inadequate by ORG ( see below ) , the applicant 's distinctive hairstyle and moustache making him easily recognisable to anyone who knew him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chairman of ORG informed ORG that cooperation had been , and would continue to be , given in the preparation of factual documentary programmes concerning the ORG system . He referred to the feature on ORG which had been broadcast by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE or DATE the applicant became aware that he had been filmed on ORG and that footage had been released because a neighbour told his partner that the former had seen him on television . He did not take any action then as he was still suffering from severe depression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a second article entitled \u201c Eyes in the sky triumph \u201d was published in ORG outlining the benefits of ORG in the fight against crime and was accompanied by the same photograph as had been previously used by that newspaper . It appears that a number of people recognised the applicant . A letter of DATE from the ORG opined that the applicant was not identifiable . ORG did not decide whether or not the applicant was identifiable from the photograph ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . At or about that time the ORG agreed to furnish ORG footage of , inter alios , the applicant to the producers of \u201c Crime Beat \u201d , a series on ORG national television with an average of CARDINAL viewers . ORG imposed orally a number of conditions on the producers including that no one should be identifiable in the footage and that all faces should be masked . The ORG were also to consult with the police to ensure that they had \u201c no objection to recordings being shown because of sub judice issues \u201d .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was told by friends that they had seen him on DATE in trailers for an episode of \u201c Crime Beat \u201d which was to be broadcast soon . On DATE he complained to the ORG about the forthcoming programme , at which stage the ORG became aware of his identity . The ORG contacted the producers who confirmed that his image had been masked . That evening the ORG footage was shown on \u201c Crime Beat \u201d . The applicant 's image was masked in the main programme itself but ORG ( see below ) later found that masking inadequate . Many of the applicant 's friends and family who saw the programme recognised the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In response to the applicant 's request for a copy of the ORG 's licence agreement with the producers of \u201c Crime Beat \u201d , by letter dated DATE , the ORG provided an unsigned and undated agreement which did not appear to relate to the applicant but which contained a requirement to mask all faces in any copies of the relevant video . By letter dated DATE the ORG confirmed that it could not locate a signed copy of the agreement with the producers but it included an earlier draft of that agreement which had been signed by the producers , which related to the footage of the applicant but which did not include any masking requirement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made a number of media appearances thereafter to speak out against the publication of the footage and photographs . On DATE he participated in a national radio programme ( ORG CARDINAL ) . On DATE he spoke to a journalist who published an article in a national newspaper and this was the first time the applicant 's name appeared in the media . Other newspaper articles included photographs of the applicant or quotes given by him . He also appeared on national television : on DATE on ORG \u201c Right to Reply \u201d , on DATE on ORG \u201c GPE and on DATE on ORG CARDINAL 's \u201c You Decide \u201d . He also had his photograph published in ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with the ORG in relation to , inter alia , the \u201c Crime Beat \u201d programme alleging an unwarranted infringement of his privacy and that he had received unjust and unfair treatment . On DATE the ORG upheld both of his complaints .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted that the ORG had already accepted that it had meant to mask the applicant 's image and that this had not been done in the trailer due to an oversight . The ORG also considered the masking during the programme inadequate as the applicant had been recognised by viewers who had not seen the trailer . It was accepted that the ORG had not intended that the applicant would be identifiable . However , the ORG found that the effect was to reveal to the applicant 's family , friends and neighbours an episode which he did not wish to reveal , and that the outcome had been distressing and amounted to an unwarranted infringement of his privacy . The ORG added that the fact that the applicant later chose to speak publicly about this incident did not alter the infringement established . The ORG was directed to broadcast a summary of the adjudication of the ORG with the episode of \u201c Crime Beat \u201d on DATE and a summary of the adjudication was also published in ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the ORG in respect of the broadcast by ORG . The latter had already apologised to the applicant and conceded that it had breached the privacy requirements of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( sections concerning coverage of events in public and scenes of suffering and distress ) . The ORG noted that the implication was that a man carrying a knife was likely to be intent on a criminal act . It found that the applicant 's identity was not adequately obscured and that he was readily identifiable and easily recognisable by those who knew him . It found that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW had been breached and the decision of the ORG was published in its ORG and Interventions Report of DATE . Given the admission and apology by ORG , no further action was taken by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the ORG in respect of the articles published in ORG . The ORG rejected the applicant 's complaint without a hearing and the decision was communicated to the applicant by letter dated DATE . The ORG considered that , whether or not the applicant was identifiable from the photographs , the events in question took place in a town high street , open to public view . It did not consider that the juxtaposition of the photographs and the articles implied that the applicant had committed a crime and it had been made clear that he was released without charge , the second article indicating that the applicant was ill at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for leave to apply for judicial review of the ORG 's disclosure of the ORG material arguing , inter alia , that that disclosure had no basis in law . On DATE a single judge of ORG refused leave . On DATE the High Court granted leave on a renewed request and leave to amend the application to include a complaint that the disclosure was irrational , even if lawful .", "CARDINAL . By judgment dated DATE ORG rejected the application for judicial review . It found that the purpose of section CARDINAL of ORG \u201c the DATE LAW ) was to empower a local authority to provide ORG equipment in order to promote the prevention of crime or the welfare of victims of crime :", "\u201c By publicising information about the successful operation of the ORG , the ORG was providing information about its effectiveness and thereby reinforcing the deterrent effect of its operation . The making available to the media of footage from the ORG film to show the effectiveness of the system can properly be said ... to be incidental to and to facilitate the discharge of the ORG 's function under LAW [ of LAW ] because it thereby increased , or tended to increase , the preventative effect of the equipment which [ the ORG was ] providing for the purposes of the prevention of crime . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It concluded that the ORG had the power to distribute the ORG footage to the media by virtue of section CARDINAL of LAW DATE in the discharge of their functions under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . As to the \u201c rationality \u201d of the ORG 's decision to disclose , the applicant submitted that the ORG acted irrationally in disclosing the footage with the aim of crime prevention when he had not been , in fact , involved in any criminal activity . He argued that by failing to consult the police to see if he had been charged with a criminal offence and to impose sufficient restrictions as regards disclosure of his identity , the ORG had facilitated an unwarranted invasion of his privacy which was contrary to the spirit , if not the letter , of the ORG 's guidelines .", "CARDINAL . The High Court judge had some sympathy with that submission but did not consider it correct in law . He went on :", "\u201c I have some sympathy with the applicant who has suffered an invasion of his privacy , as is borne out by the findings of ORG and ORG . However , if I am right in deciding that the ORG does have power to distribute the film footage from its ORG system , there may on occasion be undesirable invasions of privacy . Unless and until there is a general right of privacy recognised by LANGUAGE law ( and the indications are that there may soon be so by incorporation of ORG into our law ) , reliance must be placed on effective guidance being issued by Codes of practice or otherwise , in order to try and avoid such undesirable invasions of a person 's privacy .", "The evidence is that the ORG cameras in public places play an important role in both crime prevention and crime detection . In this case , the film footage showed a man walking in the High Street carrying a large knife in his hand . It did not show him attempting to commit suicide . It was plainly a potentially dangerous situation which the ORG 's monitoring employee quite properly put to the police , as a result of which the man was arrested . ... It was not unreasonable for the ORG to conclude that the footage was a useful example of how a potentially dangerous situation can be avoided . ... In those circumstances , it seems to me that the decision of the ORG to distribute the film footage to the media could not be said to be irrational or unreasonable , bearing in mind that the film did not show an attempted suicide and that , at the time , they did not know the applicant 's identity . They therefore had no reason to consult the police as to whether an offence had been committed . They did not sell the take - outs from the ORG footage for commercial gain and , more importantly , they had imposed on the television companies a requirement that an individual 's face should be masked . It is true that that was a verbal rather than a written requirement , but I am not persuaded that what happened was likely to have been different if it had been a written requirement . In the event , the fault lay with the television companies . ORG failed to mask the applicant 's identity adequately . The ORG failed to mask the applicant 's identity at all in the trailers . As soon as the ORG were notified about that by the applicant , DATE before the programme went out , which was the first time they were aware of the applicant 's identity , they immediately contacted the ORG and received assurances that his image had been masked in the programme . In the event , unknown to the ORG , it had not been adequately masked in the programme .", "I am sure that lessons can be learnt from this unfortunate incident , and it may be that , with the benefit of hindsight , the ORG will want to see if they can tighten up their guidelines to seek to avoid a similar incident in the future . I am , however , equally sure that , in the circumstances that I have described , the ORG can not be said to have acted irrationally in the sense that they had taken leave of their senses or had acted in a manner in which no reasonable local authority could sensibly have acted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An application to ORG for leave to appeal to ORG was rejected . The subsequent leave application to a single judge of ORG was rejected on DATE because", "\u201c ... the [ High Court ] Judge was plainly correct in his interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions and the ORG was neither acting outside its statutory authority nor irrationally in making the film and photographs available to the media . The injury , of which complaint is made , arises from a failure on the part of the media to sufficiently disguise the applicant when making the film and photographs visible to the public . That is and has been the subject of complaint against the media involved but is not capable of supporting a claim for a declaration against ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following an oral hearing before the full ORG , the applicant 's leave application was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Criminal Justice and LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) came into force on DATE . The relevant parts of CARDINAL provide as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

Essex Police Policy Guidelines dated DATE concern the involvement of the police in the installation and operation of ORG systems in their remit . In the section concerning the release to the media of video footage , it was pointed out that care should be taken not to jeopardise any existing or future legal proceedings , that licence agreements covering all appropriate terms and conditions of release should be drawn up and that care should always be taken to ensure that victims or other innocent parties featured were aware of its potential use and , where possible , their consent obtained . Where possible , the identity of victims , police employees and suspects ( where identification might jeopardise criminal proceedings ) should be masked .", "CARDINAL . As an extension of ORG announced in DATE , government funding for ORG systems was introduced in DATE and the sum of MONEY ( GBP ) has been made available over DATE , of which MONEY has already been allocated to CARDINAL ORG schemes . CARDINAL of the requirements of such funding is that the scheme should be regulated by a suitable code of practice to ensure that it operates fairly and with proper respect for personal privacy .

The LANGUAGE courts do not recognise proportionality as a separate head of judicial review . However , in the case of NORP ( ORG ) v.
