The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) remanded the applicant in custody for DATE on suspicion that he had committed CARDINAL counts of armed robbery . It considered that that measure was indispensable in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings , having regard to the serious nature of the offences in question and the severity of the anticipated penalty . Lastly , it considered that , given the way in which the offences in question had been committed , the applicant might attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimony .", "CARDINAL . During the investigation , the applicant 's detention was prolonged several times .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) prolonged his detention until DATE , relying on the grounds originally given for his detention . It further referred to the need to take various investigative measures and obtain expert evidence . It also considered that the complexity of the case justified the prolongation of the applicant 's detention with a view to securing the proper conduct of the investigation . The applicant appealed against that decision , relying on his poor health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) dismissed his appeal , having regard to the medical report of DATE which concluded that the applicant could remain in detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of Appeal prolonged his detention until DATE , finding that it was highly probable that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged . In that respect , it referred to evidence given by a certain GPE , a member of the same criminal group , who acted as a witness against the other suspects . ORG further relied on the need to obtain and secure evidence , in particular from experts in ballistics , biology and fingerprints . It stressed that it was also necessary to hold a reconstruction of the crime and to confront the suspects with each other . It also considered that the scale and the nature of the offences in question justified the applicant 's continued detention . The applicant appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) dismissed his appeal . It had regard to the serious nature of the offences in question and the need to obtain further evidence . It further emphasised the complexity of the case and considered that the applicant 's continued detention was the only measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant 's detention until DATE , considering that the strong suspicion against him of having committed the serious offences with which he had been charged , the severity of the anticipated sentence and the risk of his tampering with evidence justified holding him in custody . It found that the present case was \u201c particularly complex \u201d within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure due to , inter alia , the nature of the offences and the number of suspects involved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of Appeal prolonged the detention of the applicant and his CARDINAL co - suspects pending investigation until DATE . On DATE it ordered that the applicant be held in custody until DATE . It repeated the grounds stated in its previous decisions . It added that the prolongation of the applicant 's detention was justified by the need to obtain DNA evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted before the ORG on CARDINAL charges , including several counts of armed robbery . The bill of indictment listed CARDINAL charges brought against CARDINAL accused , who were all detained on remand . The case - file comprised CARDINAL volumes . The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from CARDINAL witnesses . The principal witness was a certain LOC , who was indicted together with all the defendants but gave evidence against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention until DATE , reiterating the grounds that had been stated in the previous decisions . It considered that there was a risk that he might abscond or interfere with witnesses , having regard to the serious nature of the offences in question and the connections between the suspects .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since on DATE the applicant 's detention reached the statutory time - limit of DATE laid down in LAW of LAW , further prolongation of the applicant 's detention was ordered by ORG . ORG relied on the particular complexity of the case as the ground for extending the applicant 's detention beyond the statutory time - limit . The relevant decisions were given on DATE ( extending the applicant 's detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( prolonging that period until DATE ) , on DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( prolonging the detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( extending the detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( prolonging it until DATE ) , on DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) , on DATE ( extending that period until DATE ) , on DATE ( ordering his continued detention until DATE ) and on DATE ( prolonging his detention until DATE ) . As at the latter date , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL accused were still detained on remand and the trial court had heard most of the prosecution witnesses .", "CARDINAL . In all those decisions ORG stated that the grounds originally given for the applicant 's detention were still valid . It especially relied on the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings against any attempt by the applicant to obstruct the process of obtaining evidence . It stressed the exceptionally complex nature of the case and the fact that CARDINAL witnesses were to be heard .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the trial began on DATE . However , as at DATE the reading out of the bill of indictment by the prosecution was still continuing .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found that holding the applicant and his CARDINAL co - defendants in custody was the only measure which would prevent them from obstructing the trial , having regard to the nature of the offences in question , the severity of the anticipated penalty and the fact that such attempts had been made in the course of the investigation . It also instructed the trial court to increase the number of hearings held DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , ORG observed that up to DATE the main reason for the delays during the trial was the obstructiveness of the defendants and the abuse of the rights of the defence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of DATE dismissing the applicant 's appeal against the decision of DATE prolonging his detention , ORG held that LAW established a presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant might induce him to obstruct the proceedings . It added that the risk of absconding or tampering with witnesses which existed in the present case did not have to be supported by any concrete facts , but resulted from the above presumption .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court made a severance order with a view to expediting the proceedings , and thereafter CARDINAL defendants ( ORG , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , who in the meantime had been released from detention , were to be tried separately from other defendants .", "CARDINAL . During the trial the applicant filed numerous but unsuccessful applications for release and appealed , likewise unsuccessfully , against the decisions prolonging his detention . He maintained that the length of his detention was excessive and unreasonable and that the charges against him lacked a sufficiently strong basis since they were founded on unreliable evidence from ORG", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant is still in detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL .
