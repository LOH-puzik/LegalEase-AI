NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in LOC . He was represented before the ORG by Mr J. Ahlin , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG Attorney .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained in the remand section of GPE prison on DATE . The ORG submitted that he had been released on DATE . The applicant claimed that he had been released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant was held in cell no .

On DATE the applicant was held with another detainee in cell no . CARDINAL , measuring QUANTITY ( including a separate QUANTITY sanitary facility ) . From DATE until his release he was held in cell no . CARDINAL , measuring QUANTITY ( including a separate QUANTITY sanitary facility ) . According to ORG , the number of detainees held in that cell fluctuated CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that he had shared the cells with CARDINAL other detainees .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law is resumed in ORG and PERSON GPE ( nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) , and ORG and others v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ) . For the purposes of the examination of the present application , the ORG points out that under LAW , if it is established that the circumstances of a case , and in particular the degree of pain and fear , and their duration , justify it , an injured party may be awarded monetary compensation , irrespective of any compensation for material damage . Even if there is no material damage , he or she may be awarded damages for the physical pain endured ; for psychological anguish resulting from a general loss of the ability to perform vital functions , disfigurement , defamation , or infringement of personal freedom or personality rights ; for the death of a next - of - kin ; and for the fear experienced . The latest observations submitted by the parties ( dated CARDINAL DATE ) summed up as follows the decisions of the domestic courts in response to claims for compensation for allegedly inadequate conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG found that the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights , as well as the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degradation treatment , had been violated on account of inadequate conditions in the remand section of GPE prison ( judgment no . I P CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The plaintiff had spent DATE ( from DATE ) in GPE prison as a remand prisoner . For most of that time he had been held together with CARDINAL other detainees in a cell measuring QUANTITY . The court found that all CARDINAL elements of civil tort were established , namely : unlawful act , occurrence of damage , causal link and the defendant \u2019s responsibility . The court noted that there was no case - law on the matter thus far and that that first judgment should establish principles for the future . Referring also to PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ) , the court noted that the rights guaranteed by the ORG represented a minimum standard and that the protection afforded by the national legislation should go beyond that minimum . It found that the personal space afforded to the plaintiff had been far below the standard of QUANTITY for multi - occupancy cells recommended by ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and provided for in LAW . It was therefore in breach of the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights . The court further observed that the overcrowding had had a negative effect on other aspects of the plaintiff \u2019s detention . It found that the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights had been breached also on account of poor ventilation , disturbances during TIME , verbal and physical conflicts in the cell , and the fact that he could not eat his meals at a table or use the telephone for TIME ( as provided for in the regulations ) . Those conditions amounted to a violation of LAW , which prohibited torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment . The plaintiff was awarded compensation for non - pecuniary damage in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) ( see Mandi\u0107 and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . When deciding on the amount of compensation , the court took into consideration the ORG \u2019s case - law , in particular as established in the case of PERSON , cited above .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by GPE ( judgment no . II Cp DATE ) against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It held that the amount of compensation awarded was fair as it approximately corresponded to CARDINAL average DATE net salaries in GPE in DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed a request for an appeal on points of law lodged by GPE ( judgment no . II DoR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Previously , on DATE ORG , considering the ORG \u2019s case - law on prison conditions and the plaintiff \u2019s personal circumstances , had dismissed a claim for compensation regarding the detention conditions in Dob prison . That judgment had been upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG had also issued on DATE a default judgment regarding prison conditions in Dob Prison , on the grounds that the plaintiff had not attended the hearing to which he had been duly summoned .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG decided on CARDINAL claims for compensation lodged in DATE and DATE concerning conditions in GPE prison ; CARDINAL of them were dismissed for lack of a violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 personality rights and in the other CARDINAL cases default judgments were issued . In DATE and DATE , CARDINAL claims for compensation were lodged concerning conditions in GPE prison ; in CARDINAL of the cases a settlement was reached with the plaintiff , and as of the date of the latest information available to ORG ( DATE ) , the other CARDINAL cases were still pending before the domestic courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
