FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Expulsion) (Conditional) (Russia)", "JUDGES": "Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had a husband and CARDINAL daughters in GPE . In DATE CARDINAL of the daughters moved to GPE and has lived there permanently since then . She is a NORP citizen . The other daughter went missing in DATE and is probably dead . The applicant raised her granddaughter , who was born in DATE , from DATE , when the child \u2019s mother went missing .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant suffered a stroke in GPE . Apparently her right side was then paralysed . At the time , she lived with her husband , until he died in DATE . Thereafter the applicant apparently lived with her granddaughter and her family near ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE with a tourist visa issued for DATE , without having lodged a prior application for a residence permit at a NORP Representation . Since then she has been living with her daughter in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for a residence permit on the basis of family ties to her daughter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE , PERSON ) refused the applicant a residence permit and ordered her removal to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , presenting new medical evidence about her state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision and referred the case back to it for reexamination as new evidence had been presented in the matter on which it could not take a stand as a first instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again refused the applicant a residence permit and ordered her removal to GPE . It found that , according to the domestic law , the applicant was not entitled to a residence permit on the basis of family ties as she was not a family member ( a spouse or a minor child ) of a person living in GPE . Other relatives than family members were issued a residence permit only in exceptional circumstances , mainly if the purpose was to continue close family life in GPE or if the relative was completely dependent on a NORP citizen living in GPE . The applicant and her daughter had not had any family life since DATE when the daughter had moved to GPE . A residence permit could not be granted on the basis of health reasons either . It did not appear that the applicant could not receive proper medical treatment or care in GPE . The applicant \u2019s age , her state of health and the fact that her relative lived in GPE were not sufficient reasons to issue her a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , requesting that ORG decision be quashed . She claimed , inter alia , that she had not received proper treatment in GPE and that such treatment could not be provided . She had no relatives in GPE who could take care of her . This meant that she would have to be put in a nursing home , the standard of which was generally poor in GPE . Her daughter could not move back to GPE either as she would have to leave her job in GPE and take her daughter with her . It was not even certain that they would be issued a residence permit in GPE . The applicant \u2019s mental condition was such that she could not endure removal and separation from her daughter . Separation would lead to her death either through sickness or suicide .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered a stay on removal for the duration of the proceedings before it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . In its reasons the court noted that the essential question was whether the applicant was completely dependent on her daughter who lives in GPE . The applicant \u2019s state of physical and mental health was attested by proper medical certificates . However , it was not shown that the applicant could not receive proper medical treatment or care in GPE , in her own language . The applicant was thus not completely dependent on her daughter in GPE , nor did she have any close ties to GPE . The applicant had close ties to GPE where she could also receive treatment . The fact that treatment would be more expensive there was not a ground to grant a residence permit . The applicant \u2019s daughter could help her financially and could also visit her in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting that she be granted leave to appeal and that the court order a stay on removal .", "CARDINAL . No stay on removal was ordered by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
