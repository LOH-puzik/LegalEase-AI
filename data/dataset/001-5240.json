NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants are Mr PERSON and his wife PERSON , both NORP nationals and born respectively in DATE and DATE , and also their CARDINAL children ( born in DATE indicated in brackets ) , who are NORP nationals : PERSON ( DATE ) , PERSON ( DATE ) , PERSON ( DATE ) , PERSON ( DATE ) and PERSON ( DATE ) . The first applicant lives in GPE , GPE , and the other applicants live in PERSON , near GPE , GPE . They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as described mainly in the judgments of the national courts , may be summarised as follows .", "As his parents were very poor , the first applicant PERSON was cared for by his uncle as his foster father . His uncle arrived in GPE in DATE and declared the first applicant as his son . In DATE , at DATE and after having completed DATE in GPE during which he was taught in oral and written GPE , the latter arrived in GPE . His foster father wished the first applicant to take part in the maintenance of the family in GPE . He was granted a permanent residence permit . In the DATE of DATE he started at a NORP school and completed primary and secondary school in DATE , following which , he took a basic high school course in engineering and mechanics . In DATE he started work and , except for a short break in DATE , he was continuously in stable employment with a relatively good income until DATE , when he was arrested for narcotics offences .", "The first applicant had visited GPE in DATE together with his foster father . He had again visited the country in DATE , in connection with his marriage , in DATE and in DATE . Each visit had lasted DATE . His wife arrived in DATE and they had their first child DATE . The first applicant \u2019s wife acquired NORP citizenship in DATE , but he never sought to obtain this himself as he had never felt particularly concerned by the question of citizenship .", "On DATE the Eidsivating High Court ( lagmannsrett ) convicted the first applicant under LAW ) , cf . LAW for having assisted in the sale of QUANTITY of heroin and for having sold drugs , probably heroin , for approximately ORG CARDINAL . It sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment . He had no previous convictions in GPE . ORG found it established that the applicant had contacted his co - accused , ORG , a NORP national , to inquire whether he would be interested in marketing heroin in or around PERSON , a small district town in another part of the country . Following an affirmative answer by T. , it was agreed that the latter should go to GPE to collect the heroin . On the agreed date and at the agreed place , T. was contacted by PERSON , also a NORP national , who offered PERSON grams of heroin on the applicant \u2019s behalf , which T. took to GPE . During the police investigations , the police , with ORG 's co - operation , recorded a telephone conversation between him and the applicant concerning payment for the heroin . Moreover , the police provided T. with ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in marked bank notes . On arresting the first applicant and PERSON , the police found NOK CARDINAL of the marked notes in the first applicant 's wallet and CARDINAL in a flat occupied by A. A further ORG CARDINAL were found in the house of the first applicant 's foster father which , it was established , were proceeds from the first applicant 's sale of drugs , mainly heroin .", "While the first applicant served his sentence , his children visited him in prison for TIME and TIME DATE . After having served a third of the sentence , he was permitted to visit his family at home . He was released on probation in MarchApril DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) ordered the first applicant \u2019s expulsion under the relevant provisions of LAW DATE ( GPE of DATE No . CARDINAL ) . On appeal by the first applicant ORG upheld the decision on DATE , finding that the expulsion would not constitute a disproportionate measure against the first applicant . In reaching this conclusion , the Ministry attached decisive importance to the fact that he had been convicted of offences under , inter alia , Article CARDINAL of the Penal Code and had been sentenced to over DATE imprisonment . Regard was had to the fact that the trial court had found that the first applicant had attempted to sell a considerable quantity of heroin in a milieu which had not previously had problems with this drug and that his actions had been motivated exclusively by the desire for financial gain . The trial court had found it necessary , in view of general considerations of crime prevention , to react strongly against such conduct . Moreover , having regard to the particularly serious nature of the criminal offence in question , ORG did not find that the expulsion would amount to a disproportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis the first applicant 's closest family members .", "The first applicant subsequently instituted proceedings before ORG , which in a judgment of DATE upheld the decision of ORG , following which the expulsion order was put into effect in DATE . At the time his wife was pregnant and very depressed .", "After his return to GPE he lived in a house belonging to his foster father and was unemployed . His eldest child visited him for DATE in DATE and his wife and all his children visited him for DATE .", "The applicants submitted , and adduced certain medical statements in support thereof , that the children suffered from asthma and allergies , and that the wife had suffered physically and psychologically as a result of her husband 's separation from the family .", "An appeal by the first applicant to ORG was rejected by judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant then lodged an appeal with ORG ( PERSON ) , which in a judgment of DATE rejected the appeal .", "In his opinion , Mr Justice Sk\u00e5re , on behalf of a unanimous court , recalled , inter alia , ORG finding that the second applicant and her children had to a slight degree been integrated into NORP society . They spoke GPE at home and the oldest children had great difficulties with the NORP language at school and in the kindergarten . During the hearing the spouse showed that she had not mastered NORP . As regards the merits of the case , Justice PERSON stated , inter alia :", "\u201c \u2026 Like the criminal cases which form the basis for the expulsion orders at issue in appeal cases nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL , there is no question in this case of such a significant amount of heroin as to warrant the application of Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . Nevertheless , it concerns CARDINAL narcotics offences which , according to the nature and quantity of the drugs call for a very severe sentence . ... .", "In the assessment it is also important to note that PERSON has resided in GPE for a long period and that he arrived here quite young . However , he has maintained his links with the NORP milieu , and his links to GPE are not as CARDINAL - sided as one may find in certain cases of more typical secondgeneration immigrants . Also his spouse and children appear to have links to the NORP culture and milieu .", "I have therefore reached the conclusion that the expulsion order can not be regarded as incompatible with LAW . The appeal must be rejected . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
