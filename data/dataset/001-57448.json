He was arrested by the NORP police on DATE , released on CARDINAL May and arrested again on DATE on a charge of having abducted and murdered a CARDINAL-year - old NORP girl , PERSON , in Genoa on DATE It was alleged that he had hidden the body and tried to extort a ransom of MONEY from the victim 's father , an industrialist . He was also charged with indecency and indecent assault with violence on CARDINAL women .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after DATE of hearings largely taken up by the evidence of CARDINAL witnesses , ORG sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment for offences relating to one of the QUANTITY women ( the time spent in detention being reckoned as part of the sentence ) . He was acquitted of the other crimes with which he was charged , in particular the abduction of PERSON and its sequel , for lack of evidence ; and he was accordingly released .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution appealed to ORG of Appeal against the judgment ( which ran to CARDINAL pages ) . The hearing was set down for on DATE but had to be adjourned , because the defence challenged the presiding judge , alleging that he had publicly stated his conviction that Mr. PERSON was guilty . The appeal proceedings commenced on DATE after this challenge had been rejected by ORG , but the accused applied for an adjournment . On the evidence of a medical certificate , he claimed that he was in hospital being treated for renal colic and was thus unable to appear . The court found that he was deliberately refusing to appear ( contumace ) and proceeded with the hearing . Thereupon the defence entered a fresh challenge in respect of the presiding judge and lodged an objection impugning ORG on grounds of bias ; the challenge and the objection were dismissed by ORG on DATE . In the absence of the applicant , the proceedings then resumed before ORG , which refused to hear some of the defence witnesses . Considering that they could no longer perform their duties in these circumstances , the applicant 's principal counsel withdrew from the case , and the defence was from then on conducted by a single lawyer who had been instructed not long before .", "On DATE , ORG , giving judgment in absentia , sentenced Mr. PERSON to life imprisonment ( ergastolo ) for the crimes relating to PERSON and to DATE imprisonment for the other crimes ; the court held that there were no extenuating circumstances .", "CARDINAL .

ORG On DATE , the NORP gendarmerie arrested him in the course of a routine check in the d\u00e9partement of ORG and on DATE he was taken into custody at FAC ( GPE - Vienne ) pending extradition proceedings . He was served with the document authorising his arrest and the documents produced in support of the extradition request , and the public prosecutor attached to at ORG examined him under LAW ) of LAW of DATE ( \" LAW \" ) . On DATE , GPE officially applied to GPE for his extradition under a bilateral treaty of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG of ORG , to which the case had been submitted in accordance with section DATE CARDINAL Act , ruled against extradition after hearing the public prosecutor , the applicant 's counsel and the applicant himself . It found that the request was in order as far as the DATE treaty and LAW were concerned but held that the NORP procedure for trial in absentia , which had been followed in this case by ORG , was incompatible with NORP public policy ( ordre public ) , because even in respect of indictable offences ( and not just of lesser ones ) it was possible under that procedure to pass an enforceable sentence on an accused who had not appeared in person before the court , without the adversarial proceedings which formed the basis of NORP criminal procedure and without any provision for making a retrial obligatory .", "By virtue of LAW , this negative ruling was final and binding on ORG , which accordingly declined to extradite the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON nonetheless remained in prison at GPE , because he had been charged in GPE with fraud and with forgery and falsification of administrative documents and use thereof .", "On DATE , the investigating judge found that ORG seemed to have acted merely as an executing agent and not to have planned and directed the frauds with which he was charged ; the details which he had \" preferred not to reveal \" related to the circumstances at the beginning of his residence and not to the matters in issue ; there were a considerable number of extentuating circumstances in connection with the making of the false identity documents ; it was no longer necessary to keep him in prison in order to ascertain the truth , but on account of his \" special administrative position \" he had to be placed under judicial supervision . The investigating judge therefore ordered his release on bail of MONEY and subject to certain conditions .", "The public prosecutor 's office appealed against this order , but ORG of ORG upheld it on DATE . DATE , despite the prosecution 's opposition , the investigating judge had decided that there were no grounds for keeping Mr. PERSON in custody .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant was immediately released . He has claimed that on DATE , DATE , he applied for a residence permit at ORG but was refused an acknowledgment of receipt of this application . The Government have stated that there is no trace of this application in the official archives , but they have not denied that it was made .

On DATE , the investigating judge issued a discharge order in respect of the fraud charge , an order terminating judicial supervision , and an order committing the applicant for trial at ORG on charges of forging and falsifying administrative documents and using false identity documents ( contrary to GPE and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The account given hereafter in DATE , DATE and CARDINAL is based mainly on information and documents supplied to the ORG and , subsequently , to the ORG by Mr. PERSON 's lawyers .

ORG The applicant refused to sign a police report stating that he complied with this decision of his own free will . On the contrary , he emphatically opposed deportation and demanded to be brought before ORG provided for in LAW DATE .", "He was told that this was out of the question and that he was going to be taken at once to GPE ( and not to the NORP border , which was the nearest frontier ) . Accordingly , without first being ordered to leave GPE for a country of his choice or being allowed to inform his wife or his lawyer , he was forced to get into an unmarked ORG and sit , still handcuffed , between CARDINAL police officers . At TIME the car left for ORG , preceded by a police car which led the way . It reached the frontier near ORG on DATE in TIME . At first it was unable to cross ; after a long telephone conversation between the officer in charge of the NORP policemen and the NORP authorities , it proceeded to the NORP customs post at GPE .", "CARDINAL . After a further telephone conversation , there appeared an unmarked Opel with a NORP number plate , and a NORP policeman got out . He put other handcuffs on Mr. PERSON , who was made to sit on the back seat between this policeman and a NORP one . The Opel entered GPE at TIME , escorted by the ORG with the other CARDINAL NORP policemen aboard . The QUANTITY vehicles drove to the police station in FAC in GPE .", "The applicant , who had no identity papers , was informed at TIME that GPE was requesting his extradition .

The documents later supplied by GPE in support of its request were dated DATE , a DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , GPE , to which GPE is bound by LAW DATE , had requested GPE to extradite the applicant , and the latter 's name had accordingly been recorded in ORG ( PERSON suisse de police ) of DATE as being the subject of a \" warrant for arrest pending extradition proceedings \" .", "Mr. PERSON was extradited to GPE on DATE after ORG had rejected his objection on DATE . He is currently serving his sentence in FAC on the island of GPE , as NORP law - unlike the NORP system - makes no provision for obligatory retrial after proceedings in absentia ( cf . LAW ) . It appears that he has never ceased to claim that he is innocent of the appalling crime of which he was convicted , but unless he is given a retrial ( revisione ) or a pardon , he will not be eligible for release ( on parole ) until DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE and DATE , Mr. PERSON 's lawyer had had recourse to CARDINAL remedies in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the first place , they summoned the Minister of the ORG to appear in urgent proceedings before the presiding judge of the GPE tribunal de grande instance on DATE .", "According to them , the \" operation \" carried out on TIME DATE had CARDINAL major defects , any CARDINAL of which was sufficient to classify it as arbitrary and thus constituting a flagrantly unlawful act ( voie de fait ) . Mr. PERSON 's \" brutal arrest \" was obviously a vital stage in the execution of the deportation order but could not be justified by the order because it had preceded notification of the order . The authorities could not prove that the execution of the administrative act had met with definite resistance or at least obvious unwillingness to comply : they had quite simply not left the applicant \" any time to do anything at all \" , and in any case it would have been in his interests to comply voluntarily so as to be able to choose the country in which he would take refuge . Finally and most importantly , the executive had no automatic right of enforcement in this matter .", "Furthermore , there was the flagrant unlawfulness of the order itself . It was contrary to the decisions to release the applicant and to discharge the judicial supervision order that had been taken by the investigating judicial authorities on DATE and DATE , and to the negative ruling of CARDINAL DATE by ORG of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; and in choosing GPE out of CARDINAL neighbouring countries , against the applicant 's will , the authorities knew that they were handing him over to ORG most likely to extradite him to GPE , owing to the existence of an extradition agreement between GPE and GPE and the nationality of the murdered girl .", "Mr. PERSON 's lawyers further pointed out that the matter was urgent because ORG was about to take a decision on the NORP extradition request ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and that their client had been improperly removed from the jurisdiction of the NORP courts , seeing that the investigating judge had committed him for trial at ORG on a charge of using false identity documents ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "They therefore sought an injunction from the presiding judge of the GPE tribunal de grande instance requiring the Minister of the ORG to apply to the appropriate NORP authority , within DATE of the interim order 's being made , for the return of their client .", "CARDINAL . ORG In his submissions of CARDINAL DATE , the Minister pointed out that LAW of CARDINAL DATE forbade any interference by the ordinary courts with administrative acts . He drew the inference that the application must be dismissed and the applicant left to take proceedings in the proper courts if he so desired .", "The GPE Commissioner of Police likewise entered a plea in bar alleging want of jurisdiction , which the procureur de la PERSON ( public prosecutor ) argued at the hearing , submitting that the parties should be referred to the administrative court . He too based his argument on LAW and , in addition , LAW of CARDINAL fructidor of DATE , which forbids the courts to deal with administrative acts of any kind whatsoever . There was nothing to prove that the deportation order complained of and its enforcement had amounted to a flagrantly unlawful act , that is to say , that they were manifestly incapable of being related to the application of a statute or regulations . In particular , the investigating judicial authorities ' order for the applicant 's release and their decision to discharge the judicial supervision order did not establish that Mr. PERSON 's presence on the national territory did not constitute a threat to public order . Furthermore , it was in the nature of deportation to be effected by coercion if need be ORG , DATE , ORG p\u00e9riodique DATE ) . As to the negative ruling by ORG of ORG on DATE , it did not forbid taking Mr. PERSON to the NORP frontier , as ORG had agreed to accept him .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the presiding judge of the GPE tribunal de grande instance made an order stating that there were no grounds for hearing the case on an urgent application because the application , \" as it [ put ] relations between GPE in issue , [ was ] not within the jurisdiction of the judge competent to hear urgent applications in the ordinary courts \" . This decision was preceded by reasons which read as follows ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" The various events between ORG 's being apprehended and his being handed over to the NORP police disclose manifest and very serious irregularities both from the point of view of NORP public policy ( ordre public ) and with regard to the rules resulting from application of LAW . Moreover , it is surprising that precisely the NORP border was chosen as the place of deportation although the NORP border is nearer GPE . Lastly , it may be noted that the courts have not been given an opportunity of making a finding as to the possible infringements of the deportation order issued against him , because as soon as the order was served on him , LOC was handed over to the NORP police , despite his protests . The executive thus itself implemented its own decision .", "It therefore appears that this operation consisted , not in a straightforward expulsion on the basis of the deportation order , but in a prearranged handing over to the NORP police ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant 's lawyers considered that there was no point in appealing . It should be noted in this connection that ORG ( Tribunal des conflits ) has held that even an unlawful decision to deport does not amount to a flagrantly unlawful act and that consequently only the administrative courts have jurisdiction in the matter ( Pr\u00e9fet du Rh\u00f4ne c. Tribunal de grande instance GPE and GPE c. Ministre PERSON , DATE , PERSON , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant 's legal advisers had applied , secondly , to ORG , to have the deportation order of DATE set aside .", "They argued in substance that this had been made by an unauthorised entity as it did not bear the Minister of the ORG 's personal signature . It was \" bad for error of law \" to the extent that it was based on Mr. PERSON 's previous conviction , because ORG of ORG had rejected as being contrary to NORP public policy the conviction in absentia by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . There had also been an abuse of powers , since the matter had been one , not of requiring Mr. PERSON to leave NORP territory , but of handing him over to the country which was more likely than any other to extradite him to GPE ; and a manifest error of judgment , inasmuch as the order complained of was based on the applicant 's behaviour in GPE - the use of a false document had seemed to him to be the only way of escaping prosecution for a crime of which he held he was innocent , and the investigating judge had found that there were a considerable number of extenuating circumstances in relation to the offence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The authorities should have looked at the whole case to determine whether Mr. PERSON 's presence amounted to a threat to public order . The order complained of had not complied with the provisions of Community law ( LAW and ORG Directive CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , the authorities had disregarded all the formal requirements of Directive CARDINAL and LAW DATE : Mr. PERSON had not been served with a refusal to issue a residence permit , had not been able to submit his observations to ORG , had not been informed of the reasons of public policy on which the administrative decision was based , and had not been given a reasonable period to leave NORP territory . Only urgency could have absolved the executive from its duty to comply with these mandatory rules , but there had been no such urgency in the instant case nor had it been relied on at any time .", "CARDINAL . ORG Initially ( DATE ) , the Minister of the ORG opposed this argument , contending , inter alia , that the circumstances in which an administrative decision was executed did not affect the lawfulness of the decision ; but in further pleadings , sent by telegram on DATE , the Minister of the ORG and for ORG stated that he desired to leave the matter to the discretion of the court .", "CARDINAL . ORG The court gave judgment on DATE . Without ruling on the other grounds , it held that the Minister of the ORG had committed \" a manifest error of judgment \" and the administrative authorities an \" abuse of powers \" .", "On the first point the judgment read as follows ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" The Minister ... refers to the applicant 's use of false administrative documents and to his behaviour in GPE ;", "The fact of having used false identity documents to enter GPE and reside there can not of itself , in the absence of any aggravating circumstances , be considered as amounting to a threat to public order ;", "It appears from the documents on the file ... that the only factor to which regard was had in respect of the applicant 's behaviour in GPE was a criminal conviction and sentence in absentia ... ; in the absence of any truly adversarial proceedings , the very serious offence of which Mr. PERSON was accused , and which he has always denied , can not be regarded as having been adequately proved ... \"", "The finding that there had been an abuse of powers was based on the following circumstances ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" Whereas the haste with which the impugned decision was enforced , when the individual concerned had not even indicated his refusal to comply , and the choice of the NORP border which was imposed on the individual clearly show the real reason behind the decision : in reality the executive sought , not to expel the applicant from NORP territory , but to hand him over to the NORP authorities via the NORP authorities , with whom GPE had an extradition agreement ; the executive was therefore seeking to circumvent the competent judicial authority 's negative ruling which was binding on ORG ; ... the impugned decision was [ therefore ] an abuse of powers ... \"", "The court accordingly quashed the deportation order .", "The Minister of the ORG and for Decentralisation did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant 's legal advisers had considered it unnecessary to couple their application for the order to be set aside with an application for a stay of its execution .

ORG According to the information provided by the Government , Mr. PERSON was not summoned to appear at ORG on the charges of forging and falsifying administrative documents and uttering false identity documents ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .
