At the lawyer \u2019s request , the court admitted several persons to participate in the proceedings as the applicant \u2019s representatives , including PERSON .

The applicant \u2019s lawyer asked for an adjournment because several witnesses , including PERSON , who had sold heroin to the applicant , and PERSON and NORP , the policemen involved in the operation , had failed to appear . However , the court decided to proceed .", "CARDINAL . The defence team \u2019s arguments before the trial court can be summarised as follows . The defence contended that applicant had been incited to commit an offence by Ms T. , acting on behalf of the police . According to the defence , NORP law prohibited any form of incitement or provocation ; only if a specific crime was being prepared could an undercover operation be carried out . In the present case , however , the police had no proof of the applicant \u2019s involvement in drug trafficking when planning the \u201c test buy \u201d .", "CARDINAL . They further stressed that the applicant \u2019s confession had been given in a state of drug intoxication and without legal advice . Finally , the defence challenged the credibility of the forensic examination report which identified the substance confiscated and allegedly sold by the applicant to Ms T. as heroin . They referred to a declaration signed by the applicant on DATE , stating that the confession had been extracted from him by force .", "DATE . At the hearing on DATE Ms T. gave evidence against the applicant . She testified that she had helped the police voluntarily . She explained that she had handed the applicant over to the police \u201c out of kindness in a manner of speaking \u201d ( \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c , \u043f\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 ) [ sic ] . She also stated as follows : \u201c At that time I did not know where to get heroin , so I called [ the applicant ] because in the past he had already procured it for me \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court also heard Mr M. , who was with the applicant at the moment of his arrest and who confirmed , in principle , PERSON account of the facts . However , he said that before the events at issue he had procured drugs for himself from another source . Finally , the court interviewed the applicant \u2019s mother , who described her son \u2019s character . She testified that she did not know when her son had started to take drugs .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the documents , exhibits and expert reports contained in the case file . In particular , it examined the police report describing the \u201c test buy \u201d and the findings of the psychiatric examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of selling heroin to PERSON on DATE . It also ruled , referring to the psychiatric report of DATE , that the applicant had committed the crime in a state of insanity and could not therefore be held criminally accountable . The court discontinued the criminal proceedings and ordered compulsory medical treatment of the applicant at his home . The applicant was released from custody .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s representative appealed , claiming that the applicant was not guilty and maintaining , inter alia , that the police had fabricated the crime . In particular , there was no reliable evidence that the applicant had already been suspected by the police of being a drug - dealer at the moment of his arrest . Moreover , the applicant had derived no financial benefit from the transaction as he had given PERSON all the money that he had received from T. for the sachet . Furthermore , the court failed to interview several key witnesses , including the QUANTITY police officers who had arrested the applicant , CARDINAL eye - witnesses to his arrest and PERSON , who had sold the substance to the applicant . Finally , the applicant \u2019s representatives claimed that the confession had been extracted from the applicant by force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The applicant was absent but his lawyer and representatives took part in the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , on a motion by psychoneurotic hospital no .
