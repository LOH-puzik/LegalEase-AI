De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG Attorney .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a stockbroker working as the head of trading in a brokerage firm . In DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the Agency \u201d ) , an independent authority vested with supervisory powers in the field of securities market operations , requested from the applicant a number of records of securities transactions he had made in DATE .", "CARDINAL . After examining these documents and the records of the stockexchange trading system , on DATE the ORG adopted a decision to initiate proceedings for revocation of the applicant \u2019s stockbroker \u2019s trading licence ( hereinafter \u201c the initial decision \u201d ) , on the ground that in the period DATE and DATE he had carried out CARDINAL fictitious securities transactions and thereby breached ORG and LAW . In its decision , the GPE specified the controversial transactions , explaining in detail the circumstances which in its opinion implied their fictitious character .", "CARDINAL . These transactions all involved cross - trading , the brokerage firm acting as both the seller and buyer of securities for its ORG or its own accounts . In certain cases the applicant carried out multiple clients\u2019 orders to sell securities , which were followed almost simultaneously by these same GPE orders to buy an equal amount of the same type of securities . Moreover , in some cases the brokerage firm itself had bought securities from clients and subsequently sold them back to them . Other types of crosstrade transactions involved alternate sale and purchase of securities of the same type between a client and the brokerage firm , where the CARDINAL first sold and bought from each other a certain amount of securities of equivalent type , only to subsequently DATE approximately TIME DATE sell / buy them back from each other under almost the same conditions .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG the orders were executed by means of a special \u201c cross - user \u201d function key which ensured that the transactions were , as intended , carried out simultaneously between CARDINAL specific parties submitting matched offers , and no third party could intervene in the prearranged transaction . Given that the sales and subsequent purchases were carried out at very short intervals , that the securities were bought and sold at almost the same prices and that the transactions did not result in any change in the economic ownership of the relevant securities , the ORG took the view that they were prearranged and that the applicant , the very person who had carried them out , must have been aware of their content .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the ORG \u2019s decision included a detailed list of sixtyfive documents , among them copies of the trading records relating to the controversial transactions , which had given rise to its suspicion that the applicant had repeatedly breached the law , as well as the dates on which the alleged violations had occurred . Finally , the applicant was notified that he could make a statement on the reasons for initiating proceedings and submit evidence in support of his statement within DATE of receiving the decision .", "CARDINAL . In his reply to the ORG \u2019s initial decision on DATE , the applicant contested the version of events presented by the ORG , as well as the application and interpretation of the substantive and procedural law . As regards his objection to the facts , the applicant , while not contesting that he had in fact carried out the transactions in question or that these sales and purchases had been carried out between the same clients or between clients exchanging roles as buyers and sellers , argued that he had not been acquainted with the details of the transactions in question . The orders had allegedly been placed with another department , whereas the trading department had only carried them out . The applicant maintained that in the DATE period from DATE , during which CARDINAL of the controversial transactions had been made , the trading department had carried out CARDINAL securities transactions . Thus , the applicant alleged that he had not known , nor had he been required to check , whether each of these transactions was made in a correct manner . In support of his submissions , the applicant provided copies of the records of relevant transactions and balance of securities in the accounts of the relevant clients .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the applicant claimed that the documents identified in the ORG \u2019s initial decision did not justify the conclusion that he had actually used the \u201c cross - user \u201d function key to carry out the controversial transactions . In so far as the ORG disagreed with his view , the applicant suggested that an expert in securities trading be appointed to examine this issue . He also suggested that that expert submit his report at an oral hearing , enabling the applicant to ask him or her relevant questions , or in written form , in which case the applicant would submit written comments .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also joined to his reply an initiative for a review of the constitutionality of certain provisions of LAW applicable to his case , explaining that he would be lodging this initiative with ORG . In the initiative he challenged , inter alia , a number of provisions regulating proceedings before the ORG and judicial review proceedings , including the provision stipulating that the ORG \u2019s decisions were , in principle , rendered without holding a hearing . The applicant requested that the initiative be considered a constitutive part of his reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged his initiative for the review of constitutionality of certain provisions of LAW with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing and the appointment of an expert , without giving any reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Agency , sitting in a panel composed of CARDINAL members of its ORG , rendered a decision revoking the applicant \u2019s trading licence ( hereinafter \u201c the final decision \u201d ) on the ground that he had carried out CARDINAL fictitious securities transactions and thereby had repeatedly breached the law and stock - exchange trading rules . As regards , firstly , the applicant \u2019s request for an oral hearing and the appointment of an expert , the Agency held that the information on fictitious transactions through the use of the \u201c cross - user \u201d function key had been obtained from the records of the stock - exchange trading system , which had been presented to the applicant . According to the Agency , the tabular extracts from the trading system records , where all controversial transactions featured the \u201c cross - user \u201d status , clearly manifested that the \u201c cross - user \u201d function key had been used in these sales and purchases .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , the ORG considered that the manner in which the transactions had been carried out was sufficiently established by the documentary evidence already included in its decision to initiate proceedings for revocation of the applicant \u2019s trading licence , as well as by the records of transactions and other documents submitted by the applicant . According to the ORG , there was no controversy regarding the facts which would have necessitated an oral hearing or the appointment of an expert .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave for judicial review before ORG , challenging the ORG \u2019s final decision , as well as its decision rejecting his procedural requests for the appointment of an expert and for an oral hearing . In his request , the applicant essentially repeated the pleas made in his reply to the initial decision , and added a number of new complaints . Complaining that his earlier requests to this effect had been refused by the ORG without cause , the applicant requested that an expert be appointed and that an oral hearing be held , although a hearing in these proceedings was excluded by law . Nevertheless , the applicant argued that the statutory exclusion of oral submissions was unconstitutional , and proposed that this issue be raised before ORG and that the judicial review proceedings be suspended pending the decision of ORG . Moreover , the applicant maintained that the documents relied upon by the ORG did not prove that he had actually carried out the transactions at issue by using the \u201c cross - user \u201d function key , and that the ORG must have based its conclusion to this effect on other documents which had not been referred to in its decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rendered a decision on the review of constitutionality of certain provisions of LAW , in which it joined several applications regarding the same matter . Some of the challenged provisions of the LAW were found to be unconstitutional ; however , none of those pertained to procedural matters , including the provisions on holding of oral hearings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action for judicial review without holding an oral hearing . Having found that the controversial transactions had all involved cross - trading between what were essentially the same clients , ORG held that the ORG \u2019s conclusions as to the facts were correct . Moreover , considering that the purchases and sales had followed each other at very short intervals , ORG agreed with the ORG that the applicant must have been aware of the irregularity of the transactions in question . The court pointed out that the applicant had failed to adduce any arguments capable of rebutting the ORG \u2019s conclusions . Also , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against the ORG \u2019s decision not to appoint an expert and/or hold an oral hearing , reiterating that the ORG had sufficiently established the facts of the case . Finally , regarding the alleged failure of the ORG to indicate all evidence on which its conclusion as to the use of the \u201c cross - user \u201d function key had been made , ORG held that , as the applicant had not previously challenged the initial decision , it was only possible to examine his complaints regarding the final decision of the Agency .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgment of ORG , challenging the refusal of the ORG and ORG to hold an oral hearing and appoint an expert . He also claimed that the ORG had failed to indicate all evidence used in the proceedings , and that ORG erroneously rejected his complaint in that regard without addressing its merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , finding , first of all , that the ORG had indicated all the documents used as evidence in the proceedings to revoke his trading licence , first in its initial decision and then in its final decision . Accordingly , the court was of the view that the ORG \u2019s conclusions as to the applicant \u2019s use of the \u201c cross - user \u201d function key were clearly based on the documentary evidence and thus did not require a complex assessment of opposing and contradictory evidence . Moreover , the applicant had been provided with sufficient opportunity to comment on the evidence which was the basis for the revocation of his licence . Therefore , although the ORG agreed with the applicant that ORG had erred in concluding that he should have challenged the ORG \u2019s initial decision to initiate the proceedings at an earlier time , it considered that remitting the case back to ORG for further examination could not lead to a different conclusion with regard to the documentary evidence used in the proceedings before the Agency .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that the ORG had refused to appoint an expert , ORG reiterated that the ORG had given an adequate explanation of the use of the \u201c cross - user \u201d function key and the records of the stock - exchange trading system . Therefore , in ORG opinion , ORG had not been required to make a specific pronouncement on this question .", "CARDINAL . Finally , as regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that the ORG had also refused to hold an oral hearing , ORG held that he had not put forward this complaint in his application for judicial review before ORG , thereby failing to use that remedy in substance . As regards the lack of an oral hearing in the judicial review proceedings , ORG emphasised that a hearing in those proceedings was excluded by law . Nevertheless , ORG took the view that the applicant \u2019s right to be heard was not affected either , as he had had the opportunity to present his submissions in written form .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events at issue the securities market operations and the powers of the ORG in respect thereof were regulated by LAW . The LAW designated the ORG as an independent legal entity , led by a ORG which was composed of the president and CARDINAL members appointed by the Government . The members of the ORG were required to hold a university degree and enjoy the reputation of renowned experts in the field of finance or commercial law .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings in individual matters before the ORG were conducted pursuant to ORG , unless otherwise provided by LAW . The parties to the proceedings were invited to make their statements in writing . An oral hearing was held only exceptionally , the LAW providing as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The Agency shall adopt decisions without a hearing .", "( CARDINAL ) Notwithstanding the first paragraph , the president of the senate may convene a hearing if he or she considers that this is necessary in order to explain or establish relevant facts .", "( CARDINAL ) The president of the senate may , without a hearing , hear parties to the action and other persons if he or she considers that this is necessary in order to explain or establish relevant facts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Oral hearings in judicial review proceedings were specifically ruled out by LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , with regard to the reasons for revoking an individual \u2019s trading licence , the Act provided as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The Agency shall withdraw a licence to provide services ...", "CARDINAL . if a stockbroker acts in severe contravention of the rules pertaining to the organised market ( LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) The following shall be deemed a severe violation of the provisions referred to in items CARDINAL and/or CARDINAL of the first paragraph of this Article ...", "CARDINAL . recurring violations of the said provisions . \u201d", "\u201c In providing services with regard to the securities on the organised securities market , brokerage firms shall be obliged to comply with the trading rules and other general acts of the stock exchange and with the requirements of the responsible bodies of the stock exchange . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
