NORP The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent authority rejected the applicant \u2019s request to be granted a disability pension ( Invalidenrente ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint in which she requested that the decision of DATE be quashed and that she be granted a disability pension . On CARDINAL DATE ORG of the GPE of Bern rejected her complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel informed the applicant that she would not lodge an appeal with ORG . She referred to a conversation with the applicant \u2019s daughter in this respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who had been unable to find new counsel before the expiry of the time - limit for a complaint to ORG on DATE , personally lodged her complaint with ORG . In her complaint she requested ORG to quash the judgment given by ORG on DATE . She submitted that the relevant amount in dispute had been attained as the case concerned social benefits ( ORG ) to be granted retroactively as from DATE . She further submitted that ORG had failed correctly to assess the available evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s complaint for adjudication as being inadmissible . ORG observed that under LAW on ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL , below ) the legal petition had to contain the request for relief . Relying on its own case - law , ORG further recalled that it was , as a rule , not sufficient to request the impugned decision to be quashed , but that the petition had to contain a request on the merits ( materieller Antrag ) . This request for relief could also be contained in the reasoning of the petition .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s request to quash ORG judgment was insufficient , as it did not contain a statement as to how the court should decide on the merits . ORG further considered that the reasoning submitted by the applicant did not contain a sufficient request on the merits . The applicant had completely failed to submit which sort of benefits she claimed ( e.g. medical or professional rehabilitation measures , disability pension , respectively the starting point and the amount of pension rights claimed ) . There was no room for setting an appropriate time - limit , as this was only permitted under the circumstances enumerated in LAW and CARDINAL of LAW on ORG , which did not apply to the instant case of clearly insufficient reasoning of the petition .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW on ORG ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber das Bundesgericht ) , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Legal petitions have to be submitted in CARDINAL of the official languages and have to contain the request for relief , the reasons therefore , together with a list of evidence and the signature .", "( CARDINAL ) The reasons have to contain succinct submissions as to why the impugned act is against the law ...", "...", "( CARDINAL ) In case of lack of the party \u2019s or its representative \u2019s signature , of the power of attorney or of the required enclosures or in case representation is not permitted , [ ORG ] sets an appropriate time - limit for amendment together with the warning that the petition will otherwise not be taken into account .", "( CARDINAL ) Illegible , inappropriate , incomprehensible [ and ] excessively extensive petitions and [ petitions ] which are not submitted in an official language may be rejected for amendment in the same way .", "... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
