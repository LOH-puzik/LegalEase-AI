The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , who was represented by a NORP lawyer throughout the proceedings , initiated civil proceedings against a public prosecutor assigned to ORG , ORG itself , and ORG , alleging a violation of his personality rights . Given the subject matter of the dispute , the applicant was exempt from having to advance the court fees , by virtue of section CARDINAL of Act no . ORG of DATE on Stamp Duties , as in force at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the applicant complained that a letter sent in the course of criminal proceedings conducted against him by the public prosecutor to ORG , the trial court in his case , had contained false information about him and thus infringed his right to honour , dignity and reputation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently modified his claim , seeking non - pecuniary damages in respect of a violation of his personality rights in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . It appears that the amount claimed was an expression of the applicant \u2019s personal estimation of the value of his reputation , rather than a sum deduced from relevant domestic jurisprudence ; however , in the ensuing procedure the applicant maintained this claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered a judgment on DATE . It discontinued the proceedings against ORG , since it had no procedural standing . As to the remainder of the claims , it held that the applicant \u2019s right to reputation had been violated by the public prosecutor \u2019s statements and ordered the public prosecutor to present her apologies to the applicant . However , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation , stating that it was excessive and in any event he could not prove that he had suffered any actual damage . The court further applied section CARDINAL of Act no . ORG of DATE on Stamp Duties and ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in court fees . Under this rule , at the material time , the amount of stamp duty in civil cases was PERCENT of the claim but should attain a minimum of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) and should not exceed a maximum of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) . In a subsequent supplementary decision on court costs , the court explained that the law required the payment of court fees proportionately to the dismissed part of the claim , and observed that the applicant \u2019s claim was far beyond the amounts normally awarded in similar cases .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the respondents appealed to ORG , which dismissed the appeal on DATE . As regards the costs , the court upheld the position taken by ORG , that is , that the applicant should pay court fees calculated as a percentage of the dismissed part of his claims . It further ordered the applicant to pay ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in appellate fees .", "CARDINAL . NORP The respondents sought the review of the final decision before ORG , arguing that the statements of a prosecutor expressed in the course of criminal proceedings could not violate the accused \u2019s personality rights , even if they were detrimental to him . By a decision of DATE ORG quashed the final decision and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action in its entirety . It found that the opinion of the public prosecutor had been expressed in the context of the criminal proceedings conducted against the applicant and thus constituted a legitimate exercise of her powers as a prosecutor . ORG further ordered the applicant to pay the court fees related to the first- and second - instance and the review proceedings in the amount of altogether ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , instead of the aggregate amount of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in principle applicable under sections DATE , CARDINAL and QUANTITY on Stamp Duties ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
