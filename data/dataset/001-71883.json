The respondent Government were represented by their agent Ambassador PERSON , former Head of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicants arrived at FAC on a flight from GPE ( GPE ) . They were in possession of passports , flight tickets and tourist visas for GPE .", "On DATE they presented themselves to the airport and border police . They requested asylum , claiming that they had fled GPE because of political persecution and that in GPE they risked deportation to GPE . They further submitted that they were no longer in possession of passports .", "Noting that the applicants had no passports and had not arrived directly from the ORG where they feared persecution , the airport and border police refused them leave to enter NORP territory .", "The applicants were offered lodging in a special transit zone ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) in a locked container near the airport which was equipped with beds and where food was provided . They refused and continued to stay in the main transit zone of the airport .", "On DATE the applicants made statements to officers of ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) .", "They said that they had left GPE in DATE as the first applicant had been persecuted by ORG ( ORG ) . Since DATE they had been living in GPE with tourist visas which they renewed DATE by travelling to GPE and subsequently re - entering GPE . The first applicant had obtained refugee status from the ORG in GPE . They had not filed an asylum request in GPE as they feared that once the NORP authorities became aware of their presence they would be deported . They added that they had destroyed their passports upon their arrival at FAC in order to avoid deportation .", "DATE ORG dismissed the ORG request for asylum . It noted that the applicants had come from GPE where they were safe from persecution .", "Subsequently , at a hearing before ORG on DATE , the applicants explained that it was in fact only after that decision that they had destroyed their passports .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the Schwechat ORG ) ordered the applicants\u2019 deportation to GPE , stipulating that if the deportation could not be effected , the applicants were to remain in the transit zone of the airport .", "Flights from GPE to GPE left DATE , on DATE .", "On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the applicants\u2019 deportation to GPE had to be postponed as they could not be found in the transit zone . Another attempt was made to deport them on DATE , but proved to no avail as the applicants did not comply with the order to board the flight and the authorities refused to employ force .", "Meanwhile ORG UNCHR in GPE was informed about the applicants\u2019 situation . It gave a favourable opinion on the applicants\u2019 deportation .", "In TIME of CARDINAL DATE the applicants were placed under police surveillance in order to ensure their deportation on a flight to GPE TIME . Their deportation was however postponed indefinitely after information was received from the NORP authorities that they would not accept the applicants without passports . The police surveillance was stopped at TIME that day .", "Meanwhile , the applicants\u2019 case attracted the attention of the media , and several articles about their situation appeared in NORP newspapers .", "On DATE ORG UNCHR in GPE stated that in GPE the applicants would risk deportation to GPE .

It noted that the ORG \u2019s decision was void as it was based on the DATE LAW which , in the meantime , had been replaced by DATE Asylum Act . It therefore directed that the proceedings should resume at the stage of ORG decision . However , the applicants did not pursue the proceedings any further .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicants lodged complaints with ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat ) . They complained that their stay in the transit zone and the authorities\u2019 attempts to deport them to GPE had been unlawful as they should have been allowed to enter GPE as asylum seekers who had come from a country where they feared persecution . They further complained that their stay in the transit zone was contrary to Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . They submitted that they had been left to their own devices without appropriate sleeping or sanitary facilities . Furthermore , there was no statutory right to bring proceedings by which the lawfulness of their detention could be reviewed speedily by a court and their release ordered if their detention was unlawful .", "On DATE , after a hearing on DATE , ORG ( ORG ) dismissed the complaint concerning the NORP authorities\u2019 refusal to let the applicants enter GPE and rejected the complaint concerning their stay in the transit zone . It found that the refusal to let the applicants enter GPE and the subsequent attempts to enforce their departure had been lawful , as they did not possess valid passports and had no right to enter under the relevant provisions of LAW , since they had come from GPE where they were safe from persecution .", "The ORG further found that the stay in the transit zone had not been ordered by , and was therefore not attributable to , the NORP authorities . The applicants , who had been free to leave GPE , had remained of their own free will . It further noted that the situation in the case before it differed from the PERSON case ( PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL ) in that the applicants were free to move about the transit zone and had not been placed under surveillance . They had also been in contact with the media and a humanitarian organisation , ORG , in GPE , which provided , inter alia , legal assistance .

It confirmed the ORG \u2019s findings in this regard . This decision was served on the applicants\u2019 counsel on DATE .", "Meanwhile , in DATE , the applicants had left GPE for GPE .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( PERSON ) DATE stipulates that aliens who do not satisfy relevant passport or visa obligations shall be prevented ( GPE ) from entering the NORP territory .

If departure is not immediately possible the officer may order the alien to stay in a designated place in the border control area until he or she leaves the territory .", "Section CARDINAL forbids the expulsion of an alien to a State where there is good reason to believe that he or she will be exposed to the risk of inhuman treatment or punishment or the death penalty or will be persecuted , within the meaning of LAW relating to LAW .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ) DATE defines a refugee as a person who has left his or her home country because of a well - founded fear of persecution on account of his or her race , religion , nationality or adherence to a particular social group or political opinion .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) states that asylum is not to be granted to a refugee who has already found a safe haven from persecution in another country .", "Section CARDINAL ) provides that an asylum seeker who has come directly from the ORG where he allegedly suffered persecution shall be allowed to enter GPE without any formalities .", "By virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , an asylum seeker who has entered GPE in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( that is to say , who has come directly from the ORG where he allegedly suffered persecution ) and who files his request for asylum within DATE , has a temporary right of residence .", "Both LAW DATE and LAW DATE have now been amended .", "ORG zum PERSON der pers\u00f6nlichen PERSON ) provides protection against the intentional deprivation of liberty . In particular , it provides for compensation for unlawful detention and a procedure by which the lawfulness of detention is decided by a body , ORG , within DATE after the complaint is lodged . If the detention is unlawful , an order must be made for the release of the person detained .", "However , according to ORG settled case - law ( see its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ; PERSON . [ Collection of Judgments and Decisions of ORG ] CARDINAL ) a mere order to stay in the main transit zone of an airport after leave to enter GPE has been refused does not amount to an arbitrary deprivation of liberty . The above mentioned LAW is therefore inapplicable . On the other hand , an order requiring foreigners to stay in the special transit zone at FAC may , in certain circumstances , constitute a deprivation of liberty .", "By virtue of Section CARDINALa ( CARDINAL ) of ORG have jurisdiction , inter alia , to examine complaints from persons who allege a violation of their rights as a result of the exercise of direct administrative authority and coercion ( ORG unmittelbarer verwaltungsbeh\u00f6rdlicher Befehls- PERSON ) .", "A refusal by the border police to admit foreigners arriving at FAC into GPE is deemed to be an exercise of direct administrative authority and coercion .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG deals with the administrative authorities\u2019 duty to give a decision .
