According to the ORG , the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention were sufficient to meet his basic needs and compatible with his state of health . While the records enabling the identification of the applicant \u2019s inmates and their health status had not been preserved , inmates suffering from contagious diseases were segregated from other detainees in accordance with the applicable rules . The Government provided numbers of various cells in which the applicant was held throughout his time in GPE and indicated that these cells measured from QUANTITY and were designed to accommodate CARDINAL inmates each and had not been overcrowded . They were equipped with windows giving sufficient access to natural light , had functioning sanitary facilities , tap water , heating , electric light and ventilation . Detainees were provided with CARDINAL meals per day , TIME DATE walks and DATE access to bathing facilities .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The court also dismissed allegations of ill - treatment raised in respect of the applicant and some of his co - defendants as unsubstantiated .

On DATE the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against this judgment . In his statement of appeal , the applicant reiterated his innocence and his allegations of ill - treatment advanced during the trial . He also reiterated that no medical assistance necessitated by his chronic conditions had been made available to him in GPE and that the conditions of his and his co - defendants\u2019 transport to the court LOC had been inhuman . In this respect he noted that on DATE the convoy had made him and his co - defendants run to the sixth - floor courtroom while handcuffed and bent over and that on DATE the detainees had been arbitrarily held in the prison van for TIME on the way back to the GPE . The applicant further complained in his cassation appeal of a breach of his right to mount a defence . He noted in this respect that he had not been provided with a lawyer upon his arrest ; his request to have his father appointed as his lay defender had been rejected ; and his lawyer PERSON had not attended the hearing of CARDINAL DATE . Finally , the applicant complained that his right to have sufficient time and facilities for the preparation of his defence had been breached , as ORG had rejected his request for an extension of time in which to study the case - file materials in preparation for the trial . The applicant also mentioned that he was intending to supplement his statement of appeal with further submissions . No copies of any such submissions were provided to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE re - qualified the applicant \u2019s conviction for smuggling as aiding and abetting smuggling and otherwise upheld the first - instance court \u2019s judgment .

In its decision , ORG noted , in particular , that the evidence of the applicant \u2019s guilt included the testimony of his co - defendants and victims of his crimes given during the trial and that there was no evidence that any statements obtained during the pre - trial investigation had been extracted through ill - treatment or in breach of the applicant \u2019s or his co - defendants\u2019 right to mount a defence . Finally , it noted that ORG had properly rejected the applicant \u2019s request for further time in which to study the case - file materials , as it was unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was transferred to Sokyriany no . CARDINAL ORG ( \u201c LOC \u201d ) to serve his sentence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer , based in GPE , GPE , asked ORG to send him a number of documents from the applicant \u2019s case file by post .", "CARDINAL .

DATE and QUANTITY DATE the applicant was detained in GPE pre - trial detention facility ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) awaiting the review of his conviction in the cassation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the conditions of his detention were detrimental to his health and incompatible with human dignity . In particular , the facility was extremely overcrowded . A cell which contained CARDINAL sleeping places was occupied by CARDINAL inmates . The window was covered with metal shutters , barely letting in air and light . The electric light provided in DATE was so dim that reading or writing could hurt the eyes . The sanitary facilities were not separated from DATE . The cell was not ventilated , the metal shutters overheated and the temperature often reached QUANTITY . The air , mattresses and pillows were very damp . The provision and change of bedding was irregular . During the one - and - a - half months in which he was held there , the applicant only once had access to the bathing facility .

According to the Government , the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention were reasonably adapted to his needs . The applicant stayed in cells nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , measuring QUANTITY , QUANTITY and QUANTITY respectively . At the material time cell CARDINAL , which was designed to accommodate CARDINAL inmates , was occupied by CARDINAL ; cell CARDINAL , which was designed to accommodate CARDINAL inmates , was occupied by CARDINAL ; and cell CARDINAL , which was designed for CARDINAL inmates , was filled to its capacity . All of the cells were equipped with windows letting in natural light and fresh air , sanitary facilities , sinks , artificial ventilation , refrigerators and televisions . The average temperature in the cells was QUANTITY . The detainees were supplied with soap and bedding , which was regularly changed , and could also buy toiletries in the GPE shop , if they so wished . They were also provided with CARDINAL meals a day , and were allowed DATE TIME walks and DATE access to the bathing facility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to ORG , where he served his sentence until DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , upon his arrival on DATE and until DATE he was detained in the intake area ( quarantine cell ) , which was very damp and unheated . His warm civilian clothes were seized and he was provided with a prison uniform in a size too small for him . This was not remedied until DATE , when his mother brought warm clothes , which he was allowed to keep . During his mother \u2019s visit , the applicant was allowed to stay with her in the colony \u2019s visitor hostel , which was also barely heated . On various occasions the administration blocked or delayed the applicant \u2019s correspondence and the delivery of NORP newspapers to which the applicant subscribed . The applicant was not provided with appropriate medical care and treatment . In addition , the colony administration exerted arbitrary psychological pressure on him by subjecting him to special supervision ( for example , the administration placed his bed by the entrance door to the cell in order to be able to supervise him more effectively ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he and his mother ( on his behalf ) brought the aforementioned matters to the attention of the colony administration and the prosecutor \u2019s office . However , their complaints were either not dispatched , ignored , or poorly investigated into .", "CARDINAL . As is evident from the case file , in DATE the applicant \u2019s mother lodged several complaints with various authorities , in which she referred to irregularities in the colony postal unit \u2019s handling of the applicant \u2019s correspondence and periodical subscriptions , a prohibition on the detainees keeping sugar in the cells , the poor heating of the colony \u2019s visitor hostel and the disappearance of CARDINAL hryvnias ( ORG ) transferred by her to the applicant \u2019s account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG acknowledged certain irregularities in the operation of the colony \u2019s postal unit in their responses to the applicant \u2019s mother and notified her that disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against the officer responsible , while the colony governor had been instructed to improve the oversight of the postal service operation . They further noted that the detainees were forbidden to keep sugar in the cells to prevent alcohol production by them and that in DATE the visitor accommodation had been equipped with movable radiators . Finally , they assured the applicant \u2019s mother that the money purportedly lost had been duly credited to the applicant \u2019s account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother wrote a letter to ORG acknowledging an improvement in the delivery of the applicant \u2019s correspondence and thanking them for their intervention .", "CARDINAL .

Having left GPE on DATE , the applicant arrived in ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the conditions of his transport were incompatible with his state of health and with human dignity . Long distances were covered in prison trains and shorter ones in prison vans . The transit took DATE because he was made to join various groups of prisoners making various shorter connections . The prison train carriages had compartments designed for CARDINAL to CARDINAL passengers , which were occupied by QUANTITY or more detainees and their belongings . The overcrowded compartments were not ventilated and in the summer heat ( QUANTITY ) the metal carriages overheated , making it hard to breathe . Reaching a destination took very long time , as upon arrival at an intermediate stop the cars often waited for TIME for additional prisoners to be brought to the station or for a new locomotive to be connected to the train . A distance that would be covered in TIME in a regular train could take TIME or more . The guards escorted the detainees to the bathroom only once TIME and there was no opportunity to go otherwise . The conditions of transport in the vans were also very uncomfortable . The vans had no windows and largely no ventilation . On many occasions they also took long stops and became overheated in the DATE sun , aggravating the symptoms of the applicant \u2019s heart and vascular problems and causing him to suffer intolerably .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further maintained that the physical conditions in the detention facilities which accommodated him as a detainee in transit between various train and van rides were likewise not suitable for habitation . For instance , the cell in PERSON had a window facing the inner corridor with no access to natural light . Cell no . CARDINAL in GPE was located in the basement . It was damp with water dripping from the ceiling and walls covered in mould . Both facilities were heavily overcrowded , with detainees taking turns to sleep , were poorly lit , ventilated and infested with insects . The sanitary facilities in them were not separated from DATE .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the poor physical conditions of detention and transport , the detainees in transit were also subjected to cruel and arbitrary practices by the convoy officers and prison guards . In particular , upon arrival and before departure they often had to spend TIME or so in overcrowded holding areas sitting in squat positions with their hands behind their heads . Guards also often made detainees assume a squat or other unnatural positions when moving somewhere , shouted , insulted , pushed and beat the prisoners , and performed unnecessary and degrading searches . The status of a prisoner in transit not having been sufficiently addressed in law and regulations , the administrative practice was not to provide them with bedding , not to segregate inmates sick with contagious diseases , and deny appropriate medical assistance or any communication with the outside world , including correspondence and visits .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the travel journals containing the particulars of the conditions of the applicant \u2019s transit had been destroyed . However , they asserted that the conditions of the applicant \u2019s transport and detention in transit points had been reasonably adapted to meeting his needs . Prison train carriages were designed to accommodate CARDINAL people . They contained large compartments measuring QUANTITY designed to accommodate CARDINAL people and smaller compartments of QUANTITY designed to accommodate CARDINAL people . It was permissible to put CARDINAL and QUANTITY people in large and smaller compartments respectively during trips that took TIME . All train cars were supplied with artificial ventilation and it was also possible to open a window . Prison vans measured QUANTITY inside and were designed to accommodate CARDINAL people in CARDINAL compartments ( CARDINAL larger ones designed for QUANTITY passengers each and CARDINAL small compartment for CARDINAL passengers ) . The vans had no windows , but they were equipped with vents and benches for sitting on .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s arrival at FAC in DATE , his medical file was found to be missing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother complained to ORG concerning ORG administration \u2019s decision to allow the applicant \u2019s transfer in DATE heat and its failure to include his medical file in his travel documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office notified the applicant \u2019s mother that according to ORG records , the applicant \u2019s medical file had been properly handed over to the convoy officers escorting him out of the colony ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
