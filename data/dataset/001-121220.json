They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicants are all active members of various law - enforcement agencies . Under the rules which were in force when the applicants took up duties , they were entitled to retire after DATE of service , irrespective of their age , or at DATE than the generally valid age - limit for old - age pension . These advantages were available in the form of a \u2018 service pension\u2019 ( szolg\u00e1lati nyugd\u00edj ) .", "As of DATE , the service pension as such was abolished by a legislative amendment ( Act no . ORG of DATE ) . In its stead , a so - called service allowance ( szolg\u00e1lati j\u00e1rand\u00f3s\u00e1g ) was instituted , with different amounts and conditions . In particular , the DATE age benefit is no longer applicable in cases like that of the applicants , and moreover , no special pension or allowance is available merely as a consequence of a CARDINAL-year long service . Furthermore , a CARDINAL - time benefit of CARDINAL months\u2019 salary due on retirement was also removed . In other words , under the new scheme the applicants\u2019 pension entitlement has become largely identical to that of the general population , despite the expectations they had when entering the service ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
