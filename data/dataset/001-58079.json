Secondly , we apprehend that the law of limitation is designed to encourage plaintiffs not to go to sleep on their rights , but to institute proceedings as soon as it is reasonably possible for ORG them to do so ... Thirdly , the law is intended to ensure that a person may with confidence feel that after a given time he may treat as being finally closed an incident which may have led to a claim against him ... But if the law of limitation is principally designed for the benefit of defendants , it would nevertheless be a mistake to lose sight of the interests of injured persons . A plaintiff who has lost the right to claim damages before he can know of the existence of that right must , in our view , inevitably feel that he has suffered injustice . \"", "In an attempt to balance these interests , the ORG recommended the retention of the DATE period for personal injury actions , but proposed that time should only start to run when the injured person knew , or could reasonably have ascertained , the nature of the injury and its attributability to an act or omission on the part of the defendant .
