During TIME , a series of offences occurred in GPE , GPE .", "The first , which may have occurred sometime after TIME , involved an attack on CARDINAL men in a parked car in a field near a public house in GPE . Just after the conclusion of sexual activities between the CARDINAL men ( Mr PERSON and PERSON ) , CARDINAL masked men appeared . CARDINAL carried a knife , the other a gun . PERSON was pulled out of the car and QUANTITY ( GBP ) was taken from him . On orders , he lay face down on the ground while the man with the knife kept guard over him . PERSON became aware of a third masked man . The robbers wanted to take the car which belonged to PERSON , who objected and was attacked . PERSON was made to crawl over to where PERSON was lying tied up . He was also tied up and gagged . Petrol was spread around both of them . PERSON saw a lit cigarette and passed out . When he recovered consciousness , PERSON 's FAC car had gone and PERSON was dead . The attackers had abandoned a stolen Spitfire car in which they had arrived on the scene in the entrance to a field , QUANTITY away .", "CARDINAL . This offence was followed , at TIME , by CARDINAL masked robbers arriving at the PERSON household in GPE . They entered by a back window . CARDINAL of them went into PERSON room ; one had a knife , the other a gun . Meanwhile , PERSON ( the father ) was awakened by the third robber armed with a revolver . He was taken into PERSON 's room . Both were told they would be shot if they did not cooperate . They attacked the robbers and forced them downstairs . In the struggle , PERSON arm was cut and an artery was severed . PERSON was forced back upstairs to the bedroom where his wife was waiting . A knife was pointed at her and she was told to remove her rings and jewellery or her fingers would be cut off . The other CARDINAL robbers ransacked the room before all CARDINAL fled taking PERSON 's Toyota car . PERSON was rushed to hospital . He was found to have a stab wound to his back that had punctured the pleural cavity and required the insertion of a chest drain . PERSON 's car was found abandoned nearby .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , at the home of PERSON in GPE , she and her partner ( Mr Almond ) awoke to find CARDINAL masked men in their bedroom . They were asked for money , jewellery and car keys . They told the intruders where to find them . ORG and Almond were bound and gagged and the house was ransacked . It was TIME before the robbers left , taking a large amount of property and the couple 's CARDINAL cars , a ORG and a Cavalier . PERSON ORG was found abandoned nearby .", "CARDINAL . There was considerable interest in the above events , including publication in the national media DATE of the offer of a reward of GBP CARDINAL for information leading to the conviction of the offenders . On DATE the police incident room received information that the persons responsible for the murder and other offences were living at FAC , GPE , GPE ( \u201c No . CARDINAL \u201d ) . In addition , the caller said that a considerable quantity of property which had been stolen during the course of the robberies had been taken by other persons resident at No . CARDINAL and stored at the flat of a female associate at ORG .", "CARDINAL . No . CARDINAL was owned by PERSON , who occupied the ground floor and basement . The remainder of the house , consisting of the CARDINAL upper floors , was divided into flats occupied by the applicants , PERSON and PERSON , amongst others . PERSON visited the house from time to time , most recently to help repair the wiring and various electrical appliances , and he was said to have been there on TIME DATE . PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were black .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL white men also lived at No . CARDINAL : PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . They were then aged DATE and DATE respectively . PERSON and PERSON sniffed glue on a regular basis . All CARDINAL had criminal records .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the information received by the police , search warrants were obtained for each of the CARDINAL addresses and were executed simultaneously at TIME on DATE . In a search of No . CARDINAL carried out sometime between TIME on DATE and TIME on DATE , the police found a brooch from the ORG robbery in ORG 's wastepaper basket . Other ORG items were found in a storeroom and , also in the storeroom , were some porcelain figurines ( not connected with these offences ) which bore PERSON 's fingerprints . Blood stains on a jacket found in PERSON 's bedroom were analysed and found to be of a blood group shared by PERCENT of the population , including the murder victim , PERSON . PERSON , PERSON , Jobbins and PERSON were arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary . PERSON was arrested on DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a DATE school student and girlfriend of ORG , produced to the police a number of items from ORG robbery , including CARDINAL eternity rings , a yellow metal watch strap and a lady 's watch . She told them that she visited PERSON quite regularly and was there during TIME DATE . She said that she did not know Jobbins , PERSON or PERSON except by sight .", "CARDINAL . PERSON informed the police that she had stayed with another resident of No . DATE , PERSON , for a period in DATE . She knew PERSON , PERSON , GPE , PERSON and PERSON . She had been at No . CARDINAL during TIME DATE and had stayed in ORG 's room .", "CARDINAL . The other search warrant was executed at CARDINAL ORG . It resulted in the arrest of the tenant , PERSON , who was the girlfriend of GPE , and the recovery of a large amount of stolen property .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was arrested on DATE after an extensive car chase by several police officers . At the time , he was carrying a revolver . In his statement he agreed that he had been to No . CARDINAL on several occasions and , on the night in question , was probably there until late . He denied involvement in the offences and said in police interviews that he might have spent TIME with a girlfriend .", "CARDINAL . The trial of the CARDINAL applicants and PERSON took place at ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution case was that the CARDINAL men had been involved in each incident . It was argued that there was evidence to link the offences : the PERSON Princess stolen from PERSON was found at the scene of the PERSON robbery ; the ORG stolen from the ORG was found abandoned close to the ORG / Almond household ; and the vehicles stolen from the latter couple were connected to the occupants of No . DATE . In addition , the witnesses to each of the robberies had described a team of CARDINAL robbers , CARDINAL of whom was carrying a gun and a second one a knife , dressed in black and wearing balaclavas .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution relied substantially upon the evidence of ORG . The latter admitted having jointly stolen the Spitfire which had been found abandoned near the scene of the first robbery and murder , and having driven the ORG and Cavalier stolen at the last robbery to a field in GPE where they had set fire to them . They gave evidence , inter alia , that on TIME , PERSON had asked if he could use the Spitfire and that he , PERSON and another black man had requested help in other ways , such as the loan of a balaclava and assistance in starting the NORP . ORG also gave evidence relating to the events of TIME ( DATE ) , when PERSON had allegedly made a number of incriminating comments about his own involvement in the crimes and had requested them to dispose of the stolen ORG cars and to store the stolen property elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the prosecution relied on the evidence of PERSON that PERSON had left her during TIME and had returned TIME at TIME ; that he gave her rings from the PERSON robbery in order to have them valued ; that he scratched his bedroom window with CARDINAL of the diamond rings and that he told her about the stolen cars . The prosecution also relied on the evidence of PERSON , that she had been given a plant by PERSON that , it was suggested , came from the boot of the car stolen from Almond . Finally , PERSON , an inmate at Her FAC Prison Brixton where PERSON had been held on remand , gave evidence of incriminating remarks allegedly made to him by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL of the accused denied any involvement in the offences . Their defence relied on the facts that PERSON and others had given evidence that PERSON and PERSON had been in their company at times during TIME to DATE which were inconsistent with a sighting of the Spitfire at a similar time close to the scene of the PERSON murder and that the victims of the offences , including PERSON , the ORG and ORG , had described their attackers as white . On behalf of PERSON it was argued that there was no evidence of his involvement in the preparatory acts or subsequent disposals .", "CARDINAL . The defence submitted that many of the witnesses for the prosecution were unreliable . Thus , PERSON 's evidence included a number of inconsistencies , as did the testimony and statements of ORG . It was argued that if anyone from No . CARDINAL had been responsible for the crimes , it was ORG , and that Jobbins , PERSON and PERSON had given a deliberately false account to the police in order to implicate the accused and thus exonerate themselves . PERSON may have been an accomplice because she knew PERSON and PERSON , and PERSON evidence may have been motivated by jealousy of PERSON 's relationship with another girlfriend and was in any event inconsistent with a letter which she had sent to PERSON whilst he was in prison . The defence sought to impugn PERSON 's evidence on the grounds that he may have lied in order to obtain parole . In addition , the defence referred to the substantial reward which had been offered as a factor which may have motivated prosecution witnesses to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . PERSON gave evidence , consistent with his statement to the police , that he had played no part in the offences and had had nothing to do with the NORP . He claimed to have spent TIME of DATE at home , and agreed with PERSON account of going out and not returning until TIME PERSON 's evidence was also consistent with his statement to the police . He denied having played any part in the offences and said that after returning to No . CARDINAL at TIME , he had then slept with PERSON PERSON throughout TIME . PERSON did not give evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the jury returned unanimous verdicts convicting the applicants and PERSON of murder , assault occasioning grievous bodily harm , and CARDINAL counts of robbery . They were each sentenced to concurrent terms of life , DATE and DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and PERSON appealed on the grounds , inter alia , that their convictions were unsafe and unsatisfactory because of weaknesses and inconsistencies in the evidence against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the first hearing before ORG , counsel for the prosecution handed to the court a document which was not shown to defence counsel . He sought ORG ruling on a matter of disclosure ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , and informed the court that the matter was sensitive to a degree which would require the court to hear him either ex parte or , if inter partes , only on an undertaking by defence counsel not to disclose what took place to their solicitors or clients . Both defence counsel indicated that they could not conscientiously give such an undertaking and withdrew from the hearing , which proceeded ex parte .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the issue of disclosure was re - canvassed before a differently constituted ORG ( although the Lord Chief Justice , PERSON , participated in both hearings ) , because defence counsel had reconsidered their position and had concluded that they had been incorrect in withdrawing voluntarily as they had done at the first hearing . It was argued by the defence that ( i ) defence counsel should have been permitted to hear the application by the ORG without giving an undertaking and ( ii ) counsel for the ORG should , at the least , have been obliged to disclose the category of material in question so that defence counsel could then have made submissions as to whether or not disclosure of material in that category should be ordered . ORG , in its judgment , remarked that the procedure to be followed when the prosecution was in possession of material which it believed should not be disclosed to the defence had been changed by the judgment in NORP v. Ward ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in that it was now for the court , and not the prosecution , to decide whether disclosure should be made , and set out a series of procedural guidelines to be followed in such cases ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . In conclusion , however , it refused to order disclosure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the outset of the hearing of the substantive appeal before a differently constituted ORG , defence counsel invited the court to order the ORG to disclose the name of any person or persons to whom any reward money had been paid for information given to the police concerning the applicants , and sought access to ORG concerning a complaint by ORG . The prosecution showed the court documents relevant to the request for disclosure which were not shown to the defence . However , defence counsel were able to make submissions as to the factors weighing in favour of disclosure and the nature of the balancing exercise to be undertaken by the court . Having considered those submissions and having examined the relevant documents , the court refused to order disclosure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicants ' convictions and that of PERSON , concluding that there was no basis to say that there was even a lurking doubt about their safety .", "CARDINAL . The applicants applied to ORG for leave to appeal to ORG , but this application was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the first applicant 's solicitor , with reference to NORP v. PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , asked ORG for disclosure of any reward claim made prior to the trial by any witness and , in particular , by CARDINAL of ORG , PERSON or PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied :", "\u201c Regarding the question raised in paragraph ( CARDINAL ) of your letter of DATE , you will know that the topic of rewards was raised by [ defence counsel ] at the outset of the appeal in this matter . This resulted in an ex parte application which was heard in camera . This application was upheld and referred to by ORG in his final judgment in these terms : ' We upheld the claim and refused to order disclosure of any kind for reasons we gave on DATE and which are recorded ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants applied to ORG for a review of the safety of their convictions . In DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) was set up under LAW DATE and the applicants ' case was transferred to it . In DATE the ORG appointed an officer from ORG to investigate the events surrounding the prosecution of the applicants and PERSON . The investigating officer 's report was submitted in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its report of DATE the ORG found , inter alia , that PERSON was a long - standing police informant , who , on DATE had approached a NORP police officer and told him that the applicants were responsible for the crimes of DATE . As a result of his assistance to the police and the evidence which he gave at the applicants ' trial , PERSON had received a reward of GBP CARDINAL , in addition to police protection DATE and immunity from prosecution in relation to his admitted participation as an accessory to the offences in question . It appeared from police records of the information supplied by PERSON that the latter had never identified PERSON as CARDINAL of the offenders . These facts had not previously been disclosed to the defence on grounds of public interest immunity . The ORG also found that \u201c the police were not keen that ORG should be prosecuted and there was a corresponding inertia on the part of the prosecuting authorities \u201d , and commented that \u201c if the jury had been aware of this then the credibility of ORG might have been assessed in a more critical manner \u201d . Moreover , PERSON had retracted his statement concerning the incriminating comments allegedly made by PERSON .", "The ORG concluded that , in the light of this new evidence , there was a real possibility that PERSON was not involved in the offences of CARDINAL to DATE . Whilst there was evidence linking the CARDINAL applicants to the robberies , if the prosecution case against CARDINAL of the CARDINAL , PERSON , might no longer be sustainable , in the PERSON 's view ORG ought at the same time to have the opportunity to consider whether the case could still be sustained against PERSON and PERSON . It therefore referred the convictions of the applicants and PERSON back to ORG , since it considered that there was a real possibility that these convictions would not be upheld if such a reference were made ( LAW DATE , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the adoption of the present judgment the applicants ' case is pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . At common law , the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial . The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Attorney - General issued Guidelines , which did not have the force of law , concerning exceptions to the common - law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL : \u201c the Guidelines \u201d ) . The Guidelines attempted to codify the rules of disclosure and to define the prosecution 's power to withhold \u201c unused material \u201d . Under paragraph CARDINAL , \u201c unused material \u201d was defined as :", "\u201c ( i ) All witness statements and documents which are not included in the committal bundle served on the defence ; ( ii ) the statements of any witnesses who are to be called to give evidence at the committal and ( if not in the bundle ) any documents referred to therein ; ( iii ) the unedited version(s ) of any edited statements or composite statement included in the committal bundles . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the Guidelines , the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within CARDINAL of the categories set out in paragraph CARDINAL . CARDINAL of these categories ( CARDINAL ) ) was \u201c sensitive \u201d material which , because of its sensitivity , it would not be in the public interest to disclose . \u201c Sensitive material \u201d was defined as follows :", "\u201c ... ( a ) it deals with matters of national security ; or it is by , or discloses the identity of , a member of ORG who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known ; ( b ) it is by , or discloses the identity of an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger ; ( c ) it is by , or discloses the identity of a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known ; ( d ) it contains details which , if they became known , might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect ; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime ; ( e ) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed , at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier \u2013 e.g. a bank official ; ( f ) it relates to other offences by , or serious allegations against , someone who is not an accused , or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him ; ( g ) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife . \u201d", "According to paragraph CARDINAL , \u201c in deciding whether or not statements containing sensitive material should be disclosed , a balance should be struck between the degree of sensitivity and the extent to which the information might assist the defence \u201d . The decision as to whether or not the balance in a particular case required disclosure of sensitive material was CARDINAL for the prosecution , although any doubt should be resolved in favour of disclosure . If either before or during the trial it became apparent that a duty to disclose had arisen , but that disclosure would not be in the public interest because of the sensitivity of the material , the prosecution would have to be abandoned .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent to the applicants ' trial in DATE , but before the appeal proceedings in DATE , the Guidelines were superseded by the common law .", "In NORP v. Ward ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) ORG dealt with the duties of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defence and the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claimed public interest immunity . It stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to be the judge of where the proper balance lay in a particular case , because :", "\u201c ... [ When ] the prosecution acted as judge in their own cause on the issue of public interest immunity in this case they committed a significant number of errors which affected the fairness of the proceedings . Policy considerations therefore powerfully reinforce the view that it would be wrong to allow the prosecution to withhold material documents without giving any notice of that fact to the defence . If , in a wholly exceptional case , the prosecution are not prepared to have the issue of public interest immunity determined by a court , the result must inevitably be that the prosecution will have to be abandoned . \u201d", "ORG described the balancing exercise to be performed by the judge as follows :", "\u201c ... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against , on the other hand , the interests of justice . Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life , the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG emphasised that , in performing the balancing exercise referred to in Ward , the court must view the material itself :", "\u201c In our judgment the exclusion of the evidence without an opportunity of testing its relevance and importance amounted to a material irregularity . When public interest immunity is claimed for a document , it is for the court to rule whether the claim should be upheld or not . To do that involves a balancing exercise . The exercise can only be performed by the judge himself examining or viewing the evidence , so as to have the facts of what it contains in mind . Only then can he be in a position to balance the competing interests of public interest immunity and fairness to the party claiming disclosure . \u201d", "This judgment also clarified that , where an accused appeals to ORG on the ground that material has been wrongly withheld , ORG will itself view the material ex parte .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity , and outlined CARDINAL different procedures to be adopted .", "The first procedure , which had generally to be followed , was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held . The defence then had the opportunity to make representations to the court .", "Secondly , however , where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed , the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made , but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte .", "The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question . In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that , although ex parte applications limited the rights of the defence , in some cases the only alternative would be to require the prosecution to choose between following an inter partes procedure or declining to prosecute , and in rare but serious cases the abandonment of a prosecution in order to protect sensitive evidence would be contrary to the public interest . It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing , the defence had \u201c as much protection as can be given without pre - empting the issue \u201d . Finally , it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed . Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure \u201c in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant \u201d . For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicants ' appeal , the NORP courts further clarified the principles and procedures relating to the issue of disclosure .", "In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) ORG emphasised that , since the ex parte procedure outlined in PERSON , PERSON and PERSON was \u201c contrary to the general principle of open justice in criminal trials \u201d , it should be used only in exceptional cases . It would be an abdication of the prosecution 's duty if , out of an abundance of caution , it were simply \u201c to dump all its unused material in the court 's lap and leave it to the judge to sort through it regardless of its materiality to the issues present or potential \u201d . Thus , the prosecution should put before the court only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold . \u201c Material \u201d evidence was that which could , on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution , be seen ( i ) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case ; ( ii ) to raise or possibly raise a new issue the existence of which was not apparent from the evidence the prosecution proposed to use ; or ( iii ) to hold out a real ( as opposed to fanciful ) prospect of providing a lead of evidence going to ( i ) or ( ii ) . Exceptionally , in case of doubt about the materiality of the documents or evidence , the court might be asked to rule on the issue . In order to assist the prosecution in deciding whether evidence in its possession was \u201c material \u201d , and the judge in performing the balancing exercise , it was open to the defence to indicate any defence or issue which they proposed to raise .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON ( The ORG , DATE ) , ORG held that a failure by the prosecution to disclose the fact that a prosecution witness whose evidence was challenged had applied for or received a reward for giving information was a material irregularity which justified overturning a conviction .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG reviewed the operation of the Guidelines . It stated :", "\u201c The Attorney - General 's objective was no doubt to improve the existing practice of disclosure by the ORG . That was a laudable objective . But the Attorney - General was not trying to make law and it was certainly beyond his power to do so ... The Guidelines are merely a set of instructions to ORG lawyers and prosecuting counsel ... Judged simply as a set of instructions to prosecutors , the LAW would be unobjectionable if they exactly matched the contours of the common law duty of disclosure ... But if the LAW , judged by the standards of DATE , reduce the common law duties of the ORG and thus abridge the common law rights of a defendant , they must be pro tanto unlawful ...", "[ T]oday , the Guidelines do not conform to the requirements of the law of disclosure in a number of critically important respects . First , the judgment in LOC established that it is for the court , not prosecuting counsel , to decide on disputed questions as to discloseable materials , and on any asserted legal ground to withhold production of relevant material ... For present purposes the point of supreme importance is that there is no hint in the Guidelines of the primacy of the court in deciding on issues of disclosure ... Secondly , the LAW are not an exhaustive statement of the ORG 's common law duty of disclosure : NORP v. Ward at CARDINAL and CARDINALD. To that extent too the Guidelines are out of date . Thirdly , the LAW were drafted before major developments in the field of public interest immunity . [ I]n paragraph CARDINAL the Guidelines are cast in the form of a prosecutor 's discretion ... Much of what is listed as ' sensitive material ' is no doubt covered by public interest immunity . But not everything so listed is covered by public interest immunity ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG returned to the balancing exercise , stating , inter alia :", "\u201c Since NORP v. Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants ' names and roles , alleging that those details are essential to the defence . Defences that the accused has been set up , and allegations of duress , which used at one time to be rare , have multiplied . We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care . They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details , because they are essential to the running of the defence , are justified . If they are not so justified , then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure . Clearly , there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will . Again , there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more ; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting , surrounding , or following the crime . Even when the informant has participated , the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence , present or potential , as to make disclosure necessary ...", "It is sufficient for us to say that in this case we are satisfied that the information concerning the informant showed a participation in the events concerning this crime which , coupled with the way in which the defence was raised from the very first moment by the defendant when he said that he was being set up , gave rise to the need for the defence to be aware of the identity of the informant and his role in this matter . We , therefore , conclude that if CARDINAL applies the principle which has been quoted from NORP v. PERSON ... to the facts of the present case , there could only be one answer to the question as to whether the details concerning this informer were so important to the issues of interest to the defence , present and potential , that the balance which the judge had to strike came down firmly in favour of disclosure . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE a new statutory scheme covering disclosure by the prosecution came into force in GPE and GPE . Under LAW , the prosecution must make \u201c primary disclosure \u201d of all previously undisclosed evidence which , in the prosecutor 's view , might undermine the case for the prosecution . The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court , setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution . The prosecution must then make a \u201c secondary disclosure \u201d of all previously undisclosed material \u201c which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused 's defence as disclosed by the defence statement \u201d . Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court .", "CARDINAL . Following the judgments of ORG in PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) and ORG and Others and PERSON and Others v. GPE ( DATE , Reports CARDINAL-IV ) GPE has introduced legislation making provision for the appointment of a \u201c special counsel \u201d in certain cases involving national security . The provisions are contained in ORG Act DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) and LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Under this legislation , where it is necessary on national security grounds for the relevant tribunal to sit in camera , in the absence of the affected individual and his or her legal representatives , the Attorney - General may appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings .
