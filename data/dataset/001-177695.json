The applicant company is a prominent NORP book - publishing house with its registered office in GPE . In DATE it was ranked among the CARDINAL publishing firms generating the highest turnover in the NORP publishing sector .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company published a book entitled \u201c ORG \u201d written by PERSON , an author internationally renowned for her anti - Mafia publications . The book was reprinted in several editions and also published in GPE . It deals , in its CARDINAL pages , with the ORG \u2019s ties to GPE , its inner structures and its various branches . The book also recounts an event which took place in DATE in GPE where CARDINAL people of NORP nationality were killed by CARDINAL bullets in front of the NORP restaurant \u201c ORG \u201d . The killings were supposed to be the culmination of a vendetta between CARDINAL \u2018 PERSON families which had started in DATE in GPE . The incident received national and international media attention .", "CARDINAL . On pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL the book referred , by his full name , to a person called PERSON , an NORP national residing in GPE . The relevant part reads as follows ( translated , names abbreviated and emphasises added by ORG ) :", "\u201c ... The public prosecutor \u2019s office of GPE investigated the NORP [ L ] for drug dealing and money laundering \u2013 he is said to have contributed to financing the electoral campaign of [ O ] with his funds . This was not to remain the sole link existing between a presumed member of the ORG and a NORP politician : in the city of GPE , the NORP [ GPE ] , who had been mentioned already in DATE in a report prepared by ORG , gained notoriety . [ PERSON ] runs the restaurant \u2018 [ Pa]\u2019 in GPE : a restaurant seating CARDINAL guests , not a bad rise for someone like [ GPE ] , who , according to statements of the investigators , had started out as a pizza baker in the pizza restaurant \u2018 Da Bruno\u2019 . After all , having contacts can be very helpful , even if , following the massacre of GPE , the pizza restaurant \u2018 Da Bruno\u2019 no longer serves as that great a reference . In any case , [ PERSON ] continued to maintain his network of relationships in GPE by generously sponsoring the local golf club . When the police performed a search of the restaurant \u2018 [ Pa]\u2019 because of [ GPE ] \u2019s alleged involvement in a murder , it ran into the then Prime Minister of GPE , [ GPE ] , and his Secretary of the ORG , [ PERSON ] \u2013 both of whom had been dining there purely as a matter of chance , as [ PERSON ] asserted . He , by the way , had excellent relations with the police : when a further search was performed , the police found an identity card in his LOC , which had been issued to him in his purported capacity as interpreter for the NORP delegation at an ORG conference in GPE . The identity card , it was stated , had been issued by the Secretary of ORG GPE . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON \u2019s presumed membership of the \u2018 PERSON , the applicant company relied on , inter alia , reports by ORG and DATE . Neither report had been made public .", "CARDINAL . The relevant passage in the report of DATE reads :", "\u201c If CARDINAL takes account of the enormous reputation that [ GPE ] has and the esteem in which he is held by the NORP community , one forms the opinion that [ PERSON ] is a defacto fully - fledged member of the \u2018 PERSON clan . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the report of DATE read :", "\u201c According to NORP colleagues from GPE and GPE , this connection could have contributed to [ PERSON ] becoming a member of the PERSON alias \u2018 Staccu\u2019 clan . Owing to the prestigious reputation [ PERSON ] enjoys in the \u2018 NORP PERSON , he has to be a full member of the \u2018 PERSON .", "...", "Direct relatives of the clan live in GPE and run pizza restaurants . Their main bases are in the cities of GPE , GPE , and GPE . These bases are led by [ TIME ] , [ ORG ] and [ PERSON ] , with [ D.G. ] taking the role of the so - called \u2018 capo locale\u2019 .", "...", "[ ORG ] and [ PERSON ] could be in charge of investing the proceeds of drug trafficking . This theory is corroborated by the high number of good restaurants and statements from various sources that [ PERSON ] is said to have invested in several restaurants and acquired real estate in GPE and the surrounding areas . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON had already been mentioned by name in the context of organised crime . He had been interviewed in a television report regarding the \u2018 PERSON in GPE and had denied any membership of or connection to the \u2018 PERSON .", "CARDINAL . After publication of the book , PERSON applied to a court for an injunction against the dissemination of the passages highlighted in the above excerpt of the book ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE , ORG issued the injunction and confirmed it on DATE after hearing both parties . It held that even though there was a public interest in reporting about organised crime , the author had acted in breach of her journalistic duties . The internal reports of ORG constituted an insufficient source for the allegations made in the book , since the reports were not intended for publication . The investigating authorities themselves had not come to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence of an offence having been committed by the plaintiff . Moreover , ORG stated , a report on a suspicion also had to include the circumstances exonerating the party affected . Accordingly , the book should have stated that the investigating authorities had not obtained any indications which would have served as a basis for filing an indictment , much less a sentence , and that in fact the investigations pursued against the plaintiff had not resulted in any such bringing of charges or in any sentencing . In addition , the court held , the publication had not made it clear that the pizza restaurant \u201c ORG \u201d , in which the murders had been perpetrated , was not identical to the pizza restaurant of the same name in which the plaintiff had worked as a pizza baker DATE prior to those deeds . Lastly , the court continued , the book had been published unlawfully because the plaintiff had not been given any opportunity to make a statement regarding the suspicion prior to publication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment of DATE . It held that the book expressed a serious allegation that the plaintiff was a member of a criminal organisation and therefore seriously interfered with his personality rights . The section of the book dealing with the plaintiff did not allow an average reader to infer that the plaintiff \u2019s membership of the criminal organisation \u2018 PERSON could only be assumed vaguely . Rather , the court continued , the interplay of the many individual statements in the book created the impression that there was a very strong suspicion that the plaintiff was a member of the \u2018 PERSON . The evidentiary facts researched by the author and published by the applicant company did not constitute sufficient proof of the exceptionally grave suspicion raised in the book . The court established that even the internal report by ORG only mentioned a number of vague suspicious circumstances , for the most part without providing any details or naming any specific sources . For example , it said that because of the high respect in which the plaintiff was held in the \u201c NORP milieu \u201d , he must be a fully fledged member of the \u2018 PERSON . The internal reports only showed that owing to certain information compiled in them , some of which had not been corroborated by evidence , assumptions had been made as to the existence of certain connections . This did not seem to be a sufficient basis for publicly branding the plaintiff as a presumed \u02bdNdranghetista . Moreover , the court continued , certain statements in the book were incorrect , such as the region in which the plaintiff had been born . Other statements were fragmentary , as the investigation during which the plaintiff \u2019s restaurant was searched by the police had been discontinued . In that regard , the court held that the book had failed to report exonerating circumstances . Even though authors did not have to await the outcome of an investigation before reporting on a corresponding suspicion , if the reporting on a suspicion was reliant on investigations that had been carried out DATE previously , the author could not ignore the fact that the investigation proceedings had come to an end without any charges having been brought .", "CARDINAL . In the main proceedings , in addition to his request that the injunction be upheld , PERSON applied for damages in the amount of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG upheld the injunction , but dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s application for damages . ORG reiterated the reasoning it had given in the judgment of DATE and that given by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . The court further reiterated that the author had not sufficiently researched the basis for the allegation that PERSON was a member of the ORG , since all the sources only indicated vague suspicious circumstances pointing at FAC Secondly , the author had not complied with the \u201c absolute requirement \u201d of presenting exonerating circumstances . Lastly , the court held that the publication was unlawful as the author had not given the plaintiff the possibility to comment on the allegation prior to publication .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s application for damages as being ill - founded . It held that even though the applicant company had breached the permissible boundaries of reporting on suspicions as well as its journalistic diligence , it had not done so in a serious manner . Accordingly , it sufficed to stop the dissemination of the impugned statements but did not require a payment of damages .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings before ORG the applicant company offered to furnish certain evidence supporting the suspicion published in the book . In particular , it offered to provide the names of witnesses who could allegedly confirm the statements made in the internal report of ORG and the suspicion published in the book . ORG refused to hear the witnesses as it found that they would be unable to give evidence regarding the alleged membership and that the applicant company had failed to identify the specific issues on which the witnesses could testify .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company did not appeal against the judgment of ORG . The plaintiff , however , appealed against the dismissal of his claim for damages . Consequently , in so far as the judgment ordered the injunction , it became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , in addition to the injunction , sentenced the applicant company to pay damages in the amount of ORG CARDINAL and dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s further claim for damages . The court stated that the prerequisite for any entitlement to pecuniary compensation was a serious violation of personality rights which could not be compensated in any other way . It found that that prerequisite had been met in the plaintiff \u2019s case . As far as the violation of the plaintiff \u2019s personality right was concerned , ORG endorsed the reasoning of ORG . It expressly conceded to the applicant company that there was great public interest in obtaining information about criminal organisations and \u201c that the motivation of the author and of the defendant [ in the instant case : applicant company ] for informing the public on the activities pursued by the \u2018 PERSON in GPE was commendable and honest \u201d . However , ORG continued , the applicant company had acted culpably to a significant extent . It had been grossly negligent on the part of the applicant company to disseminate an allegation based on a suspicion which seriously interfered with the plaintiff \u2019s personality right in spite of the fact that the plaintiff had obviously not been given an opportunity to be heard and that the allegation had been disseminated without including the necessary information that the murder investigation addressed by the book subsequently had been discontinued . This charge of gross negligence could not be put aside because the author had tackled a subject of strong public interest . The applicant company should have realised that the information compiled about the plaintiff was not corroborated by evidence and that there were insufficient evidentiary facts to support the allegation reported in the book . The applicant company could not argue that it had not acted culpably , as it had based its publication on information obtained from a governmental authority . That principle , the court held , had been developed by the courts in adjudicating for official press releases issued by NORP authorities . However , the author had relied solely on internal analyses prepared by ORG as well as evaluation reports and documents generated in the course of intra - agency communications between NORP government authorities .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further reasoned that the injunction was not sufficient redress for the plaintiff , as it was not an adequate means of reaching the readers of a book that had already been published . Consequently , it found that the payment of damages was required . The court held that compensation in the amount of EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL , instead of the EUR CARDINAL claimed by the plaintiff , was both sufficient and adequate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed as illfounded a complaint lodged by the applicant company that it had been denied the right to be heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused to admit a constitutional complaint ( CARDINAL ) lodged by the applicant company , without providing reasons ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
