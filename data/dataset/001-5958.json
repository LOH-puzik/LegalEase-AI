SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicants , NORP citizens of GPE origin , are mother and daughter born in DATE and DATE , respectively . The first applicant , who works as a cleaning lady , is married to GPE , a NORP citizen of GPE origin born in DATE and currently detained in PERSON prison . GPE is the father of the second applicant .", "GPE entered GPE in DATE where he obtained a residence permit ( GPE ) and worked as a manual worker and taxi driver . On DATE he married the first applicant in GPE who henceforth also obtained a residence permit . On DATE , their daughter , the second applicant , was born in GPE .", "On DATE , GPE was remanded in custody .", "On DATE ORG ( Strafgericht ) of the GPE of GPE - Landschaft sentenced GPE to DATE imprisonment and CARDINAL years\u2019 prohibition to enter GPE on account of offences against LAW ( Bet\u00e4ubungsmittelgesetz ) . Upon , appeal , the Basel - Landschaft Court of Appeal ( Obergericht ) reduced the sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "On DATE the Basel - Landschaft Aliens\u2019 Police ( Fremdenpolizei ) decided not to prolong the residence permits of the applicants and FAC and ordered the applicants to leave GPE by DATE , whereas GPE was ordered to leave upon termination of his prison sentence .", "The ORG appeal against this decision was dismissed by ORG ( NORP ) on DATE on the grounds that the applicants depended on public welfare , and as the conduct of GPE did not permit the conclusion that he was willing to integrate in GPE .", "On DATE the Basel - Landschaft Administrative Court ( Verwaltungsgericht ) dismissed the applicants\u2019 further appeal . The court noted that the applicants , if they returned to their home country , would in fact be separated from GPE However , in the court \u2019s opinion , their family life was already considerably limited in view of the prison sentence of GPE Given the public interest in an orderly implementation of the prison sentence , the applicants\u2019 additional separation from GPE appeared insignificant ( geringf\u00fcgig ) , particularly as they had the possibility of communicating by mail and telephone with him . The court furthermore confirmed the decision of the Basel - Landschaft Government according to which the refusal to prolong the applicants\u2019 residence permit was based on S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) of LAW ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber PERSON ) which envisaged a foreigner \u2019s expulsion if he or she depended continuously and substantially on public welfare .", "The applicants filed an administrative law appeal ( Verwaltungsgerichts - beschwerde ) with ORG which the latter declared inadmissible on DATE . It noted that S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b)(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( Organisationsgesetz ) only permitted administrative law appeals if the complainant could invoke an \u201c entitlement \u201d . In cases of family separation this required as a rule that CARDINAL of the family members had a \u201c consolidated right to stay \u201d ( gefestigtes PERSON ) in GPE , for instance on account of NORP nationality or of a right to domicile ( Niederlassungsbewilligung ) , which was not the case for the present applicants . The judgment continued :", "\u201c The only basis for such a right could ... at most , be LAW ) , in that the family of applicants would provisionally be separated even more insofar as wife and child would have to leave GPE already before their husband and father is released from prison . However , for the applicants to live together as a family is in any event excluded until release from prison . The possible direct contacts between the detainee and his family will be limited until then to short visits in prison . Nevertheless , a right of the ( remaining ) family to stay in GPE merely to exercise such a limited right to visit the detained applicant , can not a priori be derived from LAW , a fortiori as this person only disposes of a ... residence permit rather than a consolidated right to stay , for which reason he can not convey any rights to residence upon his wife and child . The ( enforced ) stay due to detention on remand or a prison sentence , based on an order of criminal procedure or penal law , can not in itself provide a \u2018 consolidated right to GPE within the meaning of the case - law to LAW . \u201d", "Subsequently , ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG ) ordered the applicants to leave GPE by DATE , whereas GPE was ordered to leave GPE upon release from detention .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was dismissed by ORG and Police ( Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Justiz- und Polizeidepartment ) on DATE .", "According to LAW of LAW , \u201c everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his communications by mail , post and telecommunications \u201d .", "S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) of LAW provides that a foreigner may be expelled from GPE , inter alia , \u201c if he , or a person for whom he has to care , continuously and substantially becomes a burden for public welfare \u201d .", "S. CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) ( CARDINAL ) of ORG states that an administrative law appeal shall be inadmissible in matters of the NORP police if it concerns the granting or the refusal of authorisations in respect of which federal law offers no entitlement ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
