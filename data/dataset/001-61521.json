According to the applicant , she agreed on condition that she would be back home before TIME", "CARDINAL . In the bar , CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the group had drinks . The applicant saw some friends , with whom she had a short chat . According to the applicant , she repeatedly told the others it was time to leave , as it was getting late .", "CARDINAL . At some time late in the evening , the group left and headed back to PERSON On the way , they were briefly stopped and checked by traffic police .", "CARDINAL . A. then suggested stopping for a swim at a nearby reservoir . According to the applicant , they went there despite her objections . She submitted that she had not suspected the men 's intentions .", "CARDINAL . At the reservoir , the applicant remained in the car , in the front passenger seat , saying that she was not interested in swimming . The CARDINAL men headed towards the water . Soon afterwards , PERSON came back and sat in the front seat next to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In her statements to the investigating authorities , the applicant submitted that P. had then pressed his body against hers , proposed that they \u201c become friends \u201d and started kissing her . The applicant had refused his advances and had asked him to leave . P. had persisted in kissing her while she had tried to push him back . He had then moved the car seat back to a horizontal position , grabbed her hands and pressed them against her back . The applicant had been scared and at the same time embarrassed by the fact that she had put herself in such a situation . She had not had the strength to resist violently or scream . Her efforts to push P. back had been unsuccessful , as he had been far stronger . P. had undressed her partially and had forced her to have sexual intercourse with him .", "CARDINAL . In her testimony , the applicant stated : \u201c It was my first time and it hurt a lot . I felt sick and I wanted to throw up . I started crying . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to P.

In her submissions to the investigator , the applicant stated that she had later come to suspect that the CARDINAL men had planned to have sex with her and had invented the pretext of swimming to drive to a deserted area . In particular , she did not remember PERSON and GPE being wet when they had come back to the car , although they had insisted on going to the reservoir for a swim .", "CARDINAL . The applicant later testified that after the first rape she had been very disturbed and had cried most of the time . According to the version of events given by PERSON when later questioned , the applicant had been in an excellent mood , had started caressing PERSON , which had irritated PERSON , and had asked to go to a bar or a restaurant . The group had gone to a restaurant , where the applicant had briefly talked with PERSON , the singer performing there . PERSON had been sitting at a table there with CARDINAL Mr M.", "CARDINAL . PERSON , the singer , stated that on DATE she had been in the restaurant with PERSON Shortly after TIME the applicant , whom she knew vaguely , had approached her and asked whether her group would be performing in DATE . PERSON recalled having seen at that moment a man waiting at the door . Having heard the answer to her question , the applicant had left . PERSON stated that the applicant had appeared cheerful and that there had been nothing unusual in her behaviour .", "CARDINAL . Mr M. was also questioned by the police . He stated that he knew the applicant very well and that he did not remember having seen her that night .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disputed the statements of P. , NORP , GPE and PERSON , maintaining that there had been no visit to a restaurant and that she did not know PERSON The applicant and her mother later accused PERSON of perjury ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Instead of returning to PERSON , at TIME the group went to a neighbouring town , where ORG relatives had a house . A. , V.A. and the applicant got out of the car . P. , who was the owner of the car , drove off .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL men and a baker , Mr S. , called by them as a witness , later maintained that in the meantime there had been a short stop at Mr S. 's bakery . Mr S. allegedly had the key to the house . Mr S. , when interrogated , stated that at TIME he had given the key to V.A. and had seen the applicant waiting in the car , apparently in a good mood . Loud music had been coming from the car . The applicant disputed that there had been any visit to a baker 's shop and accused the baker of perjury . P. , NORP and GPE submitted in their statements that they had decided to go to the house as the applicant had told them that she had quarrelled with her mother and did not want to go back home .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated to the police that she had felt helpless and in need of protection . As PERSON was the brother of a classmate of hers , she had expected such protection from him and had followed him and V.A. into a room on the ground floor of the house .", "CARDINAL . There was CARDINAL bed in the room and the applicant sat on it . The CARDINAL men smoked and talked for a while . V.A. then left the room .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that at that point A. had sat next to her , pushed her down onto the bed , undressed her and forced her to have sex with him . The applicant had not had the strength to resist violently . She had only begged the man to stop . She later related in her statement :", "\u201c I started crying and asked him to stop ... He started caressing my breasts and sucking my neck ... At some point he took my jeans and my pants off with his feet . Then he spread my legs apart with his legs and forced his way into me ... [ After he finished ] I started crying and I continued crying until some time in the morning , when I fell asleep ... [ V.A. ] woke me up telling me that [ A. ] had gone to find a car to drive me back to PERSON I sat on the bed and started crying . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A. 's position before the police was that he had had sex with the applicant with her full consent .", "CARDINAL . On TIME at TIME , the applicant 's mother found her daughter in the house of ORG relatives . The applicant 's mother stated that , having learned from neighbours that her daughter had been seen the previous evening with A. , she had been on her way to A. 's house when she had met V.A. in the street . V.A. had allegedly tried to mislead the applicant 's mother in an effort to gain time and warn A. However , she had insisted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her mother maintained in their submissions during the investigation that the applicant had told her mother right away that she had been raped . A. had also been there . He had told the applicant 's mother that \u201c a truck driver \u201d had had sex with her daughter the previous night .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG 's version of events , the applicant and her mother had quarrelled , the applicant allegedly refusing to go with her and telling her to go away . A neighbour , apparently named as a witness by A. or V.A. , stated that he had heard the quarrel and , in particular , the refusal of the applicant to leave with her mother and her saying that nothing had happened to her . The applicant accused the witness of perjury .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her mother went directly to the local hospital , where they were directed to see a forensic medical examiner . The applicant was examined at TIME", "CARDINAL . The medical examiner found that the hymen had been freshly torn . He also noted grazing on the applicant 's neck , measuring QUANTITY by QUANTITY , and CARDINAL small oval - shaped bruises . As noted in the medical certificate , the applicant had reported CARDINAL rape , stating that it had occurred CARDINAL DATE at the reservoir .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that during DATE she had refused to talk to her mother about the incident . She had given no details and had not mentioned the second rape at all . She explained that she lived in a conservative small - town environment where virginity was considered to be an asset for marriage . She felt ashamed of the fact that she had \u201c failed to protect her virginity \u201d and of \u201c what people would say about it \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On TIME after the events , on DATE , P. visited the applicant 's family . The applicant and her mother stated that that evening PERSON had begged for forgiveness and had claimed that he would marry the applicant when she came of age . The applicant 's mother had considered that accepting the offer would be reasonable in the circumstances . This had influenced the initial behaviour of the applicant , who had accepted her mother 's idea of minimising the damage .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL of the following evenings , the applicant went out with P. and some of his friends .", "CARDINAL . P. and V.A. , the latter claiming that he had been with P. during the visit to the applicant 's house on TIME CARDINAL DATE , stated that the applicant 's mother had told them that \u201c all pleasure must be paid for \u201d and had tried to extort money from them .", "CARDINAL . P. 's grandmother also made a statement to the police . She asserted that on an unspecified date the applicant 's mother had visited her , trying to extort money .", "CARDINAL . With regard to that visit and other relevant events , PERSON , a neighbour and friend of the applicant 's mother , stated that the applicant 's mother had been very upset about the events and had agreed to her daughter going out with P. as he had maintained that he loved the applicant . The applicant 's mother had nevertheless decided to talk to P. 's parents . On an unspecified date PERSON and another neighbour had approached the house of P. 's family , but his grandmother had told them to go away , stating that the applicant had slept not only with PERSON but also with A. At that moment PERSON had arrived . PERSON had asked him whether it was true that he had slept with the applicant . He had confirmed that it was true , adding that he had the money and power to do as he pleased . Until then , the applicant 's mother had not known about the second rape .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that a visit by ORG 's father on CARDINAL DATE had caused her to break down . She had then confided to her mother about the second rape . On DATE the applicant 's father returned home , after being absent for DATE . The family discussed the matter and decided to file a complaint . The applicant 's mother did so on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a written statement about the events of DATE and DATE . On DATE were arrested and made written statements . They claimed that the applicant had had sexual intercourse with them of her own free will . The CARDINAL men were released . Written statements were also made by V.A. and a person who lived next to the house where the second alleged rape had taken place . On DATE a police officer drew up a report and forwarded the file to the competent prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor opened a criminal investigation into the alleged rape and referred the case to an investigator . No charges were brought .", "CARDINAL . No action was taken on the case DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE P. and A. filed complaints with the district prosecutor 's office , stating that the applicant and her mother had been harassing them by making false public accusations .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of these complaints , on CARDINAL DATE , the district prosecutor ordered a police inquiry . In DATE and DATE several persons were heard and made written statements .", "DATE . On DATE a police officer drew up a report apparently accrediting the allegations of P. and A. and disbelieving the version of the facts as submitted by the applicant and her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the file was transmitted to the district prosecutor 's office with jurisdiction to decide whether or not to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant and her mother . It appears that the matter was left hanging and no decision was taken .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the investigator questioned the applicant , her mother and other witnesses . P. and A. were heard as witnesses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant gave a detailed account of the facts , repeating that PERSON had overcome her resistance by pressing her against the car seat and twisting her hands , and that thereafter she had been in a state of shock and unable to resist PERSON", "CARDINAL . In his evidence , PERSON claimed that the applicant had actively responded to his advances . He also asserted that the applicant had spoken with PERSON at the restaurant they had allegedly gone to after having sex .", "CARDINAL . Both A. and PERSON stated , inter alia , that shortly after having sex with P. at the reservoir , the applicant had started caressing PERSON in the car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator completed his work on the case . He drew up a report stating that there was no evidence that P. and A. had used threats or violence , and proposed that the prosecutor close the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor ordered an additional investigation . The order stated that the initial investigation had not been objective , thorough or complete .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator to whom the case had been referred appointed a psychiatrist and a psychologist to answer several questions . The experts were asked , inter alia , whether it was likely that the applicant would have spoken calmly with PERSON , the singer at the restaurant , and then listened to music in the car , if she had just been raped and whether it was likely that DATE after the alleged rape the applicant would have gone out with the person who had raped her .", "CARDINAL . The experts considered that , owing to her naivety and inexperience , the applicant had apparently not considered the possibility that she might be sexually assaulted . There was no indication that she had been threatened or hurt , or that she had been in a state of shock during the events , as she had demonstrated a clear recollection of them . The experts considered that during the events she must have been suddenly overwhelmed by an internal conflict between a natural sexual interest and a sense that the act was reprehensible , which had \u201c reduced her ability to resist and defend herself \u201d . They further found that the applicant was psychologically sound and that she had understood the meaning of the events . In view of her age at the time , however , she \u201c could not assert a stable set of convictions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The experts also found that , if there had indeed been a meeting between PERSON and the applicant after the events at the reservoir \u2013 and this was disputed DATE it was still possible that the applicant could have had a short exchange with PERSON after being raped . As to the applicant going out with P. DATE after the events , this could be easily explained by her family 's desire to lend a socially acceptable meaning to the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator concluded his work on the case and drew up a report , again proposing that the case should be closed . He considered that the experts ' opinion did not affect his earlier finding that there was no evidence demonstrating the use of force or threats .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor ordered the closure of the criminal investigation . He found , inter alia , that the use of force or threats had not been established beyond reasonable doubt . In particular , no resistance on the applicant 's part or attempts to seek help from others had been established .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged consecutive appeals with the regional prosecutor 's office and ORG . The appeals were dismissed in decisions of CARDINAL May and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutors relied , inter alia , on the statements of the alleged perpetrators and V.A. that the applicant had not shown any signs of distress after having sex with P. at the reservoir , and the evidence of the CARDINAL men and PERSON that the latter had met the applicant and had spoken with her that night . As regards the applicant 's objections that those statements should be rejected as being untrue , the decision of CARDINAL DATE stated that \u201c prosecutors ' decisions can not be based on suppositions , and witnesses ' statements can not be rejected only on the basis of doubts , without other evidence ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision of CARDINAL DATE also stated :", "\u201c It is true that , as can be seen from the report of the forensic psychiatric experts , the young age of the applicant and her lack of experience in life meant that she was unable to assert a stable set of convictions , namely to demonstrate firmly her unwillingness to engage in sexual contact . There can be no criminal act under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW , however , unless the applicant was coerced into having sexual intercourse by means of physical force or threats . This presupposes resistance , but there is no evidence of resistance in this particular case . P. and A. could be held criminally responsible only if they understood that they were having sexual intercourse without the applicant 's consent and if they used force or made threats precisely with the aim of having sexual intercourse against the applicant 's will . There is insufficient evidence to establish that the applicant demonstrated unwillingness to have sexual intercourse and that P. and A. used threats or force . \u201d", "It was further noted that the applicant had explained that the bruises on her neck had been caused by sucking .", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE reiterated those findings , while noting that the statements of PERSON , the singer at the restaurant , were not decisive . It also stated :", "\u201c What is decisive in the present case is that it has not been established beyond reasonable doubt that physical or psychological force was used against the applicant and that sexual intercourse took place against her will and despite her resistance . There are no traces of physical force such as bruises , torn clothing , etc . ...", "It is true that it is unusual for a girl who is under age and a virgin to have sexual intercourse twice within a short space of time with CARDINAL different people , but this fact alone is not sufficient to establish that a criminal act took place , in the absence of other evidence and in view of the impossibility of collecting further evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE or DATE the applicant and her mother requested the institution of criminal proceedings against PERSON and other witnesses , including V.A. , alleging that they had committed perjury in that their statements in connection with the investigation into the rape of the applicant had been false .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same prosecutor from the district prosecutor 's office who had ordered the closure of the rape investigation refused the request , stating that it was unfounded and even abusive , as all the facts had been clarified in previous proceedings .", "CARDINAL . An ensuing appeal by the applicant was dismissed on DATE by the regional prosecutor 's office .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant submitted a written opinion by CARDINAL NORP experts , Dr Svetlozar Vasilev , a psychiatrist , and Mr PERSON , a psychologist , who had been asked by the applicant 's lawyer to comment on the case .", "CARDINAL . The experts stated , with reference to scientific publications in several countries , that CARDINAL patterns of response by rape victims to their attacker were known : violent physical resistance and \u201c frozen fright \u201d ( also known as \u201c traumatic psychological infantilism syndrome \u201d ) . The latter was explained by the fact that any experience - based model of behaviour was inadequate when the victim was faced with the inevitability of rape . As a result the victim , terrorised , often adopted a passive - response model of submission , characteristic of childhood , or sought a psychological dissociation from the event , as if it were not happening to her .", "CARDINAL . The experts stated that all the scientific publications they had studied indicated that the \u201c frozen - fright pattern \u201d prevailed . Further , they had conducted their own research for the purposes of their written opinion in the present case . They had analysed all the cases of young women aged DATE who had contacted CARDINAL specialised treatment programmes for victims of violence in GPE during the period from DATE , declaring that they had been raped . Cases that were too different from that of the applicant had been excluded . As a result , CARDINAL cases had been identified , in CARDINAL of which the victim had not resisted violently , but had reacted with passive submission .", "CARDINAL . By LAW , sexual intercourse with a person under DATE is a punishable offence ( statutory rape ) . Consent is not a valid defence in such cases .", "CARDINAL . Consent is likewise irrelevant where the victim is DATE , but did not \u201c understand the essence and meaning of the occurrence \u201d ( LAW ) . That provision has been applied in cases where the victim did not grasp the meaning of the events owing to a mental disorder ( see judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG - I ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW defines rape as :", "\u201c sexual intercourse with a woman", "( CARDINAL ) incapable of defending herself , where she did not consent ;", "( CARDINAL ) who was compelled by the use of force or threats ;", "( CARDINAL ) who was brought to a state of helplessness by the perpetrator . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Although lack of consent is mentioned explicitly only in the first sub - paragraph , ORG has held that it is an element inherent in the whole provision ( see judgment no . CARDINAL , cited above ) .", "DATE . According to judicial practice , the CARDINAL sub - paragraphs of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL can only be applied alternatively , each of them referring to a separate factual situation . ORG has held that general references to CARDINAL or all of the sub - paragraphs are not acceptable ( see judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , case no . DATE , ORG - I ; judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , case no . CARDINAL , ORG - I ; and many others ) .", "CARDINAL . Therefore , an accused person may be found guilty of rape only if it has been established that he had sexual intercourse with a woman in circumstances covered by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL sub - paragraphs .", "CARDINAL . The first and third sub - paragraphs concern particular factual situations where the victim was in a state of helplessness at the time of sexual intercourse . The third sub - paragraph refers to cases where the perpetrator put the victim in a state of helplessness before raping her , whereas the first sub - paragraph refers to cases where he took advantage of the victim 's existing state of helplessness .", "CARDINAL . The courts have stated that a victim is in a state of helplessness ( \u201c incapable of defending herself \u201d or \u201c brought to a state of helplessness \u201d ) only in circumstances where she has no capacity to resist physically owing to disability , old age or illness ( see judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , case no . DATE , and judgment no . CARDINAL , cited above ) or because of the use of alcohol , medicines or drugs ( see judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , case no . CARDINAL , ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The second sub - paragraph is the provision applicable in all other cases of alleged rape . Thus , where no special circumstances such as the state of helplessness of the victim are reported , an investigation into an alleged rape will concentrate on establishing whether or not the victim was coerced into having sexual intercourse by the use of force or threats .", "CARDINAL . It is an established view in the case - law and legal theory that rape under the second sub - paragraph of LAW is a \u201c twostep \u201d offence \u2013 that is to say , the perpetrator first starts employing force or threats and then penetrates the victim .", "CARDINAL . The parties in the present case offered their views on the meaning of the words \u201c use of force and threats \u201d and their interpretation in practice ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has stated that lack of consent is to be deduced from the fact that a situation covered by one of the CARDINAL sub - paragraphs of LAW has been established , either from the victim 's state of helplessness or from the fact that physical or psychological force has been used ( see judgment no . CARDINAL , cited above ) .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL case , ORG stated that \u201c force \u201d was not only to be understood as direct violence , but could also consist of placing the victim in a situation such that she could see no other solution than to submit against her will ( see judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , case no . CARDINAL ) . In that particular case , the perpetrator , after demonstrating his desire for close relations with the victim by his behaviour over a period of DATE ( following her and trying to hold her and kiss her ) , entered her room , locked the door and asked her to undress . She refused , whereupon he tried to spread her legs apart . Realising that she had no other choice , the victim opened the window and jumped , sustaining serious injury . The perpetrator was convicted of attempted rape resulting in serious injury .", "CARDINAL . Legal commentators have not commented in detail on situations where coercion through force or threats may be considered to have been established , apparently taking the view that this was a matter for judicial interpretation ( Al . PERSON , PERSON \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e , PERSON \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442 , DATE ; GPE , \u041d\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e , PERSON \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442 , CARDINAL ) . CARDINAL commentator has stated that the essential characteristic of rape is the victim 's lack of consent and that the CARDINAL sub - paragraphs of LAW embody different situations of lack of consent . He further notes that in DATE the utmost resistance by the victim was required and that that view is now outdated . Without reference to caselaw , he considers that what is now required is nothing more than the resistance necessary to eliminate any doubt as to the victim 's lack of consent ( PERSON , GPE \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , rape committed by a man against a woman is punishable by DATE imprisonment .

Noting that the terms \u201c coercion \u201d , \u201c force \u201d , or \u201c threat of force \u201d from the PERSON definition were not intended to be interpreted narrowly , ORG in another case ( Prosecutor v. PERSON , PERSON and GPE , case no . IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) observed :", "\u201c In stating that the relevant act of sexual penetration will constitute rape only if accompanied by coercion or force or threat of force against the victim or a third person , the PERSON definition does not refer to other factors which would render an act of sexual penetration non - consensual or non - voluntary on the part of the victim , which ... as discussed below , is in the opinion of ORG the accurate scope of this aspect of the definition in international law .", "... the basic underlying principle common to [ the national legal systems surveyed is ] that sexual penetration will constitute rape if it is not truly voluntary or consensual on the part of the victim ... [ F]orce , threat of force or coercion ... are certainly the relevant considerations in many legal systems but the full range of [ the relevant ] provisions ... suggest that the true common denominator which unifies the various systems may be a wider or more basic principle of penalising violations of sexual autonomy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In PERSON , PERSON and GPE , a NORP girl in an occupied area was taken by armed soldiers to a building which served as military headquarters . After being raped by CARDINAL soldiers there , she was brought to a room where she herself initiated sexual contact with the accused PERSON , the commanding officer . ORG noted that the victim had been told by soldiers that she should satisfy their commander sexually or risk her life . The victim therefore \u201c did not freely consent to any sexual intercourse with PERSON [ as she ] was in captivity and in fear for her life \u201d . ORG also rejected PERSON 's defence that he was not aware of the fact that the victim had only initiated sexual intercourse with him because she feared for her life . The ORG found that , even if PERSON had not heard the threats made by other soldiers , he could not have been \u201c confused \u201d by the behaviour of the victim , given the general context of the existing war - time situation and the specifically delicate situation of the NORP girls in the region .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the above facts , ORG made the following observations on the elements of rape under international law :", "\u201c The basic principle which is truly common to [ the reviewed ] legal systems is that serious violations of sexual autonomy are to be penalised .

A clear demonstration that such factors negate true consent is found in those jurisdictions where absence of consent is an element of rape and consent is explicitly defined not to exist where factors such as use of force , the unconsciousness or inability to resist of the victim , or misrepresentation by the perpetrator [ are present ] .", "... coercion , force , or threat of force [ are ] not to be interpreted narrowly ... coercion in particular would encompass most conduct which negates consent ...", "In light of the above considerations , ORG understands that the actus reus of the crime of rape in international law is constituted by ... sexual penetration ... where [ it ] occurs without the consent of the victim . Consent for this purpose must be consent given voluntarily , as a result of the victim 's free will , assessed in the context of the surrounding circumstances . The mens rea is the intention to effect this sexual penetration , and the knowledge that it occurs without the consent of the victim . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

However , in explaining its focus on the absence of consent as the conditio sine qua non of rape , ORG did not disavow the ORG 's earlier jurisprudence , but instead sought to explain the relationship between force and consent . ORG or threat of force provides clear evidence of non - consent , but force is not an element per se of rape . In particular , ORG wished to explain that there are \u201c factors [ other than force ] which would render an act of sexual penetration non - consensual or non - voluntary on the part of the victim \u201d . A narrow focus on force or threat of force could permit perpetrators to evade liability for sexual activity to which the other party had not consented by taking advantage of coercive circumstances without relying on physical force ...", "For the most part , the Appellants in this case were convicted of raping women held in de facto military headquarters , detention centres and apartments maintained as soldiers ' residences . As the most egregious aspect of the conditions , the victims were considered the legitimate sexual prey of their captors . Typically , the women were raped by CARDINAL perpetrator and with a regularity that is nearly inconceivable .
