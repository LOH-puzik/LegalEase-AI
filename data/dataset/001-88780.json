The court established that the ORG had paid the applicant CARDINAL MONEY in remuneration .", "CARDINAL . The court founded its findings on , in particular , the applicant \u2019s own statements , obtained in DATE immediately following his arrest , and statements by several witnesses . Most witnesses were identified in the judgment only by their CARDINAL initials , i.e. the first letters of their first , father \u2019s ( patronymic ) and last names . For some witnesses , only the first letter of their last name was given .", "CARDINAL . Witness \u201c K.G.B. \u201d stated in his pre - trial deposition that virtually all documents concerning GPE \u2019s bilateral relationships with other countries and appraisal of the political and economic situation in these countries , which had been prepared within ORG , had contained sensitive information and their disclosure or communication to other states had been highly undesirable . The court noted that on DATE the applicant , when taking up his duties at ORG , had signed an undertaking not to disclose ORG or work - related secrets . In their pre - trial depositions witnesses \u201c ORG \u201d and \u201c I.A.T. \u201d confirmed that the applicant had had access to sensitive documents which had been of interest to NORP and that PERSON affiliation with the intelligence service had been common knowledge among experts in NORP issues . Their depositions were read out in court and witness \u201c T.G.D. \u201d also made oral submissions to the same effect . Both \u201c ORG \u201d and \u201c T.G.D. \u201d testified that NORP had had good knowledge of issues which they were not supposed to have been aware of .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that , according to information from ORG of GPE ( \u0421\u0412\u0420 PERSON ) and ORG of ORG ( ORG \u0412\u0421 ORG ) , during his work in GPE DATE and DATE the applicant had had contacts with employees of the NORP intelligence services and had negligently discussed sensitive matters in unprotected areas . In DATE it was discovered that the NORP intelligence service regularly received confidential information to which the applicant had access and that the applicant maintained private contacts with PERSON in return for remuneration . Witness \u201c PERSON , an employee of ORG , testified to the court that in DATE he had contacted the applicant and advised him of PERSON official mission as a representative of the LAW in GPE . The applicant had acknowledged that he had been aware of this fact .", "CARDINAL . Referring to a letter from the Counter - intelligence ORG of ORG of GPE ( ORG PERSON ) of CARDINAL DATE , the court established that in DATE ORG had provided ORG with copies of a \u201c draft order on the organisation of the work of ORG agents , resident in GPE in DATE \u201d and the applicant \u2019s \u201c personal residence file \u201d , from which it followed that the applicant had been recruited by the ORG during his stay in GPE and enlisted as a functioning agent of that service .", "CARDINAL . The court relied on the experts\u2019 findings in establishing that the information communicated by the applicant had contained ORG secrets . It found as follows :", "\u201c The court agrees with the experts\u2019 conclusions because the [ study ] was performed by competent persons in compliance with the rules of criminal procedure and [ has been ] scientifically proven . According to the experts , the information [ disclosed ] reveals the substance of GPE \u2019s foreign policy and co - ordination agreements with foreign states in the field of military co - operation and intelligence and also contains politically sensitive data .", "The arguments put forward by the defendant and his lawyer about a lack of competence on the part of the experts can not be considered substantiated , because the expert study was carried out by a panel that included experts designated by [ the applicant ] and his defence ; at their request the experts who had been on the expert panel at the pre - trial investigation stage took part in the court hearing and supplied [ the court ] with their written conclusions and clarifications ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court dismissed in the following terms the applicant \u2019s argument that he could not be held liable for disclosure of ORG secrets because there had been no list of classified information prior to the amendment of LAW of DATE :", "\u201c Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , the list of information constituting ORG secrets is the aggregate of categories of information which can be classified as ORG secrets ... This definition was included in the terminology part [ of the law ] in order to bring its original wording into compliance with LAW . Since the information constituting ORG secrets can not be explicitly enumerated in the law , the approach chosen was that the list was to be understood as an aggregate of the relatively generic categories of information described in section CARDINAL of the new law [ i.e. that of DATE ] .", "Hence , there is merely an unimportant semantical difference between section CARDINAL of LAW in its DATE wording and that of DATE . By no means does it imply that there were no legal instruments countering encroachments upon the fundamentals of the constitutional structure and the security of GPE until DATE ...", "Nor are the arguments to the effect that the actus reus of the offence under LAW of LAW only comprises acts involving ORG secrets based on the law . The object of espionage may include information constituting ORG secrets , as well as other information that is being collected and transmitted at the request of a foreign intelligence service for use detrimental to the external security of GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the applicant \u2019s clean criminal record , age , state of health , lengthy detention in custody , positive work references and the absence of aggravating circumstances , the court invoked the \u201c special - circumstances \u201d clause of LAW and sentenced him to a shorter term than that provided in the relevant sanction , specifically to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment in a strict - security correctional colony , with account for the time served from DATE , and confiscation of his property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and other dates the applicant and his CARDINAL lawyers appealed to ORG against the conviction . They alleged violations of the applicant \u2019s rights as guaranteed by LAW and various LAW provisions . The points of appeal touched on substantially the same issues as those raised before this ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the conviction . The court rejected the arguments by the defence and found that the first - instance court and the investigators had fully complied with both national and international law throughout the proceedings . There had been no violations of law capable of rendering the judgment unfounded or unlawful . ORG reproduced verbatim the city court \u2019s reasoning concerning liability for disclosure of ORG secrets .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant was held in the FAC remand prison , run by ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the applicant was held in a CARDINAL - person cell measuring QUANTITY m. The cell was equipped with heating , mandatory ventilation , a window that could be opened , furniture , a fridge , a TV set , a sink and a lavatory . The applicant had an individual sleeping place and bedding . He received food CARDINAL times a day in accordance with standard norms . The applicant was given cutlery and personal hygiene items , as well as books and magazines from the library . He could exercise outside for TIME a day .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s submission , the cell of QUANTITY was designed for CARDINAL inmates and contained CARDINAL bunk beds fixed to the concrete floor and walls . He shared the cell with CARDINAL other detainees in DATE and then from DATE to DATE . The furniture consisted of CARDINAL small tables and an open shelf , which the detainees mockingly referred to as \u201c a TV set \u201d because all the items on the shelf were on display . Contrary to the ORG \u2019s assertion , there was no fridge or TV set .", "CARDINAL . The lavatory in the corner of the cell had no flush system and inmates filled a pail with water from the sink to eliminate waste . The toilet was not separated from the living area ; the applicant had to use the toilet and apply his treatment for haemorrhoids in front of his cellmates and the wardens who observed them through a peephole in the door . Detainees cleaned the cell themselves . No broom , dustbin or detergent was given to them . Once in a while they received CARDINAL g of sodium hydrate to disinfect the lavatory . The applicant had access to the showers DATE and received CARDINAL g of laundry soap for washing .", "CARDINAL . The cell was dimly lit by CARDINAL QUANTITY bulbs , fixed in the ceiling and covered with metal bars and opaque glass . The artificial light was never switched off . The window pane also had frosted glass . The exercise courts were located on the roof of the facility and measured QUANTITY m. The external walls were QUANTITY high and the opening to the sky was protected with metal bars and netting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG of GPE about the general conditions of his detention , inadequate medical assistance , meagre food provisions and lack of privacy in the cell . On DATE the applicant was visited by the head of the remand prison and senior medical officer and asked about the reasons for lodging the above complaint . The head of the prison had a printed copy of the applicant \u2019s complaint , originally hand - written , which had never been addressed to the prison administration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG invited the applicant to identify the authority against which he was complaining and to pay the court fee by DATE . The applicant received this decision only on DATE . On DATE the court disallowed the applicant \u2019s complaint because the instructions of DATE had not been fulfilled ; the copy of that decision was served on the applicant on DATE and on DATE his conviction became final .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was transported from the remand centre to the courthouse and back CARDINAL times .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prison vans in which the applicant was transported had a passenger cabin which was QUANTITY long , QUANTITY wide , and QUANTITY high . The cabin was divided into CARDINAL multi - occupancy cubicles , designed for CARDINAL inmates each , and CARDINAL single - occupancy cubicle . The cubicles were equipped with hard benches . In addition to the detainees\u2019 cubicles , the cabin contained a CARDINAL wide lobby for QUANTITY police officers . According to the Government , the applicant was placed in a single - occupancy cubicle on the basis of a written request by the prison administration , in order to prevent him from communicating with other detainees ( a copy of that request has not been provided to ORG ) . The applicant submitted that he was usually placed in a multi - occupancy cubicle with CARDINAL other detainees , who had stood or sat on one another \u2019s laps . Even when he was confined to the tiny solitary cubicle , he had had to share it with another person and they had taken turns sitting on each other \u2019s laps . He was never transported alone and he could not be isolated from others because the van was so overcrowded .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the prison - van heaters and interior lights had been powered by the van engine . The vans were naturally ventilated through the emergency hatch and additional hatches with controlled airflow . The passenger cabin was cleaned and disinfected on a DATE basis . The applicant insisted that the natural flow of air through the hatches was insufficient and that it was stiflingly hot in DATE . Moreover , as the hatches were located in the wardens\u2019 lobby , the latter opened and closed the hatches on whim . In DATE there was no heating when the engine was not running , and detainees were locked for TIME inside the extremely cold van at assembly points . The floor of the cabin was extremely dirty and covered with cigarette butts , food crumbs and packaging , plastic bottles and bags with urine ; no access to the toilet was possible during the transport .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the travel time from FAC to ORG and back did not exceed TIME . The applicant pointed out that for attendance at court hearings he had usually been taken out of the detention centre TIME but was never brought back until TIME . The road from ORG to the FAC facility took much TIME because the van called en route at either the PERSON or GPE remand prison , both of which served as assembly points for detainees . As a result , the travel time was DATE . By way of example , the applicant gave the following figures : on DATE the travel time from the court to the FAC prison was QUANTITY ; DATE ; CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL min ; CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL min ; DATE CARDINAL min ( to the court ) and QUANTITY ( from the court ) ; DATE CARDINAL min ; CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL min ; CARDINAL DATE CARDINAL min ( until TIME on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

Each cubicle of the van contained CARDINAL persons : they had to stand or to sit on each other \u2019s laps . Following this \u2018 trip\u2019 I had the symptoms of flu , I had an acute attack of gastroduodenitis , [ suffered from ] a headache and other symptoms resulting from a lengthy period of sitting on cold benches in the frost .

The cell had no windows and the only opening was the peephole in the door . Heating and the mandatory ventilation were not available ; the air was heavy with cigarette smoke from prisoners smoking in the cell and police officers smoking outside .
