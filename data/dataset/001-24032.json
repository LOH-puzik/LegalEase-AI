{"ITEMID": "001-24032", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "SALKIC and OTHERS v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , PERSON and their CARDINAL children , PERSON and PERSON , are nationals of GPE and were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . They are currently residing in GPE in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "The applicants are a NORP family who originate from ORG in Republika Srpska . They fled to GPE in DATE , allegedly after the family had been subjected to harassment and discrimination , such as the dismissal of Mr GPE from his job . They remained in GPE until DATE when they were expelled to GPE and GPE , where they were given temporary residence in GPE by ORG of that city . According to the applicants , they were subsequently the victims of harassment and assaults , including rape committed against PERSON . Due to the difficult situation and marital problems between PERSON and PERSON , the latter travelled with the children to GPE , where they arrived on DATE , and applied for asylum on the grounds that they were living as refugees in GPE without the means to support themselves .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected the request for asylum on the ground that PERSON and her children were able to return to GPE and GPE without risking persecution due to their ethnicity or other reasons . It further observed that a clear process of \u201c normalisation \u201d was on - going in GPE .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden -hereinafter \u201c the Board \u201d ) , claiming that the situation in GPE was not such that they could return . On DATE the ORG upheld ORG decision in full and , on DATE , it rejected a new application lodged by the applicants as no new circumstances had been presented .", "On DATE PERSON was taken into emergency psychiatric care because her mental health had deteriorated after the ORG \u2019s rejections and she was found to be suicidal . A new application was lodged with the ORG based on PERSON state of health . However , on DATE , ORG rejected the application as it found that the circumstances were not so grave that the expulsion of the applicants would constitute a violation of humanitarian standards as laid down in GPE ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , CARDINAL ) .", "Subsequently , PERSON and her children lodged , one after another , CARDINAL new applications with ORG in which they submitted medical certificates indicating that the mental health of all CARDINAL family members was deteriorating gradually . On DATE and DATE , respectively , ORG , on the same grounds as above , refused the first CARDINAL applications . The third application was refused on DATE with , inter alia , the following reasoning :", "\u201c No circumstances have emerged which give reasons to assume that [ Mrs ] GPE and her children are in need of protection . As concerns [ PERSON ] state of health , it is possible only in exceptional circumstances to grant a residence permit on this ground . It must then concern a life threatening illness for which care can not be given in the home country or a handicap of a particularly serious kind . The investigation [ in the present case ] does not show that her state of health is such that it meets these strict requirements . Neither is a generally difficult situation in the home country such a circumstance which can lead to a residence permit [ being granted ] .", "Since the case concerns children under DATE , special regard must be had to their health and development and to the children \u2019s best interest in general . When it concerns children who remain in GPE , after a decision to expel them has gained legal force , the requirements for the grant of a residence permit based on a new application are that the risk of self - destructive actions of an extraordinarily serious nature by the child is considered particularly high , or that the children would be seriously harmed in their psycho - social development if they were to be expelled by force to their home country . However , all the circumstances of the particular case must be taken into account and a balance must be struck between the different interests ( ... ) . According to the ORG \u2019s assessment , nothing has emerged which shows that it would seriously harm the children in their psycho - social development if they return with their mother to their home country . \u201d", "On DATE Mr Salkic joined his family in GPE and applied for asylum and a residence permit , claiming that on CARDINAL occasions he had been severely beaten by unknown persons due to his father \u2019s political activities and that the police had refused to file his complaints because he was a NORP . He further stated that he could not return to his home town , ORG , since currently only NORP lived there . Furthermore , in GPE he would not be able to find a job to support his family .", "On DATE ORG refused his request for asylum and a residence permit as it considered that he did not risk persecution if returned to GPE . It further noted that he suffered from ORG ( PTSD ) , for which he received medication , but that it was not so severe as to motivate granting a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . Mr NORP appealed to ORG which , on DATE , upheld ORG decision , concurring with its reasoning .", "On DATE the family was placed by the social authorities , in co - operation with ORG , in a family home to undergo family- and individual treatment and be under constant surveillance due to their very weak and volatile mental health which , among other things , had rendered the parents incapable of caring for their children . Furthermore , it was considered that there was a risk that PERSON and PERSON would attempt to commit suicide . The aim of the treatment was to support the parents in assuming their parental roles , keep the family united , improve their mental health and help prepare the family mentally for their return to GPE . The treatment appears to have ended on DATE because the family went into hiding following yet another rejection by ORG ( see below ) .", "During DATE , the family as a whole lodged CARDINAL more applications with ORG , invoking the continued deterioration of the mental health of all members of the family and the fact that they were undergoing treatment at the family home . The requests were rejected on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , on the grounds that the documentary evidence submitted did not show that the state of health of any of the CARDINAL family members was so serious that it could be described as a life - threatening illness or a particularly serious handicap , which was the requirement according to the ORG \u2019s established case - law . Having regard to the fact that the case involved CARDINAL children , the ORG nonetheless considered that there was nothing which , convincingly , showed that the children would be seriously damaged in their psycho - social development if they were returned to their home country together with their parents .", "As mentioned above , following the ORG \u2019s rejection on DATE , PERSON and PERSON and PERSON went into hiding to avoid expulsion . They left PERSON with an uncle who resided in GPE . The family was , however , apprehended by the police on DATE and PERSON NORP was taken into custody while Mr GPE and PERSON were placed in an apartment where PERSON joined them .", "Also , on DATE , the ORG refused yet another application by the family , basing its decision on the same grounds as its previous decisions .", "On DATE the ORG refused to suspend the expulsion pending the decision on yet another application lodged by the applicants . On DATE the ORG representative requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG to suspend the applicants\u2019 expulsion .", "On DATE , the same date that the request was received by the ORG , the President of the Section to which the case had been assigned decided to apply Rule CARDINAL until the next ORG meeting on DATE . He considered that it was necessary to obtain information from the Government as to whether someone would meet the family in GPE to provide them with the necessary support there . On DATE accordingly suspended the expulsion of the applicants until further notice .", "In reply to the ORG \u2019s query , the ORG stated that no arrangements had been made for assistance to the applicants upon their arrival in GPE . However , ORG had scheduled a meeting with them on DATE where the issues would be discussed and similar meetings had taken place on earlier occasions . On a general note , the Government informed the ORG that GPE did not have any particular agreement with the NORP authorities , aid organisations or other concerning assistance to returning NORP .", "On DATE the ORG reconsidered the application in the light of the information provided by ORG and decided not to prolong the interim measure previously indicated under LAW .", "On DATE the applicants informed the ORG that the meeting with ORG had been cancelled , and disputed that any such meetings had been held on earlier occasions .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the family \u2019s new application and lifted the suspension of the expulsion . ORG noted , inter alia , that the family , like many of their countrymen , had been through traumatic experiences and felt stress and despair at having to return to their home country . However , it maintained its reasoning from its earlier decisions .", "On DATE the applicants were expelled to GPE .", "The following description of the applicants\u2019 health is based on medical and psychiatric certificates issued , DATE and DATE , by doctors , psychologists , child psychologists and a specialist in psychiatry , all of whom examined the applicants , once or over a longer period of time , while they were in GPE .", "When Mr NORP arrived in GPE in DATE , he was diagnosed as suffering from PTSD . According to a certificate by a specialist in psychiatry who met him for consultation on CARDINAL occasions DATE and DATE , he was in need of continued psychiatric treatment . The specialist further noted that the applicant \u2019s illness prevented him from assuming his parental responsibilities . In a certificate , dated DATE , another psychologist who had treated the family since DATE stated that Mr GPE was depressed and unable to care for himself or his family . After having been apprehended by the police in DATE , he was diagnosed at the psychiatric emergency unit at the hospital in GPE as having a serious crisis reaction and profound anxiety and feelings of illness .", "PERSON was taken into emergency psychiatric care in DATE following a rejection by ORG which caused her to become depressed and express suicidal thoughts . After this , her mental status slowly deteriorated over time even though she was treated by various psychologists and doctors . She was given anti - depressant medication which , apparently , was not of much help . Several of the doctors she was in contact with seemed to agree that her very fragile mental health was due to the uncertainty of her and her family \u2019s life situation during DATE and anxiety about the future . In DATE a psychologist diagnosed her as suffering from PTSD . After having been apprehended by police in DATE , she was diagnosed at the emergency psychiatric unit as having neither a clear depression nor suicidal thoughts , but as being very anxious and showing a severe stress reaction to the situation .", "On DATE Mr and PERSON were examined at a health care centre , at the unit for mental rehabilitation , in GPE . The doctor found that they were both easily irritated , had a lot of headaches , dizziness , difficulties sleeping and that they were depressive . Moreover , PERSON was very anxious and tense while Mr GPE was emotionally unstable . However , both were considered to be lucid and communicative and they were told to return for a psychiatric control within DATE .", "ORG is DATE and , it appears , the one who has been suffering the most . He has traumas from earlier experiences in life and already in DATE the doctors noted that he was very quiet , anxious and withdrawn . He showed a deep mistrust of and fear towards both adults and other children . While in GPE he was in continuous contact with a ORG and a child psychologist . During DATE he developed depression , largely it seems due to his parent \u2019s incapacity to provide him with security , attention and care . In DATE he was taken into an emergency unit for child psychiatric care as he was in a deep depression and had expressed clear suicidal thoughts , a state which appears to have remained more or less unchanged since . In a medical certificate , dated DATE , the psychologist who had had the longest contact with PERSON stated that he was in need of serious and long term treatment and that , if he were to be expelled to GPE , he would be at grave risk of permanent psychiatric damage \u201c if he survives at all \u201d .", "The girl is now DATE . According to the child psychologist , who was in continuous contact with the family while they were in GPE , she has developed an aggressive , troublemaking , conduct to attract attention and appears to have used this as a \u201c survival strategy \u201d . She has shown signs of depression , inter alia , by refusing to eat . The same child psychologist stated that PERSON was in need of continuous treatment over a long period to deal with her traumas .", "On DATE a child psychologist in GPE examined ORG and PERSON and noted that they showed antipathy towards their surroundings . PERSON was found to be in a deep depression which could be interpreted as PTSD . PERSON was found to be afraid of forming attachments as she did not want to live there . It was noted that this was typical \u201c NORP syndrome \u201d among children who had , previously , only lived briefly in GPE . The doctor further stated , on a more general note , that there were no possibilities to give the children the treatment and help that they were in need of in GPE and requested that the NORP authorities assist , or else it might lead to fatal consequences for the children .", "Already in DATE , ORG , together with ORG ( ORG ) , stressed the importance of the need for physical and psychosocial rehabilitation . CARDINAL of the components of this project was the establishment of CARDINAL ORG in GPE . In addition to the purchase of equipment and necessary medication , training and technical aid for physical and occupational therapy , CARDINAL of the objectives of the ORG was to provide clinical services for persons with mental health problems , and psychosocial rehabilitation of war traumatised persons . ORG were established either within or as extensions of existing health - care centres , each planned to cover an area with a population of CARDINAL inhabitants . In GPE canton there were CARDINAL ORG and in GPE canton there were CARDINAL . Both cities also had day hospitals and university psychiatric hospitals .", "Simultaneously with the establishment of the ORG , several other post - war initiatives were started , creating room for global development of community - based mental health - care . Many of these initiatives were supported by ORG . Given the huge costs caused by the war devastation ( e.g. refugees / displaced persons , wounded , handicapped and killed persons ) additional support was provided for mental and psychosocial rehabilitation with a special emphasis on trauma . An increasing number of clients visit the ORG which function although there are problems with lack of funding , lack of professionals and the non - existence of an integrated health insurance funding system [ See , www.cmhr-bosnia.org The information appearing on the site is from DATE ] .", "In DATE a Stability Pact for South - Eastern Europe was created which established a mental health project with immediate support of , inter alia , ORG , ORG the Government of GPE . ORG and GPE agreed to coordinate the initiative which focused on developing new and reinforcing existing community mental health services . The object was to provide more affordable and efficient paths to mental health care and rehabilitation .", "ORG and ORG have also been involved in projects to build up and improve the health care system in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
