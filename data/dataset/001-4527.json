SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , a NORP citizen born in DATE , is a businessman residing in GPE in GPE . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE at approximately CARDINALhCARDINAL , the applicant was driving on a motorway in GPE in the direction of GPE . At CARDINAL stage , when driving on the left lane , he noted a neutral car behind him which kept coming up towards him and then falling back again . The applicant felt endangered ; as he could not move to the right lane , he decided to accelerate , though the car behind him did the same . Eventually , the applicant was able to move to the right lane and then leave the motorway at the next exit . Still the car followed him . It suddenly overtook him and the co - driver held a police - signal out of the window , ordering him to stop .", "The applicant stopped and realised that the persons in the car were CARDINAL policemen . He was accompanied to a motorway stop where he was told that he had exceeded the speed limit of QUANTITY by an average of QUANTITY would be fined MONEY ( CHF ) . The applicant was shown a video film of his driving which the policemen had recorded from their car while following him . The applicant pointed out that he had been followed for a longer period of time ; originally he had driven at QUANTITY / h and had been pressed by the car to drive more quickly . The police replied that they had had to follow him for a certain stretch in order to obtain valid readings . The readings concerned a stretch of QUANTITY .", "The applicant did not pay the fine and signed the police report .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) issued a penal order ( PERSON ) sentencing the applicant to DATE imprisonment , suspended on probation , and a fine of QUANTITY for having exceeded the speed limit by QUANTITY", "Throughout the ensuing proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer .", "Upon the applicant 's objection , ORG ) requested ORG ( Bezirksgericht ) to punish the applicant with DATE imprisonment and a fine of CARDINAL .", "On DATE the ORG summoned the applicant and police officer PERSON ( the co - driver ) to the trial . The invitation was sent to the applicant 's previous address in GPE in GPE by means of letters rogatory ( PERSON ) , though the invitation could not be served as the applicant had meanwhile moved to GPE .", "At the hearing on DATE the applicant was absent , and considered not to have provided an excuse herefor . At the hearing police officer PERSON was heard , explaining inter alia the video - system used , his experience in such matters , and that the applicant had driven at QUANTITY / h . The police officer submitted CARDINAL photos which were taken from the video film . The photos register inter alia the speed of the applicant \u2019s car . On CARDINAL photos there is a distance of QUANTITY between the applicant and the police car , often with ample free space on the right lane on the motorway ; and on the twelfth and last picture the police car had come closer to the applicant \u2019s car in order to film the applicant \u2019s number plate .", "At the hearing , hand written TIME of police officer PERSON were submitted according to which the applicant had overtaken the police car at a speed of just below QUANTITY The minutes also noted : \" he has allegedly been chased by the police \" ( \" er sei durch Pol . gejagt worden \" ) . This statement was apparently not included in the subsequent typed TIME of the hearing .", "The summons to the applicant for a new hearing on DATE could not be served on him either .", "On DATE the ORG President issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant in order \" to secure his presence at the trial \" ( \" Sicherung der Hauptverhandlung \" ) . The applicant was arrested on DATE when entering GPE . He then withdrew his objection against the penal order of DATE . As a result , ORG struck the case off its list .", "The applicant filed an appeal which was upheld by ORG ) of the GPE of GPE on DATE which found , inter alia , that the applicant had not been absent at the hearing of DATE by his own fault .", "Proceedings were resumed before ORG which fixed a new trial for DATE . As the applicant only received the invitation on DATE , a new hearing was fixed for DATE . The applicant challenged the President of ORG , whereupon the Deputy President presided .", "At the hearing , the applicant unsuccessfully requested to question the second police officer ( the driver ) and to be shown the entire video film .", "On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment , suspended on probation , and a fine of QUANTITY . In its decision the ORG found that the video film clearly demonstrated the excess in speed , and there was no indication that the registration system was faulty . In view thereof and of PERSON 's statement of DATE , the ORG refused to hear the other police officer . The ORG also found that the applicant , who alleged that he had been pressed by the police , had been able to comment on PERSON 's statements .", "On DATE the applicant challenged the Deputy ORG President in view of the manner in which he had conducted the proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal in which he requested , inter alia , to be shown the entire video film leading to his conviction , and to be able to put questions to both police officers .", "The appeal was dismissed by ORG of the GPE of GPE on DATE . The ORG , which had the competence to decide on both the factual and legal issues of the case , relied in its decision , inter alia , on statements of police officer PERSON as to the events . The ORG found that CARDINAL particular statement of PERSON was an incorrect assessment , namely that a police car regularly drove QUANTITY behind a car when the speed exceeded QUANTITY / h ; in fact the pictures demonstrated that the police had driven QUANTITY behind the applicant .", "In respect of the applicant 's requests for the taking of evidence , ORG found that the applicant had been shown CARDINAL pictures of the video film which sufficed to demonstrate that he had exceeded the speed limit , and that he had not been pressed by the police . The gaps of TIME between the pictures were too short to prove otherwise . For the same reason the police officers need not be heard , and their statements would not alter the ORG 's opinion . Indeed , even if the police had pressed the applicant , this would not justify the excess in speed . In any event , police officer PERSON had been heard , and his statement had been shown to the applicant .", "The applicant \u2019s public law appeal ( staatsrechtliche Beschwerde ) and plea of nullity ( PERSON ) were dismissed by ORG on DATE , the decision being served on DATE . In its decision the ORG found that the applicant had not shown that ORG had acted arbitrarily . Thus , even if it was accepted that the police car had pressed him by coming up towards him and falling back again this would not help him , as he would then have had periods where he would have reduced his speed . In respect of the applicant 's complaint about the alleged bias of ORG , ORG found that the decision of ORG would have healed any such shortcoming .", "Under the headline \" disciplinary punishment \" , ORG stated that the applicant 's appeals clearly lacked prospects of success in view of the convincing reasons given by ORG of the GPE of LOC in its decision . The decision continues :", "< Translation >", "\" The long - winded statements in his plea of nullity and in large parts also in his public law appeal are not reasonable . The applicant 's representative shall therefore be admonished in accordance with DATE ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
