THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE , and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , a solicitor , and Mr PERSON , counsel , both practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their agent , PERSON of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant was knocked off his bicycle by a car . He started proceedings against the driver of the car on DATE . The applicant returned to live in FAC . On DATE , ORG ordered the applicant to file further medical evidence in support of his claim within DATE , failing which any particulars of injury not substantiated by a medical report would be struck out . Further medical evidence was filed on behalf of the applicant , some within DATE and some later . The defendant to the proceedings made an application that the particulars of injury be struck out for failure to comply with the order of DATE . The application was heard on DATE by GPE Judge PERSON , who struck out the particulars of injury . The practical effect of striking out the particulars of injury was that the applicant could no longer claim general damages or damages for loss of earnings , which represented by far the major part of his claim .", "The applicant appealed against the decision of GPE Judge PERSON . On DATE , the appeal was heard by PERSON . She dismissed the appeal . The applicant applied to ORG for leave to appeal .", "The hearing began on DATE and continued on DATE . ORG reserved its judgment . On DATE , ORG handed down a judgment refusing permission to appeal . Each of the CARDINAL Lord Justices of Appeal gave a separate judgment .", "Sir PERSON considered that the Recorder had applied the proper test and exercised her discretion correctly , and that permission to appeal should accordingly be refused .", "Lord Justice PERSON considered that the District Judge and the ORG had failed to apply the relevant legal principles correctly , and that permission to appeal should be granted , because otherwise no court would have considered the exercise of its discretion on correct principles .", "Lord Justice PERSON considered that the Recorder had identified the applicable principles but failed to apply them , but that this failure did not raise any question of principle within the terms of either paragraph CARDINAL of the practice direction of CARDINAL DATE or paragraph CARDINAL of the consolidated practice direction of CARDINAL DATE ( see below ) . He further considered that the case was not one which for some other reason ( practice direction of CARDINAL DATE ) , or some other compelling reason ( consolidated practice direction of DATE ) , should be considered by ORG . Lord Justice PERSON stated at pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL :", "\u201c Personal injury litigation should not be conducted on the basis that the rules peculiar to it can be treated as of no importance . To do so is to put at risk CARDINAL of the objects which those rules are intended to promote ; that is to say , that the medical evidence on which the plaintiff relies can be properly assessed by the defendant at as early a stage as possible . Failure to make early disclosure of the plaintiff \u2019s medical condition puts a fair trial at risk . I can see no basis upon which to hold that justice demands that the defendant should suffer the risk that any trial which could now be held would be less than fair . On the contrary , it seems to me that the balance of justice lies in upholding the orders which have been made . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON concluded that permission to appeal should be refused . He declined to take a view on the merits which he regarded as finely balanced .", "On DATE , Lord PERSON , Master of the Rolls , issued a practice direction relating , inter alia , to leave to appeal to ORG ( reported at [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) . Practice Directions do not have formal legal effect but are followed by the judiciary , representing as they do the collective view of senior judges and , in time , the terms of Practice Directions become embodied in decisions of the higher courts , which do have binding effect . Paragraph CARDINAL of the practice direction provided , under the heading \u201c The General Test for Leave \u201d :", "\u201c The general rule applied by ORG , and thus the relevant basis for first instance courts deciding whether to grant leave , is that leave will be given unless an appeal would have no realistic prospect of success . \u201d", "Paragraph CARDINAL of the practice direction contained new guidance , in the following terms ( so far as material ) :", "\u201c Where there has already been CARDINAL unsuccessful appeal to a court ... against the decision being challenged , for example from a District Judge to a Circuit Judge or from a Master to a ORG Judge , and the application is for permission for a further appeal to ORG , a more restrictive approach to the test for permission to appeal should be adopted . Permission should be granted only if the case raises an important point of principle or practice or the case is one which for some other compelling reason should be considered by ORG . \u201d", "On DATE , ORG issued a practice direction consolidating , with some amendments , all of the principal practice directions which applied to proceedings in ORG ) . Paragraphs CARDINAL of the practice direction of CARDINAL DATE were reproduced in similar terms in the consolidated practice direction , with CARDINAL significant change : in paragraph CARDINAL ( new paragraph CARDINAL ) , the word \u201c important \u201d was omitted from the final sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
