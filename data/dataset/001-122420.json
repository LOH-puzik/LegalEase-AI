De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a dual NORP and GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . Her application was lodged on DATE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr M. GPE , a barrister practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented successively by their Agents , PERSON and PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The case relates to a domestic civil claim brought by the applicant in respect of an incident that occurred in DATE , in which the applicant claims that she was unlawfully detained and assaulted by officers of ORG ( \u201c the defendant \u201d ) . In DATE the applicant was granted legal aid to pursue a claim for damages in respect of these allegations . She was initially represented by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s claim was issued at ORG ( \u201c the CLCC \u201d ) on DATE . Her particulars of claim ( the document setting out the basis of her claim ) were filed with the CLCC and served the defendant on DATE . On DATE the CLCC recorded that the parties had agreed an extension of time for service of the defendant \u2019s defence to the claim to DATE . On DATE the defence was served on the applicant , although it is not clear whether this defence was ever filed with the court . On DATE a telephone call was received by the CLCC from the applicant \u2019s solicitors advising that they would fax the defence to the court . There is , however , no record that the defence was received or that the solicitors followed up their telephone conversation .", "CARDINAL . The parties agreed their own directions regarding the progress of the case ( that is , the procedural timetable for the case ) and , consequently , documents were disclosed and witness statements exchanged . In the meantime nothing was heard from the court . In DATE , the applicant withdrew instructions from ORG and , in DATE , instructed ORG ( \u201c FAC ) . Transfer of legal aid funding from ORG to ORG was confirmed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the CLCC seeking to progress the case . On receipt of the letter the CLCC wrote to the defendant on DATE requesting that a copy of the defence be filed with the court , which the defendant did on DATE . On DATE an allocation questionnaire was sent to the parties . ( An allocation questionnaire is a document the parties must complete and return to the court so that the court can give appropriate directions as to where , when and how the case should be heard ) . The applicant filed her questionnaire on DATE and a case management conference ( a conference between the court and the parties to agree procedural directions and identify the issues in the case : \u201c a ORG \u201d ) was listed for DATE . At the ORG the applicant was refused permission to rely on her own expert medical evidence , directions were given for the instruction of a single joint expert , and a trial window was set for DATE and DATE . The CLCC subsequently listed the case for trial on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made an application to amend her claim and an application to vacate ( that is , adjourn ) the trial date set for CARDINAL DATE . In DATE the applicant withdrew instructions from ORG . In the meantime , the CLCC duly listed her applications for hearing on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively but the applicant , stating that she would not be able to attend the hearing of her application as a litigant in person , did not attend on DATE and sought an adjournment ( with which the defendant agreed ) of the hearing set for CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to have her application of CARDINAL DATE re - considered and/or for a stay of the order of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE she also applied for the trial date of CARDINAL July CARDINAL to be vacated on the basis that she had to instruct new solicitors who required time to prepare her case and on the basis that she was not medically fit to represent herself . This application was listed for CARDINAL DATE . At some time in DATE the applicant instructed new solicitors , PERSON , who applied for a transfer of the applicant \u2019s legal aid certificate . On DATE the applicant applied to adjourn the hearing listed for CARDINAL DATE on the ground that funding had not yet been transferred to PERSON and that she was unable to represent herself . On DATE , with neither party in attendance but with the defendant \u2019s agreement , the CLCC ordered that the application be adjourned generally with permission to apply to restore . The applicant found the order confusing and thought that it meant that the trial date had been vacated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a further application to vacate the trial date to allow her new solicitors time to prepare the case . There is no record of a response to this application . The applicant did not attend the trial on DATE . She stated that this was due to reasons of ill - health . The trial judge ordered the applicant to attend the following day . The applicant claimed that she did not receive notice of this order , although it appears that the trial judge was satisfied that it had been communicated to her by the court clerk . The applicant did not attend court on DATE and her claim was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant withdrew instructions from PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to have her claim reinstated , arguing that the trial should have been adjourned and that she had good reasons for not attending . She failed to enclose with her application the prescribed application fee , although the applicant , in her submissions to this ORG , maintains that this was because she believed she was entitled to an exemption from paying the fee . Therefore , on DATE , the CLCC returned the application to the applicant notifying her of her failure to pay the fee . The applicant paid the fee on CARDINAL DATE . The application was then listed and heard on DATE . The applicant was represented at the hearing of this application by counsel on a direct access basis ( that is , a barrister directly instructed by a lay person without the need for that person to first instruct a solicitor ) . The judge held that the applicant had good reason for failing to attend the trial and reinstated her claim . A ORG was listed for DATE but on CARDINAL DATE the applicant applied for an adjournment . The defendant agreed to this request . At a hearing before the judge \u2013 attended only by the applicant \u2013 the hearing was adjourned until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In or around DATE the applicant states that she re - instructed ORG . It appears that ORG applied for a new legal aid certificate but were refused . The applicant stated that her application was \u201c bungled \u201d and that ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) \u201c lost or mysteriously returned \u201d her papers . CARDINAL letters were sent by the ORG to the applicant . The first , dated DATE , stated that \u201c you have provided insufficient information / documentation to enable the application to be fully considered ... you may apply for review by DATE \u201d . The second , dated DATE , stated that the \u201c file has been closed ... because the application was rejected DATE as it was not properly completed and we have not received the correctly completed application ... If public funding is still required , a fresh application must be made \u201d . ORG offered to represent the applicant on a private client basis . However , the applicant stated that she was unable to afford their fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG was again adjourned , at the request of CARDINAL or both of the parties for DATE . On DATE a ORG was held at which no order was made as to medical evidence and a trial window was set for DATE and DATE . On DATE the case was listed for trial on DATE . At the defendant \u2019s request , the trial was re - listed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed not to have been informed of this new trial date until DATE when she applied to have it vacated on grounds that , although she was available , her solicitor had gone on holiday without notifying her and that she could not represent herself on health grounds . The application to vacate was heard and rejected on DATE . The defendants relied at this hearing on a letter from ORG , dated DATE , which stated that the file handler had gone away for DATE between DATE and DATE and that , in any event , ORG were no longer instructed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant instructed counsel on a direct access basis to renew on DATE of the trial her application to vacate . Counsel was not instructed in relation to the trial itself for which he had no time to prepare . The applicant did not attend the trial on DATE , again for health reasons . The judge refused the renewed application to vacate and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim in its entirety . He ordered that any application to set aside his judgment be made without notice in the first instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to have the judgment set aside . The applicant did not pay the prescribed fee until DATE . On DATE the applicant telephoned the CLCC to ask for her application to be listed after DATE . The hearing was listed and took place on a without notice basis on DATE when she was granted leave to apply on notice to the defendant .", "CARDINAL . The hearing was listed for DATE . On DATE the defendant requested that the hearing be relisted as counsel was unavailable for the original date . On DATE the ORG agreed and requested that the parties informed the court of the dates which they wished to avoid . The defendant did so by letter dated DATE . The applicant did not and instead lodged a complaint over the decision to relist the hearing . On DATE she applied to have the hearing date of CARDINAL DATE reinstated . This application was dismissed by the CLCC on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the CLCC not to relist the hearing until further notice . She then requested by letter dated DATE that the CLCC list the hearing in DATE . The CLCC sought dates to avoid from the parties and , following receipt of correspondence , listed the hearing for DATE . The defendant subsequently notified the CLCC that it was unable to attend on that date and , following further correspondence , the court required the attendance of both parties on DATE to set a date , emphasising that once the hearing had been fixed it would not be relisted again . The case was then relisted for the first agreed date when both parties could attend , DATE .", "CARDINAL . The application to set aside the judgment of CARDINAL DATE dismissing the applicant \u2019s claim was heard on that date . The applicant was again represented by counsel on a direct access basis . After reciting the procedural history of the case and the reasons advanced by the applicant for her absence at DATE trial date , the judge hearing the application concluded :", "\u201c Taking all those matters into consideration , both the history and the discrepancies which are evident in the versions given by the [ applicant ] and the documentation [ and ] the similarity of her reliance upon the same excuses for not attending in the past strongly suggest to me that [ the applicant ] can not come anywhere near satisfying this court that there were good reasons for not attending and that those reasons were genuinely honest . I am fully satisfied that they were not in relation to the trial fixed for DATE \u201d .", "The applicant maintains that the CLCC had lost the case file and the applicant \u2019s bundle , and that the judge should not have proceeded without them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal notice with ORG out of time . In that notice she claimed that an earlier notice of appeal had been filed in time on an old form , although no evidence of an application on this old form was provided . The applicant attributed the delay in appealing to those of the CLCC in obtaining the judge \u2019s signature on the relevant order ( DATE ) and in providing a transcript of his judgment ( DATE ) . On DATE the High Court refused permission to appeal , holding that no reasons had been given to explain the delay in issuing the appeal notice and that , in any event , the proposed appeal had no prospects of success ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
