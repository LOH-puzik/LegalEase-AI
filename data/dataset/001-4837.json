THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE , and currently serving a prison sentence in GPE , the GPE . Before the ORG he is represented by PERSON . PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant was taken into police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) on suspicion of incitement to murder , followed by pre - trial detention ( voorlopige hechtenis ) on DATE . The applicant denied any involvement in the offence of which he was suspected . On CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor ordered the applicant \u2019s release as the maximum period of time during which pre - trial detention was allowed was nearing its end . However , in his decision of CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor added that the investigation would continue .", "The applicant was again taken into pre - trial detention on suspicion of the same offence on DATE by ORG PERSON ) of GPE . It appeared that on DATE a witness , X. , had made a statement to the police to the effect that the applicant had told him in DATE to shoot a person . The Investigating Judge considered that this constituted a new serious grievance against the applicant , justifying a remand order ( bevel tot bewaring ) .", "A pro forma hearing before ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE was set for DATE on which date the hearing was adjourned until DATE . ORG convicted the applicant on DATE of being an accessory to the offence of incitement to murder and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention .", "Both the applicant and the public prosecutor filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE . Before this ORG hearings took place on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . On this last occasion counsel for the applicant argued that the reasonable time as referred to in LAW had been exceeded in view of the fact that it had taken DATE after the applicant had been taken into police custody before the case had come to trial . For this reason the prosecution should either be declared inadmissible or the sentence to be imposed on the applicant should be mitigated .", "On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG for technical reasons , convicted the applicant of the same offence and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention . ORG based this conviction to a decisive extent on the statement made by the witness X. to an Investigating Judge on DATE . In respect of the period of time which had elapsed before the case came to trial , ORG held that the decision to order the applicant \u2019s second period of pre - trial detention had been justified in view of the new and serious grievances against him which had only come to light at a later stage and which had not yet been examined . A reasonable time had therefore not been exceeded .", "The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) , again raising the argument that a reasonable time had been exceeded . The applicant argued that the expeditious handling of the case subsequent to the witness \u2019s statement on DATE did not take away from the fact that prior to that time the prosecuting authorities had failed to carry out any kind of activity .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal in cassation pursuant to LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) as not prompting a determination of legal issues in the interest of legal unity and legal development ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
