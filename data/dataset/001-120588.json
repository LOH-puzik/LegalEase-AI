NORP The applicant , Mr Dumitru PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his wife , ORG , had a child , PERSON , born on DATE . On DATE the NORP ORG granted the couple \u2019s divorce and the mother was granted custody of the child . The applicant was ordered to pay child support and was granted the right to have personal relations with the child and contact rights , as follows : at the child \u2019s home on DATE from TIME and at the applicant \u2019s home on DATE from TIME", "CARDINAL . Relations between the parties continued to deteriorate , and the contacts between the applicant and his former wife became increasingly turbulent , even in the presence of the child . It therefore became difficult for the applicant to see A. without a conflict occurring between the adults involved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action for custody of his child , asking , alternatively , for an extension of his contact rights . He pointed out that he had not seen his son for DATE , as his former wife and her family had forbidden all contact . The GPE ORG gave judgment on DATE . It noted that the relations between the parents had deteriorated and that the mother was obstructing all contact between the father and his son , being inflexible and omitting to communicate important information about the child to the applicant .", "\u2019s request for modification of the visiting times . It ruled :", "\u201c Dismisses the plaintiff \u2019s requests for modification of the right to personal relations with the child , namely to accommodate the minor in [ the plaintiff \u2019s ] home . \u201d", "The court ordered ORG to communicate with the applicant about the child and to allow them to speak on the telephone .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , pointing out that not only had the court dismissed his claims , but it had also restricted his contact rights by no longer allowing him to take his son to his home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG and ORG of the GPE local council ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , acting at ORG request , visited the applicant \u2019s home , interviewed him , and concluded that he was in terms of his psychological and material situation a fit and proper person to take care of his child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the previous judgment , on the ground that the best interests of the child required that he remain resident with his mother ; it gave no answer to the applicant \u2019s representation about the restriction on his contact rights .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , seeking mainly to be granted custody of the child . He did not expressly complain about the restriction of contact rights perceived by him . ORG dismissed his claims in a final decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought revision of the previous decision , on the ground that by limiting his visiting rights the courts had decided ultra petita , to his disadvantage . On DATE ORG dismissed his request as out of time . The applicant did not appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , his subsequent attempts to see the child remained unsuccessful , as , encouraged by the decision of CARDINAL DATE , the mother refused to allow him to enter her home or to take the child away with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE lodged a request for modification of the contact schedule . On DATE ORG set contact TIME for the applicant , DATE , on DATE and DATE from TIME at the child \u2019s home . Appeal proceedings are currently pending with ORG .", "CARDINAL . During the new custody proceedings , on DATE the applicant requested by means of an urgent procedure ( ordonan\u0163\u0103 pre\u015fedin\u0163ial\u0103 ) a residence order in his favour , but on DATE ORG dismissed that request , on the ground that a change in residence required serious consideration , which could not be done in an expeditious procedure .", "The decision was upheld by ORG in a final decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a new request for interim measures , seeking modification of the contact schedule . In particular , he complained that relying on the judgment of DATE , ORG had since refused to allow him to take the child to his home .", "CARDINAL . NORP The GPE ORG gave its ruling on DATE . It examined the previous decisions rendered in the matter of residence and contact rights between the parties , and evidence of the recent deterioration of the former spouses\u2019 personal relations , as well as the written answers given by ORG to the questionnaire addressed to her by the applicant through the intermediary of the court , on the manner in which she was allegedly obstructing the exercise of his contact rights . The court also took note that the applicant refused to answer the questions addressed to him by ORG through the court on the manner in which he was exercising his contact rights .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the evidence in the file , the court noted that custody and contact rights had been established by the decision of DATE , and that on DATE additional requests by the applicant had been dismissed , apart from the right to obtain information about the child and to speak with him on the telephone . The court further observed that on several occasions the applicant had breached the contact schedule by trying to take the child outside the times set in the court order or by not returning the child on time to the mother \u2019s home , and that the mother had been forced to seek help from the authorities ( bailiffs and police ) to get her child back . It also noted that the applicant had exhibited violent behaviour towards the mother in the presence of the child , and that on several occasions he had tried to take the child from ORG by force .", "Relying both on LAW and on the provisions of the new LAW , the court stated that the right to maintain personal relations with the child could not be exercised to the detriment of the child \u2019s best interest . The court reiterated that its role was to decide on a temporary agreement , as the merits of the residence rights were being examined by a different court . It noted the tense situation between the parents , and considered that it was not in the child \u2019s best interest for them to have joint custody or for the applicant \u2019s visiting rights to be extended .", "It therefore dismissed the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE ORG dismissed as out of time the appeal lodged by the applicant against the decision rendered by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE on , the applicant and ORG lodged several criminal complaints against each other , the applicant accusing his former wife of breaching his right to maintain personal relations with his child by not allowing him contact with his son , by denigrating him in front of the child , and by repeatedly changing the child \u2019s place of residence , while ORG accused the applicant of causing a public breach of the peace when trying to visit A. in her home , and of keeping the child longer than allowed by the court order . They were both fined for their behaviour , the prosecutor and criminal courts acknowledging the bad relations between the parents and finding that both of them had tried , after the divorce , to cut the other parent off from the child , thus failing on several occasions to respect the contact schedule .", "In addition , by a prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE the applicant was fined for hitting PERSON , who had tried to stop him from forcibly taking the child from ORG \u2019s arms on the way to his kindergarten .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant sought the assistance of ORG to persuade the mother to comply with the court decisions granting him contact rights . A social worker visited ORG \u2019s home , assessed it as a suitable home for the child , advised the mother on the importance of allowing the child to maintain normal relations with both parents , and explained to her that the conflicts between her and her former spouse were jeopardising the child \u2019s development .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant made a new similar request . A social worker visited ORG and the child in their new home and discussed the situation with the mother , drawing her attention to the child \u2019s right to maintain relations with his father and the extended family , but also to the importance of protecting the child from any form of abuse or neglect . A.A.C. informed ORG that at that moment the applicant was exercising his contact rights at the child \u2019s school , as each visit to her home ended in open conflict between the adults .", "CARDINAL . NORP A.A.C. also sought ORG assistance in DATE , when the applicant refused to return the child to her home after a visit .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his former spouse continued to complain to ORG about various obstructions to their rights over the child . As a consequence , in DATE the experts of the ORG met with the parents to seek a workable solution for the exercise of their respective rights . A further meeting was held in DATE . On both occasions the parents failed to reach a satisfactory compromise .", "CARDINAL . NORP In various reports on the applicant \u2019s case , ORG found that the child was developing well and that the mother was providing an excellent environment for his upbringing .", "CARDINAL . The former spouses sent each other several notifications , through bailiffs\u2019 offices ( on DATE and DATE on behalf of the applicant and on DATE on behalf of ORG ) , asking for the contact schedule established by court orders to be adhered to .", "CARDINAL .
