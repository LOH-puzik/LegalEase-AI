The applicant was born in DATE . When lodging his application , he was detained in FAC ( GPE ) . He is currently detained in Grad PERSON ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered GPE in DATE . He has been convicted CARDINAL times since DATE , notably of theft and burglary . In particular , on DATE the ORG convicted him of CARDINAL counts of joint theft as a member of a gang and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of burglary and CARDINAL count of attempted burglary and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of joint attempted burglary , committed DATE after his release from prison , and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and remanded in detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of burglary and attempted burglary , committed DATE after his release from prison , and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It found that by breaking into different shops , the applicant had stolen goods worth CARDINAL ORG ( MONEY ) . It further ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention pursuant to LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Having regard to an expert report , the court found that the applicant had a propensity to commit offences by which serious economic damage was caused and was therefore dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , supplemented on DATE , the city of GPE ordered the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE and prohibited him to re - enter GPE for an indefinite duration in view of his criminal convictions . It authorised the applicant \u2019s expulsion directly from prison as soon as he had served his sentence . The expulsion order became final on DATE , the regional government of GPE having dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the plan governing the execution of the applicant \u2019s sentence , drawn up by FAC authorities and presented to the applicant on DATE , it is noted that the applicant \u2019s transfer to a social therapeutic institution , relaxations in the conditions of his detention and preparations for his release were not envisaged as the city of GPE had issued a deportation order against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC authorities informed the applicant , who was at that time detained in FAC , that it was not possible to transfer him to GPE in order to enable him to participate in a social therapy because he was liable to be expelled after having served his prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his full prison sentence until DATE . Since then , he was remanded in preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in review proceedings pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph MONEY below ) , decided that the execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention was still necessary in view of its objective .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , allowing the applicant \u2019s appeal , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case to ORG . It found that ORG had not been entitled to authorise CARDINAL of its judges to hear the applicant alone instead of hearing him in its full composition without giving reasons for doing so . Moreover , the refusal of FAC authorities to allow the applicant \u2019s defence counsel to inspect his personal files had violated the right to a fair trial .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s counsel was subsequently granted access to the applicant \u2019s personal files at FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having heard the applicant on DATE and the applicant and the CARDINAL experts PERSON and NORP on DATE , again decided that the execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention was necessary in view of its objective ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . It therefore refused to suspend the execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention and to grant probation .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the report submitted by the expert for forensic psychiatry PERSON , ORG found that it was very likely that the applicant would reoffend if released . He had been convicted of burglary on numerous occasions and had reoffended shortly after having served long prison sentences . As confirmed by a report submitted by ORG authorities dated DATE and by the applicant \u2019s statements at the hearing , the applicant continuously refused critically to reflect on his offences and felt persecuted and wrongfully convicted by the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that there were also no other elements indicating that the applicant was no longer inclined to reoffend . It noted that according to expert PERSON , it was advisable for the applicant to participate in a social therapy . It conceded that the applicant had not been admitted to a social therapy in FAC he had applied for in DATE . The conditions of his detention had also not been relaxed ( Vollzugslockerungen ) . Both of these measures were important conditions for arriving at a prognosis that he was no longer dangerous to the public . However , this did not alter the fact that the applicant kept posing a risk to the public .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the applicant \u2019s preventive detention was also not disproportionate . As the applicant was not a NORP national it was unlikely that the prison authorities , having regard to the usual practice , would relax his conditions of detention . He had further been refused a social therapy in view of his imminent expulsion . The court considered that it was illegal to retain a convicted person in preventive detention for an indefinite period of time only as a consequence of his foreign nationality and the resulting refusal of relaxed conditions of imprisonment . ORG would have to consider this issue when deciding on a fresh motion lodged by the applicant to suspend his preventive detention pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Otherwise , a suspension of the preventive detention order against the applicant on probation could have to be ordered in the future for reasons of proportionality even without the conditions of his detention having previously been relaxed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , ORG found that the applicant was still dangerous to the public . He had also proved obstinate in prison and had to be punished CARDINAL times in DATE for having insulted the prison staff . Due to the fact that the applicant , as confirmed by expert PERSON , refused to take responsibility for his past offences , there were no suitable measures to prepare the applicant adequately for his release . As the applicant was in preventive detention only since DATE , the execution of this measure was still proportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He notably argued that his right to freedom as guaranteed by LAW of LAW was violated because his preventive detention was disproportionate . Moreover , he claimed that the refusal to admit him to a social therapy due to his imminent expulsion discriminated him because of his NORP nationality and therefore disregarded his right to equality under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint and to grant him legal aid ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It found that his complaint had no prospects of success . There was nothing to indicate that the criminal courts , in reaching their decision under LAW , notably in finding that the applicant was still dangerous , had failed duly to consider human dignity and the right to freedom as guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court confirmed that measures relaxing the conditions of detention were a decisive factor for the prognosis of a convicted person \u2019s dangerousness . However , the applicant neither claimed to have applied for such measures in the course of his preventive detention nor to have been unlawfully refused such measures . The decisions of the criminal courts were also not based on the fact that until then , no such measures had been granted . As regards therapeutic measures , the criminal courts had rightly pointed out that due to the applicant \u2019s persistent refusal to accept responsibility for his offences there were no suitable measures to prepare him adequately for his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LOC dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for measures relaxing the conditions of his preventive detention , notably leave under escort for DATE under the supervision of CARDINAL prison officers . It argued that he might abscond on that occasion . The applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law against this decision to ORG was to no avail . On DATE FAC authorities dismissed another request made by the applicant to relax his conditions of preventive detention on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC again declared not to consent to a transfer of the applicant from ORG to it in order to admit the applicant to a social therapy . It argued that it was not in a position to prepare the applicant , who was liable to be expelled , for a life without offences in GPE . The living conditions in that country were not known to the therapists . On DATE the NORP - ORG dismissed as inadmissible the applicant \u2019s request to declare that refusal unlawful . It found that it were FAC authorities which were competent to decide on the applicant \u2019s transfer to a different prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , reviewing the necessity of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention under Articles CARDINALd DATE of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , refused to suspend the execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention order on probation . Having regard to the report of psychiatric expert A. it had consulted , it found that there was still a risk that the applicant would commit further serious offences against the property of others ( but no violent offences ) if released .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s continued preventive detention was still proportionate . It conceded that it was problematic that no measures at all were planned by the prison authorities to further the applicant \u2019s reintegration into society . Moreover , owing to , in particular , his foreign nationality , the applicant could not expect any relaxations in the conditions of his detention . In practice , the latter were a precondition for coming to an assessment that a detainee was no longer dangerous to the public . Therefore , the court would have to decide at the next periodic review of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention whether the applicant was to be released for reasons of proportionality , despite the fact that he had not previously been granted relaxations in the conditions of his detention and had not been considered as no longer posing a threat to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It noted , in particular , that expert PERSON had considered that there was no starting point for beginning with measures preparing the applicant \u2019s conditional release . As he contested having committed the property offences he had been found guilt of , he could not critically reflect on his criminal behaviour . Therefore , relaxations in the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention , which were very important to arrive at a prognosis that a person was no longer dangerous to the public , had not been refused without good cause .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to suspend the execution of his preventive detention in view of his imminent expulsion under LAW . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for judicial review . Endorsing the reasons given by the prosecution authorities , it found that there was still a risk that the applicant reoffended and that he was still was not conscious of his guilt . In these circumstances , a therapeutic treatment was without prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . DATE ) . It found that the decision of ORG to consider as lawful the prosecution \u2019s balancing between the public interest in the continuation of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention and the applicant \u2019s interest in his personal liberty had \u2013 at least at that time \u2013 not been unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG dismissed another request made by the applicant to suspend the execution of his preventive detention under Article CARDINAL of LAW on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeals were to no avail . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG noted , in particular , that it might appear contradictory to the applicant that measures aiming at his reintegration into society , such as a social therapy , were refused to him because of the deportation order against him , but that the authorities nevertheless refused to suspend the execution of his preventive detention under LAW . However , the refusal of the said measures alone did not mean that the prosecution authorities could only exercise their discretion in a lawful manner by granting his request under the said provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to suspend the execution of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention at the date of his expulsion to GPE , and on DATE at the earliest , under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was expelled to GPE in accordance with the deportation order issued by the city of GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE ) convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of murder , CARDINAL count of attempted murder and robbery with firearms , committed on DATE in GPE and sentenced him to life imprisonment . The judgment was upheld on appeal . The applicant was subsequently transferred to GPE in order to serve his sentence .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows :", "CARDINAL . NORP The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention ( a so - called measure of correction and prevention ) under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence ( a penalty ) , if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALc of the Criminal Code governs orders for the preventive detention of convicted persons which are not executed immediately after the judgment ordering them becomes final . Paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention , the court responsible for the execution of sentences ( that is , a special ORG composed of CARDINAL professional judges , see sections ORG and DATE ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) must review , before completion of the prison term , whether the person \u2019s preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective . If that is not the case , it suspends the execution of the preventive detention order and places the person on probation with supervision of their conduct which commences with the suspension .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code governs the duration of preventive detention . Paragraph CARDINAL , first sentence , of that LAW , in its version in force at the relevant time , provides that if there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time - limit has not yet expired , the court shall suspend on probation the further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his release .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the court ( that is , the chamber responsible for the execution of sentences ) may review at any time whether the further execution of the preventive detention order should be suspended and a measure of probation applied . It is obliged to do so within fixed time - limits ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) . For persons in preventive detention , this time - limit is DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , ORG may dispense with the execution of a prison sentence or a measure of correction and prevention if the convicted person is expelled from NORP territory . The execution of the sentence or measure may be continued if the expelled person returns to GPE territory ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act provides that prisoners may be transferred to a socio - therapeutic institution with their consent if the special therapeutic measures and social aids of the institution are advisable for their rehabilitation . The transfer is conditional upon the consent of the head of the socio - therapeutic institution concerned .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the conditions of detention may be relaxed by making an order permitting the prisoner to perform regular work outside prison either under the supervision of a member of the prison staff ( outside work ) or without such supervision ( work release ) . The prisoner may further be permitted to leave the prison for a certain time during DATE either under the supervision of the prison staff ( short leave under escort ) or without such supervision ( short leave ) . Under LAW of LAW , these measures may only be ordered with the prisoner \u2019s consent and if there is no risk that the prisoner might seek to abscond or commit offences during the relaxation of the conditions of his detention .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of ORG relating to LAW , which seek to ensure the uniform application of the law by the authorities , external work , work release and short leave may , as a rule , not be permitted to prisoners against whom a final expulsion order is in force and who are to be deported directly from prison . Exceptions may be granted in agreement with the competent GPE authority . Short leave under escort may be authorised .", "DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the ORG preventive detention beyond the former DATE maximum period and also concerning the retrospective order for the ORG preventive detention ( file nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Reversing its previous position , ORG held that all provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective ordering of such detention were incompatible with LAW as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law , read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all the relevant provisions of LAW on the imposition and duration of preventive detention were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of persons in preventive detention . It found that those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment ( PERSON ) . These provisions included , in particular , LAW in its version in force since DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with LAW remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until DATE at the latest . The provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention which did not concern the retrospective ordering or prolongation of preventive detention could only continue to be applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality . As a general rule , proportionality was only observed where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious violent crimes or sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG relied on the interpretation of LAW made by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above ; see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ss . of ORG judgment ) . It stressed , in particular , that the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment and the principles laid down in LAW required an individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care to the persons concerned . In line with the ORG \u2019s findings in the case of PERSON GPE ( cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi - disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution did not have prospects of success ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
