It was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , from ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant company created a joint stock company \u201c ORG , a.s . \u201d which was entered in ORG on DATE . On DATE the applicant company affirmed to invest its real estate , the value of which was estimated at CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) , as a non - cash investment in the joint stock company \u2019s capital . The value of its investment was divided , for the purposes of accounting , into CARDINAL parts , when CZK MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) was booked as a registered capital ( z\u00e1kladn\u00ed kapit\u00e1l ) , CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) as a guarantee fund ( rezervn\u00ed fond ) and the remaining part of CZK MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) was placed on other capital funds .", "On DATE ORG ( finan\u010dn\u00ed \u00fa\u0159ad ) levied on the applicant company real estate transfer tax of CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , the base of assessment being fixed at CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) , calculated from the value of the immovable property which had not been booked as a registered capital .", "On DATE the ORG ( finan\u010dn\u00ed \u0159editelstv\u00ed ) dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) investment into companies or cooperatives shall be exempted from payment of gift tax and real estate transfer tax under the relevant legal provisions , i.e. the Second Part of the Commercial Code , which does not recognise any other investment than that in the registered capital , in contrast to the book - keeping procedure ... Moreover , it is clear from section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW concerning the management of investments made prior to the creation of a company , that only investments into the company \u2019s registered capital are to be considered as investments into the company ...", "Bearing in mind that LAW ] exempts from payment of tax only investments into the company , using the term of \u2018 investment\u2019 as defined in LAW , the exemption only concerns those investments which increase the company \u2019s registered capital . Other investments ... which do not increase the registered capital are liable to real estate transfer tax . ...", "It is to be added that e.g. the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Regional Court in its judgment no .

Applying systematic and teleological interpretation it concluded that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of LAW covered only investments that increased the registered capital . The court further held that the fact that the joint stock company could not have the registered capital at its disposal - contrary to its other assets \u2013 was precisely taken into account in the tax assessment . The court found irrelevant the applicant company \u2019s reference to section CARDINALa of LAW that the transfer of immovable property to a joint stock company differed from the same operation involving other companies .", "In its judgment , ORG made reference to ORG judgment no .

It referred to ORG opinion which read , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c The Director of ORG , upon ORG request , submitted that the interpretation of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW may allow a conclusion that the term of investment means property of a partner which he or she undertakes to invest in the company ... The total of the company \u2019s ORG monetary and non - monetary investments constitutes the registered capital which , in terms of book - keeping , is an accounting debit . Precisely , it is the ORG real estate invested in the company , forming , after the transfer of the ownership , the registered capital , which constitutes the investment under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of LAW .... ORG is therefore of the opinion that the investment into the company which was exempted from payment of real estate transfer tax under LAW [ then in force ] was only the investment valuably expressed in the registered capital . ...", "ORG also referred to the ... opinion of certain courts , e.g. judgments of ORG no . CARDINAL Ca CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL , of LOC no . CARDINAL Ca CARDINAL/CARDINAL , of ORG no . CARDINAL Ca DATE , ORG no . CARDINAL Ca CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL which are published in LOC , or in professional bulletins ... ORG adopted a concordant opinion in its decisions no . III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL and no . II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL . According to the Ministry , the tax legislation and its interpretation is accessible to the public , clearly defined and consistent , and so foreseeable . \u201d", "ORG held that the imposition of tax was in conformity with the LAW as it was based on the law . It further held that having carefully reasoned their decisions , it could not be said that the fiscal authorities had applied the law arbitrarily . The court found irrelevant the applicant company \u2019s reference to section CARDINALa of LAW that the taxation regime applicable to joint stock companies differed from that which applied to limited liability companies .", "Under section PERSON ) real estate transfer tax is payable on the transfer of an estate carried out in return for payment .", "Section DATE provides that the real estate transfer tax base is the price established under the relevant legal provisions on DATE of the acquisition of the estate , even if the price agreed between the parties is lower than the legally established price .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) provided , inter alia , that investments into companies or ORG under a special law , i.e. the Second Part of LAW , shall be exempted from payment of gift tax and real estate transfer tax .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) provides , inter alia , that investments into the registered capital of companies or ORG under a special law , i.e. the Second Part of LAW , shall be exempted from payment of gift tax and real estate transfer tax .", "Section CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that a company \u2019s registered capital consists of the total of its ORG monetary and non - monetary investments in the registered capital .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , a partner \u2019s investment in the company shall be the total sum of his or her monetary contribution and any other investment appraisable in monetary terms which the partner undertakes to invest in the company .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides , inter alia , that ownership title to real estate is acquired by the company upon the recording of the ownership title in ORG on the basis of a written declaration by the party concerned , to which are appended officially authenticated signatures .", "Under section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) the issue price of a share is the sum at which a company issued shares . The issue price can not be lower than the nominal value of a share . The second paragraph provides , inter alia , that if the issue price of a share is higher than its nominal value , the difference constitutes a share premium . Under the third paragraph , the difference between the value of non - monetary investment and the nominal value of shares which are to be issued to the shareholder as consideration , is considered as a share premium , providing that the company \u2019s statute , articles of association or a decision of the general meeting do not specify that that difference or part thereof is to be paid to the subscriber , or , that it is to be considered as a guarantee fund .", "The court held that if the claimant \u2019s investment had not been intended to increase the company \u2019s registered capital , it could not be considered as an investment within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of LAW .", "The court held that only investments that increase a company \u2019s registered capital are exempt from payment of tax under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of LAW .", "The court stated that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW defines the investment of a partner as the total sum of his or her monetary contribution and any other investment appraisable in monetary terms which the partner undertakes to invest in the company . The registered capital is then defined as the total of the ORG monetary and non - monetary investments in the registered capital . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of the LAW exempts from payment of gift tax investments into companies or ORG under the relevant legal provisions , i.e. the Second Part of LAW . It follows that LAW does not provide for any other investment than that into the registered capital , contrary to accounting rules . Taking into account that LAW exempts from payment of taxes only investments into a company when using the term of investment as defined by LAW , the exemption applies only to the investments which increase the company \u2019s registered capital .", "The court held that the terminology used by the legislator in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) of LAW was not equivocal . The legislator used the term of non - monetary investment , which can only be exempted from payment of tax , in meaning both the investment of a partner and , at the same time , the whole substance of the investment , i.e. not only the part which constitutes the partner \u2019s investment but also the part which was considered as a share premium . LAW had not specified , until DATE , which of the CARDINAL meanings of the investment had to be used by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(e ) .", "The court found in relation to litigation prior to the change in DATE that the exemption from payment of real estate transfer tax only applied to an investment into the registered capital of a company . In that case , the real estate transfer tax will not be levied .", "The court , applying the version in force before DATE , found that the exemption from payment of real estate transfer tax only applied to investment into a company within the meaning of LAW . Only those investments which were to increase the registered capital could be exempted from payment of real estate transfer tax . Investments which did not increase the registered capital are liable to tax .", "The domestic courts held that real estate transfer tax had to be paid on investments into companies that did not form part of the registered capital ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
