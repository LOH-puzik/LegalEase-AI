FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["Both applicants are NORP nationals and live in GPE . The first applicant , Mr M.A. , was born in DATE and the second applicant , Mr FAC , in DATE .", "They are represented before the ORG by Mr S. Foreman of ORG ( whose office is their address for service ) , and by PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the parties , can be summarised as follows .", "On an unspecified date , when the \u201c PERSON \u201d was in the port of GPE , the applicants stowed away on it . They were discovered by the crew at TIME on DATE when the ship was putting in to the NORP port of ORG , GPE . Having been informed of the situation by the ship \u2019s captain , the head of the d\u00e9partemental ORG and ORG in GPE ( PERSON ) instructed the captain to hold the applicants on board while the ship was in port and during \u201c any other calls at NORP ports \u201d .", "At TIME on CARDINAL DATE the \u201c PERSON \u201d left ORG for ORG . It was scheduled to call at ORG on DATE and to leave GPE the same or the following day bound for the GPE .", "At TIME on CARDINAL May the applicants lodged an application with the President of ORG under LAW for a provisional stay of execution of the decision to confine them on board the \u201c PERSON \u201d . They submitted that their complaint was urgent and , relying inter alia on ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW , sought an injunction requiring both the Prefect of the Charente - Maritime d\u00e9partement and the head of the PERSON to allow them to disembark and to proceed to the waiting zone . On DATE they lodged an application with ORG to have the decision for their confinement quashed and for an order for their admission to the waiting zone .", "At TIME on DATE , when the \u201c PERSON \u201d was at GPE , the authorities ended the confinement measure . The applicants were refused leave to enter NORP territory and an order was made for their placement in the waiting zone at the port of GPE . That order was renewed by the administrative authorities on DATE and upheld by the Vice - President of the GPE tribunal de grande instance on DATE .", "On DATE the Vice - President of ORG made the following order on the application for a provisional stay of execution :", "\u201c \u2026 in view of developments , the decision requiring [ the applicants ] to be held on board while the ship was docked at ORG and during \u2018 any other calls at NORP ports\u2019 \u2013 a decision which , incidentally , was effective only while the ship was at ORG is no longer enforceable . Accordingly , it is no longer necessary to decide either the application for a provisional stay of execution or , for the same reasons , the application for an injunction requiring ORG d\u00e9partement to allow the applicants to disembark ; \u2026 \u201d", "On DATE , ORG set aside that ruling on the following grounds :", "\u201c DATE of the Ordinance of DATE [ on the conditions of ORG entry into and residence in GPE ] , as amended by LAW CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , provides that \u2018 an alien who arrives in GPE by rail , sea or air and who ( a ) is refused leave to enter NORP territory or ( b ) applies for asylum may be held in a waiting zone ... for the time strictly necessary to arrange his departure ... \u2019", "Although the authorities maintained that those provisions merely gave them a discretion to place aliens who had been refused leave to enter NORP territory in a waiting zone and that they retained the right to prevent stowaways disembarking provided that their enforced stay on board the vessel did not amount to a greater degree of constraint than that which would arise on their placement in a waiting zone , the provision cited above , as made clear by the preparatory work on the law of DATE , shows firstly that the procedure established by LAW , namely placement in a waiting zone , is the only course of action available to the authorities when they decide , as they are entitled to do by LAW cited above , of their own motion to give effect to a decision , even an implied decision , to refuse leave to enter NORP territory by holding the alien concerned against his will in a specific place , and , secondly , that forced confinement on board ship would in any event amount to a significantly greater degree of constraint than that arising on placement in a waiting zone as , in particular , it deprives the alien concerned of the safeguards laid down in paragraphs PERSON to VI of DATE . Consequently , the ORG submission that the decision of CARDINAL DATE to confine them on board a vessel was unlawful and had to be quashed is founded ... \u201d", "Articles L. CARDINAL and L. CARDINAL of ORG Code provide respectively :", "\u201c \u2026 [ The presidents of the administrative courts , presidents of the administrative courts of appeal , the Vice - President of ORG and the presidents of the judicial benches of the administrative courts and the administrative courts of appeal ] may \u2026 , by an order made after adversarial process , dismiss an application for a stay . They may , in any event , remit the case before the full court .", "On an application to that end and after adversarial process , the president of the administrative court or the president of the ordinary court may make an order staying the execution of the administrative decision concerned for a maximum of DATE if there is a danger that execution will entail irreversible consequences and reasonable grounds are made out in the request .", "A provisional stay shall cease to be effective if the decision on the application for a stay is handed down before the period fixed by the judge has expired . \u201d", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( PERSON de GPE v. tribunal de grande instance de GPE ) ORG ( Tribunal des conflits ) held as follows :", "\u201c \u2026 While a vessel was in a NORP port , the NORP immigration authorities decided to refuse CARDINAL passengers of NORP nationality \u2026 leave to enter and held them on board the ship . The passengers \u2026 challenged their \u201c confinement \u201d on board before the urgent - applications judge of the GPE tribunal de grande instance and sought an injunction against the administrative authorities requiring them to allow them to disembark and to proceed to the waiting zone established by DATE of the Ordinance of DATE . Considering that a flagrantly unlawful act ( voie de fait ) had been committed , the urgent - applications judge rejected the GPE Police Commissioner \u2019s submission that he had no jurisdiction to hear the application .", "Furthermore , by LAW : \u2018 \u2026 in all cases involving deprivation of liberty of the individual , the conflict of jurisdiction can never be dealt with by the administrative authorities and the ordinary courts always have exclusive jurisdiction . The same shall apply to any civil proceedings based on facts amounting to a deprivation of individual liberty ... \u2019 These provisions , which provide an exception to the rule governing the separation of the powers of the administrative and judicial authorities ... can not be construed as authorising the ordinary courts to obstruct the enforcement of decisions taken by the authorities unless the decision concerned amounts to a flagrantly unlawful act . The power to issue injunctions against the authorities rendering their decisions unenforceable is of the same nature as the power to quash or vary decisions made by the authorities in the exercise of their prerogatives as a public authority ; that power is in the sole province of the administrative authorities except for those domains which , by their nature , are reserved to the judicial authorities . It follows from this that the provisions ... of LAW of LAW can not in the instant case serve as a basis for the giving the urgent - applications judge of the GPE tribunal de grande instance jurisdiction to hear the action brought by [ the applicants ] .", "Further , the provisions of LAW DATE show that the legislature has in principle given the administrative authorities the power to enforce deportation orders or orders refusing leave to enter made as part of the immigration - control process . Consequently , even supposing them to be unlawful , the measures taken in the instant case against [ the applicants ] were not manifestly incapable of being within the authorities\u2019 powers . Accordingly , they can not be regarded as amounting to flagrantly unlawful acts .", "It follows from the foregoing that it was the administrative courts which had jurisdiction to hear the matter that came before the GPE tribunal de grande instance and that the question of jurisdiction was rightly raised by the GPE Police Commissioner ... \u201d", "The applicants complained that the President of ORG had not ruled on their application for a provisional stay of execution of the decision confining them on board the \u201c PERSON \u201d until DATE , despite the fact that it had been lodged at TIME on CARDINAL DATE when the vessel was due to leave GPE on DATE They argued that as a result of the ORG decision in the case of GPE de GPE v. tribunal de grande instance de GPE of CARDINAL DATE , they could not apply to the urgent - applications judge , and so had been victims of a violation of LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
