The court refuted the applicant \u2019s allegation that the bat retained as evidence had been switched with another ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , noting that the disparity in the bat \u2019s description by the experts and the prosecutor could have been explained by the fact that the latter was colour blind .", "CARDINAL .
