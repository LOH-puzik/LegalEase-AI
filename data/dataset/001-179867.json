The applicants only learned of the situation through the media or by telephone from the building \u2019s security guards . They were told that the authorities were examining the legality of the building permit and other relevant documents .

The ORG is entitled to have the land back in its previous state . The demolition of the building is an indisputable consequence . The land should be cleared . If this means that the building should be demolished , then demolition should take place . The demolition is not a purpose per se .

It appears from ORG decision dated DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that during the proceedings the applicants argued that the actions taken by the ORG and ORG had been arbitrary because the construction had been lawful and in accordance with urban planning regulations . They claimed that police officers and representatives of the ORG and ORG had refused to allow them to enter the building by surrounding the building with crime scene tape . The cordoning off of the building had been done with a view to its demolition because the authorities had already proceeded in the same manner with other buildings , a fact which made it ever more apparent that there was a risk of adverse consequences for the applicants . The actions taken , namely the surrounding of the building with a view to its demolition without conducting a detailed analysis of whether the documentation was unlawful , and without the situation being examined by a court , had resulted in an extreme interference with the applicants\u2019 property rights .", "CARDINAL . During those proceedings the applicants further requested ORG to issue an interim order for the necessary measures to stay the implementation of the above - mentioned administrative action and for the removal of the obstacles which had made the seizure of the building possible and had made it impossible for them to use their properties , as well as a stay of all administrative decisions already issued or which were in the process of being issued related to the demolition of a lawful construction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , under Articles CARDINAL et seq . of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) and LAW , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , in its operative provisions ordered : \u201c the issuance of an interim order staying the administrative actions of any public authority that can interfere with the peaceful enjoyment by the applicants of their respective properties ... the interim order is to remain in place until a decision is given on the merits , provided that the applicants themselves institute proceedings on the merits within DATE of the interim order to challenge the administrative actions or any administrative decision that will be adopted in respect of their properties \u201d . The decision , in so far as relevant , is reasoned as follows :", "\u201c ... it is proved that the applicants \u2013 owners of the flats in the Jon Residence have not been allowed to enter their respective properties , thus impeding them in the exercise of their property rights to a property which they have acquired legally in accordance with domestic law ... the court considers that the request for the interim order should be accepted because the applicants submitted evidence which proves ... that in the event that a civil claim on the merits is allowed , the execution of that decision would be difficult or impossible , thus creating a situation where the legal interest or subjective right recognised by a final judicial decision remains ineffective ... in the present case the interim order requested by the applicants represents their right to access the court with the purpose of prohibiting any further action by the administrative authority ... in this way protecting their fundamental constitutional and legal rights until the examination of the merits of their claims ... the court considers that the ORG and ORG have not documented their administrative decision in the form required by law ... under administrative law this [ undocumented administrative action ] is also considered an administrative decision ... this does not affect the actual consequences of the execution of the decision , consequences which may bring about irreparable damage to the legal interest and subjective rights of the applicants ... ORG considers that it is the duty of the administrative authority to issue an administrative decision in the written form required by law , in this way there is compliance with the principle of good governance of the public administration authorities as well as effective compliance with the rights of the party against which the administrative decision has been issued , so that that party is able to institute judicial proceedings and always in respect of the principle of the right to a fair trial ... the principle of proportionality during the administrative procedure followed by the authorities in the present case is similar to the constitutional principles of proportionality examined above , which essentially aim to strike a balance between the purpose to be achieved through the administrative act and the means to be used , without disregarding fundamental freedoms and rights and the achievement of legal public interests ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the ORG representative submitted a request to the ORG , informing it of the interim order of CARDINAL DATE . He stressed the fact that under LAW of the ORG an interim order was an executable decision , even in the event of an appeal against it . He urged the authorities to take the necessary measures for the immediate enforcement of the interim order . It appears that no reply was given .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG lodged an appeal against the interim order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the proceedings concerning the interim measure on the grounds that the subject matter of the proceedings had ceased to exist , as ORG had already been demolished in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The decision , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ... it was already ... a well - known public fact that ORG had been demolished , in relation to which ORG had decided to stay the administrative actions of any ORG authority with the aim of the peaceful enjoyment of the property by the applicants until the final solution of the dispute ...

It appears that on an unspecified date one of the applicants complained to the Ombudsman ( ORG ) about the authorities\u2019 interference with her entering her flat and other residents entering their flats ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

On DATE , in reply to the applicant \u2019s complaints and to other ORG complaints appearing in the media , the ORG sent an official letter to the chief of LOC police station ( GPE i PERSON ) , the head of LOC district police ( LOC ) , and for information to the Director General of ORG ) , recommending that they take all appropriate measures to stop the unlawful actions that had resulted in a violation of the Jon Residence residents\u2019 property rights . The ORG stated that the ORG had seized the building without any formal act . The cordoning off of the building preventing the applicants from enjoying their properties was unlawful and had consequently resulted in a violation of their legal interests . Moreover , the use of yellow police \u201c crime scene \u201d tape was not appropriate since the events in the present case did not involve a crime scene . He further suggested that it was necessary to examine the case and undertake organisational measures aimed at ensuring that such actions were not repeated in the future .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , but within DATE from the interim order , CARDINAL residents , including CARDINAL of the applicants ( PERSON , A. ORG , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON .

It appears from ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that the object of the claim was the same as that lodged on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared that the actions carried out by the ORG and ORG on DATE had been arbitrary and in flagrant breach of LAW and the law . The decision in so far as relevant reads as follows :", "\u201c ... [ the ] ORG and [ the ] ORG abusively and without any administrative decision to justify their illegal actions took arbitrary action with the aim of demolishing a property which had been acquired in accordance with the law . The ORG had no legal reason to take this administrative action , and therefore its actions were totally illegal ... the administrative action for the demolition of the construction as duly authorised by the competent authorities without first analysing in detail the illegality of the actions and without an assessment of the situation by an independent court of law , was within the limits of extreme illegality ... The authorities unilaterally and without a full and comprehensive administrative investigation surrounded the building ... The authorities with their arbitrary actions gravely violated the principle of legal certainty , according to which no one should suffer an interference with their rights obtained by law and has the expectation that no ORG authority will take any administrative decision or action by which the rights obtained by law could later be violated as a consequence of the State authorities\u2019 actions ... \u201d", "ORG accordingly allowed the claim . The applicants , however , withdrew their request for the authorities to be prohibited from taking any further action , which had become devoid of purpose , since ORG had in the meantime been demolished by the authorities . ORG therefore discontinued the examination of this part of the claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an appeal by the authorities , ORG upheld ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . It appears from the decision that the applicants argued that the ORG and ORG had abusively and without any administrative decision to justify their illegal actions taken arbitrary action with a view to demolishing a lawful property . ORG reasoned that the cordoning off of the building and prevention of the applicants from entering it had been arbitrary , not in accordance with the law and in breach of their property rights . It further noted that the ORG were obliged to compensate the applicants for their illegal actions under LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) and LAW . Only after the actions taken by the authorities were declared unlawful were the applicants entitled to bring a claim for damages under LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . However , it did not decide this issue as it had not been part of the claim . It appears that the proceedings are pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG p\u00ebr GPE \u201c LOC ) adopted a decision on emergency measures to be undertaken for the protection and rehabilitation of the environment in some areas of national importance , as well as a procedure for the preparation of an integrated sectoral plan concerning stretches of coastline . The decision stated that stretches of coastline were areas of national importance where measures of an emergency nature were to be undertaken with a view to protecting and rehabilitating the territory and environment . Furthermore , it was decided that the granting of new development building permits for individual buildings on stretches of coastline and in other areas of national importance would be suspended pending the preparation of the integrated sectoral plan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision , which came into effect immediately , ordering the expropriation in the public interest of immovable private properties affected by the environmental rehabilitation of Uji i Ftoht\u00eb \u2013 Tuneli , a protected stretch of coastline in GPE . The expropriation was made in favour of GPE within DATE of the decision . The total compensation awarded was MONEY NORP PERSON ( ALL ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) in respect of the construction measuring CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL square metres in total , to be divided among the owners . The decision was taken under LAW and on the basis of CARDINAL decisions of the NCTP \u2013 the above - mentioned decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and an earlier decision of DATE on the approval of the LOC city centre plan . According to the decision , after the expropriation the legal owners of the property would be compensated ( by the authorities ) on presentation of their property title documents . The deadline for the termination of the expropriation procedure was set for CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The decision was published in ORG on DATE . It appears that the applicants only learned of the decision DATE , when the press spokesman for the Minister of ORG announced that ORG was to be demolished DATE a process that was to start DATE ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mayor of PERSON requested the assistance of the ORG with the demolition of ORG in accordance with the decision of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the ORG requested the assistance of LOC police station with the demolition , which was planned to start at TIME . The entire building was demolished DATE and DATE ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the IPRO , in response to a letter sent by CARDINAL of the applicants asking for a copy of her certificate of ownership , said that since the building had been demolished , it was unable to issue a certificate of ownership in respect of a property that no longer existed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued another decision , \u201c On some amendments to the ORG of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE \u201d , amending its previous decision of CARDINAL DATE to the effect that it awarded the applicants a total of ALL CARDINAL in compensation in respect of a plot of land measuring QUANTITY . The deadline for the termination of the expropriation procedure was set for DATE . No appeal was lodged against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG addressed a letter to ORG , stating that ORG had approved a fund of ALL CARDINAL and ALL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in total ) for the implementation of the Council of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . No payment has been made to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL residents , including all the applicants , lodged a claim with ORG against the ORG of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , challenging the value of the compensation awarded and the calculation of the exact surface area of the property which had been expropriated , on the basis that the decision had been issued as a result of an expropriation procedure in flagrant breach of the law . They also requested that ORG be ordered to change the amount of compensation ( to CARDINAL per square CARDINAL ) and compensate each owner based upon the exact size of their property , corresponding to an amount of fair compensation in accordance with the law and calculated by an expert appointed by the court , also taking into consideration the possibility of development of the property . In their claim the applicants maintained that the expropriation had been unlawful and that a \u201c de facto expropriation \u201d ( shpron\u00ebsim de facto ) had taken place . They also maintained that the actions of CARDINAL DATE of the ORG and ORG had been abusive and had been taken without any administrative decision to justify their illegal actions with the aim of demolishing a lawful property . They further submitted that , even though the authorities had issued an interim order and the ORG had also acknowledged the illegality of the authorities\u2019 actions and had recommended that similar actions in the future should not be repeated without awaiting a decision of ORG , they had nevertheless adopted the ORG of ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicants\u2019 claim . It reasoned that the expropriation had been unlawful in that the ORG of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE had been adopted in gross procedural violations and breaches of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) and various by - laws .", "CARDINAL . As regards the facts of the case , ORG mentioned that the actions taken on DATE consisting of the cordoning off of the building with a view to its demolition had been arbitrary and taken in breach of domestic law , as it had held in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It also reiterated the fact that the Ombudsman had recommended that necessary measures be taken so that similar arbitrary actions would not be repeated in the future . It nevertheless noted that the authorities had adopted the Council of ORG decision of DATE without awaiting the decision on the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . As regards the legal arguments as to whether the interference had been lawful , ORG reasoned that the authorities had not complied with the whole expropriation procedure as set out in DATE CARDINAL of LAW . The competent ministry had not informed the owners of the property or the construction company of the expropriation , therefore they and CARDINAL parties had been deprived of the opportunity to challenge it . According to their claims submitted before the district court , the applicants had only learned of the expropriation decision through the media , while the building was being demolished . Even afterwards , the applicants had never been informed , despite it being a legal requirement . This would have given them reasonable time to leave the building and take their belongings to other places . The authorities had continued with the demolition of the property without having all the information as to who the residents were . From the documents in the case file it was evident that the relevant ministry had only asked GPE for information about the residents of ORG DATE after the building had been demolished and CARDINAL days after the decision on the expropriation had been issued . It further held that the expropriation had been disguised as a formal expropriation taken in compliance with the legal provisions in force , but that in reality the seriousness of the violations had been such as to make it a \u201c de facto expropriation \u201d ( shpron\u00ebsim de facto ) . The ORG of ORG decision to expropriate the property had been a formal act , the sole purpose of which had been to disguise the actual nature of the expropriation . Furthermore , as a result of the immediate demolition of the building , without the authorities respecting the deadlines set in the law , the applicants had been prevented from being returned to their previous situation , even though the ORG of ORG decision had been null and void . ORG reasoned that the non - compliance with domestic law concerning the expropriation procedure had aggravated the applicants\u2019 situation and , therefore , the violation of the property rights had been so serious that it was unacceptable in a ORG governed by the rule of law . It reasoned that , according to the ORG \u2019s case - law ( reference was made to PERSON v. GPE judgment ( just satisfaction ) [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ) , in cases of unlawful expropriation the domestic courts had a strict obligation to award higher compensation than in cases of lawful expropriation . Moreover , as regards the existence of any legitimate aim in the public interest , ORG noted that there had been no infrastructure or ecological ( environmental ) regulatory plan approved by law , not even a plan for the development of the protected area . ORG noted that the decisions of the ORG of DATE and DATE had not provided for the demolition of any legal building or its expropriation , or the invalidity of any authorisation that had already been granted and of any construction already built . On the basis of the above considerations , ORG decided to amend the ORG of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE concerning the exact total surface area of the expropriated property , as well as the total amount of compensation and the amounts to be paid to each applicant . More concretely , ORG increased the total compensation to be awarded to the applicants to ALL CARDINAL , on the basis of a court - ordered experts\u2019 report . ORG found that the authorities had blatantly violated the procedure set out in the LAW and domestic law concerning the determination of the compensation to be paid in expropriation cases . Therefore , the calculation by ORG in its decision of CARDINAL DATE had not been made in accordance with the law . It accepted the report on the grounds that the valuation of the property had been based on the open market value following contemporary valuation methods for immovable properties such as the direct comparison and the state of the development of the property and taking also into consideration the location of the property , the development of the property , its actual development on the basis of legal documents as well as analysing the values of sales and rents of similar properties . The experts had also tried to analyse increases or decreases in the market prices of sales or purchases of similar properties . Under the expert report , the price per square metre was ORG CARDINAL ( ALL CARDINAL ) in respect of the flats and LAW ( ALL CARDINAL ) in respect of the business LOC . The price was calculated using the average market value during DATE based on a ORG of ORG decision \u201c on the valuation methods for immovable properties in GPE \u201d which stated that such calculations are made in accordance with international valuation standards .", "CARDINAL . ORG also recalculated the surface area of the expropriated property , stating that it actually measured QUANTITY . Furthermore , it included all the owners of ORG in the list of parties to be compensated , as some of the applicants had been excluded from the list under the ORG of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . Lastly , the court ruled that the compensation was to be paid by ORG and GPE in CARDINAL tranches over DATE from the moment the court \u2019s decision became final . Both ORG and GPE were obliged to pay jointly the judicial costs and expenses including the PERSON fee , the court fees for lodging the claim ( ALL CARDINAL ) and the ORG fee for the representation of PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON ( applicants in the proceedings before ORG ) , ORG and PERSON ( not applicants before ORG ) , which amounted to LAW ( ALL CARDINAL ) in total .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter the applicants lodged an appeal against the part of ORG decision of DATE concerning the amount of compensation and the manner in which it was to be paid . They argued that the expert report did not reflect the market value of the property , which was much higher than the value indicated , and that the valuation standards for expropriated properties had not been complied with . More concretely , the experts had not complied with the criteria and standards provided for by ORG ( NORP ) and the valuation standards based on the financial and legal interests of the applicants . The property had had a higher value at the time of its expropriation . The experts had not specified the value of the specific components of the relevant calculation formula or the market value for every flat in order to reflect the market value of the building . Nor had they taken into consideration all the official data in the purchase agreements for the flats . They also complained of factual and calculation errors in the expert report and requested that another be produced . An appeal was also lodged by the Attorney ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld in part the ORG decision of DATE . It reiterated the facts of the case as noted by ORG and upheld the amount of compensation awarded , the size of the construction land and the list of owners concerned . It decided that the applicants should be compensated individually based on the size of their property . The total amount of compensation ( ALL CARDINAL ) was to be divided as follows : ALL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) per square metre in respect of the flats , which measured QUANTITY in total , and ALL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) per square QUANTITY in respect of the business LOC , which measured QUANTITY in total . It decided that the value calculated in the expert report represented the real value and just compensation in accordance with the LAW , LAW , LAW and other by - laws . It ruled that the compensation was to be paid by ORG in CARDINAL lump sum . ORG was also obliged to pay the legal costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicants and the Attorney ORG lodged an appeal with ORG against the lower courts\u2019 judgments . The applicants requested a higher amount of compensation for their expropriated property . ORG , however , requested that the execution of the decision be stayed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on the basis of LAW ORG allowed the request of ORG and the proceedings were stayed . The decision contained no reasoning . The case is still pending before ORG . There is no information in the case file on what grounds ORG appealed against the lower courts\u2019 decisions and requested a stay of execution .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the ORG \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that on DATE the ORG lodged a criminal complaint with ORG against the head of ORG , alleging irregularities in the proceedings leading to the granting of the building permit on DATE . The case was sent to GPE for trial . There is no information about the outcome of those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and another resident lodged CARDINAL separate criminal complaints with ORG , alleging abuse of power on the part of officials of the ORG and the police officers of ORG involved in the seizure of ORG on DATE . They complained that they had not been allowed to enter their homes , that ORG had cordoned off the building with police crime scene tape and that inspectors of the ORG had entered the building . They also asked the authorities to take measures to end the arbitrary interference with their property rights , which was still continuing DATE that they lodged the criminal complaint .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG decided not to initiate criminal proceedings , on the grounds that the actions did not constitute a criminal offence ( fakti i kall\u00ebzuar nuk parashikohet nga ligji si vep\u00ebr penale ) . It reasoned that the ORG \u2019s employees under domestic law had been entitled to carry out the inspection and verify the regularity of the documents concerning the approval of the building permit and the implementation of its technical standards by the construction company . They had accordingly been entitled to enter the premises of ORG . Furthermore , the officers of ORG had been entitled to cooperate with and support the ORG . After the authorities had carried out the inspection criminal proceedings had been instituted , therefore the suspicion of non - compliance with the rules and urban planning conditions had been realistic . ORG further reasoned that CARDINAL of the complainants had said that when he had returned to the building DATE he had seen officers of ORG inside and had been allowed to enter his flat freely after showing them his certificate of ownership . That statement had also been corroborated with the information given by the ORG and the LOC police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following a request lodged by ORG ( Task - Forca p\u00ebr ORG \u2013 a body under the authority of the Minister of ORG ) , instituted a criminal investigation against CARDINAL public officials ( some of them employees of the LOC , others employees of GPE ) for possible abuse of power because of the irregularity of the proceedings concerning the restitution of the applicants\u2019 property and the subsequent proceedings concerning the issuance of the building permit . On DATE ORG terminated the proceedings in respect of CARDINAL of the public officials and the remaining CARDINAL were acquitted .
