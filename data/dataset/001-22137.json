He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agents , Mrs H. Voelskow - Thies , PERSON , of ORG , at the initial stage of the proceedings , and subsequently by PERSON PERSON , ORG , also of ORG .", "Further applications concerning his right of access to his son and related matters are pending before ORG ( No . CARDINAL and No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the father of the child PERSON , born out of wedlock in GPE on DATE . The applicant had been living with PERSON , the child \u2019s mother , since DATE . They agreed that the child should bear his mother \u2019s surname , i.e. B. After their separation in DATE , the applicant continued to pay maintenance and he had regular contacts with the child until DATE .", "In DATE Ms S. B. married PERSON , who was the father of her daughter , born out of wedlock in DATE and bearing the surname PERSON They chose the husband \u2019s surname name as their family name and she availed herself of the right to put her surname in front of that .", "In DATE the applicant asked ORG of the GPE Municipality whether PERSON had applied for a change of PERSON \u2019s surname . By letter of DATE he was informed that she had inquired into this possibility , however , no request had been filed yet . In his letter , the competent administrator , acting for ORG as guardian , added that , should such a request be lodged , he would agree as the stepfather had already been living together with Ms. PERSON and the child for DATE and the child fully accepted him .", "On DATE Ms B .- K. and PERSON had statements recorded at ORG according to which they gave their family name to PERSON . They also filed a document issued by ORG on DATE according to which , on behalf of the child , it agreed to the change of surname . ORG informed ORG accordingly and the registrar at ORG thereupon added the change of the child \u2019s surname to the record of his birth .", "Following correspondence with ORG , the applicant filed an action with ORG against ORG , complaining that ORG had failed to hear him on the question of the envisaged change of his son \u2019s surname .", "On DATE ORG ruled that it was incompetent to entertain the applicant \u2019s action and transferred the case to ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for rectification of the record of his son \u2019s birth as far as the entry of the change of surname was concerned . The court found that this entry was correct as the child \u2019s surname had been changed in accordance with section DATE of LAW and the relevant procedural rules . The ORG further considered that section DATE of LAW did not amount to discrimination and was not in breach of LAW . The ORG observed that the legislator was called upon the ensure that children born out of wedlock had the same opportunities for their physical and spiritual development and their place in society as were enjoyed by children born in wedlock . The legislator had meanwhile enacted legislation to this effect . Even assuming that further measures were necessary , on the whole , section DATE of LAW did not affect the equality between children born out of wedlock and children born in wedlock . Rather , in providing for the possibility of having the same surname , section DATE secured that the child \u2019s status as a child born out of wedlock was not disclosed to the public .", "Moreover , as far as procedural matters were concerned , the proceedings for a change of surname in which the natural father did not participate could not be objected to from a constitutional point of view . In particular there was no breach of the applicant \u2019s rights as a natural parent as his child had never borne the father \u2019s surname . The change of surname served the interests of the child . In any event , a mere right of the natural father to be heard in the proceedings , as argued by the applicant , without a possibility to prevent the change of surname would not be effective because the mother and the step - father would eventually decide .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG endorsed the reasoning of ORG and stated in particular that there were no indications that the legal provisions applied in the present case were unconstitutional . The ORG further confirmed that the change of surname served the interest of the child \u2019s well - being which prevailed over the interests of the natural father .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further appeal . Referring to case - law of ORG , it considered that section DATE of ORG could not be objected to from a constitutional point of view . The applicant could not derive from his rights as a natural father a right to be heard in the proceedings for the change of his child \u2019s surname , because his rights conflicted with the rights of the mother and in particular of the child whom this provision intended to protect . The child \u2019s interests are safeguarded in that ORG participates in the proceedings . If the child \u2019s mother , her husband and the guardian agree upon the change of the child \u2019s surname , this change is generally in the interest of the child \u2019s well - being .", "In DATE , following problems in having access to his son , the applicant applied to ORG for a decision granting him a right of access to Sinja Johannes . In DATE ORG granted him provisionally access . Subsequently , the child \u2019s mother no longer fully complied with the decision and prohibited visits as from DATE .", "On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings with ORG against PERSON claiming a sum amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) as compensation for damages suffered by him , namely costs for travelling , due to her refusal of access to his son on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG , following an oral hearing on DATE , dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . The court found that there was no legal basis to claim compensation for an alleged refusal of access to his son . In this respect , the court noted that , pursuant to section DATE of LAW , the person having custody and care of a child born out of wedlock determines contact arrangements with the father , and that the father can only claim personal contacts if they are in the child \u2019s interests . The court also observed that its decision of DATE on provisional visiting arrangements was formulated as granting the child a right to visit the applicant , not as a right of access awarded to the applicant .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaints against the decisions taken in the above proceedings concerning the change of his son \u2019s surname and the refusal of his compensation claim , respectively . ORG found that the conditions for admitting these complaints for a decision on their merits were not met .", "ORG considered in particular that the applicant \u2019s complaint about the change of his son \u2019s surname did not raise any questions of fundamental importance . Referring to its decision of DATE , ORG recalled that fathers of children born out of wedlock enjoyed the right to the care and upbringing of the children under LAW ) even if they were not living with the child \u2019s mother and were not educating the child together with her . However , the legislator was called upon to enact rules in case of conflict between the parents . In the present case , there was no indication that the courts , in interpreting and applying section DATE of LAW , had disregarded the applicant \u2019s right as a parent .", "As regards ORG decision of DATE , ORG considered that there were no indications that the applicant \u2019s constitutional right as a parent to have access to his child had to be safeguarded by means of an action in tort .", "The decision was served on CARDINAL DATE .", "The statutory provisions on family matters are to be found in the NORP Civil Code .

The child had agree to the change of surname , and , in case that the father declared that the child should bear his surname , the mother also had to agree . A minor child was represented in these matters by the competent ORG acting as guardian pursuant to sections DATE , DATE of LAW .", "As regards children born in wedlock , section CARDINAL of the Civil Code provided that they were given their GPE common family name or , if they have not chosen a family name , the mother \u2019s or the father \u2019s surname , as chosen by them .

According to section DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL , a change of the surname of CARDINAL of the parents on account of marriage did not affect the child \u2019s surname .", "A change of surnames of children born in wedlock following divorce and remarriage of the parent having the right to custody was governed by the general rules on the change of surnames under LAW ( Namens\u00e4nderungsgesetz ) . According to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , a surname may only be changed if there is an important reason to justify such a change .
