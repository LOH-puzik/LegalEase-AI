SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently in GPE .", "The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and applied for asylum and a residence permit . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) he stated that he was of NORP ethnicity from GPE Rural . During the war in DATE his parents had been killed and he and his CARDINAL younger siblings had remained in their home town . Since DATE they had been threatened by NORP to leave their property as the NORP considered that the land belonged to them . On DATE a group of former NORP rebels , who now belonged to the army and police , had come to their home and threatened to burn it . They had separated the applicant from his younger siblings and they had taken him to a graveyard where they had beaten him until he lost consciousness . He had awoken later at a medical centre run by NORP sans GPE . CARDINAL of the doctors had helped to arrange travel documents and a passport for him and this doctor had then travelled with him to GPE where he had left him . He did not know what had happened to his siblings . The applicant further claimed that he had not reported the incident to the police as both his attackers and the police were of NORP ethnicity and thus would protect each other . Lastly , he stated that he suffered from hepatitis B and was in need of treatment .", "On DATE ORG rejected the request . It first stated that the general situation in GPE was not so serious that the applicant could be granted a residence permit on this sole ground . Turning to his individual claims , ORG noted that the applicant had not reported the incident to the authorities although it was a criminal act and not condoned by the ORG . Moreover , it observed that PERCENT of the cases before the PERSON courts concerned disputes over land , making them a priority issue , which was also reflected in the fact that the authorities cooperated with non - governmental organisations ( NGO ) to solve property conflicts . As the applicant had failed to report the incident to the police ( or to the alleged involved police PERSON superiors ) , the judicial system or NGOs , he had not exhausted domestic remedies available to him . In this respect , the ORG considered that there was no reason to believe that he would not have received help and support from the authorities or NGOs . The fact that he was NORP did not change its opinion on this point . Thus , the ORG found that the applicant had not shown that he would be at risk if returned and that he was not in need of protection in GPE . As concerned his illness , the ORG noted that he took no medication for his hepatitis B and that health care was available in GPE . Hence , he could not be granted leave to remain in GPE on this ground either .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining his claims and adding that he was now convinced that his younger siblings had been killed so they could not claim their right to the property . The same fate would await him , if he returned . He also stressed that the judicial system in GPE was corrupt and that , since he had no financial means , he would never win legal proceedings or get help .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It first considered that , although parts of the applicant \u2019s story , such as his travel to GPE , lacked credibility , in general his story about the incident in DATE appeared credible . However , like ORG , the court found that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him in GPE and that thereby he had not shown that he was in need of protection in GPE . It also considered that his illness was not so serious that he could be granted leave to remain in GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrations\u00f6ver - domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request for reconsideration of his case . He now claimed that he had worked as a bodyguard for PERSON , the president of PERSON ( ORG pour la ORG ) . This had also been the real reason for the attack in DATE by ORG as they had wanted to interrogate him and then kill him . The applicant further alleged that he had received confirmation that his siblings had been killed by \u201c PERSON \u201d upon order by PERSON , a general within ORG . He was now very afraid of being returned to GPE as he would be arrested , tortured and killed for political reasons . Since he had been depressed , he had not understood the importance of telling every detail to the migration authorities .", "On DATE ORG refused to reconsider the case . It noted that the applicant had invoked new circumstances for his asylum claim but found that he had given no valid grounds for why he had not invoked these reasons before . In this respect , it observed that he had been in GPE for DATE before mentioning these new reasons . In the ORG \u2019s view , it was an escalation of the applicant \u2019s story and not credible . Moreover , it considered that there were no impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , relying on the same grounds as before and adding that he had also been active for the organisations AC Genocide , la PERSON d\u2019Auto - defense and ORG ( Parti pour le ORG ) . As he had been very depressed he had not thought of mentioning this before . Moreover , he had only been in contact with persons in GPE during DATE and they had informed him of his \u201c personal situation \u201d there . He submitted a copy of what he claimed was his membership card for ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It noted that the applicant had invoked new grounds for his asylum claim but agreed with ORG that he had shown no valid excuse for not having invoked these circumstances from the beginning .", "On DATE the applicant lodged his application with the ORG and requested the ORG to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG in order to stop the enforcement of his deportation , scheduled for the following TIME . As the application was incomplete and arrived very late in the afternoon , the applicant was informed that the request had been submitted too late to ORG for it to be able to make a proper examination of his request .", "On DATE the applicant again contacted the ORG , informing it that his deportation planned for DATE had been postponed to a later , unknown date . Therefore , he renewed his request for interim measures and stated that he had been a fervent member of ORG . Since the PERSON government persecuted opposition parties and , in particular , PERSON , he had been forced to flee the country . In support , he submitted copies of what he alleged were :", "His ORG membership card .", "An arrest warrant ( ORG ) , no . CARDINAL , dated DATE and signed by General Major PERSON , Director of ORG ( ORG , ORG ) . It stated that the ORG ordered the arrest of the applicant for breach of national security ( PERSON \u00e0 la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale ) and requested all public authorities to help in apprehending him and taking him to the ORG or the police . The copy also contained some text in GPE .", "An article from \u201c ORG \u201d , no . CARDINAL of DATE , and written by PERSON . It stated that on DATE the family of GPE had been attacked by men wearing police uniforms . CARDINAL persons had been killed , CARDINAL were children who were burned alive . Their brother , ORG , had been found unconscious at a cemetery and later disappeared . It was suspected that members of ORG and the police were responsible for the deaths as they allegedly wanted to eliminate all witnesses to the acts of genocide committed by persons in power within the governing party , the CNDD - FDD . As this family had lost members during the \u201c crisis \u201d , they had been ready to testify before the international criminal court .", "On DATE the President of the former Third Section refused the applicant \u2019s request for interim measures . Subsequently , the applicant informed the ORG that he wished to maintain his application .", "The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced , on DATE , the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) .

If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so .
