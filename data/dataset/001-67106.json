FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ Mr PERSON ] is a NORP national and was born in DATE . He is currently in prison . He was represented before the ORG by Mr L. Hintermann , a lawyer practising in LOC - les - PERSON ( GPE ) .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty of aggravated rape . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and suspended his civic , civil and family rights for DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant in a judgment in which it held :", "\u201c No ground of appeal has been made out in support of the appeal , the procedure was correctly followed and the sentence lawfully imposed for what both the court and the jury had found were repeated acts . \u201d", "The applicant maintained that it was the negligence of the lawyer representing him that was to blame for the failure to lodge grounds of appeal with ORG .", "Relying on LAW , the applicant complained that the criminal proceedings instituted against him had been unfair . He complained in particular of the investigating judge 's refusal to order a second expert - witness report and to hear certain defence witnesses and of being hindered in the preparation of his defence by the fact that during the investigation the authorities claimed MONEY ( ORG ) per page from him for a copy of his case file .", "Relying on LAW No . CARDINAL , he complained also that he did not have a right of appeal on the facts since the only remedy against judgments of ORG was by way of an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant complained that the criminal proceedings instituted against him had been unfair . He complained in particular of the investigating judge 's refusal to order a second expert - witness report and to hear certain defence witnesses and of being hindered in the preparation of his defence by the fact that during the investigation the authorities claimed ORG CARDINAL per page from him for a copy of his case file . He relied on LAW , which provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him , everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal ...", "...", "CARDINAL . Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights :", "...", "( b ) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence ;", "...", "( d ) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him ;", "... \u201d", "The ORG notes that neither the case file nor the applicant 's submissions indicate that he appealed to ORG against the committal order on the ground that the investigation was unfair . The ORG further notes the ground on which ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the judgment of ORG and reiterates that it is all the more difficult for the applicant to pray in aid the negligence of the lawyer who represented him before the domestic courts as he does not allege and there is nothing in the file to suggest that his counsel was appointed under the legal - aid scheme ( see GPE v. GPE , application no . CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , unreported ) . The ORG therefore finds that the applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies as he is required to do by LAW .", "In addition , the ORG notes that the applicant does not assert that ultimately he did not receive satisfactory communication of the evidence in the file before the trial at ORG ; nor does the transcript of the trial indicate that ORG dismissed any application by the applicant to call witnesses .", "Consequently , this part of the application must be dismissed pursuant to LAW , DATE and DATE of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also complained that he did not have a right of appeal on the facts since the only remedy against judgments of ORG was by way of an appeal on points of law . He relied on LAW no . CARDINAL , which reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone convicted of a criminal offence by a tribunal shall have the right to have his conviction or sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal . The exercise of this right , including the grounds on which it may be exercised , shall be governed by law .", "CARDINAL . NORP This right may be subject to exceptions in regard to offences of a minor character , as prescribed by law , or in cases in which the person concerned was tried in the first instance by the highest tribunal or was convicted following an appeal against acquittal . \u201d", "The ORG notes that the applicant was found guilty of offences of aggravated rape and sentenced to DATE imprisonment by ORG in a judgment of DATE . It notes that he was unable to appeal against the \u201c merits \u201d of that judgment , since the only remedy available under NORP law against judgments of ORG is an appeal to ORG , which may only re - examine the case on issues of law .", "The ORG reiterates , however , that under the wording of LAW No . CARDINAL the Contracting States retain the power to decide how the right to re - examine shall be exercised and may limit its extent . In a number of GPE , re - examination is thus restricted to questions of law ( see PERSON and PERSON v. GPE DATE . ) , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , PERSON ) . That was also the position taken by ORG ( see PERSON v. GPE , application no . CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , ORG and Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ; GPE v. GPE , application no . ORG decision of DATE , unreported ; ORG v. GPE , GPE and GPE , application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of CARDINAL DATE , unreported ; and GPE v. GPE , application no . ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , unreported ) .", "The ORG accordingly holds that the fact that the applicant was able to appeal on points of law against the judgment of DATE satisfied the requirements of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "Consequently , this part of the application is manifestly ill - founded and must be dismissed pursuant to LAW .", "For these reasons , the ORG unanimously", "Declares the application inadmissible ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
