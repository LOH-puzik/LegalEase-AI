On DATE the applicant was also arrested by the ORG officers , on suspicion of being associated with that group .", "CARDINAL . A search of his place of residence , carried out on DATE , did not reveal any incriminating evidence .

He argued that , in circumstances where the discovery of the hand grenade in his wife \u2019s flat was essentially the only incriminating evidence against him , the trial court had failed to take into account the unlawful manner in which the search had been conducted and to properly assess the admissibility and reliability of the evidence obtained as a result of the search . He also noted that the first - instance court had applied the most severe sentence provided for in LAW and had not taken into account his personal circumstances when imposing the sentence , such as , inter alia , the fact that he had to provide and care for his aged and ailing mother .", "CARDINAL .
