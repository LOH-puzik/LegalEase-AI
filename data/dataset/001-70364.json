The applicant was subsequently required to attend for interview with a financial investigator appointed under LAW ) Order DATE . He did so on DATE and answered all questions put to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was charged by the police with false accounting and conspiracy to defraud .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a further notice was served on the applicant under the DATE Order , requiring his attendance before financial investigators at a police station on DATE .

The notice , which was dated DATE , stated that the investigation was into whether any person had benefited from theft or false accounting , contributing to the resources of a proscribed organisation or from contraventions of betting regulations . The applicant was required to attend at FAC on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , the applicant 's solicitors sent a letter seeking a written guarantee that no information or statements obtained during the interview would be used in criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a further notice , dated DATE , was served on the applicant , again requiring him to attend the interview on DATE . The notice was served with a letter in which the investigators confirmed that they were aware of the criminal proceedings pending against the applicant . They set out the safeguards in paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL to the Order , and stated that the applicant therefore had the guarantees he sought . They added that paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL restricted the disclosure of information obtained by a financial investigator , and added that \u201c this does not prevent the answers or information being used to further the investigation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant 's solicitor sent a letter to the financial investigators indicating that the applicant 's replies could become admissible evidence at a trial and suggesting that the purpose of the interview was to compel him to disclose his defence . He added that the applicant had been advised not to attend an interview unless a satisfactory response to the letter was received .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant 's solicitor was informed by letter that the reason for the interview was not to force the applicant to disclose his defence but that a number of matters from the earlier interview required clarification and additional matters had also arisen .", "CARDINAL . On a request by the investigators , on DATE the applicant 's representatives informed the investigators that the applicant would not attend the interview . The interview did not take place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a summons charged the applicant with the offence of failing without reasonable excuse to comply with the financial investigator 's requirement to answer questions or otherwise furnish information , contrary to paragraph CARDINAL ) of Schedule DATE Order . On DATE , the applicant was convicted of this offence in the Magistrates ' Court and fined the sum of GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG allowed the applicant 's appeal against conviction , finding that the prosecution had not proved the absence of a reasonable excuse . The judge noted that ORG had dealt with a similar case ( PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] NI CARDINAL ) which related to the same legislation and the same investigation . ORG had held that as ORG had put in place certain express limitations on the use of information obtained by investigators , it could not have intended that the person concerned could put forward the risk of self - incrimination as a \u201c reasonable excuse \u201d . In PERSON v. PERSON , however , the accused had refused to answer questions at an interview , and he had not been interviewed by the police , or charged with any offence .", "CARDINAL . The judge further noted that CARDINAL of the grounds on which the information obtained by investigators could be used in criminal proceedings was where evidence inconsistent with the information was relied on by the defence . That ground had been amended in the light of the ORG 's judgment in the case of ORG v. the GPE , and the amendment would have afforded the applicant the protection he sought had it been in place at the time . The judge took the view that once he had been questioned by the police and charged , the applicant had a right not to answer questions that would have tended to incriminate him . The only outstanding matter was whether the applicant should have attended the interview and then refused to answer questions , or , as he did , refuse to attend the interview once he failed to receive the assurances he had asked for . The judge regarded the distinction as technical , and found that the prosecution had failed to establish the absence of a \u201c reasonable excuse \u201d for not answering questions about the proceeds of a crime , with which he had been formally charged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the prosecutor requested ORG to state a case for the purpose of an appeal to ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG in GPE heard the appeal . On DATE , Lord Justice PERSON , giving judgment , considered , in the light of NORP v. ORG , ex parte ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) , that LAW is directed towards the fairness of the trial itself and is not concerned with extra - judicial inquiries \u201c with the consequence that a person to whom those inquiries are directed does not have a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to comply with a financial investigator 's requirements merely because the information sought may be potentially incriminating \u201d . The appeal was upheld , and the applicant 's conviction confirmed .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings for false accounting and conspiracy to defraud ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) were struck out on grounds of delay by ORG in DATE . The magistrate was asked by the office of ORG to state a case for ORG , but he died before having prepared the stated case .", "CARDINAL . The Proceeds of Crime ( Northern Ireland ) Order DATE inter alia provides for investigatory measures and powers in respect of the tracing and confiscation of proceeds of criminal conduct .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL , it was an offence for a person to fail , without reasonable excuse , to attend to answer questions by a ORG appointed under the Order . Paragraph CARDINAL restricted the use that could be made of the statements made to CARDINAL situations :", "( a ) on a prosecution for an offence under the Perjury ( GPE ) DATE ;", "( b ) on a prosecution for some other offence where evidence inconsistent with any such answers or information is relied on by the defence , or", "( c ) on a prosecution for failing to comply with a requirement of the DATE Order , such as attending to answer questions", "On DATE , paragraph CARDINAL ) was limited by ORG and Criminal Evidence Act DATE to permit use of the statements only if they are adduced , or if they are the subject of questions at trial , by the defence .", "CARDINAL .
