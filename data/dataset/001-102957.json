On DATE ORG refused to reopen the applicant 's case as it found that the most recent general background information would not lead to a revised assessment of the case . More specifically in its letter to the applicant 's representative it stated as follows :", "... In its decision of DATE , ORG found ... ORG still finds that your client 's fear of being forcibly recruited by the ORG or of being subjected to outrages by the ORG as a result of having fled from the ORG does not warrant a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW . In this connection , ORG emphasises that your client 's statements about his alleged connection with the ORG were extended during the asylum proceedings and were diverging in essential areas . In this connection , ORG also refers to the fact that the Sri NORP military forces defeated the NORP in DATE . Moreover , ORG refers to the background information available to ORG from which it appears that it is hardly likely that former low - ranking members of the ORG or persons who have previously supported the ORG will risk reprisals from the NORP , see GPE ORG , Operational Guidance Note , GPE , DATE . Regardless of whether your client 's information about his previous activities for the ORG is considered a fact , ORG stills find that your client would not risk persecution or being subjected to outrages as covered by section CARDINAL of LAW by the Sri NORP authorities if returned to GPE , including in connection with his arrival at GPE airport . ORG emphasizes that from his detention in DATE , where his photo was taken , and until his departure in DATE your client has not been detained or had his picture or fingerprint taken or in any other way been the object of interest from LOC authorities . The authorities have thus not carried out any acts aimed at your client that indicated that he was suspected of being a member of the NORP . In this connection , ORG also refers to the fact that your client departed lawfully from GPE with his own GPE national passport for the purpose of family reunification with his spouse . Similarly , ORG refers to the background material available to ORG , according to which persons who have previously supported the ORG on a lower level are generally not of interest to the authorities , see GPE ORG , Operational Guidance Note , GPE , DATE , and see GPE ORG to GPE , GPE DATE . Against that background ORG also finds that the fact that one or more of your client 's siblings have been members of or active for the ORG can not warrant a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW , according to the background information now available . The fact that as an ethnic GPE from northern GPE your client may risk being questioned and investigated by the authorities on entry into the country can not lead to a revised assessment of the case under asylum law . In this assessment , consideration has been given to the background information available to ORG , according to which the individuals at particular risk of being detained and investigated upon entry in GPE are young NORP , men in particular , from northern and eastern GPE , those without identification or residence in GPE , and those recently returned from the LOC , see GPE ORG to GPE , GPE CARDINAL DATE . In this connection the ORG refers to its finding that it has not been rendered probable that your client would be an object of particular interest to the GPE authorities . As in its decision of DATE , ORG still finds that the general situation in GPE is not of such nature as to warrant in itself the grant of a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW . The ORG observes in that connection that it is a condition for a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW that , upon a specific , individual assessment , an alien is deemed at risk of persecution or outrages . The authority of ORG is restricted to deciding asylum - relevant issues , and it is thus outside the ORG 's authority to determine whether an alien who does not meet the conditions of section CARDINAL of LAW may be issued with a residence permit for other reasons of a more humanitarian nature . Against that background and in accordance with the ORG 's decision of DATE , ORG still finds that it has not been rendered probable that , in case of return to GPE , your client would be at concrete and individual risk of persecution as covered by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , or that your client would be at a real risk of outrages as covered by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . It should be noted that your client 's time - limit for departure is still suspended until further notice on the basis of the request of DATE from ORG . If the basis for your client 's lawful stay in GPE lapses , your client must leave the country immediately , see section CARDINAL of LAW . As appears from the decision of ORG of DATE , your client may be forcibly returned to GPE if he does not leave voluntarily , see section GPE , cf . section CARDINAL , of LAW .", "CARDINAL .

Although the government has gradually reduced the military presence in the camps and has pledged to start the progressive return to their villages of origin of the majority of those in the camps , it is clear that this may take a considerable amount of time .
