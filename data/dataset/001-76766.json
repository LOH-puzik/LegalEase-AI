THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 14+P1-1", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under current GPE law , the state pension age is DATE for men and CARDINAL for women . Until these ages , men and women who work are required to pay national insurance contributions ( \u201c NICs \u201d ) if their earnings are above a threshold amount , currently QUANTITY ( GBP ) per month .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is over DATE and works as an administrator . Since he has not reached the state pension age for men of DATE , he is required to pay NICs on his earnings . At the time of introduction of the application , his DATE salary was GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL and he paid PERCENT of his earnings ( between the primary threshold of GBP CARDINAL and the upper earnings limit of GBP CARDINAL ) in NICs ( Class CARDINAL ) , amounting to GBP CARDINAL per month and GBP CARDINAL per annum . From DATE , NICs increased to PERCENT of the amount up to the upper earnings limit , plus PERCENT on all earnings above the limit . The applicant \u2019s NICs increased to GBP CARDINAL per month .", "CARDINAL . The applicant will be required to pay national insurance contributions from his earnings until he reaches DATE .", "CARDINAL . A woman of DATE or more who continued to work would not be required to pay any NICs on her earnings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant wrote to his Member of ORG and the Paymaster General complaining about the difference in treatment for men and women . Both replied stating that since liability to pay national insurance contributions is linked to the state pension age , the treatment of men and women would equalise in DATE when the state pension age will equalise .", "CARDINAL . The National Insurance Act DATE , which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in GPE , set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population , whether employed or self - employed , are liable to pay compulsory NICs contributions . This legislation has since been replaced , most recently , by the consolidating provisions of ORG DATE ( \u201c SSCBA DATE \u201d ) and ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the SSCBA DATE sets out the various classes of ORG . Of these , the largest category is Class CARDINAL contributions which consist of earnings - related contributions paid by employers and employees . Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee \u2019s earnings band . The ORG scheme is financed on a \u201c pay as you go \u201d basis , that is , current NICs fund current benefits : thus an individual \u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others ( NORP ( PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ORG paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A substantial contribution has been made to ORG from NICs for DATE . Following the National Insurance Act CARDINAL , which imposed an additional deduction of PERCENT of earnings above the upper earnings limits , the element of calculation of the ORG allocation was also increased from PERCENT of earnings paid in DATE to PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that only those under the state pension age are liable to pay NICs from their earnings . The state pension ages are currently set as CARDINAL for men and CARDINAL for women according to section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Pensions Act DATE provides for the equalisation of state pension ages for men and women to DATE . The state pension age for women will increase gradually from DATE and the equalisation will be complete in DATE . At the same time , the age until which women are liable to pay NICs will gradually increase in line with the increase in the state pension age .", "CARDINAL . Council Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security . However , in LAW provides for derogation in the matter of \u201c the determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old - age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences therefore for other benefits \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In LOC The Queen v. Secretary of ORG , ex parte ORG [ DATE ] ECRCARDINAL - CARDINAL ( \u201c the ORG case \u201d concerning reference for a preliminary ruling from ORG ) , ORG found that :", "Article CARDINAL had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old - age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference ;", "Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where , having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears , it can not be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age ;", "In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems , in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods , and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from DATE to the next in respect of those periods , the ORG legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by the member ORG and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by LAW were to be interpreted restrictively .
