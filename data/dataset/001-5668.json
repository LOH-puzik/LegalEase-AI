Also , the applicant had suffered from peritonitis . Moreover , he had received a blow on the head with a resulting concussion and also had several bruises on his face and chest .

At TIME he had insisted to be served tea although he had been told that the bar had closed . Irritated by the invitations to leave the bar he had thrown a serving tray on the ground . When PERSON , the security guard , had then tried to lead him out of the bar , the applicant had seized a chair and had tried to hit PERSON There had followed a fight between the CARDINAL . A glass table had been broken . PERSON had finally managed to tie the hands of the applicant . PERSON had in the meantime called a friend , a taxi driver , to come and help . Upon his arrival the taxi driver had called the police . The police had arrived and had called for an ambulance which had taken the applicant .", "The taxi driver , who was also questioned , stated that upon his arrival at the bar he had seen the applicant lying on the ground and had called the police .", "PERSON pleaded guilty but emphasised that he had acted in self defence . He confirmed the sequence of events as described by the bar tender and the waitress . PERSON testified that during the fight he had kicked the applicant in the stomach and that he had then hit him again in the stomach with his knee .", "CARDINAL police officers , who had been dispatched to the scene , and the officer on duty at the police station reported in writing that at TIME a call from the bar had been received , alerting the police about the incident . Upon their arrival , officers PERSON , B. and A. , who had been patrolling the area , had found the applicant lying on the ground , his hands tied with a shirt , visibly seriously injured and drunk . They had then called for an ambulance which had arrived at TIME and had taken the applicant to the emergency unit of the local hospital . Officers T. , B. and A. had remained at the scene and had taken the written statements of CARDINAL witnesses . The applicant had stayed at the hospital until TIME At that time a police officer had visited the hospital and , having been told by Doctor PERSON , who had examined the applicant , that he had not been in need of hospitalisation , had brought him to the police station for questioning .", "In his testimony the applicant stated that at TIME , while drinking cognac in the bar , he had suddenly lost consciousness . He could not remember whether he had been hit . He had regained consciousness in TIME , in a cell at the police station . A police officer had told him that he had been seen by a doctor during TIME and had then brought him to another officer . The latter had considered that the applicant had not been fit for questioning and had called a taxi for him . A summons for questioning on the following DATE had been given to the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant was examined by a forensic doctor . He found a cut on the applicant \u2019s head , which had been surgically treated and bruises of purple - bluish colour around the left eyebrow , the eyelids , the nose and the chin . There was also a superficial cut of the skin of the cheek CARDINAL cm long and a CARDINAL PERSON long cut on the upper lip . The rim of a tooth had been broken . Several small cuts were found on the palm and a finger of the applicant \u2019s left hand . Bruises were also found on the chest and the left side of the waist . The forensic expert concluded that the injuries must have been caused on CARDINAL DATE , as stated by the applicant . Another medical opinion , ordered in the course of the investigation , found , inter alia , that there was no indication of a complete loss of consciousness having occurred as a result of the injuries .", "On DATE the preliminary investigation was completed . The investigator proposed to the competent prosecutor to indict PERSON", "On DATE ORG ordered the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against Mr. PERSON", "Based on the evidence collected in the course of the investigation it was established inter alia that the applicant had been heavily drunk and had attacked Mr. PERSON when he had attempted to lead him out of the bar ; that Mr. PERSON had reacted by kicking the applicant in the abdominal area and that a fight had followed . At some point a taxi driver had called the police who had then called an ambulance .", "The prosecutor concluded from these findings that PERSON , albeit having acted in self- defence , had administered blows which had not been strictly necessary to counter the attack . PERSON had thus caused bodily harm of medium level gravity , temporarily endangering the applicant \u2019s life . Since under the relevant law bodily harm caused in such circumstances was a crime punishable by way of private prosecution , it was unnecessary to continue the public prosecution in the case .", "It appears that at least until DATE the applicant had not mentioned any suspicion on his part that he might have been beaten by the police .", "On DATE he wrote to ORG ( \u041e\u043a\u0440\u044a\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0392\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 ) requesting an investigation against the police . On DATE he appealed to ORG ( PERSON ORG ) against the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against PERSON In these submissions he stated , inter alia , that he had decided to verify himself certain facts about the events in TIME CARDINAL DATE and that he had sought information from ORG and from the local ambulance service . The applicant enclosed medical certificates reflecting entries in the registers of ORG and of the ambulance service .", "The register of the ambulance service recorded that a sergeant PERSON from the police had called on DATE at CARDINAL and had asked for an ambulance to be dispatched to the bar where the fight had taken place that TIME . According to the certificate the ambulance had arrived at CARDINAL at the bar . The applicant had been examined on the spot by Doctor PERSON from the ambulance service . Doctor PERSON had noted that the applicant had received a blow on the head with a resulting concussion and also that there had been an appearance of food poisoning . The certificate further recorded that the applicant had been brought by the ambulance to the urgent surgery unit at ORG , to Doctor PERSON The ambulance had then returned to the LOC of the ambulance service , at TIME", "The records of the urgent surgery unit of ORG revealed that the applicant had been brought there and had been examined by Doctor PERSON The certificate stated that the applicant had been injured in the head which had necessitated stitching up , performed by Doctor PERSON There had been no indication of an acute abdominal condition . The applicant \u2019s arrival had been recorded as having happened at TIME on DATE . The preceding record in the register was for the examination of PERSON TIME The entry which followed the registration of the applicant \u2019s arrival was for PERSON , who had been admitted at TIME", "The register of the ambulance service did not mention any stitching on the applicant \u2019s head having been found when he had been examined by Doctor PERSON at TIME", "On the basis of these certificates , and referring to the findings of the forensic examination of CARDINAL DATE ( see above ) , the applicant claimed that it had been apparent that he had been beaten for a second time following his visit to the urgent surgery unit of ORG at TIME and that this had been done by the police in whose hands he had been at that time . The applicant considered that after his examination by Doctor PERSON at TIME he must have been transported back to the bar and beaten again , whereupon an ambulance had been called . The applicant accordingly requested the reopening of the investigation or the transmission of the file to ORG , which was competent to open criminal proceedings against police officers .", "On DATE ORG refused to reopen the criminal proceedings , stating that the applicant could bring a private prosecution action in court and that the facts as regards PERSON had been established . Insofar as the applicant had made new allegations these had been within the competence of ORG . Upon the applicant \u2019s appeal this decision was confirmed on DATE by ORG ( \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 ) .", "In view of the applicant \u2019s allegations that he had been beaten by police officers the file was transmitted to ORG . ORG conducted a preliminary inquiry ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430 ) .

They also stated that the applicant had not been put in a cell at the police station , but had waited for a while in the corridor .", "On DATE the opening of criminal proceedings against the police officers was refused . The decision stated that the applicant had been beaten by PERSON , that he had been brought to the hospital and that the QUANTITY police officers questioned had denied having beaten the applicant . Furthermore , the applicant having been drunk and in a helpless state , it was illogical to consider that using force against him could have become necessary .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision to ORG ( NORP \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044a\u043e\u0440\u044a\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438 ) stating inter alia that the facts had not been clarified , that he had not been questioned and that Doctors PERSON and NORP had not been questioned either . ORG replied that they had taken into account the applicant \u2019s testimony given in the course of the investigation against PERSON", "By decision of DATE a prosecutor of ORG dismissed the appeal stating that the witnesses examined in the course of the criminal proceedings against PERSON , PERSON own admissions , and the applicant \u2019s testimony showed that all injuries had been caused by PERSON", "On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision . The appeal was examined on the merits and dismissed on DATE by decision of a senior prosecutor at ORG who in substance repeated the findings of the lower prosecutor . He stated , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s allegations were devoid of any serious foundation .", "None of the decisions addressed the applicant \u2019s allegation that he had been brought to the hospital twice during TIME . Nor did any of the decisions deal with the applicant \u2019s request that Doctors PERSON and NORP be questioned .", "On DATE the applicant instituted private prosecution proceedings against PERSON The ORG heard witnesses , including Doctors NORP and PERSON and the police officers involved , and collected other evidence .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE PERSON was convicted of bodily assault committed in circumstances of overstepping the necessary defence against an attack . He was acquitted insofar as it had been alleged that he had also caused a loss of consciousness , as it had not been proven that the applicant had lost consciousness at any moment . PERSON was ordered to pay CARDINAL old NORP levs ( CARDINAL ORG ) to the applicant and a fine .", "ORG found , inter alia , that after the call for an ambulance the applicant had been seen by Doctor PERSON who had noted a head injury and the applicant \u2019s intoxication . Doctor PERSON , who had seen the applicant at the hospital , had treated the wound on the applicant \u2019s head and had examined his general state of health . He had not detected an acute abdominal condition . That had been diagnosed later , when the applicant \u2019s condition had deteriorated .", "ORG further found that there were no contradictions arising from the evidence in the case , including all medical certificates . It rejected PERSON assertion that it had been unclear whether the applicant \u2019s injuries had been caused by him .", "The applicant did not appeal . Upon the appeal of PERSON , on DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment as it found that the amount of the fine had been unclear , different figures having been mentioned in the operative part and in the reasoning of the judgment .
