It also appears that some time later the civilian witness gave written answers to written questions sent to them by the police . But , notwithstanding this , I am satisfied , from hearing their answers in cross - examination and from watching their demeanour in the witness box , and having regard to the precise and detailed evidence given by police officers as to what happened in GPE police station on DATE when the witnesses and PERSON gave the police the prepared statements and refused to answer questions from the police , that the civilian witnesses gave untruthful answers on oath in the witness box when they said that there was not a pre - arranged plan to give written statements to PERSON , and that some of them gave untruthful answers when they said that they did not refuse to answer questions to the police . It is quite contrary to common sense to accept that the civilian witnesses all went and gave statements to PERSON , and that he accompanied them to the police station and told the police that they would answer no questions , without some sort of plan or arrangement between them and , possibly , CARDINAL party or third parties . Therefore , when assessing the truthfulness of the evidence of the civilian witnesses as to what they saw happen in the car park between < Marine E > and PERSON and Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON and when the car drove out of the car park , I have to bear in mind that they were prepared to lie in the witness box and did lie in the witness box about the way in which they gave their statements to the police . I also think it is probable that the civilian witnesses gave their statements to the police in this way because they did not want to let slip any piece of information which would help the soldiers or would harm Mr PERSON or Mr PERSON . This consideration therefore raises a question mark about their impartiality when they described in the witness box what they saw happen in the car park ... \"", "As regards the significance of the evidence , the Lord Chief Justice found :", "\" There is no doubt that Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were unarmed . It is also clear that they were not terrorists , and no suggestion was made by the CARDINAL accused that they believed them to be terrorists . However the evidence given by the CARDINAL accused clearly raised the defence ( although the onus is not on the accused to establish this defence , but the onus is on the crown to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt ) that they fired because they believed that Marine B would be killed or seriously injured if they did not fire ... \"", "He stated the applicable law , inter alia , as follows :", "\" A number of decisions of the highest courts , ORG , ORG and ORG in GPE , have made it clear that where an accused raises the defence that he killed or injured a person in self - defence or in defence of a third person , the ORG must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not acting in defence of himself or another person or that the force which he used was unreasonable . And these decisions also make it clear that in deciding whether the ORG has proved that the force used was unreasonable beyond doubt the tribunal of fact must have regard not to what actually happened , but to what the accused at the relevant time honestly believed was happening . Moreover the courts have made it clear that the tribunal of fact must assess this , not retrospectively in the calm of the courtroom , but by putting itself in the position of the accused and deciding the question taking account of the situation which the accused was in and of the pressures to which he was subjected and of the time in which he had to act ...", "In the Attorney - General for GPE Reference at CARDINAL E Lord PERSON stated :", "' ... The form in which the jury would have to ask themselves the question in a trial for an offence against the person in which this defence was raised by the accused would be : Are we satisfied that no reasonable man ( a ) with knowledge of such facts as were known to the accused or reasonably believed by him to exist ( b ) in the circumstances and time available to him for reflection ( c ) could be of opinion that the prevention of the risk of harm to which others might be exposed if the suspect were allowed to escape justified exposing the suspect to the risk of harm to him that might result from the kind of force that the accused contemplated using ? ...

In the context of this case the issue is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the white Rover car drove off from the car park with NORP B on the bonnet so that the CARDINAL accused honestly believed that he was being carried away on the bonnet and that they had to fire at the driver of the car to stop the car in order to protect ORG from death or serious injury by being thrown off the bonnet of the car ...", "However in a case such as this where there is a complete conflict of evidence as to what happened at the vital time , and where there are grounds for doubting the truthfulness of the evidence of both the prosecution witnesses and the accused and their principal witness , it is important for the court to remind itself of the fundamental principle of the criminal law , which is that an accused person can only be convicted if the court is satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , and , of course , this principle applies to the trial of a soldier just as much as it applies to the trial of any other person .", "Therefore , at the end of this case , when I came to look back at , and to weigh and consider , all the evidence , bearing in mind the points made by both PERSON and PERSON in their closing speeches , I found that I had a reasonable doubt whether the accused were guilty . Stating the same thing in a different way , I considered that there was a reasonable possibility that PERSON was carried away on the bonnet of the white Rover car and that , in the emergency of the moment , there was a reasonable possibility that the CARDINAL accused fired at the driver because they honestly believed it was necessary to do so to save PERSON from death or serious injury and that in the circumstances as the accused honestly believed them to be there was a reasonable possibility that this constituted reasonable force ... \"", "In reaching that conclusion , the Lord Chief Justice based himself on CARDINAL factors :", "\" CARDINAL . ... < the probability > that the civilian witnesses were deliberately untruthful ...", "CARDINAL .
