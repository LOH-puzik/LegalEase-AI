NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON Sch\u00fcller , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is married to a GPE national . CARDINAL children have been born to the couple , in DATE , in DATE and in DATE . The children have GPE nationality .", "CARDINAL . Mr A. was also the applicant in the case of NORP v. the GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) . The following is taken from the ORG \u2019s admissibility decision in that case , adopted on CARDINAL DATE , and its judgment , delivered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his native GPE the applicant opposed the regime of Colonel PERSON , which at that time held power there .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered the GPE in DATE and applied for asylum . He was met with a refusal . He exhausted the available domestic remedies without success . In the course of the domestic proceedings secret intelligence reports were prepared by the intelligence and security service , ORG ( Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) and its successor , ORG ( Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst \u2013 \u201c LAW \u201d ) . Details are provided in the ORG \u2019s judgment PERSON the GPE , no . CARDINAL , LAW DATE , DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was CARDINAL of CARDINAL individuals tried in GPE as members of an organisation suspected of , among other things , recruiting NORP militants for jihad ( NORP holy war ) against countries including the GPE . The \u201c GPE jihad trial \u201d , as the proceedings were dubbed , attracted considerable media attention and the applicant \u2019s identity became known . The applicant and his co - accused were acquitted of all charges on DATE , after the trial court had excluded evidence based on secret intelligence withheld from the defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) imposed an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ; CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on the applicant on the ground that he constituted a threat to national security . As a consequence of this decision , the applicant could no longer be lawfully resident in the GPE and was subject to expulsion . The decision itself was based largely on secret intelligence not disclosed to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision , which the Minister for ORG rejected on DATE . The applicant appealed ( beroep ) to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE , which dismissed the appeal on DATE . The applicant lodged a further appeal ( hoger beroep ) with ORG of ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak PERSON , \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which was rejected on summary reasoning on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an application ( no . CARDINAL ) with the ORG . As relevant to the present case , the applicant complained that his expulsion to GPE , if effected , would violate his rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( no . CARDINAL , A. v. the GPE ) , the ORG held as follows ( paragraph references omitted ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The applicant fears detention and ill - treatment in GPE on account of his political opposition activities , and the nature of the charges for which he had been tried in the GPE and which trial had been widely reported in the media .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes from the materials in its possession and the materials submitted by the parties that the overall human - rights situation in GPE continues to give rise to serious concerns . Where it concerns the position of persons detained in GPE , materials from both governmental and nongovernmental sources indicate the existence of a real risk for detainees in GPE to be subjected to torture and/or ill - treatment ( ... ) which \u2013 according to the most recent report of ORG are said to occur routinely ( ... ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the risk that the applicant will be detained if expelled to GPE , the ORG notes that , in the applicant \u2019s own submissions , the opposition group for which he had been active had started having problems with the NORP regime as from DATE or DATE whereas he had not encountered any problems from the side of the NORP authorities when he left GPE at DATE via an official border crossing - point , holding his own authentic passport . As apparently persons leaving or entering GPE are subjected to strict controls by border control officials , the ORG considers that in these circumstances it has not been established that the applicant had attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities on account of his alleged opposition activities prior to his departure from GPE .", "CARDINAL . Where it concerns the risk of the applicant being detained in GPE for having stood trial in the GPE on suspicion of involvement in an NORP extremist network active in the GPE , the ORG notes that the applicant was acquitted in these proceedings . However , these criminal proceedings attracted considerable media attention and the applicant \u2019s name and nationality were disclosed in several printed media reports . ORG also notes that on DATE , shortly after the prosecution had withdrawn its appeal against the applicant \u2019s acquittal in the criminal proceedings , the NORP mission in the GPE was informed by ORG [ Vreemdelingenpolitie ] that the applicant had been placed in GPE detention [ vreemdelingenbewaring ] for removal purposes .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further notes that , according to reports of ORG and ORG , the NORP authorities oppose militant forms of ORG and that , according to information gathered by ORG [ i.e. PERSON GPE ] , the NORP authorities often have a good insight in the activities and contacts of NORP abroad . Against this background and the strict controls of persons seeking to enter GPE , the ORG considers it sufficiently plausible for the purposes of LAW that the applicant would be identified and detained for questioning after his arrival in GPE entailing a real risk of being subjected to treatment in violation of LAW at the hands of the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , the ORG considers that substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the applicant would face a real risk of treatment proscribed by LAW if expelled to GPE . Given this finding , the ORG does not find it necessary to examine the remaining issues raised by the applicant under this provision .", "CARDINAL . The ORG finds therefore that , in the circumstances of the present case , the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE would breach LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The regime of Colonel PERSON was overthrown in DATE . On DATE Colonel PERSON himself was captured and killed . ORG , the internationally recognised interim authority , declared the country liberated DATE .", "CARDINAL . GPE is now governed under a transitional constitution , LAW , which was promulgated on DATE . According to LAW , GPE is an independent democratic state in which power derives from the people ; ORG is the state religion ; and sharia ( NORP law ) is the principal source of legislation . DATE provides that GPE shall be a multi - party democracy .", "CARDINAL . Parliamentary elections were held in DATE . The NORP parliament , ORG , was sworn in on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the present case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . After the ORG had given its judgment of DATE , the applicant asked ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) of ORG ( PERSON ; renamed ORG and ORG ( PERSON ) after DATE ) to reconsider the applicant \u2019s exclusion order . He questioned , in particular , the relevance of the secret intelligence which was by then DATE . He also submitted information on his family life , in particular the state of health of his wife who suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder as a result of police raids on the couple \u2019s home carried out in DATE and DATE to arrest the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON , ORG , by this time the successor to the Minister for ORG ) wrote to the applicant \u2019s counsel informing him of his refusal to have the secret intelligence report on the applicant , which dated from DATE , updated by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG gave his decision .", "CARDINAL . The Minister noted that the applicant was not yet entitled to the lifting of the exclusion order in any case , since he had not spent CARDINAL consecutive years outside the GPE . There was accordingly no need to have the secret intelligence report updated . He referred in this connection to the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE , in which it had been held that the decision to deny the applicant the status of refugee as well as the decision to impose an exclusion order on him did not , as such , concern a right or freedom guaranteed under the Convention ( loc . cit . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and also that the secret intelligence report and the underlying materials did not , as such , concern the applicant \u2019s fear of being subjected to ill - treatment in GPE but only whether he was posing a threat to GPE national security ( loc . cit . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The fact that LAW prevented the applicant \u2019s expulsion to his country of origin did not affect the exclusion order . An alien subject to such an order was under an obligation to leave the country . Only if the alien was able to prove that LAW constituted a durable obstacle to his return , and that there was no other foreign country where he could settle , and that in the individual case the exclusion order was disproportionate , could the exclusion order be lifted at the alien \u2019s request . The applicant had failed to seek refuge in any foreign country and had failed to explain why he could not travel to countries other than GPE where he had spent time earlier .", "CARDINAL . NORP The secret intelligence report , which dated from DATE , was still sufficiently up - to - date and determinative of danger to justify the exclusion order . The applicant \u2019s family life did not make any difference . The pertinent information , including the reports on the medical state of the applicant \u2019s wife , had already been known at the time of the appeal against the exclusion order itself and did not , therefore , constitute relevant new facts ; nor was the subsequent birth of CARDINAL further children justification for making an exception . The refusal to lift the exclusion order was therefore not contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against the Minister \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicant applied to ORG of GPE for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) .", "CARDINAL . The objection was dismissed by ORG on DATE , on behalf of the Minister of the ORG and ORG ( Minister PERSON en GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of The Hague .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch , gave its decision . It found that the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE did not of itself require the exclusion order to be revisited . However , the exclusion order had been based on the assumption that the applicant could return to GPE , which assumption had been found by the ORG to be incorrect ; this meant that the decision of CARDINAL DATE would have to be overturned . The matter had now to be reviewed in the light of the fact that the applicant was prevented by operation of LAW from returning to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG first went into the question whether the original exclusion order could stand . In this connection , it held that an exclusion order required the person concerned to leave the GPE of his or her own accord , whether to his or her country of origin or to another country . The applicant had failed to establish that there was no country other than GPE for him to settle . He had likewise failed to establish that there was no country other than GPE to which his wife and children could , or would , follow him . This meant that the Minister of the Interior and ORG could reasonably argue that the exclusion order would have been given even if it had been known at the time that the applicant could not return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG then considered whether the Minister of the Interior and ORG had acted reasonably by failing to lift the exclusion order . It noted in this connection that the applicant had clearly not met the requirement of CARDINAL consecutive PERSON residence abroad . Since the applicant had not established that LAW constituted a durable obstacle to his return to GPE \u2013 \u201c durable \u201d meaning that it prevented the applicant \u2019s expulsion to that country for a period of DATE and that there was no other foreign country for him to settle , the Minister of the Interior and ORG had been entitled in reason to consider that the impossibility of expelling the applicant to GPE did not require the exclusion order to be lifted .", "CARDINAL . Since LAW had been taken into consideration in the proceedings concerning the exclusion order itself , the question now was whether there had been any relevant changes in the applicant \u2019s situation requiring ORG to allow him to exercise his family life in the GPE . Taking the view that the birth of CARDINAL more children since the end of the first set of proceedings changed nothing in principle , ORG found none .", "CARDINAL . ORG accordingly overturned the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) but left its legal consequences in place .", "CARDINAL . In a simultaneous but separate decision , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for a provisional measure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision dismissing the appeal on summary reasoning .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) provides that a foreign national may be declared an undesirable alien , entailing the imposition of an exclusion order , on the ground , inter alia , that he or she poses a danger to national security . An exclusion order entails a ban on residing in or visiting the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Exclusion orders , as well as expulsion orders , can be challenged in administrative law appeal proceedings under the terms of LAW ( Algemene wet bestuursrecht ) . Such appeal proceedings do not have an automatic suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) provides that an alien who stays in the GPE in the knowledge that he or she is subject to an exclusion order commits a criminal offence punishable by CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . An exclusion order may be revoked , upon request , if the alien concerned has been residing outside the GPE for a period of DATE ( section DATE of LAW ) . Such revocation entitles the alien to seek readmission to GPE territory subject to the conditions that are applicable to every alien ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
