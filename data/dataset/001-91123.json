{"ITEMID": "001-91123", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2009, "DOCNAME": "W. v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr C. Ingelse , a lawyer practising in GPE .", ", may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the Juvenile Judge ( kinderrechter ) for criminal cases of ORG ( rechtbank ) found the applicant guilty of causing bodily harm ( mishandeling ) . The applicant was sentenced to a suspended term of juvenile detention ( voorwaardelijke jeugddetentie ) , a community service order ( werkstraf ) of TIME and a training order ( leerstraf ) of TIME .", "In view of the applicant \u2019s conviction , and pursuant to LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the DNA Testing ( Convicted Persons ) Act ( Wet DNA - onderzoek bij veroordeelden ; \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , the public prosecutor , on DATE , ordered that cellular material be taken from the applicant in order for his DNA profile to be determined . A mouth swab was taken from the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant , pursuant to LAW , lodged an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) against the decision to have his DNA profile determined and processed , i.e. entered into a national DNA database . He submitted that , in accordance with LAW , the personal interests of a minor should be balanced against the general interests of society when it was being considered whether to apply the LAW to that minor , and within that balancing exercise the interests of the minor should be the primary consideration pursuant to LAW . The applicant submitted that regard should be had to the age of the convicted person at the time of the commission of the crime , the seriousness of the offence , the circumstances under which the offence had been committed , the risk of the convicted person reoffending and other personal circumstances of the convicted person .", "The applicant further argued that the public prosecutor had failed to strike a proper balance of the interests involved . In particular , the public prosecutor had failed to take into account that the applicant had only been DATE when he committed the offence , that the offence had consisted of the administration of CARDINAL blow with his fist , that the applicant was performing well at school and that he showed no risk at all of reoffending . The applicant also claimed that the storage of his DNA profile would not be beneficial for the possible detection , prevention or conviction of future crimes committed by him and that the exception contained in article CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL sub b of the LAW ( see below ) should therefore apply .", "On DATE ORG , having heard the public prosecutor and counsel for the applicant in camera , dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection . It considered that , if all requirements stipulated in the LAW had been met , the public prosecutor was obliged to collect a DNA sample from the applicant regardless of the fact that he was a minor . As regards the applicant \u2019s claim of a violation of LAW , ORG referred to the parliamentary discussions ( parlementaire behandeling ) on the adoption of the LAW , which had concluded that the LAW did not breach fundamental rights enshrined in the LAW and international treaties . ORG adopted these conclusions and LAW CARDINAL argument was accordingly dismissed .", "ORG further noted that ORG had not featured in the parliamentary discussions . Being of the view that the determination and processing of the DNA profile of a minor could adversely affect that minor \u2019s interests , ORG considered that it ought to interpret the provisions of the LAW in the light of the text and aim of the Convention on the Rights of the LAW . With reference to LAW , it found that where the determination and processing of a minor \u2019s DNA profile were concerned , the interests of the minor and the general interests of the ORG in the prevention and detection of crime should be weighed against each other . ORG went on to observe that it appeared from the file that the applicant had severely injured his victim , that he had already performed TIME of community service to avoid criminal prosecution relating to an earlier charge of causing bodily harm , and that at the hearing the public prosecutor had disclosed that the applicant had in the meantime been apprehended on suspicion of attempted manslaughter . ORG held that in these circumstances the interests of the ORG outweighed those of the applicant . It further considered that the determination and processing of the applicant \u2019s DNA profile would not result in any adverse effects for the applicant relating to his young age since the DNA database was not public and stringent criteria on access to it were in place .", "No appeal lay against the decision of ORG .", "The statutory maximum prison sentence for the offence of assault causing bodily harm is DATE ( article CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of LAW , GPE ) . In the event that grievous bodily harm is caused , the statutory maximum prison sentence is DATE ( article CARDINAL paragraph QUANTITY of LAW ) .", "The DNA Testing ( Convicted Persons ) Act entered into force on DATE .", "LAW requires the public prosecutor at ORG that has given judgment at first instance to order that a sample of cellular material be taken from , inter alia , a person who has been convicted of CARDINAL of the offences listed in CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL sub b of LAW ( PERSON ) . Assault causing bodily harm is one of those offences .", "According to the explanatory memorandum to LAW ( Memorie van Toelichting ; ORG , no . CARDINAL , DATE session , no . CARDINAL ) , the seriousness of the offence(s ) involved justifies determining and processing a DNA profile of the convicted person in order to contribute to the detection , prosecution and trial of criminal offences committed by him or her and , if possible , to prevent him or her from again committing criminal offences .", "Paragraph CARDINAL sub b of LAW sets out CARDINAL exceptions . No order for sample collection will be made if , in view of the nature of the offence or the special circumstances under which it was committed , it may reasonably be assumed that the determination and processing of the DNA profile will not be of significance for the prevention , detection , prosecution and trial of criminal offences committed by the person in question . It appears from the explanatory memorandum to this provision that the first exception of paragraph CARDINAL sub b , relating to the nature of the offence , may apply when a person has been convicted of a crime for the solution of which DNA investigations can play no meaningful role \u2013 perjury or forgery , for instance . The second exception , relating to the special circumstances under which the offence was committed , may apply to a convicted person who is most unlikely previously to have committed an offence in respect of which DNA investigation might be of use and who will not be able to do so in the future , for example due to serious physical injury or in the case of a woman who has never had any dealings with the law and who , after having been ill - treated by her husband for DATE , finally inflicts grievous bodily harm on him or kills him .", "LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the Act stipulates that DNA profiles are only to be processed for the purpose of the prevention , detection , prosecution and trial of criminal offences . It further states that rules as to the processing of DNA profiles and cellular material are to be laid down by ORG ( algemene maatregel van bestuur ) , after ORG ( College Bescherming Persoonsgegevens ) has been heard . The rules in question have been set out in the DNA ( Criminal Cases ) Tests Decree ( Besluit DNA - onderzoek in strafzaken ) . It regulates how and by whom samples are to be taken ; how they are to be kept , sealed and identified ; how and by whom the DNA profile is to be drawn up ; and which authorities are allowed to make use of the data stored in the DNA database . The Decree further lays down rules on the duration of the retention of a DNA profile and cellular material . This depends on the offence of which the individual concerned has been convicted . The data of persons convicted of an offence carrying a statutory maximum sentence of DATE or more is retained for DATE . For less serious offences carrying sentences of DATE , cellular material and DNA profiles may be retained for a maximum period of DATE .", "The individual concerned may lodge an objection against the determination and processing of his or her DNA profile with ORG within DATE after the sample has been taken or after he or she has been served with the notification , required by article CARDINAL paragraph QUANTITY , that sufficient cellular material has been collected for a DNA profile to be determined and processed ( article CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The documents relating to the enactment of the LAW contain no references to LAW . However , in a parliamentary discussion which took place on DATE the Minister of ORG said that he saw no reason to exempt juveniles from the application of the LAW or to establish a different regulation for them , since the chance of a convicted person reoffending was no less in the case of a minor than in that of an adult ( Handelingen Tweede Kamer \u2013 Records of ORG DATE , p. CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "The compatibility of the LAW with the Convention on the Rights of the LAW was discussed in ORG when , in DATE , a number of amendments \u2013 not relevant to the present case DATE to the LAW were proposed . On that occasion the Minister of ORG replied to written questions of Members of ORG that the Convention on the Rights of the ORG intended for juvenile criminal law to provide an educational perspective in which the reaction to the commission of criminal offences by juveniles ought to be based on rehabilitation , the offering of a second chance and correction of , or compensation for , a failed upbringing . According to the Minister , the taking of cellular material for the purpose of DNA investigation was not contrary to those principles . On the contrary , he considered that the processing of their DNA profile in the national database could contribute to their social rehabilitation . He therefore saw no need to amend the LAW in this context ( GPE ( Parliamentary Documents ) , DATE , CARDINAL , nr . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "After the entry into force of the LAW , different ORG reached different decisions on objections lodged by minors against the determination and processing of their DNA profiles . Whereas ORG considered that the full application of the LAW to persons who had been underage when convicted sat ill with the Convention on the Rights of the LAW in view of its stigmatising effect , others found that DNA testing following a conviction was not detrimental to a child \u2019s feelings of dignity and self - worth and did not stand in the way of the child \u2019s reintegration into society . CARDINAL ORG subscribing to this latter view considered that application of the LAW to a minor did not entail adverse consequences since information relating to the determination and processing of a DNA profile was not public and would only be used in a specific criminal case ; the DNA profile was stored in the DNA database anonymously and coded ; and the minor would subsequently not be confronted with his DNA profile unless it appeared \u2013 as a result of a comparison of his or her DNA profile with DNA profiles of traces found in unsolved criminal cases \u2013 that he or she had previously committed one or more offences or committed another offence in the future . It was concluded that no stigmatising affect attached to the processing of DNA profiles and cellular material of juveniles . Moreover , to the extent that the LAW aimed at dissuading convicted persons from reoffending , the processing of their DNA profile in the DNA database might have a preventive effect on the behaviour of minors ( ORG , DATE , GPE National Case - law ( database ) number , \u201c LJN \u201d \u2013 AUCARDINAL ) .", "In view of the differing decisions taken by different ORG , the Procurator General at ORG ( PERSON ) lodged an appeal in cassation with that court in the interest of the law ( cassatie in het belang der wet ) in CARDINAL cases ( not including the present one ) . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( PERSON ) , in which it had regard to the explanatory memorandum to the LAW and the parliamentary discussions on the adoption of the LAW , ORG considered that the basic premise of the text , goal as well as the tenor of the LAW was that cellular material be taken from every convicted person within the meaning of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW . The LAW did not differentiate between underage and adult convicts and the system of the LAW did not allow for any further balancing of interests . The public prosecutor was obliged to issue an order for cellular material to be taken unless one of the exceptions set out in paragraph CARDINAL of article CARDINAL applied . ORG concluded that the system , as intended by the legislator , of a wide opportunity for the taking of cellular material with CARDINAL exceptions that were to be narrowly interpreted , did not provide room for a generic exception for minors . Moreover , such a generic exception could also not be derived from ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
