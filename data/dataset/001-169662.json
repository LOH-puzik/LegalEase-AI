As a result of that disease the applicant developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , for which he received treatment .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicant suffered from hepatitis C , which was also diagnosed in DATE and was probably linked to a history of drug abuse . It was accompanied by liver fibrosis . According to a medical report dated DATE his hepatitis , which had been treated effectively in DATE and DATE , had become stable .", "CARDINAL . A magnetic resonance imaging scan carried out in DATE showed that the applicant had suffered a stroke , resulting in permanent paralysis of the left arm .

On DATE ORG refused the request on the ground that , under section CARDINALter(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the applicant was excluded from its scope on account of the serious crimes which had given rise in the meantime to a ministerial deportation order issued on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request for a stay of execution of that decision under the ordinary procedure , together with an application to set aside .

In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims in the following terms :", "\u201c It is clear from the wording of [ section CARDINALter ] that there is nothing to prevent the administrative authority , when dealing with a request for leave to remain on the basis of the above - mentioned section CARDINALter , from ruling immediately on the exclusion of the person concerned from the scope of the said section CARDINALter without first being required to take a decision on the medical evidence submitted to it , if it considers at the outset that there are substantial grounds for believing that the person concerned has committed any of the acts referred to in section CARDINAL/CARDINAL , cited above . Indeed , the examination of that evidence is superfluous in such a situation since the person responsible for taking the decision has in any event already decided that the individual is excluded from the scope [ of section CARDINALter ] .", "...", "As regards the alleged violation of LAW , it should be observed that the decision complained of in the present application is not accompanied by any removal measure , with the result that the alleged risk of discontinuation of treatment in the event of the applicant \u2019s return to GPE is hypothetical . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also dismissed the complaint under LAW in view of the fact that the impugned decision had not been accompanied by any removal measure .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had lodged a second request for regularisation on medical grounds on the basis of section CARDINALter of LAW . In addition to his various health problems he referred to the fact that he had been continuously resident in GPE for DATE and had lasting social ties in that country , and to his family situation . He also argued that if he was sent back he would be left to fend for himself while ill in a country in which he no longer had any family ties and where the medical facilities were unsuitable and expensive .", "CARDINAL . The request was refused by ORG on DATE for the same reason it had cited previously ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG to have that decision set aside .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the application to set aside . It held that , where the above - mentioned exclusion clause was applied , ORG was not required to rule on the medical and other evidence contained in the request for regularisation . According to ORG , such examination was superfluous by virtue of the exclusion clause alone . ORG pointed out that its task was to review the lawfulness of the measure . This review did not permit it to substitute its own assessment of the facts that were deemed to have been established and were not apparent from the administrative file ; rather , its task was confined to ensuring that the formal requirement to provide reasons had been complied with and that the reasoning was not based on a manifest error of assessment . As to the complaints alleging a violation of ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention , ORG stated that the assessment of the medical situation of an alien facing removal whose request for regularisation had been rejected should be carried out , as applicable , at the time of enforcement of the removal measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment with the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat . CARDINAL of the grounds of appeal was based on ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention . The applicant submitted that ORG could not have been unaware that several orders to leave the country had already been issued against him prior to the decision not to examine his request for leave to remain , and that his expulsion had been suspended only as a result of the interim measure applied by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant further argued that ORG had breached the provisions of the LAW by postponing until the date of enforcement of the removal measure the examination of the medical situation of an alien suffering from a serious illness who had requested leave to remain on medical grounds , without studying the specific risks .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE the appeal on points of law was declared inadmissible . The ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat held that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s assertion , the grounds for setting aside advanced before ORG had simply stressed , in a theoretical and general manner , that section CARDINALter of the LAW encompassed the application in domestic law of the obligation under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW prohibiting the removal of a seriously ill person if such a measure was liable to result in death or inhuman and degrading treatment ; no specific explanation had been given , however , as to how the applicant himself risked facing that situation . The ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat also observed that the applicant had not argued before ORG that orders to leave the country had been issued against him , or that a removal measure could be revived ; he was therefore unable to rely on those arguments in his appeal on points of law . In any event , the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat held that ORG had in no way erred in finding that the examination of the medical situation of an alien facing removal whose request for leave to remain had been rejected should be carried out , as applicable , at the time of enforcement of the measure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was requested to report to ORG medical service on DATE for a medical check - up and to enable the NORP authorities to reply to the ORG \u2019s questions .", "CARDINAL .
