As a result of the inspection , on DATE ORG drew up a report indicating a number of relatively minor errors in the company \u2019s tax returns and served it on the company .", "CARDINAL . Following the company \u2019s objections , on DATE ORG adopted a decision in which it found the company liable for having filed incomplete returns in respect of certain taxes .", "CARDINAL . The decision of ORG was accepted and complied with by the company on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) , acting as a reviewing body within the meaning of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , carried out an additional tax inspection of the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a report indicating that the applicant company had a large tax liability for DATE . The detailed report came to over CARDINAL pages and had CARDINAL supporting documents in annex . The report was served on the applicant company on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry established that in DATE the applicant company had carried out its activities through a network of CARDINAL trading companies registered in low - tax areas of GPE ( \u201c GPE , the town of ORG in ORG , GPE , the town of GPE in LOC , the town of GPE in GPE and the GPE \u201d ) . For all legal purposes , most of these entities were set up as entirely independent from the applicant , i.e. as belonging and being controlled by third persons , although their sole activity consisted of commissioning the applicant company to buy crude oil on their behalf from the company \u2019s own oil - producing subsidiaries and either putting it up for sale on the domestic market or abroad , or first handing it over to the company \u2019s own oil - processing plants and then selling it . There were no real cash transactions between the applicant company , its oil - processing and oil - producing subsidiaries and the trading entities , and the company \u2019s own promissory notes and mutual offsetting were used instead . All the money thus accumulated from sales was then transferred unilaterally to the \u201c ORG of the Production Development of OAO ORG \u201d , a commercial entity founded , owned and run by the applicant company . Since at all relevant times the applicant company took part in all of the transactions of the trading companies , but acted as the ORG agent and never as an owner of the goods produced and processed by its own subsidiaries and since the compensation paid by the trading entities for its services was negligible , the applicant company \u2019s real turnover was never reflected in any tax documents and , consequently , in its tax returns . In addition , most of the trading companies were in fact sham entities , as they were neither present nor operated in the place of their registration . In addition , they had no assets and no employees of their own .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found it established , among other things , that :", "( a ) the actual movement of the traded oil was from the applicant company \u2019s production sites to its own processing or storage facilities ;", "( b ) the applicant company acted as an exporter of goods for the purpose of customs clearance , even though the goods had formally been owned and sold by sham companies ;", "( c ) through the use of various techniques , the applicant company indirectly established and , at all relevant times de facto , controlled and owned the sham entities ;", "( d ) all accounting operations of the companies were carried out by the same CARDINAL entities , ORG \u201d ORG and ORG , both dependant on or belonging to the applicant company ;", "( e ) the network of sham companies was officially managed by ORG \u201d RM , all official correspondence , including tax documents , being sent from the postal address of ORG \u201d GPE , the applicant company \u2019s managing subsidiary ;", "( f ) the sham companies and the applicant company \u2019s subsidiaries entered into transactions with lowered prices for the purpose of reducing the taxable base of their operations ;", "( g ) NORP all revenues perceived by the sham companies were thereafter unilaterally transferred to the applicant company ;", "( h ) statements by the owners and directors of the trading entities , who confessed that they had signed documents that they had been required to sign by the officials of the applicant company , and had never conducted any independent activity on behalf of their companies , were true ;", "( i ) and , lastly , that the sham companies received tax benefits unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to all this , the Ministry decided that the activities of the sham companies served the purpose of screening the real business activity of the applicant company , that the transactions of these companies were sham and that it had been the applicant company , and not the sham entities , which conducted the transactions and became the owner of the traded goods . In view of the above , and also since neither the sham entities nor the applicant company qualified for the tax exemptions in question , the report concluded that the company , having acted in bad faith , had failed properly to reflect these transactions in its tax declarations , thus avoiding the payment of GPE , motorway tax , corporate property tax , tax for improvement of the housing stock and socio - cultural facilities , tax in respect of sales of fuels and lubricants and profit tax .", "CARDINAL .
