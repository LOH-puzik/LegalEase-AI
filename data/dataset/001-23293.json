THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Mark Villiger;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant was convicted of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and sentenced to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment . He had attacked his girl friend following consumption of alcohol .", "On DATE , the applicant pleaded guilty to CARDINAL counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm arising out of an incident when , under the influence of alcohol , he stabbed his DATE stepson and brother - in - law with a screwdriver .", "The pre - sentence report prepared by ORG observed inter alia that the applicant \u2019s tendency to violence stemmed from his habit of excessive drinking and that he was at high risk of further offending . It also noted his genuine remorse for the offences and his intention to work on his alcohol problem .", "The trial judge sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG in relation to the wounding convictions . In that regard , the judge stated inter alia :", "\u201c ... the CARDINAL offences for which you fall to be sentenced ... are so serious that only custodial sentences can be justified . Indeed ... I am obliged to pass an automatic life sentence of imprisonment upon you in respect of each of these offences , unless I am of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances relating either to the offences or to you ...", "I have listened carefully to [ the applicant counsel \u2019s ] submissions , I have carefully read your wife \u2019s letter and I have read the contents of the pre - sentence report and all the conclusions that I have come to ... I am not satisfied that there are any exceptional circumstances which should lead me not to impose an automatic life sentence ... \u201d", "The judge assessed the applicable determinate sentence ( which he would have passed but for LAW at DATE , allowing for the mitigation in the applicant \u2019s case and the time already served , and on that basis fixed a tariff of DATE .", "The applicant did not apply at that time to appeal against sentence . Following developments in domestic case - law concerning the application of LAW ( see below ) , the applicant made an application for permission to appeal against sentence to ORG .", "On DATE , after a hearing at which the applicant was represented by counsel , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for leave to appeal and his application to call fresh evidence . It noted that the trial judge had not carried out an assessment of the risk posed by the applicant to the public when imposing the sentence of life imprisonment which had been found to be the proper approach in the subsequent PERSON case . It went on to review the case in light of the new authority and taking into account a report by a consultant forensic psychiatrist commissioned by the applicant . Noting however the applicant \u2019s \u201c worrying \u201d history of alcohol abuse and violence with a weapon , it found that the applicant represented a continuing risk to the public and that an automatic life sentence was appropriate in the circumstances of his case .", "The applicant \u2019s tariff expired on DATE . His case was considered by ORG on DATE and it directed his release , subject to certain licence conditions , as it considered his detention was no longer necessary to protect the public .", "On DATE , the applicant was released .", "The DATE Act came into force on DATE . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) provide as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This section applies where -", "( a ) a person is convicted of a serious offence committed after the commencement of this section ; and", "( b ) at the time when that offence was committed , he was DATE or over and had been convicted in any part of GPE of another serious offence .", "( CARDINAL ) The court shall impose a life sentence , that is to say -", "( a ) where the person is ORG over , a sentence of imprisonment for life ; ( b ) where he is DATE , a sentence of custody for life under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ,", "unless the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances relating to either of the offences or to the offender which justify its not doing so .", "( CARDINAL ) Where the court does not impose a life sentence , it shall state in open court that it is of that opinion and what the exceptional circumstances are . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) listed the offences considered \u201c serious \u201d for the purposes of the section . The offences listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) were already punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment and they include rape .", "Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act impose mandatory penalties of DATE for a third conviction on class A drug trafficking offences and domestic burglaries , respectively . Both sections oblige the court to impose the fixed sentence when the statutory conditions are fulfilled except :", "\u201c where the court is of the opinion that there are specific circumstances which -", "( a ) NORP relate to any of the offences or to the offender ; and", "( b ) would make the prescribed custodial sentence unjust in all the circumstances . \u201d", "In this case , decided after the entry into force of LAW DATE , ORG adopted a more flexible interpretation of the words \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d in section QUANTITY of LAW .", "The appellants contended that section CARDINAL was incompatible with , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . ORG agreed that the manner of interpreting section DATE meant that that section could clearly operate in a disproportionate manner , it not being difficult to find examples of situations where it would be wholly disproportionate to impose a life sentence even for a second serious offence .", "It considered that the problem would disappear if the words \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d in section CARDINAL were construed in a manner which accorded with the policy of ORG in adopting the section . That policy was to protect the public . Accordingly , a finding that an offender does not constitute a significant risk to the public should be considered to constitute \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d which approach , ORG considered , would accord with parliamentary intent and with the provisions of the Convention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
