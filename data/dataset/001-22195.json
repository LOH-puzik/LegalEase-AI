She also informed the prosecutor that her husband was suffering serious psychological problems and asked the prosecutor for assistance to find her husband .", "On DATE , DATE after having been thus informed , the PERSON prosecutor took a decision to discontinue the investigation into the disappearance of the applicant \u2019s husband . As to his reasoning for this decision , the prosecutor stated that the applicant \u2019s husband had not disappeared in suspicious circumstances and that no evidence of a crime had been found in the investigation .", "In DATE the uncle of the applicant \u2019s husband went to the registry office to obtain a copy of the family \u2019s registry records for an unconnected purpose . He discovered that there was an entry in the records stating that the applicant \u2019s husband had been killed in DATE .", "On DATE the uncle went to the office of the ORG public prosecutor to ask for clarification as to how the applicant \u2019s husband had met his death and why the family had never been informed about the death despite the fact that the applicant had informed the prosecutor of her husband \u2019s disappearance . He also asked the prosecutor where the applicant \u2019s husband was buried . The prosecutor said that no one knew where the applicant \u2019s husband was buried and that the authorities had no obligation to hand the body over to the family . The prosecutor further stated that on DATE , following the applicant \u2019s husband \u2019s death , he had sent the file to ORG and asked them to make a decision as to whether they wanted to prosecute the applicant \u2019s deceased husband for membership of the ORG but on CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor of ORG had taken a decision not to prosecute the applicant \u2019s husband as he was dead .", "The applicant subsequently obtained a copy of the report of the autopsy which had been carried out on DATE .

The prosecutor stated that although it was established that the applicant \u2019s husband was killed by the village guards , it was not possible to establish which CARDINAL of the CARDINAL village guards had shot him .", "In NORP law \u2013 for the purposes of preliminary investigations by prosecutors \u2013 criminal acts are divided into CARDINAL categories ; firstly those in respect of which a victim must inform the prosecutor so that an investigation can be started by the latter , and secondly , those in respect of which the victim is not required to make a complaint in order for an investigation to be started by the prosecutor ( LAW , hereinafter the ORG ) . Murder is classified as CARDINAL of the crimes in the second category . However , this does not prevent relatives of victims from lodging criminal complaints with the authorities .", "Pursuant to LAW ORG , if there is evidence to suggest that a deceased has not died of natural causes , the police officers or other public officials who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal court judge .", "A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts by conducting the necessary inquiries to identify the perpetrators ( LAW ) . The public prosecutor may institute criminal proceedings if he or she decides that the evidence justifies the indictment of a suspect ( LAW ORG ) . If it appears that the evidence against a suspect is insufficient to justify the institution of criminal proceedings , the public prosecutor may close the investigation in respect of that person . However , the public prosecutor may decide not to prosecute if , and only if , the evidence is clearly insufficient .", "Insofar as a criminal complaint has been lodged , a complainant may file an appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings . This appeal must be lodged , within DATE after notification of this decision to the complainant , with the president of ORG in whose jurisdiction the public prosecutor who had taken the decision not to prosecute works ( LAW ORG ) . The president of ORG may request the public prosecutor to send him or her the investigation file . The president , in order to reach his decision , may also ask for the investigation to be expanded by the local ORG judge ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) . If the president concludes that there are insufficient grounds to initiate a prosecution , he or she may reject the appeal ( LAW . If the president agrees with the grounds invoked by the appellant , he or she may decide to order a prosecution . The public prosecutor is obliged to enforce the president \u2019s decision ( LAW .", "According to article CARDINAL of LAW , if a person is killed by CARDINAL or more persons , and if it is not established at the trial which one of these persons caused the death , the prison sentence to be imposed on any of the perpetrators is not CARDINAL and not CARDINAL of the maximum prison sentence stipulated in LAW for the offence of murder ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
