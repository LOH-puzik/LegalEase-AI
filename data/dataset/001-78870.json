On DATE ORG upheld the conviction but partly altered the sentence imposed . It raised the fine originally imposed to PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The reasoning for that judgment read , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c ... The alleged breach of [ the applicant \u2019s ] procedural rights can not be upheld . The legal grounds for declining to hear J.S .- T. before the court are laid down in LAW . Under that provision , the court may \u2013 even if the parties object DATE decline to take measures to summon a witness and confine itself to reading out the records of statements previously given by him or her as a defendant or suspect . The application of that provision is an exception to the rule of the direct examination of witnesses and does diminish the accused person \u2019s defence rights , in particular in situations where there has been no prior confrontation between him and a witness whose testimony is later read out . It must however be stressed that LAW does not oblige the court to exhaust all possibilities of producing a witness from abroad at the trial , even if he or she resides in a neighbouring country . ... Of course , the trial court is empowered , apart from the application of the measure under LAW ... , to make efforts to ensure the direct examination of a witness from abroad . But those efforts make sense only if there are prospects of success . It is known \u2013 also to the author of the appeal \u2013 that the [ previous ] attempts made by the court in that respect were futile and that future ones would fail . As early as DATE ORG asked ORG for information as to whether NORP .- T. lived at the address that she had supplied . The reply was evasive and should be interpreted as a refusal to furnish any information on that matter . A further confirmation of the firmness of that position is found in the letter of the NORP diplomatic service ( see the letter of ORG in GPE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "A pre - condition for securing an appearance of a witness from abroad is that the authority conducting the proceedings knows his or her address . Bearing in mind the obligation to observe all procedural rules attached to summoning a witness from a foreign country , a summons can not be sent if his or her address is unknown or if it is clear that the address is false . It that context , it should be recalled that the applicant \u2019s \u201c private \u201d enquiries were to no avail ( see ... the letter of DATE ... ) .", "In conclusion and having regard to the grounds for the appeal , the [ trial ] court would not have been able to satisfy the requirement of the \u201c proper and effective summoning of the witness J.S .- T. for the trial \u201d . Consequently , this argument is ill - founded and , indeed , this court could have stopped at this point because the appellant \u2019s further arguments do not concern the court \u2019s actions but the actions of the investigative authorities and , also , the appellant does not challenge the logic of the conclusion reached by the trial court . Yet there is a need to make the following remarks .", "First of all , J.S .- T. was released because she put up bail of PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Until that time , that is to say , for DATE , she was in custody . The [ applicant ] was treated in the same way but on more favourable conditions : he was released after DATE and the security in question was PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "Secondly , evidence obtained under LAW must be assessed with a particular thoroughness . The assessment of ORG testimony must be very careful , not least because she was charged with theft of the car in question and supplied a false address . ORG , did , however , manage the task . The best proof is the fact that the [ appellant ] does not even try to challenge the arguments relating to J.S .- T. \u2019s testimony , which are presented in the reasoning of the contested judgment . It can only be recalled that the trial court took notice of the circumstances surrounding the last questioning of NORP ( by the prosecutor and in the presence of her lawyer ) and of the importance of those statements for her criminal responsibility . The court of first instance did not overlook the fact that those statements differed from the previous ones . There is no material proof to conclude that her statements incriminating [ the applicant ] were made in consequence of her agreement with the investigating authority and , in particular , that they were the price for her release . If her release can be looked on from this angle , the price for her release DATE although lawful DATE was the security in question .", "Apart from the above - mentioned arguments of the trial court , there is CARDINAL more reason to believe J.S .- T. and not to believe [ the applicant ] . His subsequent statements differ in respect to a number of principal points , points that were enumerated by the trial court . That court rightly noted that [ the applicant ] , when questioned for the first time , had no reason to present a version of events that differed from those later presented . That was decisive for the trial court when , in making a choice between [ the applicant \u2019s ] statements and the last version presented by PERSON , it rejected his testimony . She also changed her statements but she had an interest in concealing the truth . Yet , if [ the applicant ] was not in any criminal conspiracy with other persons involved in the case , he had no reason to conceal the true circumstances capable of showing that he was not involved in the activities of those persons .", "The applicant \u2019s letter to the court dated DATE reinforces the conclusions reached by ORG rather than supporting his own credibility .
