GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who lives in Calbe . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", ", may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the operator of a service - station in ORG . In DATE , he concluded a service - station agreement with an oil company which contained an exclusive purchasing clause , according to which the applicant is obliged to buy petrol from the company for DATE .", "In DATE , after the applicant \u2019s legal counsel had challenged the contract , the oil company sued the applicant before ORG in order to declare the contract between the parties as being valid and to order the applicant to refrain from purchasing , storing and selling other ORG petrol .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the oil company \u2019s claim . It held that the agreement was prohibited by LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL LAW ( then LAW ) and was therefore void pursuant to LAW of LAW . ORG found that the exclusive purchasing agreement restricted the competition within the NORP common market and that the contract with its DATE duration formed part of a number of agreements designed to hamper the market entry for potential competitors . ORG also found that this provision applied even though the contract had described the applicant \u2019s position as that of a sales agent ( PERSON ) , because his contractual obligations did not support such a qualification .", "The oil company subsequently lodged an appeal with ORG . In the appeal proceedings , the applicant asked the court to dismiss the appeal and , alternatively , to make a referral to ORG under LAW regarding the following question :", "\u201c Is LAW to be interpreted in such a way that the obligation for the exclusive purchase of petrol in a service - station contract with the owner of the service - station , like the contract between the parties to the present dispute , -even if the contract is phrased as a sales agent agreement- is capable to distort competition within the relevant market of the sale of petrol by service - stations and to noticeably affect trade between member states and is such an agreement consequently void pursuant to LAW ORG ? \u201d", "On DATE , ORG set aside ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the applicant to refrain from purchasing , storing or selling other oil company \u2019s petrol in his service - station . ORG concluded that the applicant had to be regarded as a sales agent under NORP PERSON and that LAW was therefore not applicable . Finally , ORG stated that it had not been obliged to seek a preliminary ruling by ORG under LAW ORG since the applicant could still lodge an appeal on points of law with ORG .", "The applicant , represented by legal counsel , lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG on DATE , requesting ORG to set aside the judgment of ORG of CARDINAL DATE and to decide in accordance with his motions lodged in the appeal proceedings ( \u201c nach den Schlu\u00dfantr\u00e4gen der Revisionkl\u00e4gerin in PERSON ) . Those motions thus also included his alternative motion to request a preliminary ruling under LAW . However , his submissions to ORG did not contain an express request for a reference under LAW , nor did the applicant give any express reasons for the necessity of a preliminary ruling . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , finding that the case was neither of fundamental importance , nor that it had reasonable prospects of success . No further reasons for the dismissal were given by ORG .", "On DATE , ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint without giving any reasons .", "( CARDINAL ) The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market : all agreements between undertakings , decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member GPE and which have as their object or effect the prevention , restriction or distortion of competition within the common market , and in particular those which :", "( a ) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions ;", "( b ) limit or control production , markets , technical development , or investment ;", "( c ) share markets or sources of supply ;", "( d ) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties , thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage ;", "( e ) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which , by their nature or according to commercial usage , have no connection with the subject of such contracts .", "( CARDINAL ) Any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to this Article shall be automatically void . ( ... )", "ORG shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning :", "( a ) the interpretation of this LAW ; ( ... )", "Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member ORG , that court or tribunal may , if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment , request ORG to give a ruling thereon .", "Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member ORG against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law , that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before ORG .", "LAW of LAW Grundgesetz ) provides :", "\u201c ( ... ) No one may be removed from the jurisdiction of his lawful judge . \u201d", "It is settled case - law of ORG that ORG is a \u201c lawful judge \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( see BVerfGE DATE , p. CARDINAL , at p. CARDINAL ; BVerfG , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG finds a violation of that provision if a court against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy basically fails to recognise its obligation to seek a preliminary ruling under LAW ( BVerfG , decision of DATE , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . The same applies in the instance that there does not yet exist any case - law by ORG concerning a decisive question on the application or interpretation of ORG law , or the existing case - law has not yet exhaustively answered that question ( BVerfG , decision of DATE , cited above , p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
