De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was at that time a journalist of the DATE magazine PERSON , contacted GPE , the then rector of ORG , in order to inform him that she considered him to be a long - term informant for the communist secret services in the past . She did not refer to any relevant documentary evidence in her possession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant published an article in PERSON entitled \u201c Agents Wearing Ermine \u201d , alleging that during the communist times PERSON had been an informant for the NORP secret police . The article had the subheading \u201c Leaders of university anti - vetting revolt collaborated with NORP secret services \u201d . A photo showing PERSON in the course of his official duties alongside the article had the caption : \u201c PERSON , rector of ORG , used to be an informant for the communist secret services under the name Lek \u201d . The article did not quote its sources , referring in general terms to unspecified documents .", "CARDINAL . The article was also published on the magazine \u2019s website ( www.wprost.pl ) , where it was available until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant obtained consent from the President of ORG ( PERSON \u2013\u201cthe ORG \u201d ) to access its files . The ORG \u2019s tasks included , inter alia , storing and researching documents of the communist security services . On DATE the applicant checked its files registered as GPE no . DATE , ORG Gd CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON informed the prosecution authorities that he had been libelled by the author of the article . On DATE ORG in GPE refused to institute a criminal investigation and informed GPE that the offence alleged could only be prosecuted by way of private prosecution .", "CARDINAL . A.C. \u2019s lawyer requested PERSON to publish an apology rectifying the allegations against him and his reply to them . On CARDINAL DATE the magazine refused to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the magazine published an article written by the applicant ( but signed GPE ) entitled \u201c The Party of Fear \u201d . It was available on the magazine \u2019s website until DATE . Its main thrust was that highsociety former informants opposed amendments to vetting legislation introduced in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) for fear that their past would come to light . It referred to ORG as a former informant and contained his photo as rector of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , a body composed mainly of media representatives designated to observe whether journalists followed the applicable rules of professional ethics , sent a letter to the applicant . It criticised the articles in so far as they alleged ORG \u2019s involvement with the communist secret services , saying that the arguments presented by the applicant in the articles were not sufficiently convincing . It also criticised the applicant for her failure to refer to the precise sources of her allegations . It further referred to a previous public plea to the media requesting them to deal with allegations of collaboration with the communist secret services with the utmost diligence , seriousness and caution , so as not to cause detriment to anyone and to avoid a sensationalist approach to a very serious issue . It recommended that only thoughtful discussion should be held about themes of such importance as collaboration with the secret services and the manner in which vetting legislation should be applied , commensurate with the gravity of the issues involved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same magazine published an article \u201c New Documents about the Chancellor \u2013 Informant \u201d . It was available on the magazine \u2019s website until DATE . Its thrust was also that ORG was a former informant . The article did not quote its sources and merely referred generally to unspecified documents . A photo of ORG was again published alongside it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG brought a private bill of indictment against the applicant and PERSON , the editor - in - chief of the magazine at that time . It was argued that they had libelled him by publishing the articles and by disseminating untrue information alleging secret and conscious collaboration with the communist secret services . It was submitted that this publication could discredit him in the eyes of the public and result in him losing the confidence necessary to perform his duties as a public university rector , a criminal offence punishable under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and PERSON , but were subsequently stayed in DATE to obtain information about the result of the vetting process ( procedura lustracyjna ) in respect of GPE which was pending at the time .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE in the latter proceedings , ORG held , referring to documents stored by the ORG , that ORG had made a true vetting statement to the effect that he had not been an informant for the communist secret services . The court established that he had been registered as such , but without his consent or knowledge . It further noted that on DATE A.C. had obtained the security certificate issued by ORG guaranteeing him access to classified information . He had therefore already been positively vetted for integrity by the authorities of a democratic ORG prior to the judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the first - instance judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal proceedings against the applicant were resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the applicant and editor were guilty of libel under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court found that the plaintiff had been working at ORG since DATE . He had been questioned by the communist secret police on several occasions before DATE , when the communist system in GPE had collapsed .", "The applicant had contacted him , apparently by telephone , prior to publication of the first article of DATE claiming to know that he had been an informant . She had neither informed him about any ORG documents on which she would be basing her allegations nor sought to meet him in person .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated before the court that she had written the articles motivated by the public interest . ORG was a well - known personality and society should be made aware of persons in positions of responsibility who were former informants for the NORP secret police .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that while before it the applicant had referred to ORG documents , neither the documents she had submitted originating from these files nor the full file obtained by the court had supported the conclusion that ORG had been an informant . Certain documents did not refer to him at all , while others did not indicate that he had been an informant . He had never declared willingness to become one . The court referred to a document in the ORG \u2019s files which noted his reluctance to be involved with the services when urged by them to turn into an informant . In these files he was only referred to as being on the staff of the university in DATE . They also demonstrated that he had been questioned by the communist services after coming back to GPE following a scholarship in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court concluded that the documents it had before it in evidence were manifestly insufficient to hold that the plaintiff had been an informant .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the documents available , the thesis advanced by the applicant was not only devoid of factual basis , but also incompatible with her obligation to show proper journalistic diligence . She had only obtained access to the full set of ORG files concerning ORG after her first article had been published . She had only received a decision from the director of the ORG allowing her to access the documents on DATE , after the article had been published and created a considerable media stir . She had failed to contact PERSON prior to the publication to try to check the veracity of the information , apart from her telephone call to him whereby she had only informed him that she would be publishing the article .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the applicant had failed to show the journalistic diligence required of her under section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . The impugned articles contained unreliable information , which she had assessed in a superficial manner . Being an informant for the communist secret police was perceived in society in an extremely negative manner . It was therefore not open to doubt that allegations made by the applicant could stigmatise GPE and undermine public confidence in his capacity to hold office within the meaning of LAW . The mere fact that the court had gathered more material relevant to establishing the facts concerning ORG past than the applicant had had at her disposal prior to the publication of the impugned articles demonstrated that she had formulated her allegations without a sound factual basis . In the light of that material , it had to be concluded that the statements made in the article were untrue , or at least unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The court referred to the ORG \u2019s case - law on LAW on freedom of the press . It noted that that freedom carried duties and responsibilities on the part of journalists . It was limited by the criterion of truthfulness on the one hand , and the necessity to protect important values such as dignity , reputation , honour and the private life of individuals on the other . In the present case , the applicant had not had sufficient knowledge at her disposal to support the factual thesis she had advanced in the articles . She had therefore overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism , defamed the plaintiff and thereby committed a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . The court imposed fines on the applicant and her co - defendant , the magazine \u2019s editor - in - chief . It determined the amount of the applicant \u2019s fine at MONEY ( PLN - approximately CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) and ordered her to pay LAW ( CARDINAL ORG ) to charity . The court observed that the amount of the fine had been determined with regard to the degree of the applicant \u2019s guilt . The publication of the articles had been her idea and she had written them . However , the fine imposed on her was lower than that imposed on the editor , regard being had to the fact that her income was lower than his . The court further noted that the plaintiff had demanded that a custodial sentence be imposed on the applicant . However , the court was of the view that a non - custodial sentence was sufficient in the circumstances , commensurate with the gravity of the offence . It further ordered that the judgment be made public , having regard to a request submitted by the plaintiff and LAW , which obliged the court to allow such requests in cases involving convictions based on LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her co - accused appealed , raising many procedural arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment , essentially sharing the findings and views of the first - instance court . The GPE appeals were considered by the court to be unfounded . The court ordered the applicant to pay ORG MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in costs to ORG . It further ordered her and her coaccused to pay jointly the plaintiff \u2019s costs before the appellate court , amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
