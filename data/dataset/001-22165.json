He was represented before ORG by Professor M.W.C. PERSON of ORG of ORG , who also works as a fiscal advisor in GPE", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "DATE , the applicant \u2019s employer provided him with a company car . The respective catalogue prices of the CARDINAL cars concerned were CARDINAL Netherlands Guilders ( \u201c NLG \u201d ) ( car used until DATE ) , ORG . CARDINAL ( car used as from DATE ) and ORG . CARDINAL ( car used as from DATE ) . The applicant used his company car DATE a week for transport from his home to his office . The distance between both places was QUANTITY . The applicant further used this car for private purposes . The distances travelled for private purposes in DATE exceeded QUANTITY .", "On DATE , ORG issued the applicant \u2019s income tax assessment ( aanslag inkomstenbelasting ) for DATE . In the determination of the applicant \u2019s taxable income for DATE , ORG had added \u2013 pursuant to the DATE LAW ( Wet op de Inkomstenbelasting ; hereinafter \u201c FAC \u201d ) as amended by LAW DATE \u2013 an amount of ORG . CARDINAL ( PERCENT of the catalogue price of the applicant \u2019s company car in DATE ) to the applicant \u2019s taxable income .", "In the applicant \u2019s income tax assessment for DATE of DATE , the assessment for DATE of CARDINAL DATE and the assessment for DATE of CARDINAL DATE \u2013 on the same grounds as in the assessment of CARDINAL DATE PERCENT of the catalogue value of the company car provided to the applicant in DATE , i.e. NLG . CARDINAL , ORG . CARDINAL and ORG . CARDINAL respectively , was added to his taxable income .", "The applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the ORG against the income tax assessments for DATE . He complained that the PERCENT increase of his taxable income instead of PERCENT was contrary to the prohibition on discrimination under LAW , in that employees having a company car who drive CARDINAL per year for private purposes and who live QUANTITY from their place of work - like himself - must add a further PERCENT ( PERCENT instead of PERCENT ) to their taxable income , whereas employees with a company car in identical circumstances , apart from the fact that they drive QUANTITY per year for private purposes , do not have to add PERCENT of the car \u2019s catalogue value to their taxable income , but are in fact fully exempted from any addition to their taxable income . He requested that PERCENT of his company car \u2019s value be deducted from his taxable income for DATE .", "In a judgment of DATE in a similar case to the applicant \u2019s , the \u2018 s - ORG ( Gerechtshof ) found in favour of the taxpayer . It held that the reasons stated by the legislator for creating the difference in treatment at issue could not be regarded as constituting an objective and reasonable justification . Consequently , it quashed ORG challenged decision , reduced the determination of that taxpayer \u2019s taxable income and ordered ORG to reimburse the appellant \u2019s legal costs , including court fees . The ORG Secretary of ORG ( Staatssecretaris PERSON ) filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) against this judgment of DATE .", "ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objections against the income tax assessment for DATE on DATE . ORG did , however , mention in his decision that proceedings were pending before ORG in relation to the complaint made by the applicant . The decision further stated that the applicant \u2019s tax assessment for DATE would be reduced ex officio if the final judicial decision on the matter would warrant such a course of action .", "ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objections against the income tax assessment for DATE on DATE . In this decision , ORG mentioned that , in its judgment of DATE , ORG had made a remark to the effect that , possibly , there was prohibited unequal treatment of persons having company cars , living more than QUANTITY from their place of work and who used their company car for , on the one hand , QUANTITY a year for private purposes and , on the other hand , QUANTITY for private purposes .", "ORG had , however , not determined this question in that judgment . The applicant was further informed that proceedings on this question were ongoing in which the same complaints as those made by the applicant had been raised . The applicant was finally informed that , in order to prevent numerous proceedings concerning the same matter , his income tax assessment for DATE would be reduced ex officio if the final decision by ORG would warrant this . The applicant \u2019s attention was , however , drawn to the fact that this would only take place when , at the appropriate moment , the applicant would make a request to this effect .", "The applicant \u2019s objection against the income tax assessment for DATE was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "Although an appeal against a rejection of an objection against a tax assessment lies with ORG , the applicant decided , on the basis of the ORG Secretary \u2019s decision of DATE , not to file an appeal against the rejection of his objections . For the same reason , he also decided not to file an objection against his income tax assessment for DATE .", "In its judgment of DATE in the other identical case ( reported in GPE Fiscal Law Reports [ FAC in FAC \u201d \u2013 \u201c FAC \u201d ) no . CARDINAL , ORG ruled that the tax payers concerned was treated unequally without justification . However , it upheld ORG decision of DATE . Consequently , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE . with the exception of the costs order against ORG . ORG further ordered the ORG Secretary to reimburse the adversary party \u2019s legal costs in the cassation proceedings . This judgment , insofar as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In objecting to the application of this so - called increased fixed amount for car costs ( verhoogde autokostenforfait ) , the < applicant > has argued before ORG that the legislator unjustly subjects him to different treatment from those taxpayers to whom LAW , fourth paragraph , is not applied , as those taxpayers , unlike the < applicant > , use their company car for private purposes for a distance of QUANTITY per year > but , like the < applicant > , live CARDINAL kms from their place of work and drive with their ORG car to and from work . ...", "CARDINAL . In answering the question whether it concerns an inequality in treatment prohibited by these Treaties [ including LAW in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL ] , it must be stated at the outset that they do not prohibit every inequality in treatment of equivalent cases . The legislator has a certain margin of appreciation in answering the question whether cases , for the purposes of the application of these Treaties , are to considered as equivalent and , if so , whether there is an objective and reasonable justification for nevertheless regulating those cases in a different manner .", "CARDINAL . The difference in treatment challenged by the < applicant > has been created by LAW DATE ... The aim of this LAW was to make a contribution to both reducing commuter traffic as such ( limitation of mobility ) and reducing the use of cars for commuting purposes ( limitation of car mobility ) . ...", "CARDINAL . It thus follows from the < legislative > history of the creation of the < PERCENT > addition ... that the legislator , as a basic premise , no longer wished to make a link between the strictly private use of the car and its use for commuting purposes . The legislator did not therefore intend to tax \u2013 through the introduction of an increased percentage of the fixed amount for car costs ( autokostenforfait ) \u2013 the higher sum of income considered as being derived from employment as an extra advantage , made dependent on the travel distance , on account of private use .", "CARDINAL . This entails that the addition of PERCENT of the catalogue price of the < company > car , though in form an increase of the fixed amount for car costs , in nature has the character of an independent addition for the cases where tax payers habitually travel DATE a week over a CARDINAL - way distance of QUANTITY between their home and their work place using for this a car placed at their disposal for work purposes . ORG fails to see that , for the application of that independent addition , it is of any relevance whether or not the car , apart from commuter travel , has not or only to a limited extent been used for private purposes .", "CARDINAL . The considerations set out in CARDINAL . to CARDINAL . lead to the conclusion that the legislator , by not prescribing the addition of PERCENT of the catalogue price in cases where there is no or only a limited private use of the < company > car , has given preferential treatment to a limited group within a category of equivalent cases - in short : commuter travel CARDINAL kms - , and has thus treated equivalent cases unequally .", "CARDINAL . Members of ORG ( PERSON ) have shown doubts as to the legitimacy of that unequal treatment . It has been stated in justification on the ORG side that , from the point of view of transport arranged by the employer , the employees privileged by the proposed regulation are on a par with employees who , either collectively or not , are transported by their employer in minibuses and the like . That contention is , however , in all reasonability untenable . Within the group of employees whose transport is arranged by the employer , those disposing of a < company > car are in a completely different situation from those who are , either collectively or not , transported by the employer in minibuses and the like . As of old , the legislator itself has not viewed these cases as equivalents . It has long since made a difference within the relevant group of employees by including employees disposing of a < company > car as being liable to income tax for the private use of such a car . The form chosen for this , the fixed amount for car costs , prompted an addition of a fixed amount for private use < of a company car > to the taxable income in all cases where an employer has made a car available , unless the tax payer can convincingly prove that , on an DATE basis , the car has been used for private purposes for less than ( at present ) QUANTITY . In addition , the \u201c employer \u2019s car \u201d in the latter situation is further treated differently from other transport arranged by the employer , as in that situation the value of the real private use is taxed . Also , given this long standing difference , the argument made in an earlier phase of the examination of the draft Act , that the distinction of the employees with a < company > car runs up against practical difficulties , is defective .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , ORG has not found outside this legislative history any grounds of a fiscal or non - fiscal nature that can justify the unequal treatment at issue .", "CARDINAL . Further , it can not be said that the unequal treatment results in a quantitatively unimportant advantage as , with the addition of PERCENT of the catalogue price of a < company > car , quickly one finds that an increase in income of ORG . CARDINAL to ORG . CARDINAL is involved .", "CARDINAL . Even taking into consideration the margin of appreciation of the legislator , the above also leads to the conclusion that the legislator can not in all reasonability have held that it concerns here unequal cases , or that there is a reasonable and objective justification for the unequal treatment of those cases . The < cassation > complaints I and II , insofar as they are based on a different opinion , fail .", "CARDINAL . The < cassation > complaint I ... is however successful insofar it points out that not to apply the rule contained in LAW CARDINAL of the ORG would result in an equally unjustifiable inequality in treatment , namely in respect of employees who habitually commute , involving a CARDINAL - way travel distance of QUANTITY , with their own car or with public transportation without having a public - transport - declaration [ for fiscal deduction purposes ] ( openbaar vervoerverklaring ) . This could only be remedied by the non - application of the entire < regulation on the > \u201c capping < of the tax allowance for commuters > \u201d ( \u201c aftopping \u201d ) . ORG considers for the time being that such a consequence of the inequality found is disproportionate . It is for legislator to remove the inequality found . ORG assumes that the PERSON announced in the < cassation > complaint III will be presented < to Parliament>. \u201d", "In a further judgment given on DATE in yet another case concerning the same subject matter , ORG rejected the argument that , on the basis of its judgment of DATE , an increase of PERCENT instead of PERCENT should not be imposed . It held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... In cassation , the appellant argues .... that the fiscal judge should now refrain from applying the regulation at issue , because the legislator has failed to introduce in a timely manner a PERSON in order to remove the inequality which has been found .", "CARDINAL . As to this argument , the following applies .", "ORG . In consideration CARDINAL of its judgment of DATE , ORG held that it was for the legislator to remove the inequality found and that it assumed that to this end the ORG Secretary < of ORG > would submit < to ORG > the PERSON announced in the ORG Secretary \u2019s cassation memorial .", "In its advice of CARDINAL DATE on draft legislation on amendments to forthcoming statutory fiscal regulations ... ORG ( PERSON ) noted that this PERSON did not contain a regulation designed to remove the above inequality under the law , and advised that such a regulation be included already in this PERSON . In the further report ( ... ) , the Government replied as follows :", "\u201c ORG > advises , with reference to ORG judgment of DATE ... , as to the application of the ... increased fixed amount for car costs to repair the inequality found in respect of the fixed amount for car costs already < in this PERSON ... this inequality will be repaired by a change of legislation . This change is however connected to the elaboration of the announcement in LAW ( NORP ) to replace the fixed amount nature ( forfaitaire karakter ) of the car ORG fiction ( autokostenfictie ) by an approach that more befits the factual private use of the company car . The manner in which this reparation is to take place is further dependent on the new modelling of the fiscal treatment of company cars in the framework of legislation on tax reforms for DATE ( belastingherziening CARDINALe eeuw ) . In this it will also be considered whether the above - intended reparation , if required , can already occur as of DATE in anticipation of the announced fiscal reform for DATE . \u201d", "The Government have subsequently .... stated the following :", "\u201c In LAW < this point made by > ORG is resolved . It has been considered whether it was feasible to advance < this solution > without great problems . To advance < this regulation > would , in the light of the proposed fiscal reform for DATE lead to an unbalanced < global > package . In the Fiscal Plan CARDINAL it was not possible to incorporate the compensation \u2013 connected with < this solution > \u2013 in the sphere of tariffs and the further retrenchments from the fiscal reform for DATE . In addition , justice would no longer be done to the policy connection with other regulations on fiscal reform ( commuter travel expenses and labour reduction ) . In the fiscal reforms for DATE , on the other hand , the budgetary and revenuepolitical consequences of the < solution > are incorporated in the total package of measures .", "Apart from this , a reparation within the current system as an extra intermediate step to the fiscal reform leads to confusion for taxpayers and the fiscal executive , and to extra administrative charges . Taxpayers and the fiscal executive would thus be confronted with an adapted system that will change totally again within DATE . To achieve a balance , we have therefore opted for resolving the inequality pointed out < by ORG > as to the < fixed amount for car costs > in the Bill on Fiscal Reform DATE . In taking up this option , the fact that this PERSON has already been submitted to ORG of ORG also plays a role . \u201d", "In the PERSON mentioned here by the Government , that has been submitted on DATE to ORG and which PERSON has been adopted in the meantime ( LAW DATE on the Determination of LAW DATE ( Fiscal Reform DATE ) , ORG ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , the inequality referred to above has in fact been removed .", "DATE . It appears from the above that the legislator has opted to remove the inequality in the framework of a general fiscal reform in connection with other regulations that , in the legislator \u2019s opinion , also required revision ... in order to establish in that way a coherent overall < system>.", "ORG is of the opinion that there are insufficient grounds for finding that the legislator could not reasonably have taken this decision , although the removal of the inequality therefore took longer than was desirable . In this finding , ORG takes into consideration , apart from the above circumstances and the duration of the delay , that apparently initially a totally different regulation was considered , that a change in legislation could possibly have resulted in an increase of fiscal charges for certain groups , and that it is understandable that the legislator did not wish to alter the regulation twice within a short space of time . These considerations lead to the conclusion that ORG has correctly refrained from not applying LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , it must be noted that the appellant in the present case , as regards the income tax imposition for DATE , can not successfully argue that this statutory provision should not be applied in his case because , in any event , the legislation was not obliged to remove the instant inequality found with retroactive effect for DATE . \u201d", "On DATE , ORG issued the applicant \u2019s income tax return assessment ( voorlopige teruggaaf inkomstenbelasting ) for DATE . Like in the previous assessment , PERCENT of the catalogue value of the his company car was added to his taxable income .", "The applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the ORG against the income tax return assessment for DATE . Relying on ORG judgment of DATE , he complained that LAW ITA was contrary to the prohibition on discrimination insofar as it resulted an increase of PERCENT . He submitted that , in its judgment of DATE , ORG had refrained from action , in the form of a reduction of the income tax assessment , on the assumption that a new LAW would be submitted to ORG in the near future . As this PERSON had not yet been presented to ORG , the applicant considered that the need for judicial action had now arisen .", "ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection on DATE . ORG noted that that ORG , although it had found that the application of LAW of the DATE LAW was contrary to the principle of equal treatment , had declined to render this provision inoperative as this would have entailed an equally unjustifiable inequality , with disproportionate consequences . ORG further noted that ORG had concluded that it was for the legislator to remove the unequal treatment . ORG did not accept the applicant \u2019s argument that the legislator had failed to act with due diligence in drawing up new legislation .", "The applicant filed an appeal with ORG . He did not avail himself of the possibility to claim a reimbursement of his legal costs by the other party . By judgment of DATE and referring to ORG findings in its judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded .", "Although it was open to the applicant to file an appeal in cassation with ORG , he did not avail himself of this possibility , considering that this would not have had any prospects of success .", "Pursuant to LAW ( Wet op de Inkomstenbelasting ) , employees disposing of a company car provided by their employer must add a fixed amount to their taxable income because of the use of such a car for private purposes . The wording of this provision fixes this amount , the so - called fixed amount for car costs ( autokostenforfait ) , at PERCENT of the catalogue price of the car concerned .", "Following the adoption of LAW of DATE amending income tax and salaries tax [ capping of the tax allowance for commuters ] ( PERSON wijziging van de inkomstenbelasting en de loonbelasting [ aftopping reiskostenforfait ] ) , this fixed amount was increased by PERCENT ( i.e. to PERCENT ) in those cases where an employee habitually travels DATE a week between his or her home and work place when the distance of a oneway journey between these CARDINAL places exceeds QUANTITY ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "LAW provides that the rules contained in LAW are not applied where it appears that , on an annual basis , the company car has been used for private purposes for a total distance not exceeding QUANTITY . In that situation no fixed amount for car costs has to be added to the taxable income , but the actual benefit must be added on the basis of a fixed amount per CARDINAL , e.g. QUANTITY at MONEY per kilometre .", "The underlying rationale of the LAW of DATE was of an environmental nature , i.e. to reduce commuter traffic by encouraging employees to live closer to their place of work , as well as to reduce the use of cars for commuter travel by encouraging employees to opt either for public transport or other forms of collective transport arranged by the employer .", "In the original proposal contained in the PERSON , which resulted in LAW of DATE , the existing possibilities for tax deduction of costs for commuting to work and the exemption from taxes of compensation paid by employers in respect of commuting costs were limited to a maximum ( aftopping ) . Costs for commuting to work for distances in excess of QUANTITY were to be considered as \u201c private \u201d and no longer eligible for tax allowances .", "As to the application of the fixed amount for car costs in cases concerning a company car , the commuter traffic in excess of QUANTITY was to be considered as \u201c private \u201c and lead to the application of a higher percentage . This would only apply , however , where a car was also being used for private purposes . If the car would only be strictly used for work purposes , including commuting , the fixed amount for car costs would not come into play .", "As this approach met with the objection that QUANTITY driven by a company car for private purposes could result in the addition to the taxable income of the fixed amount for car costs , the PERSON was amended . The fixed amount for car costs would be applied when a company car was to be used for private purposes involving a distance of QUANTITY or DATE . In the determination of this question , the distance between the home and place of work DATE whether or not it was QUANTITY \u2013 would be irrelevant . If the limit of QUANTITY for private use were exceeded , an addition of PERCENT of the car \u2019s catalogue price would be applied where the commuting to work remained limited to a distance of QUANTITY from the home . For commuting involving a distance between the home and place of work of QUANTITY , a percentage of PERCENT would be applied .", "Although some critical questions were put during the parliamentary debate the system as amended was adopted by LAW DATE .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( BNB no . CARDINAL ) , ORG held that :", "\u201c In the present proceedings , the question has not been raised whether the rules contained in LAW and QUANTITY [ ITA ] entail a prohibited unequal treatment in respect of those case in which a car made available by an employer is used for private purposes for QUANTITY per year . That question must at present , however , remain unresolved , since its answer also requires an investigation of the facts for which there is no scope in cassation proceedings . \u201d", "The rules contained in LAW remained in force until DATE when fiscal reform legislation came into force - LAW DATE . This Act provided that the distance between the home and place of work is no longer relevant in the determination of the addition of the fixed amount for car costs in respect of company cars . Only the distance for private purposes for which the company car is used is relevant . In case this use is less than CARDINAL kms per year , no fixed amount has to be added to the taxable income . For a distance QUANTITY , PERCENT of the car \u2019s catalogue value must be added to the taxable income , for distances QUANTITY , PERCENT , and for distances exceeding QUANTITY , PERCENT . Commuter travel is considered to be work - related .", "LAW ( PERSON ) , provides :", "\" All persons present in the GPE shall be treated in the same way in similar situations .
