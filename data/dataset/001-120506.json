NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

According to the applicant , at the time of the arrest he was with his brother , who was also taken to the police station .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that several police officers , under the leadership of officer NORP , had subjected him to physical ill - treatment and psychological pressure with a view to extracting a confession from him . They had allegedly handcuffed him to a table leg and beat him with rubber truncheons , punching him and kicking him in various parts of his body . The applicant also alleged that the beating had worsened when he had requested a meeting with a lawyer , so he signed a waiver refusing his right to legal assistance \u201c for the time being \u201d . He agreed to plead guilty , allegedly under the threat that if he did not , his brother would be tortured . The applicant referred to the fact that the police had lost the black shirt and black trousers in which he had been arrested ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . According to him , the clothes in question had been left torn and bloodstained , and their loss was to be viewed as evidence in support of his allegation of ill - treatment . He also submitted that a request he had made to be examined by a doctor had been refused .", "CARDINAL . According to the investigation authorities , the applicant had confessed to the murder of his own free will . As to the issue regarding his clothes , it transpired that during his arrest he had been wearing the same clothes as had been worn during TIME of the murder ( a black shirt and black trousers ) . As a result , the police brought him some sportswear to change into which they had retrieved from his home , so that the clothes in which he had been arrested could be sent away for forensic expert examination with a view to establishing whether they contained any evidence linking him to the crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant confessed to the incriminated murder . According to him , he did so when he saw that his brother had been released . His confession stated that he had been having an affair with PERSON since DATE . On DATE he went to see her at her home .

I have been informed of my rights and I understand them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant repeated his confession when he was questioned as a suspect DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a forensic medical expert examined the applicant . The examination report , which was also signed by the applicant , reported that there were no injuries to the applicant \u2019s body and none complained of .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant did not mention the expert report in his submissions to the Court . According to him , following his arrest the police had unsuccessfully attempted to transfer him to ORG no . CARDINAL ( \u201c GPE no . CARDINAL \u201d ) , the administration of which had allegedly refused to accept him on the grounds that he had serious injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a reconstruction of events took place , during which the applicant repeated his confession and explained how he had killed PERSON The reconstruction took place in the presence of CARDINAL attesting witnesses and was video - recorded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant signed another waiver of legal assistance , similar to that of DATE . He also confirmed his earlier statements in full , adding that it had not been his intention to kill Ms NORP and that she had provoked him . The applicant alleged in his submissions to the ORG that he had done so having been promised a meeting with his parents .", "CARDINAL . Some of the documents in the case file ( namely a letter from ORG to the applicant \u2019s mother dated DATE and an information note of the head of the GPE medical unit of DATE ) suggest that the applicant was transferred from the police detention facility to GPE no . CARDINAL on DATE . However , an information note by the ORG governor of DATE addressed \u201c to whom it may concern \u201d suggests that the applicant was held in GPE no . CARDINAL from DATE to DATE . The applicant also submitted that he had been transferred to the GPE on DATE , and that before that , the ORG had twice refused to accept him as a detainee on account of his unspecified injuries .", "CARDINAL . The aforementioned information note of the head of the GPE medical unit stated that the applicant underwent clinical , laboratory and ORG examinations upon his arrival to the GPE on DATE , with no injuries or other health - related concerns having been discovered .

On DATE a lawyer , PERSON , entered into a legal services agreement with the applicant \u2019s parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator rejected PERSON \u2019s request for a meeting with the applicant , on the grounds that the latter had waived his right to legal assistance . The investigator informed the lawyer that he would ask the applicant whether he had changed his mind about having legal representation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant once again waived his right to legal assistance , stating that he refused the services of lawyers , including those of M. The investigator passed this on to PERSON , who complained to ORG and to ORG that the investigator had overstepped his competence and that the applicant \u2019s right to legal assistance had been violated .", "CARDINAL . As alleged by the applicant , on an unspecified date the investigator suggested a lawyer for him who had unsuccessfully solicited a bribe from the applicant \u2019s parents in exchange for having their son declared insane .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had a meeting with his parents and complained to them that he had been ill - treated by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he underwent a forensic psychiatric examination , with a view to establishing whether he could be held criminally liable for his actions . He stated to the experts that he did not remember the murder , but did recall that Ms D. had been rude to him and that they had had a fight . He claimed that he could not remember any further details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant stated that he wished to be represented by PERSON , who was admitted in the proceedings the following day .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant retracted his earlier confessions as having been given under duress , and changed his plea to not guilty . According to his new account of the events of CARDINAL DATE , he had not seen PERSON after she had left under the pretext of the need to buy some bread . Having waited for her in vain for TIME , he had returned home at TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote a letter to PERSON in response to his complaint about the alleged violation of the applicant \u2019s right to legal assistance . The letter stated that on DATE and DATE the investigator had informed the applicant of his right to have legal representation ; however , the applicant had voluntarily waived that right and had signed forms to that effect . As soon as he changed his mind , his request for legal representation was allowed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted on a charge of premeditated murder and committed for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) found the applicant guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The court mainly based its verdict on the applicant \u2019s confession statements made during his initial police questioning . Among the witnesses examined by the court was PERSON . , who had known the victim for DATE before her death . In giving evidence , PERSON . stated that he had met up with her on DATE and they had had sexual intercourse after she had left the applicant under the pretext that she was going to buy some bread . As to the applicant \u2019s allegation of ill - treatment , the court heard evidence from several police officers who denied any coercion . It also referred to the forensic medical examination report of DATE , which stated that no injuries to the applicant \u2019s body had been discovered or complained of . Lastly , the court noted that the applicant had not raised that complaint even after he had started to be legally represented .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed , submitting that the verdict had been based solely on the applicant \u2019s confessions given under duress and in the absence of a lawyer . The appeal also stated that the trial court had failed to give any consideration to the fact that the witness ORG . had been detained for DATE and had also been questioned as a suspect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed the above judgment and remitted the case to the same first - instance court for a fresh examination on the basis that CARDINAL of the judges had started a hearing in a different case while the panel had been supposed to be in the deliberations room preparing its verdict in respect of the applicant . Accordingly , the secrecy of the deliberations had been breached . The appellate court also held that the applicant \u2019s allegation of ill - treatment had not been duly investigated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instructed ORG ( \u201c ORG Office \u201d ) to investigate the applicant \u2019s allegation of illtreatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a ruling refusing to open a criminal case against the investigator and the CARDINAL police officers involved in the applicant \u2019s detention and questioning for lack of corpus delicti in their actions . The prosecutor relied , in particular , on the statements of the officers in question and on the applicant \u2019s forensic medical examination of DATE . The ruling also stated that the applicant \u2019s initial statements had contained such factual details that could only be known to him and could not have possibly been dictated to him by the investigator . Lastly , the prosecutor noted that the applicant had not raised any complaints of ill - treatment even after having been legally represented . Accordingly , his later complaints in that regard were considered as being a part of his attempts to escape liability .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother requested ORG to return the applicant \u2019s clothes seized on DATE of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered another judgment in which it again found the applicant guilty of premeditated murder , but reduced the sentence to DATE . It relied on the applicant \u2019s confession , having found that it had been given in full freedom because , firstly , there were written waivers by the applicant of his right to legal assistance , and , secondly , because his allegation of ill - treatment was considered to be unsubstantiated . The court noted that the applicant had not complained of any ill - treatment by the police during the pre - trial investigation . It dismissed as untruthful the statement of the applicant \u2019s acquaintance , who when questioned as a witness alleged having seen the applicant at the police station in TIME on DATE wearing torn and blood - stained sportswear . The court also relied on the statements of other witnesses who , in particular , had seen the applicant waiting for Ms NORP on the evening on DATE . Furthermore , the court relied on the findings of a forensic cytological expert examination , which suggested that the antigens found under his nails could have belonged to the victim . ORG referred to the following circumstances warranting a reduction of the applicant \u2019s sentence : the fact that he had pleaded guilty , was remorseful and had actively assisted the police in the initial stages of the investigation , and the fact that he had a minor child and had been in gainful employment before his detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the above judgment , reiterating his earlier arguments and also contending that criminal procedure law provided that legal representation should have been afforded to him as from his very first questioning by the police , as he was LANGUAGE - speaking and did not have a good command of NORP . In support of the allegation of police illtreatment , he pointed out that GPE no . CARDINAL had refused to accept him as a detainee several times on account of his injuries . The applicant also alleged that the police had concealed the fact that they had withheld the clothes in which he had been arrested and questioned and which bore traces of his ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s mother , in reply to her request of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , that there was no information in the investigation file about any clothes having being seized and that no such clothes were among the material evidence in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG further mitigated the applicant \u2019s sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , having taken into account the provocative behaviour of the victim and the fact that the applicant had a minor child to take care of . The appellate court ruled so in partially allowing the applicant \u2019s appeal . At the same time , it regarded his allegations of ill - treatment in police custody and of coercion into self - incrimination as unsubstantiated . It held that no facts in support of that allegation had been established and that there was no documentary evidence to prove that the applicant had sustained any injuries . Lastly , the court noted that the applicant had never raised the issue of his insufficient command of NORP during the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal as unsubstantiated , having found that the grievances submitted therein had already been duly examined by the lower - level courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother complained to ORG that her son had been ill - treated . She also maintained that he had been convicted of a crime which he had not committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on the instruction of the prosecutor , analysed the video - recording of the applicant \u2019s police questioning and the reconstruction of events of CARDINAL and DATE respectively , with a view to establishing whether the applicant could be regarded as having been subjected to psychological pressure . The forensic psychologist concluded that no such pressure had been put on the applicant , who had been making his statements freely . The applicant \u2019s behaviour and way of speaking suggested that his self - incriminating statements had been voluntary and truthful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision refusing to open a criminal case in respect of the loss of the applicant \u2019s clothes . It was established that the police had indeed withheld the clothes in which he had been arrested , as they had been required for a forensic examination . The loss of the clothes , although having caused some pecuniary damage to the applicant , could not be regarded as proof that he had been ill - treated . Furthermore , the pecuniary damage was not so considerable as to warrant a criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy ORG delivered a report summarising the findings of the investigation into the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment and the loss of his clothes , which had been verified and dismissed as inaccurate . The prosecutor referred , in particular , to the forensic medical examination of DATE which found no injuries to the applicant \u2019s body , and the forensic psychological examination of CARDINAL DATE which gave no indication that any psychological pressure had been put on him . The applicant \u2019s submissions that he had been refused admission to the GPE on CARDINAL occasions had been verified and dismissed as untrue . The prosecutor consulted the relevant documentation of the GPE and questioned its medical staff , who reported that the applicant had arrived there on DATE and had undergone extensive medical examinations the same day ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE stating that the loss of the applicant \u2019s clothes by the police was not proof that a criminal offence had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decisions of the prosecutor and first - instance court and remitted the case for additional investigation . As noted in its ruling , the applicant alleged that the loss of the clothes in question had caused damage to him far more serious than the money they cost . Namely , he argued that , because of this loss , he was not able to prove that he had suffered ill - treatment in the hands of the police . This argument had not however been duly examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued another decision refusing to institute a criminal investigation into the applicant \u2019s complaints , having found them unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor informed the applicant and his relatives , on several occasions , in reply to their repeated complaints about his alleged ill - treatment , that they could challenge the decision of CARDINAL DATE before the higher - level prosecution authorities or the courts . It appears that no further complaints were lodged .", "CARDINAL .
