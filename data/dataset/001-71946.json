POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company filed a claim against the Best - Sat company in the ORG ( FAC ) . The value of the claim was ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The claim resulted from ORG refusal to pay the applicant company \u2019s invoice issued on DATE for the construction of a TV cable network , in accordance with the contract concluded between the parties . The applicant company requested that its claim be considered in a summary procedure ( post\u0119powanie nakazowe ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the case should be considered in the ordinary procedure as it did not fulfil the legal conditions for the summary procedure . On DATE the applicant company filed with the ORG an interlocutory appeal ( za\u017calenie ) against the decision of DATE . Subsequently , the court ordered the applicant company to pay a court fee of ORG for the consideration of its interlocutory appeal . On DATE the applicant filed with the ORG an application for an exemption from that fee . However , on DATE ORG dismissed that application . The applicant filed another , apparently unsuccessful , interlocutory appeal against the decision of DATE , claiming that the company was on the brink of insolvency as a result of its enforceable claims not having been satisfied by the Best - Sat company .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified later date , the case was transmitted to the Bielsko - Bia\u0142a Regional Court ( S\u0105d ORG ) in order to be considered in the ordinary proceedings . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant company to pay a court fee of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL for lodging its claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company filed with the ORG an application for an exemption from the fee , pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . It stated that the amount of the fee was considerably beyond its means . It also submitted that , for DATE , it had made net profits of CARDINAL , while the company \u2019s assets amounted to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , but consisted mostly of claims to be satisfied .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company stressed that it had no possibility to dispose of its assets promptly in order to secure funds to pay the court fee and , even if that were possible , it would lead to the winding up of the company . It further argued that the lack of funds to pay the court fee did not result from any fault in its activities or from a negligent failure to secure funds for the litigation . It also maintained that its claim resulted from work done over DATE which had dominated the activities of the company . Consequently , it did not have other possibilities to secure sufficient funds from other contracts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant company to produce a number of documents concerning its financial situation . The relevant documents were submitted to the court as enclosures to a letter of DATE . In the same letter the applicant supplemented its application for exemption from the court fees . It stated that it had CARDINAL enforceable claims , including CARDINAL against ORG which were the subject of the pending litigation . The third claim , although enforceable as of DATE , had not been satisfied . The applicant company stated that its fixed assets of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL were necessary to continue the running of its business and , if disposed of , the company would have to be wound up . The plaintiff also submitted that in DATE it had made net profits of ORG , which were used to set off the losses made in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the application . The court gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c At the request of the court , the plaintiff has submitted its balance sheets as of DATE and of CARDINAL DATE , as well as a bank statement regarding its accounts as of CARDINAL DATE . In the court \u2019s view the above documents prove unequivocally that the plaintiff makes profits from its business , as evidenced by the balance on its bank accounts for the period DATE . It should also be pointed out that the plaintiff has gross profits ( przych\u00f3d ) from its business activity estimated at PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , including gross profits from the sale of goods and materials in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "Furthermore , according to the balance sheet of DATE , the plaintiff company has significant fixed assets ( maj\u0105tek trwa\u0142y ) in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , and current assets ( maj\u0105tek obrotowy ) in the amount of ORG .", "The examination of the above documents leads to the conclusion that the plaintiff can afford to pay the court fees because it has sufficient funds .", "It should also be pointed out that , in case of a lack of such funds , the plaintiff could obtain them by means of ORG surcharges ( dop\u0142aty ) since it is a limited liability company .", "All the other expenses of the plaintiff should be treated by it on equal terms with the expenses which are necessary to pursue its claims ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company filed an interlocutory appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE with ORG . It submitted that ORG had made a mistake in calculating the amounts of fixed and current assets because the figures relied on were from DATE , but the value of the assets had decreased since then . As of CARDINAL DATE the amount of fixed and current assets was estimated at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and ORG respectively . The applicant company argued that the combined value of all its assets only slightly exceeded the amount of the court fee , and that , if the latter had to be paid in that amount , the company would be forced to wind up .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company further pointed out that the fixed assets consisted of office equipment which was necessary to run the business , whereas its current assets consisted mostly of reserves of materials necessary to provide services to clients and claims which were the subject of separate litigation . Thus , even assuming that the value of current assets exceeded the amount of the court fee , it could not be presumed that the former could be disposed of in order to provide the funds necessary to pay that fee .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company also contested ORG view that all expenses should be treated equally , and pointed out that any surplus would be used to pay taxes since failure to do so could result in prosecution . Finally , the applicant observed that the unpaid invoice which gave rise to the present claim related to work done by the applicant company over a period of DATE , which had dominated the applicant \u2019s business during that period . That was , to a large extent , the reason why the applicant company had been unable to secure funds for possible litigation expenses . Lastly , the applicant company , in principle , agreed with ORG view as to the possibility of obtaining additional funds by means of ORG surcharges . However , relying on section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , it stressed that a legal person was entitled to exemption from court fees if it proved that it did not have sufficient funds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as follows :", "\u201c According to the plaintiff \u2019s documents , its financial situation deteriorated only in DATE . However , it emerges from the documents produced in support of the statement of claim that the plaintiff \u2019s claim results from work done DATE , since the notice to pay for that work is dated DATE . From that it unequivocally follows that the plaintiff could have secured the funds necessary for the pursuance of its claims prior to DATE when its financial situation deteriorated , and when , as it transpires from its balance sheets , its assets and gross profits from the sale of goods and materials had been at the level which had been referred to in the contested decision .", "ORG also does not subscribe to the plaintiff \u2019s view that , if at the current moment the plaintiff does not have sufficient funds to pay the court fee , then it can successfully request to be exempted ... under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .", "As follows from the established case - law of ORG , and also the case - law of ORG , the possibilities of paying the court fees by a legal person should be assessed in the larger context not only of the funds currently held but also those that could possibly have been secured . When the plaintiff holds a current bank account , where its turnover is recorded , and that turnover still in DATE was of significant volume , then there are no reasons to assume that the plaintiff could not take out the necessary loan in order to obtain the funds needed to pursue claims of the very significant value of ORG . Obviously , interest will be charged on such a loan , but there are no grounds to hold that the cost of such a loan should be borne by the taxpayers , which would happen if exemption from court fees was granted ...", "ORG also fully shares ORG argument that , since the plaintiff is a limited liability company , the obligation of the partners to make appropriate surcharges in order to secure funds to cover expenses related to the assertion of claims should be taken into consideration ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant company did not pay the required court fee . On an unspecified later date , the Bielsko - Bia\u0142a Regional Court ordered that the applicant company \u2019s statement of claim be returned to it , which meant that its claim was of no legal effect .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant company \u2019s tax return for DATE , in DATE it made net profits of ORG MONEY .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law every plaintiff is obliged to pay a court fee at the time of lodging a statement of claim with a court . As the case proceeds , either party is obliged to pay further court fees at the time of lodging any appeal , unless granted exemption from such fees .", "Court fees are based on a percentage ( if a fee is due for lodging a claim or an appeal ) or a fraction ( if a fee is due for lodging an interlocutory appeal ) of the value of the claim in question . The court fees incurred by either party can , depending on the outcome of the litigation , be finally repaid by the losing party ( who , in principle , is ordered to pay all the costs of litigation in a final judgment ) .", "CARDINAL . There are , however , categories of litigants who are exempted from court fees by virtue of statutory provisions . Some of those categories are listed in LAW . That provision , in the version applicable at the relevant time , exempted from court fees a party lodging a paternity action , a party seeking maintenance , a prosecutor , a court - appointed guardian and \u201c any party exempted from court fees by the competent court \u201d ( that is to say , a party who had been granted an exemption under LAW , cited below ) .", "CARDINAL .
