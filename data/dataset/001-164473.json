At TIME the detectives examined CARDINAL ORG notes provided by PERSON which they had marked with special luminescent fluid ( lumiphore ) and which PERSON then put in his pocket . This action was documented in a record of the application of special chemical substances ( PERSON \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0445\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432 ) and was signed by the participants and CARDINAL attesting witnesses . According to later submissions by some of those present , PERSON also had a dictaphone attached to his clothing .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE PERSON entered the applicant \u2019s office and emerged TIME , indicating to the detectives and prosecutor PERSON that he had given the banknotes to the applicant , whereupon they also entered the applicant \u2019s office . According to the crime scene inspection report ( PERSON \u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f ) drawn up by the prosecutor , between TIME and TIME the prosecutor and police officers conducted a search of the applicant \u2019s office . They recorded that during the search the applicant was asked by the police officers whether he had received any money . He replied in the negative . The police officers then checked the applicant \u2019s hands with a special device and found traces of lumiphore on his right hand . They looked in an open safe situated near the applicant \u2019s desk and found the CARDINAL marked banknotes inside . It was also noted in the report that the search had been audio - recorded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested that DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with soliciting and receiving a bribe .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was dismissed from his post of probation officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Dhzankoy District Court ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) examined the applicant \u2019s case and referred it to ORG for further investigation . The court ordered that during the further investigation the banknotes which had been used for the bribe should be located and checked for the applicant \u2019s fingerprints , and that the audio - recording of the bribe - taking , and documents proving that that operation had been lawful must be produced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) quashed the ruling of DATE , finding that the requirements laid down by the first - instance court were irrelevant or unnecessary . It observed in particular that the banknotes had been treated with chemicals and examined by forensic experts , that the probability of finding fingerprints on them was therefore low and that it was for this reason that the corresponding examination had not been conducted . The court also noted that there was no evidence either in the case - file or the bill of indictment that an audio - recording had been made , and the first - instance court judge had failed to indicate on what basis he had concluded that such an audio - recording of the bribe handover had in fact been made .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG acquitted the applicant . The court noted that the applicant denied the accusations , claiming that after the postponement of the hearings in the case of PERSON , the latter had approached him on several occasions to ask about the case . On CARDINAL DATE PERSON had come to his office , they had shaken hands and PERSON had started asking him again about his probation . After PERSON had left the office , the police officers had come in and had found MONEY in his safe . The applicant claimed that he knew nothing about the money and had never solicited or taken any bribe from PERSON argued that PERSON could have put the money in his safe without his knowledge and that the traces of lumiphore on his hand could have been caused by shaking hands with PERSON The court also examined the evidence presented by the police and found that the operation had been conducted in breach of criminal procedure . It held , in particular , that the operation had been instigated on the basis of unverified allegations made by PERSON and without an order to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant , and also that certain investigative techniques ( special chemicals and audio - recording ) had been used without an operational file having been opened , contrary to section CARDINAL of the Search and Seizure Activities Act . The court further noted that the prosecution had lost the audio - recording of the conversation between PERSON and the applicant , which constituted an important item of evidence that could have confirmed or refuted PERSON \u2019s allegations that the applicant had extorted money from him . Although the prosecutor denied the use of audio - recording during the operation , PERSON and CARDINAL of the police officers confirmed that a dictaphone had been used during the operation . The court also observed that the expert opinion stated that the marked banknotes could in fact have been checked for the applicant \u2019s fingerprints but this had not been done and the banknotes had been lost . The traces of the chemical on the applicant \u2019s hand did not in itself constitute conclusive evidence that he had taken money from PERSON court also noted that during the trial prosecutor PERSON had claimed that the operation had been headed by police inspector I. , whereas the latter stated that they were merely assisting the prosecutor to verify the notification of a crime . The court also doubted the testimony given by PERSON in the light of an earlier promise to take revenge , which was confirmed in the court by CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s colleagues . For all these reasons the court concluded that the evidence presented by the prosecution had either been unlawfully obtained or was too inconclusive to establish that the applicant had solicited or received a bribe from PERSON", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor appealed . In the applicant \u2019s reply to the appeal he stated that the audio - recording made during the operation contained evidence of his innocence and had been withheld from the case file for this reason , and that prosecuting investigator PERSON had not investigated the real intention behind PERSON \u2019s complaint , namely to slander the applicant and evade imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the earlier judgment , found the applicant guilty of bribery , sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment together with confiscation of all his property and detained him pending appeal . The court considered that the fact that the applicant had solicited a bribe from PERSON was proved by the consistent and logical statements given by the latter . It noted that the applicant had failed to check the validity of the reasons for PERSON \u2019s non - compliance with the probation requirements . In the latter aspect , it referred to CARDINAL decisions of ORG of DATE and DATE in favour of PERSON The court also relied on the evidence provided by the records of the use of the special chemical , of the discovery of the marked banknotes in the safe , of the discovery of traces of special chemicals on CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s hands , of an event reconstruction proving that PERSON could not have put the money in the safe without the applicant having noticed it , of the finding of traces of the special chemical on the applicant \u2019s hand and a forensic examination finding a similarity between the chemical on the applicant \u2019s hand and that on the marked banknotes . The court held that ORG had examined the evidence thoroughly but had assessed it incorrectly . Referring to the statement by police officer I. that no operational file had been opened because this had been a preliminary inquiry within the meaning of Section CARDINAL of the ORG , it concluded that the evidence obtained in the course of the operation had been obtained in compliance with criminal procedure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law challenging the admissibility of the evidence against him . Over and above the findings of the trial court he argued that the operation had not been authorised by any court , contrary to LAW ORG and section CARDINAL of the Search and Seizure Activities Act , and that the operation conducted by the authorities on CARDINAL DATE had assisted the provocation of a bribe rather than examining the truthfulness of PERSON \u2019s allegations and preventing the crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the court of appeal but reduced the applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE imprisonment . The court noted that the applicant \u2019s guilt had been proved by the consistent testimonies of PERSON who had no reason for making false accusations against the applicant . It concluded that there had been sufficient direct and indirect proof that the applicant had not only taken the bribe but had solicited it too .", "CARDINAL .
