GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , is an NORP national of NORP origin and resident in GPE , GPE .", "In DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on the suspicion of insult . In these proceedings defence counsel assisted him .", "On DATE , following a hearing , the GPE ( GPE ) ORG ( ORG ) convicted the applicant of insult and of having caused false suspicion , and imposed a fine of CARDINAL DATE rates of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW ) , insult ( PERSON ) is an offence punishable with a maximum of DATE imprisonment or a fine .", "ORG found that in the course of a dispute between the applicant and the foreign couple Mr and PERSON about their alleged unlawful parking , he had stated that \u201c they came from the LOC and did not know about NORP law \u201d , and he had called them \u201c GPE \u201d , a term used in NORP language to disparage foreigners . Moreover , in the investigation proceedings instituted at PERSON and PERSON request , he laid information against them pretending that they had insulted him in the course of the above dispute , that PERSON had threatened him with force and that they had committed a parking offence . Subsequently , the applicant had also laid information against a witness of the above dispute , PERSON , pretending that this person had also insulted him . ORG established these facts on the basis of the applicant \u2019s statements as well as on the evidence given by PERSON and PERSON , Mr DATE PERSON , the applicant \u2019s life companion , and PERSON , a customs officer having witnessed the dispute in the course of an observation of the place . It also had before it photographs of the place in question .", "On DATE , following oral hearings , ORG ( Land - gericht ) , upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , reduced the fine to CARDINAL DATE rates of DEM CARDINAL and dismissed the remainder of the appeal . ORG , on the basis of its own taking of evidence , confirmed in essence the establishment of facts by ORG . Thus the applicant had started a dispute with PERSON and PERSON about their allegedly wrong parking , stating that \u201c they were not on the LOC and had to comply with NORP traffic regulations \u201d and , in his annoyance , he had called them \u201c GPE \u201d . The court found that PERSON statements were refuted by the evidence given by PERSON , a neutral witness who had credibly explained that as a dog - fancier he would have seen PERSON and her dog . ORG , having regard to the material before it , including a site plan and photographs , also considered that an inspection of the place of the events had not been necessary . Furthermore , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments that the expression \u201c GPE \u201d was a neutral denomination of LOC NORP , considering that in NORP language this expression was unfortunately used , in a disparaging manner , in relation to foreigners .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberstes PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) refused to entertain the applicant 's constitutional appeal . The decision was served on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
