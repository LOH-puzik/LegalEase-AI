The charges against the applicant did not relate to political activity . The applicant \u2019s allegation that any detainee would be subjected to ill - treatment in GPE was too general . He was accused of banditry , illegal weapons trafficking and the murder of CARDINAL people with aggravating circumstances . There was no evidence that the applicant had engaged in any political activity . His allegations of earlier instances of illtreatment in GPE were vague , totally unsubstantiated and unconvincing .
