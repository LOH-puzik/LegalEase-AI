GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in GPE in GPE , where he lived with his parents and his younger sister and attended school . On an unspecified date the applicant 's brother died in an accident . His parents have been lawfully resident in GPE for DATE . According to the applicant 's submissions , he visited GPE CARDINAL or CARDINAL times during his holidays .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent authorities granted the applicant a permanent residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor discontinued juvenile - delinquency proceedings brought against the applicant for grievous bodily harm .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant completed his apprenticeship as a car mechanic . In DATE he worked for DATE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and subsequently detained on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of attempted aggravated trafficking in human beings ( versuchter schwerer Menschenhandel ) , several counts of battery and aggravated battery ( schwere gef\u00e4hrliche GPE ) , procurement ( PERSON ) , purchasing illegal drugs ( PERSON ) , CARDINAL counts of drunken driving and CARDINAL counts of insulting behaviour and sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment . ORG found that DATE the applicant had forced his former partner to surrender the main part of her earnings acquired through prostitution . To that end , he had used physical violence , on CARDINAL occasion kicking the woman 's face with his shod foot . In DATE the applicant \u2013 together with CARDINAL accomplices , including his former partner \u2013 had attempted on QUANTITY occasions to force another woman into prostitution . The applicant and his male accomplice had intended to use the earnings to finance their upkeep and their drug consumption .", "CARDINAL . To that end , the applicant and his accomplices had first locked the woman in . Later on , the applicant had encouraged his former partner to beat the woman and her sister , who had aided her resistance . In the applicant 's presence and with his explicit consent , both women had been punched CARDINAL times in their face .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was also found guilty of having purchased QUANTITY of cocaine on CARDINAL occasion , together with CARDINAL accomplice , and of having insulted several police officers . In view of the fact that the applicant had been DATE when committing those offences and that there was no indication of retarded development , ORG did not apply juvenile but adult criminal law .", "CARDINAL . When assessing the applicant 's sentence , ORG treated as mitigating factors the fact that the applicant had no previous convictions and that he had confessed to the offences during the main proceedings . It emphasised , however , that the applicant had acted as the driving force in carrying out the crimes committed jointly against the second victim . ORG further noted that the applicant had acted with \u201c incredible brutality \u201d ( unglaubliche PERSON ) towards his second victim , after having already exploited his former partner . The applicant had taken MONEY from the latter without leaving her the necessary resources to cater to her own and her child 's needs , his intention being to use the money for alcohol , drugs and other purposes of his own . ORG put special emphasis on the exceptional brutality with which the applicant had exploited his former partner . Lastly , it considered the degree of disdain he had shown towards the police officers . Only the applicant 's confession had prevented ORG from imposing a prison sentence of DATE , which would have meant relinquishing the examination of the case in favour of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Regierungspr\u00e4sidium ) ordered the applicant 's expulsion to GPE . It was announced that he would be deported on his release from prison .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicant was born in GPE and possessed a valid residence permit , ORG considered that his conviction for several serious offences made it necessary to expel him under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and section QUANTITY ) of LAW ( Ausl\u00e4ndergesetz \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) for serious reasons relating to public safety . Regard being had to the reasons given for the applicant 's criminal conviction , his expulsion was necessary in the interest of general deterrence ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG also considered the applicant 's expulsion justified in this particular case because there was a high risk that he would continue to pose a serious threat to public safety . The seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant demonstrated his high criminal potential and his violent disposition . His criminal offences showed that he was not willing to respect the rights and dignity of his fellow human beings . These factors led to a serious danger of recidivism ( erhebliche GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the applicant 's expulsion was proportionate and complied with LAW . The applicant was a single adult and could be reasonably expected to live in GPE . He had not submitted any evidence that his parents depended on his support . His parents would be in a position to maintain contact with him by way of visits and exchanging letters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) for judicial review of the expulsion order . He stated , inter alia , that his parents \u2013 especially his mother , but also , to a lesser degree , his father \u2013 were suffering from serious depression caused by the earlier loss of their other son . The applicant 's current situation had aggravated their condition , obliging them to seek medical treatment . His deportation might cause his mother to suffer a complete psychological breakdown . He was , moreover , ready to undergo social training and to come to terms with his former alcohol abuse . With respect to his prospects in GPE , the applicant alleged that he spoke only colloquial NORP and had but limited writing skills in that language .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's motion . It concurred with the reasoning set out in the expulsion order to the effect that there were sufficient indications that the applicant would continue to pose a danger to public order and safety . The alleged hardships suffered by the applicant 's parents did not justify a different assessment of the facts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently applied for leave to appeal . In a letter of DATE he submitted , inter alia , that he had been born in GPE , where he had gone to school and received vocational training . His whole family lived in GPE . He further submitted that he did not have any connection with GPE and that he had poor knowledge of the NORP language . His expulsion would lead to the destruction of his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Baden - ORG ( ORG ) refused the applicant leave to appeal . It found , firstly , that the applicant 's submissions were not capable of raising serious doubts as to the correctness of ORG judgment . Furthermore , he had not established that an appeal would be justified on the ground of the legal complexity of the subject matter . It was obvious that the interference with the applicant 's right to respect for his private and family life , as guaranteed by LAW , was justified under paragraph CARDINAL of that Article , regard being had in particular to the serious danger of recidivism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was deported from prison to GPE . The remaining third of his prison sentence was suspended in view of his deportation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to accept the applicant 's complaint for adjudication . That decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant married a NORP national of NORP origin , who lives in GPE . On DATE a child was born to the couple .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested to have a time - limit placed on his exclusion order . On DATE ORG limited the period of validity of the applicant 's exclusion order until DATE , i. e. DATE from the date of his deportation . The limitation was subject to the condition that the applicant was to submit evidence that he had not committed any further criminal offences and that he was still married to his NORP wife , that he was to submit a hair analysis proving that he did not consume drugs and that he was to reimburse the expenses incurred in connection with his deportation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's application for judicial review aimed at further shortening the time - limit set to his exclusion order .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , the applicant was still residing in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The rights of entry and residence for foreigners were governed until DATE by LAW ) and from DATE by LAW ( Aufenthaltsgesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL ) , point CARDINAL , of LAW , a foreigner is to be expelled where he or she has been sentenced to DATE imprisonment for having wilfully committed CARDINAL or more criminal offences .", "CARDINAL . If a foreigner was born in GPE and is in possession of a permanent residence permit , he or she may only be expelled if serious reasons relating to public safety and order justify the expulsion ( section TIME ) ) . Generally , this will be the case where section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) applies ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , an alien who has been expelled is not permitted to re - enter NORP territory . This effect can , as a rule ( in der PERSON ) , be limited in time upon application . A similar provision is contained in section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to section DATE ( CARDINAL ) no.CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) no . CARDINAL of LAW , an alien 's residence permit expires on issue of an expulsion order against him .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , as in force from DATE until DATE , provided as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) An alien who applies for naturalisation between the age of DATE and CARDINAL shall be naturalised provided that he or she", "CARDINAL . loses or relinquishes his or her former nationality ,", "CARDINAL . has been legally residing in GPE for DATE ,", "CARDINAL . has attended a school for DATE , including DATE of attendance at a school providing general education , and", "CARDINAL . has not been convicted of a criminal offence .", "( CARDINAL ) There shall be no entitlement to naturalisation if the alien does not possess a residence permit . ORG may be denied if there is a ground for expulsion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Residency Act provides that a residence permit is to be granted for reasons of family reunion . By CARDINAL , a residence permit is to be granted to a NORP national 's spouse or minor child , or to the parent of a minor NORP national in order to exercise parental authority ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
