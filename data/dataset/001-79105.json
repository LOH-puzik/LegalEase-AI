The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , the applicant had been receiving an old - age pension . From DATE , her pension was to be calculated under the Law on Calculating and ORG . The law introduced a new method for calculating pensions . This method , \u201c a pensioner 's individual multiplier \u201d was meant to link the pensioner 's pension to his or her previous earnings .", "CARDINAL . The authority in charge of the applicant 's pension , ORG of LOC of GPE , fixed the applicant 's multiplier at CARDINAL . The applicant considered that the agency had misread the law , and that her multiplier should be higher . On an unspecified date in DATE she challenged the agency 's decision in a court . Thus , in her view the net underpayments from DATE until DATE amounted to MONEY , without taking into account the raise of the local cost of living index .", "CARDINAL . The case came before ORG . On DATE the court held for the applicant . It found that the agency had misread the law : as from CARDINAL DATE the multiplier should have been TIME . Consequently , the agency was ordered to recalculate the applicant 's pension accordingly and pay it .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the enforcement of the judgment in the applicant 's favour was suspended in connection with the proceedings before ORG . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint . It found that contrary to what the plaintiffs suggested ORG had not trespassed its authority when it issued the ORG , and that the ORG 's interpretation of LAW had been correct . On DATE the Cassation Section of ORG upheld this judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the agency asked ORG to re - open the case due to discovery of new circumstances . They argued that the interpretation of the law on pensions given by the ORG was different from that of ORG . Further , they referred to the decision of ORG of GPE which confirmed the lawfulness of the ORG . The agency argued that it had not known about those facts until after the litigation , and that the case should therefore be reconsidered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the district court granted the agency 's request and reopened the judgment under LAW . Under this Article , a court might reopen a judgment , if a party discovered significant circumstances that were not and could not have been known to this party during the litigation .", "CARDINAL .

The ruling ordering the re - consideration of the judgment ... due to newly - discovered circumstances is not subject to any appeal \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE adopted a ruling concerning certain provisions of LAW ( CCrP ) . In that ruling ORG decided that LAW CCrP ( \u201c FAC for re - consideration of a [ criminal ] case on the basis of newly discovered circumstances \u201d , which was in many respect similar to LAW ) was unconstitutional in that it limited the grounds for the re - opening of a criminal case by the situations of \u201c newly discovered circumstances \u201d . In that ruling ORG suggested that this provision of the ORG prevented rectification of judicial errors and miscarriages of justice ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
