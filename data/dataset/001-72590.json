He further maintained that it was not clear from that record whether \u201c PERSON \u201d had been examined or whether the report had been drawn up before or after the applicant was charged .

I think that must be him in photograph no . CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the chronology of the examination of \u201c PERSON \u201d was as follows : the witness was asked about PERSON and therefore she started to speak about a person called PERSON first . She described him and , after that , she was shown the photograph album and then incidentally mentioned that she knew most of the persons shown in the photographs including the applicant . The official record of the interview stated that \u201c PERSON \u201d was questioned about PERSON , alias \u201c PERSON or \u201c D\u017euro \u201d , during the examination of DATE , and that she identified \u201c NORP \u201d as being the individual in photograph number CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant \u2019s lawyer asked the witness why he was so afraid and why he wished to remain anonymous . The witness stated that PERSON were a temperamental people , that they had threatened him when he had wanted to buy drugs from someone else and that he had been concerned about the safety of his family . To the lawyer \u2019s further question whether the person in photograph number CARDINAL had ever threatened him , the witness replied in the negative . In reply to the lawyer \u2019s last question , \u201c PERSON \u201d said more precisely that he had bought heroin from the man in photograph number CARDINAL after the New Year , most recently around DATE .", "CARDINAL . The police case file was sent to ORG ( okresn\u00ed st\u00e1tn\u00ed zastupitelstv\u00ed ) , which on DATE filed an indictment against the applicant with ORG ( okresn\u00ed soud ) .

The prosecutor suggested that the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses as well as witnesses PERSON and PERSON give evidence at the trial and that the police records on the photograph - based recognition of the applicant be read out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s trial began in ORG . The applicant entered a plea of not guilty .", "CARDINAL . The record of the hearing shows that , under LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the presiding judge heard the anonymous witness \u201c PERSON \u201d outside the courtroom and out of sight of the applicant and his counsel , who were able to put questions to the witness through the presiding judge . The witness stated that the applicant was the person who had sold drugs to him and that he had bought heroin from the applicant some time in DATE . In his testimony , the witness also stated that he was cured and was no longer addicted to any drug . In reply to several questions put by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , the witness stated that the applicant had sold drugs DATE . He had then disappeared and had started selling them again in DATE . He also said that he had been buying drugs from the applicant during a DATE period in DATE and that he had seen him selling heroin to other people during DATE . He described the applicant as a man of CARDINAL in height , slim , with straight dark hair . He added that , unlike at present , he had not been good at recalling the colour of hair at that time . In reaction to the anonymous witness \u2019s testimony , the applicant claimed that it was not true .", "CARDINAL . The court then read out the witness statements of PERSON and PERSON , an expert report and other written evidence . It adjourned the proceedings until DATE with a view to summoning \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Another hearing was held on DATE . It was recorded that the investigating authorities had reported by telephone that , at the time of the hearing , \u201c PERSON \u201d could not be found at her home . The proceedings were therefore adjourned until DATE . The police were instructed to conduct a search to find out whether the witness was staying at her home address .", "CARDINAL . According to the record of the hearing of DATE , ORG read out the police reports of CARDINAL and DATE on the unknown whereabouts of \u201c PERSON \u201d . In accordance with LAW ( a ) of the ORG , her witness statement from the pre - trial police records was read out . In reaction to the witness \u2019s testimony , the applicant claimed that he had not been in GPE at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment given on DATE , the court found the applicant guilty of the unauthorised production and possession of narcotics and poisonous substances , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , as well as expulsion from GPE for an unlimited period of time . It held that , from DATE to DATE , the applicant had been selling heroin in \u201c small envelopes \u201d . He had sold CARDINAL \u201c envelopes \u201d of heroin to \u201c PERSON \u201d , and on a number of occasions during this time he had also sold heroin to \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that he had not been in GPE at the relevant time and that the drugs found in his possession had been for his personal use .", "CARDINAL . The ORG based its finding of guilt exclusively on the testimonies of the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses . It stated that the confidentiality of their identities prior to their interview in order to safeguard their security was justified under LAW of the ORG , having regard to the seriousness of the offence at issue and the witnesses\u2019 fear of testifying in open court .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that anonymous witness \u201c PERSON \u201d had stated that he had bought CARDINAL \u201c envelopes \u201d of heroin from the applicant and that he had recognised the latter from photographs , both in the pre - trial proceedings and at trial , as the person who had been selling heroin not only to him , but also to other persons .", "CARDINAL . As regards \u201c PERSON \u201d , the court referred to the police report stating that the witness could not be found at her place of residence and that the search for her had been unsuccessful . It mentioned that she had testified in the pre - trial proceedings in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer and had said that she had been buying heroin from the applicant , whom she had recognised from photographs .", "CARDINAL . The court also had regard to a photocopy of the applicant \u2019s passport , finding that he had arrived in GPE on DATE from GPE . According to the expert psychiatric report , the applicant was , inter alia , a drug addict who should have been aware of the dangerousness of his criminal activity for society and could have controlled his conduct . An expert examination of the substance found on the applicant indicated that it was heroin .", "CARDINAL . The court , having assessed all the relevant evidence , held that the testimonies of the anonymous witnesses were trustworthy and consistent and that they incriminated the applicant . It also stated that the witness \u201c Jan Novotn\u00fd \u201d had recognised the applicant in both the trial and pre - trial proceedings . It concluded that the evidence adduced by the applicant - the copy of his passport and a plane ticket showing that he was not in GPE for most of the period during which he was alleged to have committed the offence - was not sufficient to rebut the strength of the case against him . It seems that the court did not rely on the witness statements of PERSON and S.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed , claiming that he had not committed any criminal offence and that the heroin found in his possession had been for his personal use only . He also challenged the ORG reliance on the testimonies of the anonymous witnesses whose statements had been misused to his detriment . The applicant further complained of the failure of both the investigating authorities and ORG to resolve material contradictions in the statements of the anonymous witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON Regional Court ( krajsk\u00fd soud ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding his objection to the use of anonymous testimony unsubstantiated . It noted that both anonymous witnesses had been interviewed in the pre - trial proceedings and that the statement of \u201c PERSON \u201d had been read out because she could not be located at her home address . The court further noted that witnesses PERSON and PERSON had refused to testify at trial .", "CARDINAL . The court found that , owing to the nature of the criminal activity , the witnesses had been recruited from among drug users and drug addicts , who were \u201c much more vulnerable \u201d . It concluded that the concerns which the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses had expressed to the investigating authorities had resulted in the correct procedural steps being taken , in accordance with LAW ORG , including the decision to interview them under fictitious names .", "CARDINAL . As regards the inconsistency in the ORG statements , ORG stated that witness \u201c PERSON \u201d had recognised the applicant from the photographs as the person from whom she had bought heroin , but had not known his name . She had described a drug dealer whom she had known by the name \u201c LOC and who had not corresponded to the description of the applicant . The court held that the testimony given by witness \u201c PERSON \u201d had not been contradictory and that he had repeatedly described from whom , where and when he had bought heroin . He had usually seen the applicant in a smoke - filled gambling hall under subdued lighting and had not been concentrating on remembering details of the applicant \u2019s appearance , but rather on obtaining drugs . The court held that his inability to describe the correct hair colour \u201c did not play an important role \u201d . It fully endorsed ORG findings of fact and law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal ( \u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost ) , claiming a violation of his rights as guaranteed by LAW ( d ) of the LAW . He alleged that there had been no legal basis for the use of the anonymous witness testimony and that the authorities had put the defence at a substantial disadvantage , contrary to the principle of equality of arms . He complained that his conviction had been based solely on the testimonies of anonymous witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as unsubstantiated . It held that statements by anonymous witnesses could only be used in evidence if the principle of subsidiarity was observed , namely if there were no other means of ensuring the safety of a witness and any limitation on the rights of the defence had been minimised . The court recognised that there was a conflict between , on the one hand , the constitutional right to defend oneself and , on the other hand , the need to protect the health and life of witnesses . It held that this conflict could be resolved only on the basis of the principle of proportionality .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not accept the applicant \u2019s allegation that the anonymous witness procedure had been misused to his detriment . It held that , to the extent that defence rights might found that , according to official police records , the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses had been interviewed in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer , who had had the opportunity to question them . The court concluded that , having regard to the photograph - based recognition of the applicant before the pre - trial authorities , as well as before the trial court , no doubt could be cast on the legality and fairness of the proceedings . It held that any disadvantages under which the defence might have operated did not give rise to a question of unconstitutionality , as it was the content of the ORG evidence rather than their identity that was relevant , notwithstanding the fact that the courts had not provided sufficient reasons for having adopted the procedure laid down in ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG lodged a complaint in the applicant \u2019s favour , alleging a breach of law ( st\u00ed\u017enost pro poru\u0161en\u00ed z\u00e1kona ) . He based his complaint on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... [ the courts ] did not sufficiently offer the necessary guarantees to ensure a fair trial as [ the applicant \u2019s ] lawyer could not see both anonymous witnesses during their interviews in order to learn their identity ,", "the prosecuting authorities did not examine the question whether it was necessary to conceal the identity of the witnesses ,", "before the decision to conceal the identity of the witnesses was taken , the defence was never given an opportunity to raise objections concerning their credibility or the justification of the alleged threats against them which might justify their anonymity ,", "the courts did not specify ... that they knew the true identity of both witnesses and found that the accused represented a serious threat to the life and liberty of both anonymous witnesses ,", "[ the applicant \u2019s ] lawyer could not verify the credibility of the anonymous witnesses and their statements , and the courts did not do so either ,", "inadequate conditions during the identification of the accused from photographs deprived the witnesses of their credibility , and", "the conviction of the accused was based exclusively on the statements of the anonymous witnesses . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the complaint , relying on and sharing the legal opinions of ORG . It added that LAW ORG did not provide for the right of counsel to see anonymous witnesses and to be informed of their identity . The Minister \u2019s CARDINAL specific arguments in this connection had therefore been submitted contra legem .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided that anyone who manufactured , imported , exported , transported , or kept or acquired for a third party , narcotics or poisonous substances , without authorisation , would be punished by imprisonment of DATE or by a fine .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the ORG , where the circumstances indicated that a witness or a person close to the witness ran an obvious risk of bodily harm or other serious danger of interference with his / her fundamental rights in testifying , and when it was not possible to ensure the effective protection of the witness in another manner , the authorities were required to take measures to prevent the visual identification of the witness . The witness \u2019s name and surname as well as his / her other particulars were not recorded in the statement , but were kept separate from the criminal file and known only to the authorities . The witness had to be informed of the right to have one \u2019s identity concealed and to sign the statement using a fictitious forename and surname , by which the person would subsequently be identified . If the reasons for concealing the witness \u2019s identity and for separating the witness \u2019s particulars ceased to exist , that information would be attached to the criminal file and the witness \u2019s identity would no longer be concealed .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the president of the division was to ensure that any witness who had not yet testified did not attend the interview of the defendant or of other witnesses . If there was any doubt that the witness would not testify truthfully in the presence of the defendant , or if the witness or persons close to him or her were at risk of bodily harm , death or any other serious danger , the president of the division was required to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety or to conceal the identity of the witness , or to order the defendant to leave the courtroom while the witness was being questioned . However , once having returned to the courtroom , the defendant had to be informed of the content of the witness \u2019s testimony and be given the opportunity to comment on it , and , without meeting the witness in person , might put questions to the witness through the president of the chamber . When the witness \u2019s identity was to remain confidential , the president of the chamber was required to take measures in order to prevent the true identity of the witness being revealed .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided that when a witness whose identity had been concealed was examined at trial , the court , acting of its own motion , was required to take all necessary steps with a view to verifying the witness \u2019s credibility .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided , inter alia , that prior to examination , the identity of a witness and his or her relationship to the accused , if any , had to be ascertained . The witness was to be advised that he or she had the right to refuse to give testimony and , if need be , to proceed under LAW . The witness was also to be warned to tell the truth and nothing but the truth . At the same time , instructions had to be given on the importance of the testimony with regard to the general interest and on the criminal law consequences of perjury . The second paragraph provided , inter alia , that at the beginning of the examination , the witness would be asked about his or her connection with the case at issue and any relationship to the parties and ,", "if need be , about other circumstances that might be important for ascertaining his or her reliability .", "CARDINAL . The plenary assembly of ORG declared unconstitutional the version of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG then in force . It held that the criteria for assessing whether the use of anonymous witnesses was constitutional and in line with the principle of subsidiarity were as follows : first , anonymity may only be granted if the witness can not be provided with reliable protection in any other way ; secondly , any constraints on the exercise of the rights of the defence resulting from the hearing of evidence from anonymous witnesses must be kept to a minimum .", "CARDINAL . In this case , the court found the criminal proceedings unfair because the appellant \u2019s identification had been based on photograph albums alone and the witness had not described the appellant prior to the identification procedure . Concerning the use of anonymous witnesses , ORG concluded that the trial court had not verified the credibility of the witnesses as required by LAW ORG . The trial court had only declared that the witnesses had no \u201c outstanding accounts \u201d with the appellant and hence there was no reason for them to take revenge against him and to incriminate him falsely . Such a declaration could not in itself mean that the trial court had complied with LAW ORG . It should have examined and verified the relationship between the witnesses and the appellant , checked the latter \u2019s objections to their credibility and produced all necessary evidence , for example the full transcript of the criminal records of the witnesses , the reports of the local police and administrative authorities on the reputation of the witnesses , and the expert psychological reports on the witnesses , under LAW ORG . ORG quashed the decisions of both the trial and appellate courts .", "CARDINAL . The Appendix to Recommendation No . R ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL of ORG , concerning the intimidation of witnesses and the rights of the defence , includes the following passage :", "\u201c ... CARDINAL . Anonymity should only be granted when the competent judicial authority , after hearing the parties , finds that :", "\u2013 the life or freedom of the person involved is seriously threatened or , in the case of an undercover agent , his / her potential to work in the future is seriously threatened ; and", "\u2013 the evidence is likely to be significant and the person appears to be credible .", "CARDINAL . Where appropriate , further measures should be available to protect witnesses giving evidence , including preventing the identification of the witness by the defence , for example by using screens , disguising the face or distorting the voice .", "CARDINAL . When anonymity has been granted , the conviction shall not be based solely or to a decisive extent on the evidence of such persons .", "CARDINAL . Where appropriate , special programmes , such as witness protection programmes , should be set up and made available to witnesses who need protection . The main objective of these programmes should be to safeguard the life and personal security of witnesses , their relatives and other persons close to them .", "CARDINAL . Witness protection programmes should offer various methods of protection ; this may include giving witnesses and their relatives and other persons close to them a change of identity , relocation , assistance in obtaining new jobs , providing them with bodyguards and other physical protection .", "CARDINAL . Given the prominent role that collaborators of justice play in the fight against organised crime , they should be given adequate consideration , including the possibility of benefiting from measures provided by witness protection programmes .
