CARDINAL sister and CARDINAL brother moved to GPE in DATE and the rest of the family appears to have followed at unspecified dates . The applicant visited GPE in DATE to try to join his family . During his stay there he was arrested on CARDINAL DATE for possession of cocaine and subsequently sentenced to a DATE term of imprisonment . After DATE , he was paroled for good behaviour and deported on DATE to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant arrived at FAC , GPE , on DATE and sought leave to enter GPE for DATE as a visitor . He was found at the airport terminal to be in possession of a substantial quantity of cocaine with a street value of QUANTITY ( GBP ) . The immigration officer refused him leave to enter on the ground that his exclusion was conducive to the public good and gave him notice that he would be removed to GPE within DATE .", "However , after being arrested and charged , the applicant was remanded in custody and subsequently prosecuted for being knowingly involved in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on the importation of controlled drugs of class A. He pleaded guilty at ORG on DATE and was sentenced on DATE to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . He apparently behaved well while in PERSON and was released on licence on DATE . He was placed in immigration detention pending his removal to GPE . Bail was granted by an adjudicator on DATE after the ORG \u2019s report had been made public .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , while serving his prison sentence , the applicant suffered an attack of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( \" PCP \" ) and was diagnosed as HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus)-positive and as suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .

ORG On DATE , immediately prior to his release on licence , the immigration authorities gave directions for the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG By letter dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s solicitors requested that the Secretary of ORG grant the applicant leave to remain on compassionate grounds since his removal to GPE would entail the loss of the medical treatment which he was currently receiving , thereby shortening his life expectancy ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . This request was refused on DATE by the Chief Immigration Officer . In his letter of refusal addressed to the applicant \u2019s solicitors the Chief Immigration Officer stated :", "\" In reaching this decision full account was taken of paragraph CARDINAL of ORG and HIV - positive cases . You will be aware that paragraph CARDINAL of this instruction which relates to persons whose applications are for leave to enter the GPE states [ see paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment below ] ... While we are saddened to learn of Mr D [ ... ] \u2019s medical circumstances we do not accept , in line with ORG , that it is right generally or in the individual circumstances of this case , to allow an AIDS sufferer to remain here exceptionally when , as here , treatment in this country is carried out at public expense , under ORG . Nor would it be fair to treat AIDS sufferers any differently from others suffering medical conditions ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant applied unsuccessfully to ORG for leave to apply for judicial review of the decision to refuse him leave to enter . On DATE , ORG dismissed his renewed application . It found that section CARDINAL of the Immigration Act DATE drew a distinction between leave to enter and leave to remain . It held that the Chief Immigration Officer had correctly treated PERSON application as an application for leave to enter and was not required to take into account paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG guidelines which applied to applications for leave to remain ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . As to the applicant \u2019s argument that ORG acted unreasonably or irrationally in not acceding to the compassionate circumstances of his plea , Sir PERSON stated in his judgment :", "\" Nobody can but have great sympathy for this applicant in the plight in which he finds himself . If he is to return to GPE it seems that he will be unable to work because of his illness . His expectation of life , if the medical evidence is correct , may well be shorter than it would be if he remained under the treatment that he is receiving in GPE , and in many ways his plight will be great . On the other hand he would not be here if he had not come on a cocaine smuggling expedition in DATE ; and if he had not been imprisoned he would have gone back to GPE , if he had ever come here at all , long before his AIDS was diagnosed . Taking account of the fact that the ORG must give most anxious scrutiny to a decision which involves questions particularly of life expectancy , as this one apparently does , nevertheless I can not find that an argument in this case that the decision of the Chief Immigration Officer was irrational is one that has any hope of success at all . Putting it the opposite way , it seems to me to be one which was well within the bounds of his discretion , and thus is not one with which the ORG can properly interfere . \"", "CARDINAL .

In view of the fact that [ the applicant ] has now had AIDS for DATE and because this is a relentlessly progressive disease his prognosis is extremely poor . In my professional opinion [ the applicant \u2019s ] life expectancy would be substantially shortened if he were to return to GPE where there is no medication ; it is important that he receives pentamidine treatment against ORG and that he receives prompt anti - microbial therapy for any further infections which he is likely to develop ... \"", "CARDINAL .

Amongst the first category , several drugs can be used , including AZT ( also known as ORG or its tradename Retrovir ) . This belongs to a family of drugs called nucleoside analogues which inhibit an enzyme produced by HIV called reverse transcriptase ( ORG ) . If ORG is inhibited , HIV can not infect new cells and the build - up of virus in the body is slowed down . However , the existing drugs are only partially effective and at best can only delay the worsening of HIV - related disease rather than prevent it .", "CARDINAL . ORG As regards the second category , persons whose immune systems have been significantly damaged are vulnerable to a range of infections and tumours known as opportunistic infections . These commonly include cytomegalovirus ( herpes virus ) , PERSON \u2019s sarcoma , anaemia , tuberculosis , toxoplasmosis and ORG . ORG is a form of pneumonia which in people infected with HIV may affect the lymph nodes , bone marrow , spleen and liver as well as the lungs . Steps to avoid such infections include taking care with food and drink and prophylactic treatment by drugs . In the case of ORG , which was a common cause of death during DATE of the epidemic and is still one of the commonest AIDS illnesses , options include the long - term taking of antibiotics such as cotrimoxazole and the use of nebulised pentamidine which is intended to protect the lungs .", "CARDINAL .
