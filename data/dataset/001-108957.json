He complained that he had been held in pre - trial detention beyond a reasonable time . He also argued that he had been deprived of his liberty on the grounds of his inability to fulfil a contractual obligation , in breach of LAW .

Moreover , contrary to LAW ORG , the prosecutor had not proceeded to seize his property .", "CARDINAL . In a detailed judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of deception and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The court acquitted the applicant of the charge of establishing a criminal organisation . In fact , it acknowledged , that this charge had been brought in order to extend the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , as the time - limit was coming to an end .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL pages of the judgment gave a detailed description of the establishment of the applicant \u2019s company , its activities and its modus operandi . According to ORG , the development and progress of the applicant \u2019s company was made up of CARDINAL phases . The first phase of the development extended from DATE to DATE during which time the economic and commercial activity of the company was concentrated in the sphere of fast - income businesses , relying on cash , such as bakeries , retail shops , cake shops , restaurants and travel agencies . The second phase extended from DATE until the placement of the company in administration . During this period , the goal of the company was to modernise its lines of production and extend its activities within the country and abroad . In the court \u2019s view , this was the decisive period which gave rise to great economic and financial problems . ORG acknowledged that the principal reason for the taking of loans from members of the public were the rapid pace of the company \u2019s expansion and development as well as the actual impossibility for the NORP banks to give loans .", "CARDINAL . The judgment further stated that the process of taking loans from the public continued until DATE . Towards DATE and DATE , the loan contracts consisted of a simple letter and offered interest rates PERCENT per month . The total number of persons who concluded a loan contract with the company was CARDINAL creditors . The total amount of loans taken , on the basis of calculations made by specialised bodies and experts , was equivalent to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . This figure was not accurate since the final findings had not yet been drawn up .", "CARDINAL . The ensuing CARDINAL pages of the judgment focused on the financial situation of the applicant \u2019s company . The court analysed the company \u2019s balance sheets for DATE on the basis of the company \u2019s tax returns . It concluded that the balance sheets showed an unjustified inflation of the company \u2019s assets in order to cover the excessive debts it had incurred through the taking of loans from members of the public . Furthermore , the court examined a number of transactions and expenses that had been incurred domestically and abroad by either the company or the applicant , with a view to pointing to their unlawful nature .", "CARDINAL . In finding the applicant \u2019s actions unlawful and the applicant guilty , ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c First , the applicant entered into loan agreements with individuals with a maturity period of DATE . This is contrary to section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW in GPE , which states that \u2018 no other entity , with the exception of a bank , may accept deposits from the public with an initial maturity period of DATE or less\u2019 .", "Second , on concluding the loan agreements and accepting the loans , the applicant \u2019s company offered creditors an advance payment of MONEY of their accrued interest , a somewhat strange action given the nature of the company as an investment entity .", "Third , the applicant carried out actions , notably the modification of the real values of the balance sheets for DATE , in breach of the DATE LAW .", "Fourth , a number of transactions were made in cash , thus avoiding lawful entries in the accounting records ...", "Fifth , the interest rates offered by the applicant \u2019s company , which varied from PERCENT per month , were staggering compared with the interest rates offered by [ commercial ] banks . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s company carried out arbitrary , unilateral actions , even breaching its contractual obligations by decreasing the interest rate without the prior consent of creditors .", "Sixth , the contractual obligations vis - \u00e0 - vis creditors were met by continuously attracting new loans from the public ...", "Seventh , the economic activity of the company is contrary to the DATE LAW since the activity of taking loans under LAW is allowed only between individuals . Checks reveal that there have been reported cases when loans were made to the applicant \u2019s company .", "Eighth , the applicant and his company deliberately increased the value of their assets to obtain a positive balance sheet for the company ...", "Ninth , the applicant paid exorbitant prices , beyond the real market value , for the purchase of objects with a lower return rate compared to the speed and fast pace of the withdrawal of money .", "Tenth , the increase of unnecessary expenses for the purchase of luxury items and the high expenses for personnel costs did not correspond to the reality . ...", "Eleventh , during the commercial activities of the applicant and his company , there were cash transfers for the purchase of objects and property ... without any guarantee or interest rate , despite the fact that the money was taken from the public at an interest rate of MONEY per month . In most cases these amounts do not appear in the company \u2019s balance sheet .", "Twelfth , on the basis of balance sheets submitted by the company to the tax authorities in DATE ... the level of profits compared to the withdrawal of money from creditors was CARDINAL per cent . Questioned at a hearing , the experts concluded that , having regard to the profit made and the level of assets as assessed by the auditors , there could be no question of returning the principal amount , let alone paying interest .", "Thirteenth , during the operation of the company , notably following the adoption of the DATE LAW , there is a pattern of transfers of money by way of cash to different countries , particularly GPE , to allegedly buy shares , banks or set up new activities so that the company could allegedly explore ways for its continuation and survival .", "Fourteenth , the loan contracts were not concluded before the public notary in accordance with the [ DATE ] LAW and LAW ; they are standardised contracts , with defined obligations ... concluded without seeking the creditor \u2019s consent and without proprietary guarantees . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s claims concerning his detention , conviction and sentence arising out of his inability to fulfil his contractual obligations , the judgment read :", "\u201c ... the [ district ] court will not directly examine the contractual obligations . The applicant \u2019s actions and failure to act , as well as his inability to fulfil his [ contractual ] civil obligations , amount to a criminal offence . More precisely , as a result of the unlawful actions carried out from the beginning [ of the company \u2019s business activities ] until the actual trial , a number of legal provisions , as mentioned above , were sidestepped , breached or not observed ( ... gjykata n\u00eb k\u00ebt\u00eb rast nuk i futet detyrimit civil n\u00eb m\u00ebnyr\u00eb t\u00eb drejtp\u00ebrdrejt\u00eb por se me veprimet dhe mosveprimet e tij dhe mosp\u00ebrmbushjes s\u00eb detyrimeve civile , ka lindur nj\u00eb vep\u00ebr penale dhe konkretisht me an\u00eb t\u00eb veprimeve t\u00eb kundraligjshme q\u00eb nga momenti i fillimit e deri n\u00eb momentin aktual t\u00eb gjykimit jan\u00eb m\u00ebnjanuar apo shkelur , apo l\u00ebn\u00eb pa zbatuar nj\u00eb s\u00ebr\u00eb dispozitash ligjore t\u00eb cilat ne I p\u00ebmend\u00ebm m\u00eb sip\u00ebr ) .", "It must be emphasised that the taking of loans does not constitute an act engaging civil liability , since the [ loan ] agreements did not entail any monetary guarantee , the interest rates were beyond the prescribed legal ceiling and there was concealment of revenues and loss of property ( PERSON theksuar se veprimtaria e huamarrjes nuk \u00ebsht\u00eb nj\u00eb veprim i drejtp\u00ebrdrejt\u00eb civil pasi kontratat jan\u00eb b\u00ebr\u00eb pa garanci pasurore , niveli i interesave ka qen\u00eb tej normativave ligjore , kemi fshehje t\u00eb t\u00eb ardhurave dhe rrjedhje t\u00eb pasuris\u00eb ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the prosecutor \u2019s request to sentence the applicant on CARDINAL counts , equal to the total number of creditors . It stated that the applicant had been charged with CARDINAL offence . The offence in question had started in DATE and finished on DATE , thus constituting a continuing crime rather than a repeated one . The court held that LAW could not apply to the instant case as the applicant had committed only one criminal offence . ORG had further regard to the then ORG decision of DATE , which had sentenced another individual only once , in accordance with LAW , on principally the same facts and circumstances as the applicant \u2019s .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant and the prosecutor appealed . The applicant argued that he had been sentenced on account of his inability to fulfil a contractual obligation arising out of the loan agreements entered into with his creditors . However , no creditor had accused the applicant of deception . To this end , CARDINAL creditors had been questioned by the court and had all declared that they had willingly lent money to the applicant and had withdrawn the interest on the date agreed upon in the agreement . The applicant contended that LAW did not stipulate that a loan agreement could be concluded CARDINAL private individuals only . The applicant also contested the assessment of evidence by ORG and its failure to examine whether he was capable of fulfilling his contractual obligations towards the creditors .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE ORG appointed the same CARDINAL experts to produce another financial report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts submitted their report . According to the report , the total number of creditors was CARDINAL and the overall debt amounted to ALL CARDINAL , the equivalent of CARDINAL at the material time . This figure was drawn from the company \u2019s computers , which had been seized by the prosecutor \u2019s office . Referring to the number of claims made by creditors after the start of the compulsory administration proceedings , the report indicated that the overall number of creditors was CARDINAL , while the total debt was ORG CARDINAL .", "As regards the value of the applicant \u2019s company \u2019s assets , the report concluded that as of DATE its assets totalled ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . This estimate was based on a decision of ORG of DATE , which listed the company \u2019s property and the corresponding monetary value . However , it did not include the value of mines and other mineral reserves .", "Following the start of the compulsory administration proceedings , the total value of the applicant \u2019s company assets amounted to USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL , of which ORG CARDINAL consisted of the proceeds from the sale of assets and ORG CARDINAL was the estimated value of assets which had not yet been sold .", "As regards the cash flow in the company \u2019s bank accounts , the report concluded that its balance was ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . However , not all banks had submitted cash flow reports . The outstanding debt owed by third parties to the applicant \u2019s company was calculated to be CARDINAL . The report assessed the damage to the applicant \u2019s company \u2019s assets as a result of the DATE civil unrest at MONEY .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ORG relied on the facts established in ORG judgment . It found the applicant to be responsible for the deception of CARDINAL creditors in the total amount of ALL CARDINAL . The court explained the decrease in the overall number of creditors and the total amount of debt by the deduction of the capitalised interest and the exclusion of inaccurate records . The court further dismissed the figures resulting from the compulsory administration proceedings as being inaccurate , having regard to the fact that not all creditors might have shown up to submit their claims .", "CARDINAL . ORG sentenced the applicant to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment in accordance with LAW of the ORG , which had entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . He complained about the retrospective application of LAW of the ORG , which had aggravated his position . He alleged that ORG had not given him time to prepare his defence when it had recharacterised the criminal offence and sentenced him under LAW of the ORG . The applicant further maintained that none of his creditors had been questioned before the lower courts or complained about the contracts he had concluded with them . As regards the offence with which he was charged , he stated that he had invested all the money he had taken from the public . There had been no intention to lie or abuse trust on his part . This assertion was supported by the large number of assets that his company owned and managed . Lastly , the applicant alleged that the decrease in the value of his property had resulted from the mismanagement of the administrators and improper handling of the sale of his company \u2019s assets .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty as charged . Relying on the same facts as established in the lower courts\u2019 decisions , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s actions and the company \u2019s activities had been improper and unlawful . ORG judgment , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c On the basis of the wealth of material , documents and experts\u2019 reports which have been adduced before the trial and appeal courts , it is clear that the accused collected considerable amounts of money and foreign currency from members of the public by means of false promises to repay the amounts and pay high interest rates , knowing that he was incapable of keeping his promises . In contrast to the accused \u2019s claims , the [ lower ] courts established that the taking of money from members of the public , in the form of so - called loans , was carried out for the sole purpose of acquiring property for the accused himself and other persons . The accused was not capable of securing the amounts in question relying solely on the money taken from members of the public and he knew that he could not obtain profits in a lawful manner in order to repay the loans .", "The undertaking to pay back the money collected from members of the public was not based on the company \u2019s realisable profits , but on the prospect of attracting money in the same way from other members of the public . The [ lower ] courts established that no lawful and normal commercial company could secure the interest rates needed to cover the high rate of interest that the accused offered to persons from whom he had collected extraordinarily large sums of money .", "In augmenting untruthfully the value of investments he had made using the money taken from members of the public , the accused \u2019s purpose was to attract a large number of persons in response to the competition from the so - called foundations and other pyramid schemes which were operating at the time , and to instil in the public the false idea that he possessed property and other assets which would underwrite the obligations he had entered into . The increase in interest rates for creditors and the shortening of deadlines for the repayment of loans fell into this same category .", "Regard being had to the whole body of evidence which was analysed in detail by ORG and by ORG , it emerges that , using money taken from members of the public , the accused created a pyramid scheme the base of which consisted of loans collected from members of the public who had been deceived , while its apex consisted of repayments which , as established by the courts , were not sufficient to fulfil the accused \u2019s [ contractual ] obligations .", "...", "It appears from the investigation and the case file that the criminal intent to commit theft by way of deception had its genesis in DATE , through the process of loan - taking . With the passage of time this intent evolved as the applicant expanded his activities , which took on staggering proportions as the scheme was rolled out across the country until DATE , the date that marked the end of his pyramid scheme .", "At its inception , the document used by the company for the taking of loans consisted of a simple letter or an order ( mandat ) .

Even the company \u2019s balance sheets were submitted as a single balance sheet covering the whole company . More specifically , according to the DATE balance sheet , the company had a net profit amounting to CARDINAL and a workforce of CARDINAL people . According to the DATE balance sheet , the company \u2019s net profit was ALL CARDINAL , which was equal to PERCENT of the outstanding debt owed to its creditors .", "In DATE there was an increase in the number of loans [ made by members of the public ] . Consequently , ORG \u2019s balance sheet reflected increased values . The company \u2019s net profit for DATE reached ALL CARDINAL , the equivalent of PERCENT of the outstanding debt owed to its creditors .", "By DATE the process of loan - taking had assumed unprecedented proportions and , consequently , the company \u2019s net profit totalled ORG , the equivalent of PERCENT of the outstanding debt owed to its creditors .", "CARDINAL .

However , it concluded that the total amount of the applicant \u2019s liabilities was ALL PERSON ( approximately USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL at the material time ) after having deducted the company \u2019s cash flows , which totalled ALL CARDINAL . ORG judgment , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c ... Any eventual change in the number of creditors does not affect the accused \u2019s guilt or his sentence in respect of the offence he has committed . A final court decision in the criminal case is binding on the court examining civil liabilities only in so far as the commission of the criminal offence is concerned and if the offence was committed by the accused . It does not have any consequences for the resolution of civil proceedings that may be instituted in the future .", "During the investigation stage , as well as in the trial and appeal proceedings , the accused claimed that , since his actions vis - \u00e0 - vis his creditors constituted civil relations in the form of fulfilment of a contractual obligation resulting from the loans taken , they could not give rise to criminal liability . This argument was dismissed by the domestic courts as unfounded . The accused also complained that no criminal offence had been committed , on the grounds that the property in his possession was far greater than the value of his liabilities vis - \u00e0 - vis creditors .", "The [ lower ] courts , having assessed the evidence in their possession , concluded that this claim was unfounded . The perception of the accused among members of the public as the owner of huge assets was CARDINAL of the forms of deception he employed to attract large amounts of money from citizens . The court notes that the [ lower ] courts drew this conclusion on the basis of voluminous documents , explanations provided by experts and the experts\u2019 reports that were compiled . ... As regards the valuation of objects , their value does not reflect the reality , as the valuation was unilateral and was fictitiously increased compared to the purchase price and the real market value . ORG reached the same finding via more detailed reasoning .", "In these circumstances , the [ lower ] courts accepted that the accused had committed the criminal offence of theft by way of lies and abuse of trust . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held that ORG had incorrectly applied LAW of the ORG . In passing sentence on the applicant , ORG reasoned that he should be held criminally liable on as many counts as the overall number of creditors , namely CARDINAL , in accordance with LAW , which prescribed a term of imprisonment of DATE . Referring to LAW of the ORG , it decided that the cumulative sentence should not exceed the maximum penalty of DATE imprisonment . Consequently , it sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that , by re - characterising the criminal offence , ORG had not given him adequate time to prepare his defence .", "CARDINAL . In this connection , the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ORG convicted the accused of deception and applied Article CARDINAL only once . ORG , while finding that the accused \u2019s conviction on CARDINAL count under LAW was unfounded , incorrectly characterised the criminal offence , finding the accused guilty and sentencing him under LAW of the ORG . In its decision , ORG , relying on LAW , reasoned that the offence should be classified under LAW of the ORG , on the grounds that , as a newly introduced criminal - law provision , the latter was more favourable than the previous provisions .", "The argument employed by ORG that the criminal offence constitutes a continuous crime ... is not borne out by the deception that has been carried out . In order for a crime to be continuous , the following elements must be present : each offence must not stand on its own , the acts or the failure to act must have constituted the same criminal offence , and the criminal intent which joins separate acts in a single integral offence must exist .", "In the present case the [ lower ] courts have accepted that the accused committed different acts over different periods of time . The criminal activity took place over a long time and , as argued above , was not the consequence of the same criminal intent . The latter was subject to continuous modification owing to competition from other unlawful loan - taking companies . This took the form of changing interest rates , varying deception techniques to adapt to different people and different circumstances , developing diverse strategies to make the deception credible , either through propaganda in the broadcast media or through efforts to make the criminal activity appear as normal banking activity .", "The court adopts the same position with the unifying decision ( no . CARDINAL ) of DATE of ORG to the effect that persons who have committed the offence of deception shall be criminally liable under LAW on as many counts as the number of people deceived .", "ORG considers that ORG reasoning that LAW should be applied as it is more favourable does not have any legal basis . LAW provides that \u201c the most serious criminal offence shall be considered to be that which attracts the most severe maximum penalty or , where the most severe maximum penalties are equal , the most severe minimum penalty . \u201d On that basis , taking the most severe maximum penalty as the criterion for the most serious offence , it is clear that LAW , which was in force when the criminal offence was committed and which provides for a penalty of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , is more favourable than the second paragraph , which was added to the provision and provides for a maximum penalty of DATE imprisonment . The fact that the cumulative sentence imposed may be higher than the penalty provided for in LAW can not provide a basis for finding that LAW is less favourable .", "For these reasons ORG , having aggravated the accused \u2019s position , should not have classified the offence under LAW of the ORG . The accused ... should be found guilty and sentenced on the basis of LAW for the criminal offence of deception on CARDINAL counts , equal to the number of injured persons .", "ORG considers the defendant \u2019s complaint that his right to defence was breached by the change of characterisation of the criminal offence by ORG , contrary to Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL of LAW and LAW a ) of the LAW , ill - founded . The court , by giving the facts a different determination , may re - characterise the offence , which may be less serious or more so . In the latter case , this does not mean that the accused \u2019s position has been aggravated . In accordance with LAW , the court may give the facts a different determination from that given by the prosecutor , since the court is independent and makes its own assessment of the facts .", "In this context , LAW does not oblige the court to give the accused time in the defence of his interest , whereas pursuant to LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL the accused is granted additional time to secure his defence against new charges lodged by the prosecutor . The latter provisions make reference to the prosecutor who , prior to the completion of the judicial examination has the right to modify the charges , to lodge a different charge or to charge the accused with a new offence . On these occasions , because the defence rights should be secured , the law provides that the court makes time available to the accused to secure his defence against the new charges . In the case of the application of LAW ORG , when the court proceeds with a different requalification of the offence , the same binding procedure does not apply as in the case of the filing of new charges by the prosecutor . The court , after an examination of facts , may give the facts a new and different legal determination . The criminal procedural law does not envisage adjournment of hearings or granting of [ additional ] time to the defence when the re - characterisation of the criminal offence is made by the court by virtue of its final decision . Contrary to the defendant \u2019s complaint , it can not be said that there has been a breach of the accused \u2019s right to defence .", "The spirit of the law ( LAW has been so that , owing to its amendment by virtue of law no ... , the lawmaker intended to clarify its content . According to the amendment , it is stated that \u201c by way of the final decision the court may give the fact a different determination from that given by the prosecutor or the injured party , which may be more favourable or more serious , provided that it is competent ratione personae to examine the offence . \u201d", "The defendant \u2019s complaint that the courts did not question all ORG \u2019s creditors is ill - founded . The prosecutor and the courts questioned as many creditors as was deemed necessary . Questioning of creditors does not constitute a legal necessity , since deception is not a criminal offence which can be prosecuted solely on the strength of a complaint . Furthermore , such questioning was not necessary in order to clarify or substantiate the charge against the accused .", "The defendant \u2019s complaint that the replacement of the appeal prosecutor by ORG , at the stage of the appeal proceedings before ORG , was in breach of Article CARDINAL of the ORG , is ill - founded . It results that the replacement of the appeal prosecutor by ORG was in accordance with LAW ORG , because according to ORG the appeal prosecutor had expressed his prior opinion about the case .", "Having regard to the foregoing , the ORG concludes that the accused should be declared guilty on CARDINAL counts of the criminal offence of deception in accordance with LAW . In passing the sentence , the court takes account of the danger which the accused presents to society , the large number of injured parties and the considerable amount of damage caused and , it considers that the applicant should be sentenced to DATE imprisonment . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
