GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . The second applicant , FAC , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . The applicants live in GPE , GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr F. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicants , who both lived in GPE before moving to GPE , are married in accordance with the NORP rituals since DATE but did not have a civil marriage in GPE . They are the parents of PERSON who was born on DATE . They have another CARDINAL children born in DATE .", "On DATE the first applicant brought PERSON to a hospital in GPE on the advice of a child doctor . According to the first applicant , PERSON had fallen DATE before , without his parents having observed this , and had been injured . He had a swollen forehead and a glasses haematoma , with his eyes being swollen following massive blood intrusions . When examining the child , the hospital doctors discovered further injuries . Considering these symptoms to be the result of PERSON \u2019s maltreatment , they informed the police thereof .", "On DATE CARDINAL experts of ORG submitted a report on the motion of ORG . Having examined PERSON on DATE , they found that the child had numerous older haematoma all over his body , mostly at parts on which he was unlikely to fall , and several smaller scars stemming from injuries inflicted at different moments in time . These findings indicated that he had been ill - treated over a longer period of time and suffered from a so - called battered child syndrome .", "In the course of further examinations carried out in hospital , PERSON was found to have also suffered a fracture of the skull at an earlier date which his parents had not noticed .", "On DATE ORG , by way of an interim injunction and without having previously heard the applicants , provisionally withdrew the applicants\u2019 right to determine PERSON \u2019s place of residence and transferred it to ORG . It found that , having regard to PERSON \u2019s multiple injuries , the applicants were suspected of having ill - treated him . It ordered that the applicants\u2019 other children be equally examined by ORG .", "In their report dated DATE the CARDINAL experts of ORG , having examined PERSON \u2019s CARDINAL brothers , found that they did not show any signs of exposure to violent acts .", "On DATE the applicants , who were from then on represented by counsel in the proceedings before the domestic courts , lodged an appeal against the order of CARDINAL DATE . They claimed that at no point in time they ill - treated M.", "On DATE ORG , having heard the applicants in person , confirmed the withdrawal of the applicants\u2019 right to determine PERSON \u2019s place of residence , provisionally withdrew the right of custody of the second applicant , who , in the court \u2019s view , had sole custody pursuant to section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) , and transferred it to ORG . It further ordered an expert report on the question of whether there were signs that PERSON had been ill - treated by his mother and possibly also by his father from a psychological point of view .", "On DATE M. was released from hospital . Since then , he has been living in a foster family . His parents visit him DATE .", "On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicants as there was no sufficient evidence that it had been them who had injured M.", "On DATE ORG withdrew the applicants\u2019 parental custody of LAW pursuant to section DATE of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) and conferred it to ORG .", "ORG had heard the applicants in person without appointing an interpreter for the second applicant , who hardly spoke NORP and whose submissions in LANGUAGE were translated by the first applicant . It had further consulted a psychological expert and a representative of ORG .", "ORG was convinced that PERSON had repeatedly experienced violence . It noted that the applicants had stressed that PERSON had not been deliberately injured by them , but had injured himself while romping around . However , there were no innocent explanations for his numerous injuries inflicted at different points in time . Even assuming that some of them were caused by PERSON \u2019s own inadvertence , there were several signs , such as the fact that he ducked when someone approached him or that he strongly resisted being undressed , which indicated that he had been ill - treated by others .", "The court , having regard to the report of the psychological expert , found that it could not be ascertained whether the injuries of the DATE PERSON , who was not able to make any concrete statement , had been inflicted by his parents . However , it was clear that they had been unable to protect PERSON from such injuries .", "Moreover , relying on the report of the psychological expert , ORG found that also PERSON \u2019s mental development was jeopardized . Mere language problems were inevitable in a family in which CARDINAL of the parents did not speak NORP and were no reason to separate a child from his parents . However , PERSON lived isolated in the family \u2019s apartment with his mother , who spoke LANGUAGE , hardly knew any NORP and showed no interest in his education , including his learning NORP .", "According to the psychological expert and the representative of ORG had settled well in his foster family . ORG found that there were no milder measures , such as aids by public authorities , which were suitable to avert risks to PERSON \u2019s welfare . The first applicant was busy with CARDINAL jobs and the second applicant , whom both applicants considered responsible for their children \u2019s education , did not speak NORP and was unwilling to change this by starting to learn NORP . It conceded that the applicants had declared to be willing to cooperate with the authorities , if necessary with the help of a neighbour who was ready to interpret for them . However , as confirmed by a representative of ORG , social pedagogic family support , which was based on a relationship of trust between the pedagogue and the parent , was not possible in the permanent presence of an interpreter .", "On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal against ORG decision of DATE .", "On DATE ORG appointed PERSON a curator ad litem who subsequently submitted CARDINAL reports to ORG .", "On DATE the ORG heard the parties and the psychological expert .", "On DATE the ORG , following another hearing in which it also consulted PERSON \u2019s foster parents , dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal . Agreeing with ORG , it found that the applicants , by their failure , had jeopardized PERSON \u2019s welfare and that there were no milder means of averting danger to the child \u2019s best interest . The applicants were unable to educate PERSON in a way which safeguarded his physical and mental integrity .", "ORG found that PERSON had been considerably injured on several occasions in the applicants\u2019 household . It could not be ascertained whether it had been PERSON \u2019s parents or third persons who had injured the child so that the criminal investigations against the applicants had been discontinued . Despite this , there were several indications , notably PERSON \u2019s repeated statements that his mother was mean , his aggressive behaviour and the fact that his parents had given different and contradictory explanations for his injuries , that PERSON had been ill - treated within his family . This could , however , be left open . Even assuming that PERSON ( then aged two ) had injured himself while romping around , his parents , despite his serious injuries , had failed to guarantee his full and prompt medical treatment . The applicants were indifferent towards physical injuries of their children . This was not least demonstrated by the fact that during the expert \u2019s presence , their children were romping around with dangerous objects like turned chairs and forks without their parents interfering . Therefore , the need to protect PERSON \u2019s physical integrity was already in itself a sufficient reason to withdraw his GPE custody .", "ORG , agreeing with the findings of the psychological expert , further found that the child \u2019s mental welfare would be jeopardized if he returned to his family . PERSON had made traumatising experiences within his family which he had started to overcome as he had settled well in his foster family and , as confirmed by ORG , had developed intensive bonds with them . On the contrary , he had never developed any relationship with his father and had told his mother that she should leave him alone . Visits of his parents had shown that there was hardly any relationship between them and PERSON any longer .", "ORG stressed that it was irrelevant that PERSON \u2019s foster parents could further PERSON considerably more from an intellectual and linguistic perspective than his parents . It was the child \u2019s welfare which was decisive for the measures to be taken .", "ORG observed that pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) , measures resulting in the separation of a child from his family were only permitted if the danger to the child \u2019s welfare could not be averted by other means , notably aids by public authorities . However , ORG had submitted that it had no pedagogues speaking LANGUAGE and that a direct communication between the pedagogue and the parents was indispensable for a social pedagogic measure to have prospects of success . The parents had not changed their attitude towards physical injuries of their children so that support would be necessary DATE and TIME which was impossible to furnish . Even if this was possible , PERSON \u2019s mental welfare would still be jeopardized for the reasons already set out .", "ORG observed that , the applicants not having had a civil marriage in GPE , it was probably only the second applicant who had custody of PERSON It had nevertheless dismissed also the first applicant \u2019s appeal for reasons of precaution .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 remonstrance . Referring to the reasons given in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , it argued in particular that , even assuming delays in the proceedings , these did as such not warrant returning PERSON to his family .", "On DATE ORG , without giving reasons for its decision , refused to admit the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint . The decision was served on the applicants\u2019 lawyer on DATE .", "Pursuant to section DATE of LAW a child \u2019s mother has sole custody if the child \u2019s parents are not married and have not deposited a declaration of joint custody recorded by a notary with the authorities .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that the family courts shall be entitled to take the necessary measures to avert dangers to the physical , mental or spiritual welfare of a child caused by an abusive exercise of parental custody , by neglecting the child or by unintentional failure of the parents if the parents are unwilling or unable to avert the dangers .", "Pursuant to section QUANTITY CARDINAL of the Civil Code measures which entail a separation of the child from the parents are only permitted if the danger can not be averted by other means , including aids by public authorities . The right of personal custody may only be withdrawn in its entirety if other measures proved unsuccessful or if it has to be assumed that they are insufficient to avert the danger ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
