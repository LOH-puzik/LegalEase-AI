Sections A - G below concern the applicable law and practice prior to the entry into force of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under CARDINAL of the DATE LAW civilian \u201d offences were also offences under LAW . Accordingly , even if the charge amounted to a civilian offence , in most cases naval personnel could be tried on that charge by the naval authorities under LAW .", "CARDINAL . At the material time a naval court - martial consisted of CARDINAL naval officers not below the rank of lieutenant , though the rank of the members might have been higher depending on the rank of the accused . Not all members belonged to the same ship or naval establishment and the captain and executive officer of the accused \u2019s ship could not sit on the court - martial .", "CARDINAL .

An application for a court - martial to be held was generally made to the convening authority by the Commanding Officer by way of a \u201c circumstantial letter \u201d . This letter reported the circumstances upon which a charge was based in sufficient detail to show the real nature and extent of the offence . Any statement made by the accused in the course of inquiries , during investigation or after he was charged had to be forwarded in a separate document annexed to the letter . A charge sheet in the prescribed form , a list of witnesses for the prosecution , summaries of evidence of those witnesses and a list of exhibits which the Prosecutor proposed to put in evidence accompanied the letter .", "CARDINAL . Based on the material submitted , the convening authority decided on the charges to be retained against an accused and , if he was satisfied with the charge sheet accompanying the circumstantial letter , he could countersign the charge sheet . He also decided on the necessity to hold a court - martial on the charges retained . In this latter respect , the convening authority was guided by the principles issued by ORG under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE and was not to order the holding of a court - martial unless satisfied that the charges were correct , that the evidence was sufficient ( namely , that there was a realistic prospect of a conviction ) and that there was a \u201c service interest \u201d in trying the matter by court - martial .

The Judge Advocate of the ORG was appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor and was removable on the same authority for inability or misbehaviour . He had to be a barrister or advocate of not less than ten years\u2019 standing . He acted as legal advisor to ORG on matters regarding the administration of justice under LAW . It was his duty to review all contested courts - martial whether the verdict was guilty or not guilty and , in particular , he advised that ORG whether a court - martial had been properly conducted according to law and whether the conviction could stand , he gave a view on the sentence and he drew attention to any gross errors or irregularities . He also gave the Chief Naval Judge Advocate his view as to the manner in which the naval barristers had conducted themselves as Judge Advocate , Prosecutor and as the accused \u2019s friend . As a result of the latter advice , \u201c there may well be downstream actions issuing guidance either specifically or generally \u201d ( LAW , Appendix CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Chief Naval Judge Advocate was a serving officer of the rank of captain of ORG and he was also a barrister . The Chief Naval Judge Advocate was assisted by a staff of serving naval officers who were barristers . His duties included assisting and consulting with the Judge Advocate of the Fleet , advising on the selection and appointment of naval barristers and sitting as Judge Advocate at naval courts - martial where the seriousness of the charges , the complexity of the trial , the rank of the accused or the interests of the Service so required .", "CARDINAL . In all other cases , a Judge Advocate was appointed to a court - martial from the staff of the Chief Naval Judge Advocate .", "CARDINAL . Before the trial the Judge Advocate appointed informed the convening authority of any defect in the constitution of the court - martial . He advised the court - martial , whether his opinion was requested or not , upon all questions of law and procedure which arose and the court - martial had to accept his advice unless there were weighty reasons for rejecting it , in which case those reasons had to be recorded .", "CARDINAL . The Judge Advocate had to ensure that the accused did not suffer any disadvantage during the hearing in consequence of , inter alia , the accused \u2019s position , ignorance or incapacity to examine witnesses . Before the closing of the trial the Judge Advocate summed up the relevant law and evidence . The Judge Advocate was not present when the court considered its finding and , if during the court - martial \u2019s deliberations on the charges further advice was required , the court - martial had to receive that advice in open court . The Judge Advocate advised the court - martial on sentence but not in open court .", "CARDINAL . The accused could object to any particular member of the court - martial and to its general constitution . If the objection to the President was upheld the court had to adjourn until another was appointed . If an objection to a member was upheld , another member could be appointed from the \u201c spare members list \u201d and , if an objection as to the constitution of the court - martial was upheld , the court - martial had to adjourn and report the matter to the convening authority . All members of the court and any other officers of the court - martial had to take a prescribed oath or affirmation ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) . The opinion of the President and of each member of the court - martial had to be given orally and on each charge separately , and their opinions had to be given in order of seniority commencing with the junior in rank . The vote of the majority determined sentence .", "CARDINAL . Before the court accepted a plea of guilty , the Judge Advocate had to ensure that the accused understood the charge to which he had pleaded and the different procedure which would result from that plea . The Prosecutor then read the circumstantial letter . Before the court proceeded to deliberate on sentence , the ORG , whenever possible , called relevant witness evidence on information in the possession of the naval authorities as to the accused \u2019s background and history which might have rendered the accused more likely to commit the offence , as to his service history and as to his previous convictions . The accused could also give evidence and call witnesses in mitigation . The court - martial had to take note of the accused \u2019s naval record ( for example , awards for gallantry ) . The members of the court - martial retired ( with the Judge Advocate ) to consider the sentence . The court - martial did not give reasons for its decision on sentence .", "CARDINAL . Having received the report of the finding and sentence , the convening authority took the necessary steps to give effect to the sentence ( either by a committal order or otherwise ) or he could order the suspension of the sentence pursuant to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW of ORG law ( Volume II ) pointed out that before the convening authority gave effect to or suspended the sentence , he ( or , inter alia , the Commander in Chief ) had to satisfy himself so far as he was able , that no errors had been made in the conduct of the court - martial likely , in his opinion , to invalidate the finding of the court - martial . If he doubted the correctness of the finding , in fact or in law , or the legality of the sentence , he could not execute the sentence pending reference to ORG . In such circumstances , the accused was retained in custody or the sentence was suspended under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The convening authority ( among other naval authorities ) could at any time , and had to at intervals of not DATE , reconsider any case of suspension and if on reconsideration it appeared that the conduct of the offender since his conviction had been such as to justify a remission of sentence , he had to remit the whole or any part of it ( section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . A certified transcript of the proceedings was completed and sent through the commander - in - chief or senior naval officer to ORG . ORG could , at any time , review a finding of guilt , any sentence awarded in respect of such a finding and any finding by a court - martial that a person was unfit to stand trial or was not guilty by reason of insanity . This had to be done by ORG in the case of a court - martial as soon as practicable after the receipt of the record of proceedings ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . A convicted person could also petition ORG against the findings or sentence or both ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) . Having reviewed the petition , ORG could , inter alia , quash or alter findings , authorise a re - trial and annul , remit or alter sentences . However , those powers could be , and were normally , carried out by ORG or by any officer so empowered by ORG . Once an appeal was lodged with ORG , the review functions of ORG ceased . ORG", "CARDINAL . The Courts - Martial Appeal Court ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) was established by ORG DATE and was confirmed by ORG DATE . The ORG had the same status and , in essence , the same procedure as ORG and considered appeals from courts - martial . The judges of this court included ordinary and ex officio judges of ORG and such judges of ORG as were nominated by the Lord Chief Justice . There was no provision for an appeal against sentence only , although certain powers of revising such sentences , pursuant to an appeal against conviction , were available to the ORG . Once an application to the ORG was received by the Registrar of the ORG , ORG duty to review ceases .", "CARDINAL .
