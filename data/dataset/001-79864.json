They are both NORP nationals from ORG . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant entered GPE on DATE and applied for asylum or a residence permit . She was not in possession of any travel documents or identity papers . On DATE her daughter , the second applicant , was born .", "According to the report of the asylum interview , the first applicant explained that she was from GPE in GPE and had lived there all her life . She lived together with her parents and CARDINAL brothers . She went to school for DATE . She had a husband named NORP . Her sister had died in DATE , allegedly following childbirth combined with female genital mutilation ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . According to NORP tradition , women were forced to undergo ORG when they gave birth . As the first applicant was pregnant , she was afraid of this inhuman practice . Neither her parents nor her husband could prevent this since it was such a deep - rooted tradition . She claimed that if she had travelled to another part of GPE to give birth to her child , she and her child would have been killed in a religious ceremony . Moreover , the first applicant \u2019s husband and parents would not have been able to protect them from ORG . Instead , she had decided to flee the country . She got in touch with a man in GPE , who offered to take her to a NORP country to seek asylum . They travelled to another NORP country . She did not know which one . From there they went by plane to LOC , and then by train to GPE . She paid MONEY to the smuggler .", "In written submissions of DATE the first applicant \u2019s counsel repeated that the first applicant \u2019s husband could not protect her from ORG . Being a businessman earning MONEY per year , he had , however , been able to finance the first applicant \u2019s escape . He was thus happy that she had escaped and given birth to a healthy child .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected the applications for asylum , refugee status or a residence permit . Firstly , it noted that ORG was not included as a ground for asylum under LAW . Secondly , it stated that ORG was prohibited by law in GPE and that this prohibition was observed in CARDINAL NORP states . Thus , if the applicants returned to CARDINAL of those states it would be unlikely that they would be forced to undergo ORG .", "The applicants appealed against the decision to the then ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden DATE hereinafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , maintaining their claims and adding that the practice of ORG was deeply rooted in GPE and persisted despite the law against it . Moreover , those carrying out the actual \u201c operation \u201d were never prosecuted or punished . Thus , the applicants alleged that they would not be able to obtain any help or protection from the authorities . The first applicant also referred to her relationship with a NORP citizen .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal , endorsing ORG reasoning and conclusion in full .", "Subsequently , the applicants lodged CARDINAL so - called \u201c new applications \u201d with ORG .", "The first one was lodged on DATE . In it the applicants added that women who refused to undergo ORG were stigmatised and excluded from society and their family . Thus , it would also be very difficult for a woman to settle in another part of the country since she would have no support , and the family and tribe to which she belonged would always find her . ORG rejected the application on DATE as it found that the applicants had provided no new information .", "The second application was lodged on DATE and enclosed a statement by a professor emeritus of NORP languages , PERSON , and a statement by a regional protection officer from the ORG , PERSON , both confirming that in general ORG was widespread in GPE . ORG turned down the application on DATE .", "The third application was lodged on DATE . In it the first applicant submitted that in fact she had already been subjected to ORG . She maintained , however , that she would not be able to protect her daughter from suffering the same fate on returning to GPE . ORG rejected the application on DATE . It considered that the applicants had failed to show that they were in need of protection in GPE or that it would violate the standards of humanity to deport them to their home country .", "On DATE the first applicant gave birth to a second daughter . The latter has applied for a residence permit to ORG , before which the case is pending .", "On DATE ORG , examining the applicants\u2019 cases on its own initiative in accordance with a temporary provision of LAW , found that the applicants could not be granted residence permits under the temporary wording of LAW , section CARDINAL b of LAW .", "In the applicants\u2019 letter of DATE the first applicant submitted that she did not have any contact with her family in GPE . Nevertheless , she had heard that the second applicant \u2019s father had been forced to leave the village because he had been harassed and accused of having let the first applicant leave the home and \u201c escape \u201d from ORG . She also claimed that she had had an ultrasound examination when she was DATE pregnant and had thus known that she was expecting a girl and naturally wanted to protect her as well .", "Following an indication given by ORG DATE under Rule CARDINAL of ORG , the applicants\u2019 deportation was stayed until further notice .", "Having decided to communicate the application on DATE , the ORG requested that the parties submit observations as to the complaint . In addition , it specifically invited the first applicant to reply to the following questions :", "\u201c Why did she choose to go to GPE ? How did she manage to leave GPE and enter GPE ? What was her itinerary ? Who bought her tickets ? How much did the tickets and the travel expenses amount to ? Can the sponsor thereof not assist the applicants financially or practically if they were to return to GPE ? Have the applicants made any effort to seek help from the various non - governmental organisations in GPE who are engaged in matters concerning women \u2019s rights ? In the affirmative , the applicants are invited to substantiate this fact . Why did the applicant mother not submit to the domestic authorities from the very beginning the fact that she had already been subjected to ORG ? Finally , she is requested to substantiate her allegation before the ORG that she had an ultrasound examination made when she was DATE pregnant . \u201d", "The first applicant never replied to the above questions .", "In her observations of DATE , she referred to the information already provided . In addition , she explained that it was through a slip of the pen that she had previously stated ( in a letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG and the application form of DATE ) that she was born in DATE . She was in fact born in DATE . Moreover , she stated that she had never been married to the second applicant \u2019s father and that he had broken off all contact with the applicants .", "A new Aliens Act ( SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , replacing the DATE LAW , entered into force on DATE . The LAW establishes a new system for examining and determining applications for asylum and residence permits . While ORG continues to carry out the initial examination , an appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision is determined by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL new migration courts . ORG is the court of final instance . It examines appeals against the decisions of the migration courts , provided leave to appeal is granted . Upon the entry into force of LAW , ORG ceased to exist . ORG acts as the alien \u2019s opposing party in proceedings before the courts . The migration courts must , as a rule , hold an oral hearing if the alien so requests .", "The provisions mainly applied in the present case were to be found in the DATE LAW , now repealed . In accordance with the LAW , an alien staying in GPE for DATE had to , as a rule , have a residence permit ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . A residence permit could be issued , inter alia , to an alien who , for humanitarian reasons , was to be allowed to settle in GPE ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . Serious physical or mental illness could , in exceptional cases , constitute humanitarian reasons for the granting of a residence permit .", "An alien who was considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection was , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d referred to an alien who was outside the country of his nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or religious or political opinion , and who was unable or , owing to such fear , unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country . This applied irrespective of whether such persecution was at the hands of the authorities of the country or whether those authorities could not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . An \u201c alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d denoted , inter alia , a person who had left the country of his nationality because he had a wellfounded fear of being sentenced to death or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . By making that a separate ground for granting a residence permit , the legislature had highlighted the importance of such considerations . The correspondence between national legislation and LAW had been emphasised as a result . From DATE the term \u201c alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d also referred to someone who had a well - founded fear of persecution because of his or her sex or homosexuality ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "In enforcing a decision on refusal of entry or expulsion , the risk of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment was taken into account . In accordance with a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien could not be sent to a country where there were reasonable grounds for believing that he would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . In addition , he could not , in principle , be sent to a country where he risked persecution ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "Until DATE an alien who was to be refused entry or expelled in accordance with a decision that had gained legal force could be granted a residence permit if he filed a so - called \u201c new application \u201d with ORG based on circumstances which had not previously been examined in the case concerning refusal of entry or expulsion . A residence permit could then be granted if the alien was entitled to a residence permit under LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW or if it would be contrary to the requirements of humanity to enforce the refusal - of - entry or expulsion decision ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b , in its wording before DATE ) .", "Amendments to LAW , section CARDINAL b , of the DATE LAW entered into force on DATE , whereby a new legal remedy of a temporary nature was introduced . The new procedure for obtaining a residence permit replaced the rules relating to new applications for a residence permit laid down in chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b , in its previous wording . Furthermore , the amendments to the DATE Act introduced additional legal grounds for granting a residence permit to aliens against whom a final expulsion order had been made . The temporary provisions remained in force until LAW entered into force on DATE . ORG continued , however , to examine applications which it had received before that date but had not yet determined .", "In some previous cases ORG has been called upon to assess applications in which it was claimed that the asylum - seeker had a well - founded fear of being exposed to female genital mutilation , if expelled to her home country ( see , e.g. , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . According to ORG , forced female genital mutilation falls under the notion of \u201c inhuman or degrading treatment \u201d in chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL LAW . ORG stated that such a procedure was in conflict with both ORG CARDINAL of LAW . From DATE forced female genital mutilation was also covered by chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL LAW , by which a well - founded fear of persecution because of one \u2019s sex constitutes a need for protection .", "Although there is no federal law in GPE against the practice of ORG , several states have prohibited ORG by law , including GPE , GPE , LOC , GPE , GPE , PERSON and LOC . In the last - mentioned state , the \u201c Prohibition of Female Circumcision and Genital Mutilation Law \u201d was passed on DATE and published in ORG on DATE . It follows from this law that it is an offence , inter alia , to circumcise or mutilate the genital organ of any female and that it is irrelevant whether or not consent is obtained . It further follows that any person who is convicted of an act prohibited by the law is liable to a fine or imprisonment for not DATE , or to both .", "There are different forms of female genital cutting ( ORG ) or female circumcision ( opponents to these practices use the term female genital mutilation ( ORG ) ) . The distinctions and definitions used by ORG are the following :", "Type I circumcision is defined as a clitoridotomy and perhaps the excision of part or all of the clitoris . A clitoridotomy ( also called \u201c hoodectomy \u201d in slang ) involves the removal or splitting of the clitoral hood .", "Type II circumcision is more extensive than type I , meaning a clitoridectomy and sometimes also the removal of the labia minora . A clitoridectomy means the partial or total removal of the external part of the clitoris .", "Type III is regarded as the most severe form of female circumcision , also referred to as infibulation or pharaonic circumcision . Infibulation replaces the vulva with a wall of flesh from the pubis to the anus , except for a pencilsize opening at the inferior portion of the vulva to allow urine and menstrual blood to pass through . After excision , the labia are sewn together , and since the skin is abraded and raw after being cut , the CARDINAL surfaces will join via the natural healing and scar - formation process to form a smooth surface . The girl \u2019s legs are tied together for DATE to prevent her from moving the wound . Infibulation is often carried out by a \u201c gedda \u201d , or matron of the village , without anaesthetic , on girls DATE .", "According to ORG \u2019s \u201c ORG , DATE , LAW \u201d , ORG \u2019s prevalence in GPE among women aged CARDINAL amounted to PERCENT ( figure CARDINAL ) .

While practiced in all parts of the country , ORG was much more prevalent in the south . Women from northern states were less likely to undergo the severe type of ORG known as infibulation . The age at which women and girls were subjected to the practice varied from DATE of life until after a woman delivers her first child ; however , DATE of the NDHS DATE survey respondents who had undergone ORG had the procedure before their first birthday . According to the survey , the principal perceived \u2018 GPE of ORG include maintaining chastity / virginity before marriage , giving the victim better marriage prospects , providing more sexual pleasure for men ( primarily according to male respondents ) , and aiding safe childbirth .", "The federal government publicly opposed ORG but took no legal action to curb the practice . Because of the considerable problems that anti - FGM groups faced at the federal level , most refocused their energies on combating the practice at the state and ORG levels . PERSON , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , and GPE banned ORG . However , once a state legislature criminalized ORG , NGOs found that they had to convince the ORG authorities that state laws were applicable in their districts . ORG , women \u2019s groups , and many NGOs sponsored public awareness projects to educate communities about the health hazards of ORG . They worked to eradicate the practice , but they had limited contact with health care workers on the medical effects of ORG .", "On DATE ] , ORG enacted a law aimed at punishing those who encourage ORG .

In ORG , in particular , the police were actively implementing the prohibition on ORG . In the rest of the states where ORG was prohibited it was not clear to what extent the police and other authorities were actually enforcing the prohibition .
