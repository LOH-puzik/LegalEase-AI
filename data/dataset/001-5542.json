He is represented before the ORG by Ms. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their agent , Mr C.A. Whomersley of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was placed under surveillance by ORG and Excise officers after he was seen having a business meeting with CARDINAL NORP citizens , \u201c J \u201d and \u201c O \u201d , both of whom had been under investigation since DATE .", "The applicant was arrested on DATE . On DATE he was charged with conspiracy to import cannabis , cannabis resin and cocaine and with the importation of cocaine contrary to Section CARDINAL ) of the ORG and Excise Management Act DATE . On CARDINAL DATE the charge against the applicant relating to the alleged conspiracy to import cannabis and cannabis resin was withdrawn .", "The applicant \u2019s trial at the Inner London Crown Court commenced on DATE . The prosecution claimed that DATE he had conspired with J. to import large quantities of cocaine into GPE . On DATE he had smuggled in QUANTITY of cocaine , worth GBP CARDINAL , hidden in satellite receiver boxes in his car . CARDINAL of the bags had the applicant \u2019s fingerprints on it . It was claimed that he had used his company , \u201c Eurosales \u201d , as a cover .", "The applicant gave evidence at trial . He admitted bringing the cocaine into GPE , but claimed not to have known that the satellite box contained drugs , believing instead that he was smuggling jewellery . He stated that he had had previous dealings with PERSON in connection with valuable watches and had put them in touch with his supplier . They had asked him to bring over a consignment of jewellery on his next business trip of DATE .", "J. pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to evade the restrictions on the importation of both cannabis and cocaine . CARDINAL other co - defendants , O. , PERSON and NORP , pleaded guilty to conspiracy to evade the restrictions on the importation of cannabis .", "Prior to the trial , the prosecution made an ex parte application to the trial judge in accordance with ORG guidelines in NORP v. PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( see below ) . The judge ruled there was no obligation on the prosecution to make further disclosure and indicated that he would review his decision during the course of the trial . The defence was notified that an application would be made , but was not informed of the category of material which the prosecution sought to withhold on grounds of public interest immunity .", "At various points during the trial the judge prohibited questioning on certain issues , including whether or not ORG and Excise had relied on an informer and details relating to the manner in which surveillance of the applicant had been carried out . On DATE the judge stopped defence counsel from asking any questions about undisclosed sensitive material . When defence counsel asked how he would know if his questions were straying into sensitive areas , he was referred to a list of questions produced DATE prior to the trial .", "In his summing - up the judge told the jury that there were some areas of investigation which he had not allowed to be opened up through disclosure or cross - examination . Defence counsel told the jury that there was a risk that the restrictions on questioning could result in a miscarriage of justice .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted of conspiracy to contravene LAW ) of ORG in relation to the importation of a Class A controlled drug . On DATE he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . A confiscation order in the sum of GBP CARDINAL was also imposed under LAW DATE with a consecutive sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment in default of payment .", "On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal against conviction and sentence , commenting :", "\u201c Before the hearing we had the advantage of looking at the material which was put before the trial judge . Each member of this court has read it . We have no doubt , having read it and being fully apprised of the issues in the case and the basis upon which the defence sought to have further material disclosed , that the trial judge was correct in his ruling . [ The applicant \u2019s ] counsel frankly and properly indicated to this court that since he did not know what the material was and since he knew that we had seen it , he could not develop the grounds upon which he had relied beyond reasserting them and inviting us to take a different view from that taken by the trial judge . Not only do we consider that the trial judge was correct in his decision , but we consider that he followed the correct procedure to the letter in everything he did in relation to the ex parte application and the decisions arising from it . \u201d", "ORG also concluded that the judge had been correct to withhold information regarding the manner in which surveillance had been carried out , noting that the work of ORG and Excise would be hampered if such information were made known .", "At common law , the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial . The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence .", "In DATE the Attorney - General issued Guidelines , which did not have the force of law , concerning exceptions to the common law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ( ( DATE ) CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON ( \u201c the LAW ) ) . The LAW attempted to codify the rules of disclosure and to define the prosecution \u2019s power to withhold \u201c unused material \u201d . Under paragraph CARDINAL , \u201c unused material \u201d was defined as :", "\u201c ( i ) All witness statements and documents which are not included in the committal bundle served on the defence ; ( ii ) the statements of any witnesses who are to be called to give evidence at the committal and ( if not in the bundle ) any documents referred to therein ; ( iii ) the unedited version(s ) of any edited statements or composite statement included in the committal bundles . \u201d", "According to the LAW , the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within CARDINAL of the categories set out in paragraph CARDINAL . CARDINAL of these categories ( CARDINAL ) ) was \u201c sensitive \u201d material which , because of its sensitivity , it would not be in the public interest to disclose . \u201c Sensitive material \u201d was defined as follows :", "\u201c ( a ) it deals with matters of national security ; or it is by , or discloses the identity of , a member of ORG who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known ; ( b ) it is by , or discloses the identity of , an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger ; ( c ) it is by , or discloses the identity of , a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known ; ( d ) it contains details which , if they became known , might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect ; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime ; ( e ) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed , at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier - e.g. a bank official ; ( f ) it relates to other offences by , or serious allegations against , someone who is not an accused , or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him ; ( g ) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife . \u201d", "According to paragraph CARDINAL , \u201c in deciding whether or not statements containing sensitive material should be disclosed , a balance should be struck between the degree of sensitivity and the extent to which the information might assist the defence \u201d . The decision as to whether or not the balance in a particular case required disclosure of sensitive material was CARDINAL for the prosecution , although any doubt should be resolved in favour of disclosure . If either before or during the trial it became apparent that a duty to disclose had arisen , but that disclosure would not be in the public interest because of the sensitivity of the material , the prosecution would have to be abandoned .", "Since DATE the Guidelines have been superseded by the common law , notably by a number of decisions of ORG . In NORP v. Ward ( [ DATE ] Weekly Law Reports p. CARDINAL ) ORG dealt with the duties of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defence and the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claimed public interest immunity . It stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to be the judge of where the proper balance lay in a particular case , because :", "\u201c ... [ When ] the prosecution acted as judge in their own cause on the issue of public interest immunity in this case they committed a significant number of errors which affected the fairness of the proceedings . Policy considerations therefore powerfully reinforce the view that it would be wrong to allow the prosecution to withhold material documents without giving any notice of that fact to the defence . If , in a wholly exceptional case , the prosecution are not prepared to have the issue of public interest immunity determined by a court , the result must inevitably be that the prosecution will have to be abandoned . \u201d", "ORG described the balancing exercise to be performed by the judge as follows :", "\u201c ... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against , on the other hand , the interests of justice . Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life , the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed \u201d .", "In NORP v. PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( [ DATE ] Weekly Law Reports p. CARDINAL ) , ORG held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity , and outlined CARDINAL different procedures to be adopted . The first procedure , which had generally to be followed , was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held . The defence then had the opportunity to make representations to the court . Secondly , however , where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed , the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made , but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte . The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question . In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
