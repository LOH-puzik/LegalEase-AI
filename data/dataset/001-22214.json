{"ITEMID": "001-22214", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ITA", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "GAUDIO v. ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is represented before the ORG by Mr A. Amenduni , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the manager of the NORP DATE newspaper ORG .", "In DATE an article was published about Mr F.B. , who was the mayor of ORG until DATE . It was entitled \u201c Mayor [ F.]B. seeks reimbursement on the basis of false invoices \u201d ( \u201c Il Sindaco [ PERSON chiede rimborsi con fatture false \u201d ) . In the article the applicant expressed himself as follows :", "\u201c ORG settled some entertainment expenses incurred on DATE of the same year [ DATE ] by the then mayor , the socialist ORG , on the occasion of the passing through PERSON of the long - distance runner PERSON invoices do not correspond to the day of the celebration . ( ... ) The first invoice is dated DATE . ( ... ) If the celebration was held on DATE only , how is it possible that the ceremony had taken place DATE in advance and on different DATE ? \u201d", "\u201c ORG liquidava alcune spese di rappresentanza sostenute il CARDINAL Settembre dello stesso anno [ DATE ] dall\u2019allora GPE , il socialista ORG , in GPE da Adelfia del podista L.M. Due fatture non trovano alcun riscontro con il giorno in cui si e\u2019 svolta la manifestazione ( ... ) GPE prima fattura porta la data del DATE ( ... ) Se la manifestazione si e\u2019 svolta nella sola giornata del DATE , com\u2019e\u2019 possibile che i convenevoli sono stati consumati con alcuni mesi di anticipo ed in giorni differenti ? \u201d .", "Copies of the invoices were also published .", "In DATE , ORG had been dissolved by a judgment of ORG . On DATE a ORG Commissioner had been appointed and on DATE PERSON , the mayor , had handed over to him .", "On DATE , acting on a complaint by PERSON , the judge responsible for preliminary investigations committed the applicant for trial . He was accused of defamation .", "On DATE ORG found the accused guilty of defamation within the meaning of LAW , granting mitigating circumstances . It sentenced the applicant to a fine of MONEY ( ITL ) and ordered him to pay costs and damages to be determined in separate proceedings . The court held that the defamatory nature of the article was evidenced principally by the fact that the applicant had associated the mayor \u2019s name with a request for reimbursement of false invoices without the necessary checks of the truth of the events . In particular , the court noted that the applicant had only verified that PERSON was ORG \u2019s mayor at the time of the issue of the invoices and that if he had ascertained the truth more fully , the applicant would have noticed the errors in the Government Commissioner \u2019s deliberation of CARDINAL DATE . In fact , the latter had wrongly linked both the invoices of CARDINAL DATE and DATE to the passing through of the long - distance runner on DATE . In reality that event had taken place on DATE and the invoice of CARDINAL DATE had been issued for a mineral - water supply to ORG . The court held that the defamatory nature of the article was also evidenced by the fact that the article had been published DATE after the event . The court added that the invoices could be not considered false because they had been issued for services which had really been provided . The court concluded that the applicant was not entitled to assert the right to report current events ( diritto di cronaca ) and comment on them ( diritto di critica ) because , in the absence of the truth of the facts and of their objective reference , the article appeared to be the result of a specific intention to muckrake in respect of a particular person with a defamatory aim .", "The applicant appealed . Relying on the right to report current events and to comment on them , he submitted that the divulgation of the news was justified by the public interest in knowing how ORG was spending public money . He alleged that the article also contained a putative truth ( putativamente vera ) because he had examined the Government Commissioner \u2019s deliberation and the enclosed documents . Consequently , he had acted in good faith in relation to the inexactitudes he was accused of .", "Evidence was heard from the applicant who declared that before publication he had telephoned the long - distance runner who told him that he had not taken part in any celebration on DATE because he had left ORG DATE before .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG acquitted the applicant because the facts did not amount to a crime . The court confirmed that the invoices could not be considered false because they had been issued for services which had genuinely been carried out . Nevertheless , it held that the applicant \u2019s doubts and considerations about irregularities in the proceedings had been justified by adequate evidential support , namely the Government Commissioner \u2019s deliberation , that is , a public document . Consequently the court held that the applicant had sufficiently ascertained the facts before publication and concluded that he had been acted in good faith about the inexactitudes he was accused of .", "ORG and PERSON lodged an application with ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG overturned the judgment of ORG of DATE and remitted the case to another division of the same court to re - examine it . ORG held that the grounds of ORG judgment of DATE were affected by flawed logic , because it had confirmed that the invoices could not be considered false , but held that the applicant had sufficiently ascertained the facts before publication . The court alleged that the applicant , as the manager of the newspaper , could not have been unaware that on DATE , when the long - distance runner was passing through , Mr F.B. was no longer mayor , that the entertainment expenses could not be attributed to him and that the invoice expenses were genuine and not to be linked with the celebrations of CARDINAL DATE .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG re - examined the case , upheld ORG judgment of DATE and awarded costs against the applicant . The court held that the absence of good faith was evidenced first by the fact that the title of the article associated the mayor \u2019s name with a request for reimbursement of false invoices ; second by the fact that the applicant , as the manager of the newspaper , could not have been unaware of the political events in ORG and , in particular , that Mr F.B. was no longer the mayor at the time of the celebrations of DATE ; and finally , by the fact that the applicant had stated that PERSON had asked for reimbursements regardless of the fact that PERSON name was written neither on the invoices nor in the ORG Commissioner \u2019s deliberation .", "The applicant lodged an application with ORG . First , he stressed an error in ORG judgment of DATE in relation to the date on which the long - distance runner had been passing through ( it was on DATE and not on DATE ) . He also stressed an error in ORG judgment of DATE which had stated that on CARDINAL DATE PERSON was no longer the mayor , whereas he had given the court the documentary evidence that PERSON had handed over to the Government Commissioner on CARDINAL DATE . In relation to the accusations of defamation , the applicant alleged that he had noticed the error in the Government Commissioner \u2019s deliberation about the date of the long - distance runner celebrations and about the ORG session of CARDINAL DATE which the supply of mineral - water was destined to , because on that date no session had taken place . The applicant also alleged that before publication he had telephoned the long - distance runner who told him that he had never taken part in the celebration of DATE because he had left ORG DATE before . Finally , the applicant held that his aim was not to defame anyone , but to inform readers how public money was being spent by public authorities .", "In a judgment of DATE , deposited with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the application and upheld ORG decision of DATE . The court held that the applicant \u2019s allegations were irrelevant because he had not , in any case , given evidence that the invoices were false and that they had to be attributed to PERSON Consequently , the court declared the appeal inadmissible and sentenced the applicant to a fine of ITL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL and awarded costs against him ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
