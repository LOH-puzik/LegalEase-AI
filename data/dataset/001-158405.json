He was represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On CARDINAL May DATE ORG declared unconstitutional several provisions of the Law on DATE State Budget and Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts which had been the basis for re - calculation and eventual decrease of the applicant \u2019s PERSON pension .", "In DATE , referring to the above decision of ORG , the applicant lodged a civil claim with ORG of GPE against ORG , complaining that as from DATE the amount of his Chornobyl pension was too low contrary to the LAW and seeking damages caused by a legislative act which had decreased his pension and later had been recognized unconstitutional . He invoked Articles DATE and CARDINAL of LAW in this respect .", "By judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim on the ground that the conditions and mechanisms for implementation of the provisions of Articles DATE LAW had not been established by the legislation . Furthermore , the court noted that the applicant did not prove any damage caused to him , given that he alleged damages to have been sustained as from DATE , whilst the provisions found unconstitutional lost their legal force on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE and DATE respectively ORG and ORG upheld the decision of the first - instance court confirming : that the applicant failed to meet the conditions laid down by Articles DATE and CARDINAL ; and that compensation for material damage as guaranteed by Articles DATE and CARDINAL would only have been possible if a special law establishing the conditions and procedure for such compensation had been enacted . The court of appeal noted in particular that , in the circumstances referred to by the claimant , the possibility of obtaining compensation in respect of pecuniary damage is linked to the existence of legislation establishing the specific conditions and the relevant procedure . It concluded that , as such legislation did not exist , the first - instance court had rightly decided that the applicant \u2019s claims were unfounded .", "The Civil Code , which came into force in DATE , lays down different obligations as to compensation in respect of damage . Among others , CARDINAL articles , namely Articles DATE , relied on by the applicant in the domestic proceedings , provide for the ORG to compensate the victims of unlawful decisions of ORG authorities . The articles in question provide as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Pecuniary damage caused to a natural person or legal entity by unlawful decisions , actions or omissions of ORG authorities , authorities of GPE or local self - governance authorities in the course of the exercise of their powers shall be compensated for by the ORG , GPE or local self - governance regardless of the fault of these bodies . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Pecuniary damage caused to a natural person or legal entities as a result of adoption by ORG authorities , authorities of GPE or a local self - governance authority of a normative - legal act that was declared illegal and annulled , shall be compensated for by the ORG , GPE or the local self - governance authority regardless of the fault of officers and employees of these bodies . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .
