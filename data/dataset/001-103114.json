On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG Between CARDINAL DATE ( date of the first application ) and DATE , Mr PERSON submitted CARDINAL applications for release , which were all dismissed by ORG of the PERSON or ORG on the grounds that the length of the proceedings was reasonable in view of the serious charges against the applicant and the gravity and complexity of the facts , that public order had been seriously prejudiced in the region and that there was a risk that he would abscond if released . The applicant lodged CARDINAL appeals on points of law , which were all dismissed .", "When CARDINAL of the applications for release was being heard , on DATE , the applicant 's lawyer requested his immediate release on the ground that the file did not contain any warrant ordering his detention . ORG adjourned the case to CARDINAL DATE . On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged CARDINAL appeals on points of law against this decision . On DATE ORG refused to order his immediate release . It found that the missing warrant was in the file and rejected the argument concerning the identity of the person named in it , holding that the reference to PERSON rather than PERSON in the committal warrant of CARDINAL DATE had been due to a clerical error .", "ORG delivered CARDINAL judgments on DATE . In the first , it declared the appeal against the adjournment decision inadmissible ; in the second , it declared the submission alleging a defect in the committal warrant inadmissible , but remitted the case to ORG , finding of its own motion that the impugned decision had not contained a statement of the reasons on which it was based . On DATE ORG dismissed the application , holding that , in view of the circumstances , the length of the proceedings had not been excessive .", "The applicant appealed on points of law against the latter decision , alleging , inter alia , a violation of LAW para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW . In a judgment of DATE ORG declared the appeal devoid of purpose following the applicant 's committal for trial at FAC on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
