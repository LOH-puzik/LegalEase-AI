The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a master builder and is a member of ORG ( \u201c the MBA \u201d ) . Under LAW ( Law no . DATE \u201c the DATE LAW ) , he was under an obligation to pay a levy known as the \u201c industry charge \u201d to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , an organisation of which the applicant was not a member and to which the MBA was not affiliated . LAW provided that a charge of PERCENT should be levied on all industrial activities in GPE as defined in the LAW . The definition included all activities coming under activity code numbers enumerated in an appendix to the LAW . Private - sector enterprises not covered by the code numbers were not subject to the industry charge . This was the case , for example , for enterprises in the meat - processing , milk - processing and fish - processing industries . Other enterprises in the food and drink industry were covered . Enterprises entirely under public ownership or established by special statute were not covered ( section CARDINAL ) . Revenues from the industry charge were to be transferred to the ORG , and were to be used for the promotion and development of industry in GPE ( section CARDINAL ) . ORG was to receive PERCENT of the charge collected in order to cover the costs of its collection ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL persons ( legal persons and self - employed individuals ) paid the industry charge . The ORG had CARDINAL members ( enterprises and self - employed individuals ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government supplied copies of the ORG \u2019s reports to ORG regarding the disbursement of the industry charge for DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s report for DATE ( dated DATE ) stated :", "\u201c The GPE \u2019s accounts have not indicated whether particular operational items are paid for with funds from membership fees , capital income or the industry charge , because an overwhelming proportion of its work benefits industrial companies whether they are members of the ORG or not . ORG has not expressed any reservation regarding this arrangement , and legislation concerning the industry charge imposes no other requirements .", "The Federation and ORG are , however , in agreement about the requirement for a more detailed account of how the industry charge is disbursed , and that has been done in this report . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under the title \u201c Disbursement of the industry charge in DATE according to the ORG \u2019s accounts \u201d , the report included a table showing the \u201c Income and expenditure according to ORG audited accounts for DATE \u201d . In a separate column the table indicated the percentage of funds originating from the industry charge in relation to each item and sub - item . This included the following items : \u201c Operating profits \u201d and \u201c Operating expenses \u201d . It also detailed \u201c Further itemisation of disbursement of the industry charge according to the accounts \u201d , namely : ( CARDINAL ) \u201c Wages and related expenses \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c Meetings and conferences \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c Promotional activities \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c Publications \u201d ; ( CARDINAL ) \u201c Branches and special projects \u201d ; and ( CARDINAL ) \u201c General and administrative expenses \u201d .", "For each of these sub - items the report contained explanatory notes , providing information on the treatment of members as compared with non - members . For example , under sub - item ( CARDINAL ) it was stated that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL DATE concerned work that benefited members only . With reference to sub - item ( CARDINAL ) it was stated that ORG exhibitions were open to everyone and that ORG members enjoyed a discount on participation fees . Under sub - item ( CARDINAL ) it was stated that non - members could access the quality management project but would be charged a higher fee than members .", "CARDINAL . From the table it appears that in DATE the ORG \u2019s operating revenues totalled CARDINAL NORP kr\u00f3nur ( ORG ) , of which ORG CARDINAL had originated from the industry charge transferred to the ORG by ORG ; ORG CARDINAL from membership fees ; and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL from other income . DATE , the operating expenses had totalled ORG CARDINAL , of which ISK CARDINAL ( PERCENT ) had been spent on public projects ( comprising ORG CARDINAL derived from the industry charge and ISK CARDINAL from membership fees and other income ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government explained that in fulfilling its role and objectives of promoting NORP industry pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , the ORG notably worked to develop and protect the image of the industry , allocated large amounts of the funds obtained though the industry charge to training , gave opinions on behalf of the business community on draft legislation and regulations in the sphere of environmental affairs , and instilled in public authorities the need to observe restraint in public procurement and to observe clear and transparent tender rules .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , the applicant paid the following amounts in industry charge for DATE indicated : for DATE ORG CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) ; for DATE ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) ; for DATE ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) ; and for DATE ISK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged proceedings against the ORG with ORG , requesting an order to exempt him from the charges imposed on him in respect of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG found in favour of the ORG and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , arguing , inter alia , that section CARDINAL of the DATE Act meant that all individuals and companies engaged in particular business activities had to pay membership fees to the ORG , irrespective of whether they were members or not . The applicant considered that LAW , which provided for the membership charge , clearly reflected its nature in that , as was provided therein , ORG members paying an industry charge which was transferred to the ORG should have that part deducted from their membership fees . Thus , by the levy and collection of the charge , membership of the ORG was in fact made compulsory for others , although they enjoyed no rights vis - \u00e0 - vis the ORG . Consequently , the industry charge was merely a membership fee to the ORG . The applicant submitted that he was a member of the MBA , to which he paid his fees and through which he considered his interests to be best served , and he had no wish to be a member of the ORG . The latter pursued policies with which he disagreed and which were contrary to his own interests . The compulsory membership of the ORG was incompatible with his right to freedom of association as protected by LAW . The applicant also argued that by virtue of LAW , he was unjustifiably taxed in excess of other taxes and that , under the LAW , a limited group was being taxed \u201c for the benefit of another limited group or the restricted interests of others \u201d . Finally , he submitted that the imposition of the charge amounted to discrimination in breach of LAW , as the taxation was dependent upon the ownership structure of an enterprise , and the enumeration of activity code numbers , on which the taxation was based , was haphazard in nature .", "The ORG disputed the applicant \u2019s submission that the industry charge constituted a membership fee to the ORG . They argued that by law it was a tax levied by the ORG on particular groups of individuals and legal persons , in accordance with general and applicable standards , without anything being required in return . By the same LAW , the decision had been taken to have the charge transferred to the ORG , which was to use it for the promotion and development of NORP industry . Such an allocation of tax revenues to an association provided for by law did not mean that those who paid the relevant tax were thereby obliged by law to become members of it . The charge was not expected to be used for the benefit of the members alone , but for the benefit of all industries and industrial development in GPE , under the supervision of ORG . Any discounts on membership fees were decided unilaterally by the ORG , without any connection to the assessment and collection of the charge . The ORG also denied that the DATE Act involved discrimination between persons who were in the appellant \u2019s situation and those who enjoyed an exemption from the charge . It was a reasonable and objective arrangement to exempt public enterprises from the charge , and it was in the nature of things that the considerations that applied to companies under public ownership were different from those relating to private enterprises . The ORG also argued that public support for industry and industrial development sometimes took the form of launching industrial activities that others were not capable of initiating . Finally , the number of publicly owned industrial enterprises had been greatly reduced in DATE . The ORG also disputed the allegation that the enumeration of activity code numbers governing the taxation had been haphazard .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG , by CARDINAL votes to one , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld ORG judgment . It held as follows :", "\u201c As mentioned in ORG judgment , ORG rendered a judgment on DATE in case no . CARDINAL , PERSON v. GPE , published at page CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s Reports for DATE . The appellant in that case requested an exemption from his liability to pay the industry loan fund charge and the industry charge for DATE . He based his case on arguments that are to a significant degree identical to those invoked by the appellant in the present case . ORG accepts the view of the respondent in that the above - mentioned case must be regarded as the precedent in the case now to be determined , to the extent that the issues raised by the appellant in support of his present claim were determined in that case .", "In the earlier case the appellant , as here , maintained that as a result of his liability to pay the industry charge , which is to be transferred to ORG , he was obliged to be a member of ORG . ORG mentioned in its judgment that although the charge was transferred to the Federation , it was to be used for a certain purpose ( see section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) , and did not constitute a grant to ORG . The use of the revenues was subject to the supervision of ORG . The ORG accepted that this arrangement did not involve obligatory membership of ORG in breach of the LAW and LAW [ on Human Rights ] . It also noted that even if ORG had exceeded the boundaries laid down in the [ DATE ] Act , this could not have the effect of exempting the appellant from paying the charge . With this in mind , and in other respects by reference to the grounds stated in the contested judgment , the ORG must reject the conclusion that the appellant \u2019s arguments in this regard may lead to a granting of his request . Bearing in mind that ORG is under a legal duty to use the revenues from the industry charge for promoting NORP industries and industrial development , and consequently for the benefit of the activities being taxed , the ORG can not accept that the legislature thus exceeded its powers .", "The appellant submits that equality was not respected , since enterprises under public ownership may be exempted from the charge . As regards this argument , it must be noted that various factors distinguish enterprises under public ownership from privately owned enterprises , and in various fields their taxation is governed by different considerations , as seen in NORP tax legislation in general . In his written submissions , the appellant did not present a comparison of his situation vis - \u00e0 - vis any particular public enterprises . It has not been established that any discrimination has taken place between the appellant and the parties to whom the exemptions of the [ DATE ] Act apply . Finally , the appellant bases his request on the assertion that the activity code enumeration , by reference to which taxation under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act takes place , is haphazard in nature . The charge is levied on industry , subsequently defined as any activity coming under the activity code numbers enumerated in the classification of NORP business activities in an appendix to LAW , as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Industry , thus defined , does not only cover manufacturing industry , but also processing and services , including the construction industry . This defines the activities to be included under the term \u2018 industry\u2019 within the meaning of the [ CARDINAL ] Act , distinguishing them from other fields of economic activity , including activities that have developed within the fields of agriculture and fishing . Such classification of economic activity has furthermore been recognised as a basis for other forms of taxation other than the industry charge . The appellant \u2019s claim can not be granted on the basis of the arguments presented . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The dissenting member of ORG , Mr Justice PERSON , gave a separate opinion containing , inter alia , the following reasons :", "\u201c I", "The original LAW was Law no . CARDINAL . It was stated in the explanatory notes to the draft law that it had been submitted in accordance with a recommendation of the ORG , ORG , and ORG . These provided a detailed report , which apparently was adopted verbatim in the explanatory notes . It included the observation that \u2018 ... it may be noted that industrial enterprises and self - employed persons in industry collect various taxes for public authorities , both from their employees and from the consumers . The tax collection they carry out and are responsible for amounts to CARDINAL DATE , entirely without remuneration . It therefore seems reasonable that the ORG should undertake to collect , by way of compensation for these parties , a charge which amounts to only a small fraction of what they collect for the ORG . This source of revenue should create a financial basis for more active participation by professional federations within NORP industry in shaping future industrial development\u2019 . The LAW also contained a provision similar to that of the LAW now in effect , that ORG should be sent an DATE report on the use of the revenues derived from the charge . In this context , it was mentioned in the explanatory notes that this was a \u2018 provision intended to ensure that public authorities will be given a reasonable account of how the industry charge is PERSON .", "Law no . CARDINAL was superseded by the present PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It was stated in the explanatory notes to the [ DATE ] Act that those liable for the charge would be the same as before , but a system of reference to activity code numbers in accordance with the business activity classification of ORG was adopted in order to \u2018 remove any doubt as to who are liable for this ORG . It was furthermore provided that the revenues derived from the charge should be transferred to the ORG in their entirety , whereas under LAW they had been distributed between ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG . At the same time the tax base was changed , since the municipal business tax , on which the level of tax had previously been determined , had been abolished .", "II", "According to the Articles of its Statute , the ORG is a federation of enterprises , self - employed persons , trades and master builders\u2019 associations , who jointly wish to pursue common goals as enumerated in LAW . This LAW states the purpose and role of the Federation in QUANTITY points , as involving the promotion of NORP industries in various ways and supporting the members by all the means which are detailed therein . According to the documents submitted , the association involves itself with political issues , for example as regards membership of ORG and taxation in various fields . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL , each member of the Federation enjoys voting rights at its meetings in proportion to his paid membership fees . It is provided in Article CARDINAL that the membership fees are a maximum of PERCENT of DATE turnover , but the board of ORG may decide to collect lower membership fees . The provision goes on to state that \u2018 [ p]arties paying an industry charge that is transferred to the Federation shall have that part recognised , and deducted when their membership fees to ORG are calculated . If the industry charge is no longer levied , this deduction shall automatically be abolished . The voting right of each member shall be calculated on the basis of his paid membership fee . Management and decision - making within the Federation is , as generally within associations , the responsibility of its board and the managing director\u2019 .", "Documents submitted from the ORG relating to the period to which the [ applicant \u2019s ] requests pertain do not contain a clear breakdown of how the industry charge is used . It also appears from a comment in the GPE \u2019s reports on the use of the charge for DATE and DATE that the ORG does \u2018 not keep separate accounts of whether the individual elements of the GPE \u2019s operations are financed by monies derived from membership fees , capital income , or the industry ORG . A similar declaration on this point is found in the report to the Minister in respect of DATE , but a report for DATE is not in the case file . The Federation \u2019s reports to the Minister are also in other respects similar from DATE . In fact the case file seems to permit the inference that part of the charge is used for the general management of ORG . It can not be seen from the submissions in this case that ORG has made any observations concerning the use of the charge , and in a letter to ORG of DATE , following complaints relating to the use of the charge , he expresses the following opinion : \u2018 As can be clearly seen from LAW , the ORG has the unrestricted power to decide how the charge is allocated , and ORG can not interfere with this as long as it remains within the framework of the law.\u2019 It can be seen from the submitted reports of the ORG for the periods to which this case relates that the arrangement has been used for granting those members of ORG who pay the industry charge a discount on their membership fees equal to the amount of the charge . As an example , the following comment in the GPE \u2019s report to ORG for DATE may be quoted : \u2018 It may be pointed out that members who pay the industry charge have it deducted in full from their membership fees to ORG . It would not be considered proper that companies within the Federation that are liable to the industry charge should pay more to the Federation \u2019s activities than companies that are members , but not liable to the charge . In this way all the member companies of the Federation make equal payments to the Federation , irrespective of whether they are liable to the industry charge or not . On the other hand other companies , remaining outside , only pay the industry charge and thus make a contribution to the general protection of the interests of NORP industries.\u2019", "III", "Provisions on freedom of association are found in LAW ... They contain more detailed rules on freedom of association than those directly expressed in LAW Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW provides : \u2018 No one may be obliged to be a member of any association . Membership of an association may , however , be made obligatory by law if this is necessary in order to enable an association to discharge its functions in the public interest or on account of the rights of others.\u2019", "As noted above , the purpose of the industry charge is , according to LAW , the promotion of NORP industry , but it is also expressly provided that only the part of the charge corresponding to the cost of its collection is to be transferred to ORG . The remainder is transferred to the ORG , to be used as the GPE decides . It also seems that an unspecified proportion of the charge is used for the general activities of the ORG as its board may decide . It can furthermore not be seen from the provisions of LAW that the Minister of Industry is adequately empowered to ensure that the charge is used in the manner provided for in the LAW ; in this regard , the Minister simply receives the reports of the ORG . For these reasons the provisions of the DATE Act can not be regarded as ensuring that the charge will be used for the activities the LAW requires .", "The payment of membership fees to an association is generally a chief obligation of the members of an association that requires such payments . The applicant is a member of ORG . Neither he nor his association is a member of the ORG . The applicant does not agree with the GPE \u2019s objectives in various fields , considering , as mentioned in the contested judgment , that the GPE acts contrary to his interests , and indeed also contrary to those of many others within industry who also pay the industry charge without being members of ORG . Nevertheless , by virtue of LAW , the [ applicant ] is bound by a duty to pay the charge , which , as described , is transferred to a free association with the purpose of protecting the interests of those active in NORP industries and those of its members , as these interests are assessed at any particular time by a decision of the managing director and the board , without any significant involvement of public authorities .", "When considering the above and the history of LAW , and in view of the use of the charge , without objection , for the general activities of the Federation , the arrangement provided for in the LAW must be seen as involving , in fact , a duty on the part of the appellant to take a significant part in the Federation \u2019s activities without his agreement . The above provisions of LAW , concerning people \u2019s rights to remain outside associations , must be interpreted as prohibiting an arrangement such as provided for by LAW , unless that arrangement fulfils the requirements laid down in the second paragraph of the LAW . The ORG is not an association engaged in activities of the kind referred to therein . For this reason in itself , the appellant \u2019s request for an exemption from his liability to pay the industry charge for DATE should be granted , and the respondent should be ordered to pay the appellant the costs of the case in ORG as well as before ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article QUANTITY of LAW provide :", "\u201c Associations may be formed without prior permission for any lawful purpose , including political associations and trade unions . An association may not be dissolved by administrative decision . The activities of an association found to be in furtherance of unlawful objectives may , however , be enjoined , in which case legal action shall be brought without undue delay for a judgment dissolving the association .", "No one may be obliged to be a member of any association . Membership of an association may , however , be made obligatory by law if this is necessary in order to enable an association to discharge its functions in the public interest or on account of the rights of others . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant provisions of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) read :", "\u201c A charge of PERCENT , the industry charge , shall be levied on all NORP industries as defined in section CARDINAL . The charge shall be based on the turnover as provided for in LAW of ORG , plus any revenue exempted from value - added tax pursuant to section CARDINAL of that Act .", "The assessment and collection of the industry charge shall be governed by the provisions of Chapters VII - XIV of the Income and LAW , as applicable .", "The State ORG shall receive PERCENT of the industry charge collected in accordance with the first paragraph to cover the cost of its collection .", "The amounts paid under the industry charge are deductible from the revenue of DATE on which the level of tax is based . \u201d", "\u201c Any activity coming under the activity code numbers enumerated in the appendix to this Act shall be included in the term \u2018 industry\u2019 .", "Enterprises entirely under public ownership , and enterprises formed under particular acts of law to be under public ownership to a significant extent , shall be exempt from the charge , unless a provision to the contrary is made in the LAW in question . \u201d", "\u201c Revenues derived from the industry charge shall be transferred to ORG . The revenues shall be used to promote industry and industrial development in GPE . The Federation shall provide an DATE report to ORG on the use of the revenues . \u201d", "\u201c ORG may demand accounts from institutions , associations , funds and other parties that receive funding or guarantees from the ORG , and they shall be obliged to provide ORG with the materials requested . Furthermore , ORG shall be permitted access to , and shall have the right to examine , the original materials or reports that are created as well as invoices issued to the ORG or ORG bodies for work or services that are to be paid for , entirely or to a substantial extent , by ORG in accordance with the law or contracts or labour agreements on the basis of tariffs that have been agreed with individuals or legal entities , in order to verify the contents of invoices and the payment obligation borne by ORG . ...", "In the event of a dispute regarding the right of ORG to carry out audit work in accordance with this section , ORG may seek a ruling by ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has addressed the issue of trade - union fees and contributions from the angle of Article CARDINAL of LAW on several occasions , notably those referred to below :", "\u201c DATE . The ORG observes firstly that the fees deducted from the wages of workers pursuant to a collective agreement concluded between ORG and ORG are , according to the collective agreement , for the service of wage monitoring . ORG considers that the system of wage monitoring may , depending upon national traditions , be assumed either by public authorities , or , on the explicit or implicit authorisation of the legislator , by professional associations or trade unions . In the latter case this could legitimately require the payment of a fee .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the ORG considers that the payment of a fee to the trade union for financing its activity of wage monitoring can not be regarded in itself as unjustified . It also considers that it can not be regarded as an interference with the freedom of a worker to join a trade union as the payment of the fee does not automatically lead to membership of the ORG and in addition is not required from workers members [ who are members ] of trade unions other than ORG .", "CARDINAL . However , the ORG considers that doubts exist as to the real use of the fees and that , in the present case , if they were to finance activities other than wage monitoring , these fees would , on the grounds indicated in paragraph CARDINAL , be deducted , at least for a part , in violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , the ORG is not in a position to verify the use of the fees and in particular to verify to what extent the fees are proportional to the cost of the service carried out and to the benefits wage monitoring confers on the workers . These are decisive factors in determining a violation of LAW with reference to paragraphs DATE and DATE or CARDINAL . ORG considers therefore that it is for the national courts to decide the matter in the light of the principles the ORG has laid down on this subject or , as the case may be , for the legislator to enable the courts to draw the consequences as regards the conformity with the [ NORP Social ] Charter and the legality of the provisions at issue .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reserves the right to supervise the situation in practice through the reporting procedure and , as the case may be , the collective complaints procedure .", "... \u201d", "\u201c ... According to the report , it is common for trade unions to impose the payment of a fee and \u2018 the filling [ out ] of an application form or of an engagement\u2019 on non - members within the enterprise in consideration for negotiating a collective agreement . Supplementary information received from the government at the ORG \u2019s request indicates that the basis for this practice is the single national collective agreement DATE , according to which the amount of the deduction should be PERCENT of salary and no more than the amount of union dues . ORG observes that by virtue of section CARDINAL of [ Law ] no . CARDINAL on collective labour agreements , collective agreements apply to all workers in the enterprise , irrespective of their length of service or trade - union membership . In these circumstances , the imposition of a fee on workers who are not members of a trade union constitutes a union security practice that is contrary to the right to organise .", "The ORG asks that the next report indicate clearly whether , in addition to paying a fee to the union , non - members are also required , as the report would seem to suggest , to apply for membership . ... \u201d", "\u201c ... ORG previously concluded that the situation in GPE was not in conformity with LAW obligation on non - unionised workers to pay a fee to the trade union that had negotiated the applicable collective agreement , even though such agreements applied by law to all workers independently of whether or not they were members of a trade union ( the situation is described in DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG has re - examined the situation in the light of the explanations in the report and of the principles it has laid down in Complaint No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( ORG v. GPE , decision on the merits of CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . It notes firstly that the contribution helps to finance an activity that benefits all employees : negotiating collective agreements . Secondly , under the single national collective agreement for DATE , on which the practice is based , the contribution is not obligatory and is not earmarked for a trade union . Finally there is no statutory provision for automatic affiliation to a trade union . The ORG therefore considers that the payment of this sum can not in itself be regarded as an infringement of employees\u2019 right to join or not to join a trade union . \u201d", "\u201c ... In its previous conclusion , the ORG asked if automatic deductions from all workers\u2019 wages , including those who were not unionised , were forbidden under the present legislation . The report states that according to rules on deducting trade - union dues , union dues are paid only by persons who are mandated to pay such dues , which means that they must be trade - union members .", "Union dues can be paid in CARDINAL ways . Union members may either pay their dues directly into the union account or ask their employers to deduct the dues from their wages , in which case the employer is required to comply . In DATE , parliament adopted legislation , with the support of the unions , requiring employers to deduct and transfer dues . Prior to that , deductions were only possible with the agreement of both employer and employee . ORG considers that the procedure for deducting trade union contributions from wages at source may not be prohibited or made obligatory by national legislation . It must be made a criminal offence to use such a procedure for illegitimate purposes , for example to secure information on trade - union membership . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Information on the right of workers and employers to establish and join organisations of their own choosing may be found in LAW and Principles of ORG of ORG of the ORG .", "Under the subheading \u201c Trade union unity and pluralism \u201d , it is pointed out , inter alia , that the fact that workers and employers generally find it in their interest to avoid a multiplication of the number of competing organisations would not be sufficient to justify direct or indirect intervention by ORG , DATE , paragraph CARDINAL ) . A monopoly situation imposed by law would be at variance with the principle of free choice of workers\u2019 and ORG organisations ( ibid . , paragraph CARDINAL ) . A government should neither support nor obstruct a legal attempt by a trade union to displace an existing organisation . Workers should be free to choose the union which , in their opinion , will best promote their occupational interests without interference by the authorities ( ibid . , paragraph CARDINAL ) . The imposition of an obligation on all the workers in the category concerned to pay contributions to a single national trade union , the establishment of which is permitted by branch of industry and by region , would not be compatible with the principle that workers should have the right to join organisations \u201c of their own choosing \u201d ( ibid . , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the subheading \u201c Favouritism or discrimination in respect of particular organisations \u201d , it is stated , inter alia ( references in ORG and Principles added after each paragraph have been omitted here ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Considering the limited functions which , in CARDINAL case , were by law open to certain categories of trade unions , the ORG felt that the distinction made between trade unions under the national legislation could have the indirect consequence of restricting the freedom of workers to belong to the organisations of their choosing . The reasons which led the ORG to adopt this position are as follows . As a general rule , when a government can grant an advantage to CARDINAL particular organisation or withdraw that advantage from CARDINAL organisation in favour of another , there is a risk , even if such is not the government \u2019s intention , that CARDINAL trade union will be placed at an unfair advantage or disadvantage in relation to the others , which would thereby constitute an act of discrimination . More precisely , by placing CARDINAL organisation at an advantage or at a disadvantage in relation to the others , a government may either directly or indirectly influence the choice of workers regarding the organisation to which they intend to belong , since they will undeniably want to belong to the union best able to serve them , even if their natural preference would have led them to join another organisation for occupational , religious , political or other reasons . The freedom of the parties to choose is a right expressly laid down in [ ORG ] Convention No . CARDINAL [ concerning freedom of association and the right to organise ] .", "...", "CARDINAL . By according favourable or unfavourable treatment to a given organisation as compared with others , a government may be able to influence the choice of workers as to the organisation which they intend to join . In addition , a government which deliberately acts in this manner violates the principle laid down in [ ORG ] Convention No . CARDINAL that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict the rights provided for in the Convention or impede their lawful exercise ; more indirectly , it would also violate the principle that the law of the land shall not be such as to impair , nor shall it be so applied as to impair , the guarantees provided for in the LAW . It would seem desirable that , if a government wishes to make certain facilities available to trade - union organisations , these organisations should enjoy equal treatment in this respect .", "...", "CARDINAL . In a case in which there was at the very least a close working relationship between a trade union and the labour and other authorities , the ORG emphasised the importance it attaches to the resolution of DATE concerning the independence of the trade - union movement and urged the government to refrain from showing favouritism towards , or discriminating against , any given trade union , and requested it to adopt a neutral attitude in its dealings with all workers\u2019 and ORG organisations , so that they are all placed on an equal footing .", "...", "CARDINAL .
