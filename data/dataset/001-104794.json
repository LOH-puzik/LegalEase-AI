The applicants were born in DATE and DATE and live in NORP and GPE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , a student at FAC in Bolu ( \u201c the university \u201d ) , was killed in an attack . Thereafter , on DATE of every subsequent year students at the university have held a meeting to mark the anniversary of the killing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the first - instance court in respect of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants asked the prosecutor at ORG to apply to that court for rectification of the decision of DATE . In their letter to the prosecutor the applicants also pointed out that none of the injured gendarmes had accused them of inflicting their injuries .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor accepted the ORG request and on DATE applied to ORG president for rectification of the decision . In his application the prosecutor noted that none of the injured gendarmes had named the applicants as the persons responsible for their injuries . The prosecutor referred to LAW and argued that university grounds could not be regarded as public places within the meaning of PERSON no . CARDINAL and that the applicants\u2019 and their fellow GPE actions could not therefore be regarded to be in breach of that PERSON . The students\u2019 failure to hold their meeting in a place other than the one for which permission had been granted could only be regarded as a disciplinary issue and dealt with by the university administration and not by courts of law .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor also noted that the disturbance in the demonstration had been caused by the gendarmes\u2019 intervention . Moreover , the reports drawn up by the gendarmes who had taken part in the operation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not made any mention of physical resistance by the students . The trial court had not examined the video footage and had not asked the injured gendarmes to identify the persons responsible for their injuries . As such , the trial court \u2019s decision to convict the applicants under section QUANTITY of the Law no . CARDINAL had not been in accordance with applicable law and procedure .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of DATE the Grand Chamber of ORG observed that the transcripts of one of the hearings held by the trial court did not bear the signature of the court \u2019s clerk , and quashed the decision convicting the applicants . It deemed it unnecessary to examine the points raised by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . A retrial began before the trial court , which rendered its decision on CARDINAL DATE . Having examined the video footage , the trial court observed that TIME had elapsed between the beginning of the gathering and its dispersal by the gendarmes . It also noted that neither the applicants nor any of the other participants in the demonstration had used force against the gendarmes . Nevertheless , the trial court considered that the applicants and the other students had taken part in an unauthorised meeting and had thus acted in breach of section QUANTITY no . CARDINAL . According to the trial court , the gathering had been unlawful because it had not been organised in the canteen but rather had taken place outside . The applicants were sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , but the sentence was suspended .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed . The appeal proceedings are still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on account of his participation in the demonstration , on DATE the university imposed a disciplinary sanction on the first applicant PERSON , and expelled him from the university for DATE . As the university \u2019s decision was not quashed by the administrative courts until DATE , the decision was enforced and the applicant \u2019s graduation from the university was thus delayed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Also in the meantime , the first applicant completed his studies and started working as a teacher . Nevertheless , on DATE ORG dismissed him from his post on account of his attendance at the demonstration . He was reinstated in his post in DATE , following the quashing of his conviction by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . At the material time section CARDINAL of the Meetings and Demonstration Marches Act ( Law no . CARDINAL ) was worded as follows :", "\u201c In order for a meeting to take place , the governor \u2019s office or authorities of the district in which the demonstration is planned must be informed , during TIME and CARDINAL prior to the meeting , by a notice containing the signature of all the members of the organising board ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the same Act prohibits demonstrations and processions on public streets , in parks , places of worship and buildings in which public services are based . Demonstrations organised in public squares must comply with security instructions and not disrupt ORG movement or public transport . Finally , section CARDINAL provides that demonstrations and processions which do not comply with the provisions of this law will be dispersed by force on the order of the governor \u2019s office and after the demonstrators have been warned .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW , in so far as relevant , provided as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Unarmed persons taking part in an unlawful meeting or procession who , instead of dispersing of their own motion after having been warned or ordered to do so and who thus have to be forcefully dispersed by government forces , are liable to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE .", "...", "CARDINAL . Unless their action breaches another criminal law provision which stipulates a more severe punishment , persons who resort to violence or making threats while being dispersed , or who resist the attempts to disperse them , are liable to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE .", "... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
