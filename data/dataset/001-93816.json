POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s parents owned a large metallurgical factory in ORG . Following the outbreak of the Second World War , in DATE the property was taken over by the NORP occupying administration . The applicant \u2019s entire family were evicted from their home , which was in the same town , put in a transit camp for a period and in DATE resettled to the PERSON , the eastern part of GPE under a special regime of NORP occupying administration . During the war the factory operated under a ORG appointed by the NORP administration ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) . When the applicant \u2019s family returned DATE , they found only the bare walls . All equipment had been stolen .", "After the war , in DATE , the NORP authorities instructed the applicant \u2019s father to make a list of the damage that had been done to his property by the NORP occupying forces . He submitted the list to the local authorities in DATE . He estimated the amount of damage at MONEY ( PLZ ) .", "Until DATE GPE paid war reparations to GPE on the basis of international agreements . The applicant \u2019s parents did not , however , receive any compensation . In DATE GPE had renounced its right to obtain further reparations from the then GPE ( see below , Relevant domestic and international law ) .", "In DATE the applicant requested ORG , represented by the PERSON Governor , to pay him compensation for damage caused in the part of the property owned by his mother as a result of the acts of the occupying NORP administration . On DATE the Minister of ORG refused . The applicant appealed to ORG .", "By a judgment of DATE that court dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It noted that it was not in dispute that the applicant \u2019s mother \u2019s property had been damaged by the NORP occupying administration , but considered that it had to examine whether the applicant \u2019s claim was of such a character as to be determined by way of an administrative decision . It observed that it was true that GPE had obtained war reparations from GPE on the basis of international agreements and that these were intended to cover both damage sustained by the ORG and various forms of damage suffered by individuals . However , it held that neither the domestic nor international law provided for a substantive individual compensation claim on the part of former owners or their successors in title which could be determined by way of an administrative decision .", "In DATE the applicant submitted a compensation claim against ORG to the GPE \u2013 ORG concerning the part of the property owned by his father .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed that claim . In so far as the applicant had argued that his claim was based on liability in tort under LAW , the court considered that the damage which his predecessor in title had sustained had originated from the acts of the NORP occupying administration . Hence , no civil obligations based on the law of tort could have arisen between the applicant and ORG . Moreover , while it was true that the ORG had participated after the Second World War in international agreements concerning the war reparations to be paid to GPE , and that GPE had paid them in part , no international legal agreements had ever been concluded which would have imposed on the ORG an obligation to transfer to individuals the funds which it had received in war reparations from GPE .", "Likewise , no such obligation had been imposed on the ORG by the domestic law . It was true that in DATE the NORP authorities had created a Ministry of War Reparations ( Resort Odszkodowa\u0144 Wojennych ) , but its competence had been limited to establishing the war damage caused in GPE by the NORP occupying administration and making relevant estimates with a view to obtaining reparations . Similarly , LAW ( LOC o PERSON ) did not impose on relevant institutions an obligation to issue ordinances regulating compensation due to individuals . Consequently , the domestic law did not contain any regulation under which the applicant could claim compensation from the NORP State in respect of damage caused to individuals by the NORP occupying authorities during the war .", "The applicant appealed . He disagreed with the assertion that his claim had been based on legal provisions governing civil liability for tortious acts . He submitted that the first - instance court had breached the provisions of LAW in so far as LAW thereof specifically established that the ORG had a civil liability for the acts of its agents . He further referred to LAW , which stated that everyone had the right to compensation for damage caused by the unlawful acts or omissions of public authorities . He submitted that , in his case , the ORG had failed in its obligation to issue legal regulations , in the form of an ordinance , entitling individuals to make substantive compensation claims in respect of war damage they had suffered . The obligation , in his view , originated from LAW . He also referred to LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "The applicant further argued that the ORG had obtained reparations from GPE which , contrary to the opinion expressed in the proceedings by the ORG - Treasury representatives , were intended to cover both the ORG and individual damage . He referred to the judgment of ORG of DATE . In his submission , therefore , the ORG should have been obliged to pay him compensation from the funds it had received for that purpose . Under the rule of law a citizen could not legitimately be required to bear the adverse effects of the ORG \u2019s failure to legislate . LAW had entrusted responsibility for its execution to the Minister . The ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201c entrusts the execution \u201d had to be seen as imposing on the Minister an obligation to issue relevant ordinances which would make it possible for individuals to obtain compensation funded by war reparations .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It observed , firstly , that the first - instance court had failed to examine whether LAW DATE was still in force . It held that that PERSON had been enacted with the specific purpose of reorganising the economy through planning techniques . It had therefore lapsed at DATE following the implementation of the plan it had created and could not , therefore , serve as a source of any individual rights and obligations . Moreover , section QUANTITY on which the applicant had relied , could not be regarded as authorisation for issuing the ordinance , as such statutory authorisation had to comply with precise conditions that were set out in DATE LAW . Hence , the fact that no ordinance had been issued on the basis of that section could not be construed as a failure to act giving rise to the ORG \u2019s liability in tort under LAW .", "In any event , the transitional provisions of that Code , which had entered into force on DATE , had clearly provided that the legal consequences of civil obligations arising out of events that had occurred prior to that date had to be assessed in the light of the statutory provisions in force at the time the events took place . Hence , the civil liability of the ORG could not be examined in the light of LAW , but only in the light of LAW , which had been enacted in DATE . However , LAW did not specifically regulate the ORG \u2019s liability in tort . Civil liability in tort was governed only by general provisions and could arise only when it could be shown that the tortfeasor had acted unlawfully or had failed to act when required to do so . In the absence of any obligation on the ORG to legislate on individual compensation claims , it could not be said that the ORG had acted unlawfully and should have been held liable .", "The reparations which GPE had obtained from GPE constituted a debt of the latter towards the Polish State . No individual right vis - \u00e0 - vis ORG had been generated by the payment of reparations to ORG .", "ORG further accepted the reasoning of the lower court concerning the legal character of the provisions of LAW . It reiterated that no individual right to compensation could be derived from it .", "The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with ORG , essentially reiterating his earlier arguments .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed his cassation appeal .", "It observed that the applicant had asserted that his claim was based essentially on the ORG \u2019s failure to enact ordinances providing for a detailed compensation mechanism for damage caused by the NORP occupying administration . However , no liability in tort could have arisen on the part of the ORG , as it had been under no obligation to introduce such legislation . Neither Article CARDINAL of LAW nor the provisions of LAW of DATE provided that mere inaction - provided it was not unlawful \u2013 could give rise to the ORG \u2019s liability in tort . Section CARDINAL of LAW , contrary to the applicant \u2019s assertion , did not impose any such obligation on the State .", "Nor could the court accept that the applicant \u2019s claim could be based directly on the LAW . For the ORG \u2019s liability to arise towards an individual a statutory legal basis was necessary . Moreover , under the case - law of ORG , Article CARDINAL governing ORG liability could be applied only to events that occurred after the LAW entered into force in DATE . In conclusion , the findings of the lower courts that the ORG \u2019s conduct could not be qualified as unlawful were correct and had to be upheld .", "LAW \u2013 an agreement on policy for the occupying and reconstruction of GPE after the Second World War and the NORP surrender of CARDINAL DATE \u2013 was adopted by the CARDINAL ORG of GPE , GPE and GPE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Powers \u201d ) and set out , inter alia , the principles governing the payment of war reparations by GPE ( LAW , \u201c Reparations from GPE \u201d ) .", "The issue of war reparations for GPE , which in accordance with LAW were to be settled by the GPE from its share , was resolved by a bilateral treaty between the GPE and GPE : the Agreement of DATE between ORG and the Government of the GPE on compensation for financial losses sustained during the NORP occupying administration ( umowa mi\u0119dzy PERSON RP a ORG o wynagrodzeniu szk\u00f3d finansowych wyrz\u0105dzonych przez okupacj\u0119 niemieck\u0105 ) .", "In DATE GPE expressly renounced further reparations in an agreement with GPE ( GPE ) and again in LAW of DATE with GPE ( GPE ) .", "LAW was adopted on DATE . Its Section CARDINAL read :", "\u201c A National Economy Plan CARDINAL DATE ( ORG ) is hereby established . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provided as follows :", "\u201c The raising of living standards of the working class above their pre - war levels shall be the essential task of the national economy from DATE until DATE . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL read , inter alia :", "\u201c The task referred to above shall be carried out through ... b ) war reparations . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL read :", "\u201c Damage caused by the war shall be repaired in a manner corresponding to plans regarding reconstruction of the national economy ; with due regard being had to the creation of basis for its necessary restructuring and growth during the next national planning periods and to preventing further deterioration of national property . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL provided :", "\u201c ORG and the ministers shall be responsible for implementing the provisions of this LAW . \u201d", "Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the NORP Civil Code , which entered into force in DATE , provide for liability in tort .
