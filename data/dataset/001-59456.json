In comments made to the first applicant in her interview , the possibility that in due course she could see the video of the disclosure interview was referred to by PERSON and PERSON", "CARDINAL . Later , on CARDINAL DATE , the local authority applied successfully to GPE magistrates court for a place of safety order .

The local authority attended the application and argued that they should have care and control of the second applicant in order to protect her from the risk of abuse .

In his letter dated DATE to the first applicant \u2019s solicitor , he gave his firm opinion that the interview disclosed a high probability that the second applicant had been abused sexually and that there appeared to be little doubt that she was identifying the mother \u2019s boyfriend as the perpetrator . He recommended that the first applicant be allowed to see the video . He referred to PERSON continual insistence that the court would not approve of the first applicant seeing the video and gave his own opinion that the best interests of the second applicant would be served by her mother having access to the fullest possible information .

Anger , unforgiveness or victimisation may well be directed at the child especially if the purpose of the viewing is to enable a party to seek to establish his or her innocence of alleged LAW abuse or to confirm a party \u2019s view that no Child Sexual abuse has taken place and that the child must be lying . \u201d", "She had no objection to the lawyers and medical experts seeing the tape and transcript .", "CARDINAL . By reports dated CARDINAL DATE , PERSON and a social worker for the local health authority gave their opinions that it was good and desirable practice for parents to see the interviews involving their children . PERSON noted generally that the mothers of abused children would often be in a position to clarify details , including the identity of the alleged abuser . He also understood that the video had already been shown by the police to LOC in the course of their investigation into the allegations of abuse and considered that it would appear against natural justice to deny the first applicant similar opportunity . He saw no risk of harm flowing to the second applicant from such disclosure .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date at or about that time , the first applicant \u2019s solicitors had sight of the transcript . The transcript showed that the second applicant had shaken her head when asked whether the abuser was living at home and that she had identified her abuser as having been thrown out of the house by the first applicant . These matters , which were inconsistent with the identification of LOC as the abuser , were raised by the first applicant \u2019s solicitors with the local authority on or DATE , when the summons concerning the video was to be heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at a hearing in the High Court the local authority recommended that the second applicant be rehabilitated to the first applicant and FAC for a trial period of DATE at which point a final proposal would be made . In a report dated DATE submitted for that hearing , a social worker for the local authority stated that the fact that the second applicant had been sexually abused had been acknowledged by all the psychiatrists in the case , that there was now doubt as to the identity of the abuser but that whoever it was , the second applicant had suffered a seriously damaging experience from which her mother had been unable to protect her . While there had been doubts as to the first applicant \u2019s ability to be a \u201c good enough parent \u201d , it was noted that her situation had changed \u2013 she had \u201c matured \u201d , had had a second child and was in a stable relationship with the second child \u2019s father . If over the trial period , any further abuse occurred , it was proposed that the second applicant be removed permanently with a view to adoption and that NORP \u2019s future be assessed . In her affidavit of CARDINAL DATE , the first applicant said that she had been informed , and believed , that the video and transcript had been reviewed by the local authority who had concluded that her boyfriend PERSON was no longer a suspected abuser . Mr Justice PERSON ordered by consent that the second applicant remain a ward of court and that interim care and control be committed to the local authority who had leave to place her with the first applicant . The matter was adjourned for a period of not DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant remained with the first applicant from that time DATE . In DATE , the final hearing took place in ORG . The local authority advised the judge that there was no longer any concern that required the second applicant to remain a ward of court . The wardship was discharged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants issued proceedings making allegations of negligence and breach of statutory duty against the local authority , the central allegation being that the social worker , PERSON , and the psychiatrist , PERSON , failed to investigate the facts with proper care and thoroughness and failed to discuss their conclusions with the first applicant . The health authority and PERSON were also named as defendants . The applicants claimed that as a result of their enforced separation each of them had suffered a psychiatric disorder .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants were seen by a psychiatrist who diagnosed that they were suffering from psychological disturbance known as anxiety neurosis . He issued CARDINAL reports , CARDINAL dated DATE and the second undated , concerning the effects of the separation and proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON struck out the application as revealing no cause of action on the basis that PERSON enjoyed immunity in suit as a witness or potential witness in proceedings concerning the abuse of the second applicant and that this acted to bar the applicants\u2019 claims . The applicants\u2019 appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE by Judge PERSON who held that no claim could arise from any alleged right to custody of a child which would give rise to an award of damages .", "CARDINAL . In ORG , ORG striking out decision was upheld on DATE . The majority found that no claim for breach of statutory duty in respect of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE could arise , due to the general nature of the duty , the imprecise terms in which it was couched and the fact that the alleged breach of duty took place before the child was taken into care under the statutory duty in question . They held in respect of the claims that PERSON and PERSON were liable in damages as professional persons who caused personal injuries that the local authority arranged for the disclosure interview to enable to decide whether or not to intervene in the performance of its statutory functions . The psychiatrist PERSON was acting in order to advise the local authority and owed a duty of care to the local authority , not to the first or second applicant . Nor could the local authority be held liable for the negligent mistake made by the social worker in carrying out the statutory function of the local authority to make enquiries . Reference was made to the policy considerations weighing against imposing liability in such matters . However , the Master of the Rolls , Sir PERSON , dissented and stated that he believed that it could be argued that a common law duty of care was owed to the second applicant by the psychiatrist and the local authority ( reported as M v. GPE LBC ; PERSON v. GPE ORG ) CARDINAL ) . Leave was granted to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On appeal to ORG , the decision of the majority of ORG was upheld on DATE . Lord PERSON delivered the leading judgment concerning CARDINAL cases , the GPE case , the PERSON case ( the applicants\u2019 case ) and the GPE case ( reported as X and Others v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the claims for breach of statutory duty made in both the GPE and GPE cases , Lord PERSON held :", "\u201c ... My starting point is that the Acts in question are all concerned to establish an administrative system designed to promote the social welfare of the community . The welfare sector involved is CARDINAL of peculiar sensitivity , involving very difficult decisions how to strike the balance between protecting the child from immediate feared harm and disrupting the relationship between the child and its parents . In my judgment in such a context it would require exceptionally clear statutory language to show a parliamentary intention that those responsible for carrying out these difficult functions should be liable in damages if , on subsequent investigation with the benefit of hindsight , it was shown that they had reached an erroneous conclusion and therefore failed to discharge their statutory duties . ...", "When CARDINAL turns to the actual words used in the primary legislation to create the duties relied upon in my judgment they are inconsistent with any intention to create a private law cause of action . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicants\u2019 claim in the PERSON case that the local authority and the health authority were vicariously liable for the actions of the social worker , PERSON , and psychiatrist PERSON respectively , Lord PERSON said as follows :", "\u201c In the PERSON case [ the applicant \u2019s case ] the pleadings and Mr PERSON \u2019s submissions make it clear how the case is put . The social worker and the psychiatrist , as professionals , owed a personal duty to the first plaintiff , the child , and to the second plaintiff , the mother , to exercise reasonable professional skills in the conduct of the interview with the child and to make proper enquiries . The social worker and the psychiatrist were each personally in breach of this duty , for which breach their employers ... are vicariously liable . ... \u201d", "Like the majority in ORG , I can not accept these arguments . The social workers and the psychiatrists were retained by the local authority to advise the local authority , not the plaintiffs . The subject matter of the advice and activities of the professionals is the child ... the fact that the carrying out of the retainer involves contact and relationship with the child can not alter the extent of the duty owed by the professionals under the retainer from the local authority ...", "In my judgment in the present cases , the social workers and the psychiatrist did not , by accepting the instructions of the local authority assume any general professional duty of care to the plaintiff children ...", "Even if contrary to my view the social workers and psychiatrist would otherwise have come under a duty of care to the plaintiffs , the same considerations which have led me to the view that there is no direct duty of care owed by the local authorities apply with at least equal force to the question whether it would be just and reasonable to impose such a duty of care on the individual social workers and the psychiatrist . ...", "In the PERSON case [ the applicant \u2019s case ] it is not alleged that the borough council was under any direct duty of care to the plaintiffs : the case is based solely on the vicarious liability of the council and the health authority for the negligence of their servants . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the GPE case , where the applicant children had argued that the local authority owed them a direct duty of care in the exercise of their child care functions , Lord PERSON stated , insofar as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c I turn then to consider whether , in accordance with the ordinary principles laid down in GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL , the local authority ... owed a direct duty of care to the plaintiffs . The local authority accepts that they could foresee damage to the plaintiffs if they carried out their statutory duties negligently and that the relationship between the authority is sufficiently proximate . The third requirement laid down in GPE is that it must be just and reasonable to impose a common law duty of care in all the circumstances ...", "The Master of the Rolls took the view , with which I agree , that the public policy consideration that has first claim on the loyalty of the law is that wrongs should be remedied and that very potent counter considerations are required to override that policy ( see [ DATE ] CARDINAL AER CARDINAL at CARDINAL ) . However , in my judgment there are such considerations in this case .", "First , in my judgment a common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory system set up for the protection of children at risk . As a result of the ministerial directions contained in \u201c ORG \u201d the protection of such children is not the exclusive territory of the local authority \u2019s social services . The system is inter - disciplinary , involving the participation of the police , educational bodies , doctors and others . At all stages the system involves joint discussions , joint recommendations and joint decisions . The key organisation is ORG , a multi - disciplinary body which decides whether to place the child on ORG . This procedure by way of joint action takes place , not merely because it is good practice , but because it is required by guidance having statutory force binding on the local authority . The guidance is extremely detailed and extensive : the current edition of \u201c LAW \u201d runs to CARDINAL pages . To introduce into such a system a common law duty of care enforceable against CARDINAL of the participant bodies would be manifestly unfair . To impose such liability on all the participant bodies would lead to almost impossible problems of disentangling as between the respective bodies the liability , both primary and by way of contribution , of each for reaching a decision found to be negligent .", "Second , the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with children at risk is extraordinarily delicate . Legislation requires the local authority to have regard not only to the physical well - being of the child but also to the advantages of not disrupting the child \u2019s family environment . ... In one of the child abuse cases , the local authority is blamed for removing the child precipitately ; in the other for failing to remove the children from their mother . As the Report of the Inquiry into Child Abuse in GPE DATE ( ORG . CARDINAL ) ( \u201c GPE Report DATE \u201d ) said , at p. CARDINAL :", "\u2018 ... It is a delicate and difficult line to tread between taking action too soon and not taking it soon enough . Social services whilst putting the needs of the child first must respect the rights of the parents ; they also must work if possible with the parents for the benefit of the children . These parents themselves are often in need of help . Inevitably a degree of conflict develops between those objectives.\u2019", "ORG , if liability in damages were to be imposed , it might well be that local authorities would adopt a more cautious and defensive approach to their duties . For example , as ORG makes clear , on occasions the speedy decision to remove the child is sometimes vital . If the authority is to be made liable in damages for a negligent decision to remove a child ( such negligence lying in the failure properly first to investigate the allegations ) there would be a substantial temptation to postpone making such a decision until further inquiries have been made in the hope of getting more concrete facts . Not only would the child in fact being abused be prejudiced by such delay , the increased workload inherent in making such investigations would reduce the time available to deal with other cases and other children .", "The relationship between the social worker and the child \u2019s parents is frequently CARDINAL of conflict , the parent wishing to retain care of the child , the social worker having to consider whether to remove it . This is fertile ground in which to breed ill - feeling and litigation , often hopeless , the cost of which both in terms of money and human resources will be diverted from the performance of the social service for which they were provided . The spectre of vexatious and costly litigation is often urged as a reason for not imposing a legal duty . But the circumstances surrounding cases of child abuse make the risk a very high one which can not be ignored .", "If there were no other remedy for maladministration of the statutory system for the protection of children , it would provide substantial argument for imposing a duty of care . But the statutory complaints procedures contained in section DATE of LAW and the much fuller procedures now available under LAW provide a means to have grievances investigated though not to recover compensation . Further , it was submitted ( and not controverted ) that the local authorities ORG would have power to investigate cases such as these .", "Finally , your Lordships\u2019 decision in Caparo [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL lays down that in deciding whether to develop novel categories of negligence the court should proceed incrementally and by analogy with decided categories . We were not referred to any category of case in which a duty of care has been held to exist which is in any way analogous to the present cases . Here , for the first time , the plaintiffs are seeking to erect a common law duty of care in relation to the administration of a statutory social welfare scheme . Such a scheme is designed to protect weaker members of society ( children ) from harm done to them by others . The scheme involves the administrators in exercising discretion and powers which could not exist in the private sector and which in many cases bring them into conflict with those who , under the general law , are responsible for the child \u2019s welfare . To my mind , the nearest analogies are the cases where a common law duty of care has been sought to be imposed upon the police ( in seeking to protect vulnerable members of society from wrongs done to them by others ) or statutory regulators of financial dealing who are seeking to protect investors from dishonesty . In neither of these cases has it been thought appropriate to superimpose on a statutory regime a common law duty of care giving rise to a claim in damages for failure to protect the weak against the wrongdoer . ... In my judgment , the courts should proceed with great care before holding liable in negligence those who have been charged by ORG with the task of protecting society from the wrong doings of others . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

This case concerned the claims by a mother and father ( first and second plaintiffs ) , who had agreed to act as foster parents , that the defendant local authority placed G , a DATE boy , in their home although they knew that he was a suspect or known sexual abuser . During G \u2019s stay in their home , the plaintiffs\u2019 CARDINAL children ( DATE plaintiffs ) were all sexually abused and suffered psychiatric illness . The plaintiffs brought an action against the local authority and the social worker involved , claiming damages for negligence and for negligent misstatement . On the defendants\u2019 application to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action , the judges struck out the GPE claims but refused to strike out the claims of the children . ORG upheld his decision . The headnote for the judgment summarised ORG findings as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ... In the instant case , the giving of information to the parents was part and parcel of the defendants\u2019 performance of their statutory powers and duties , and it had been conceded that it was arguable that those decisions fell outside the ambit of their discretion . Accordingly , since it had also been conceded that the damage to the children was reasonably foreseeable and that there was sufficient proximity , the question for the court was whether it was just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the council or the social worker . Having regard to the fact that the common law duty of care would cut across the whole statutory set up for the protection of children at risk , that the task of the local authority and its servants in dealing with such children was extraordinarily difficult and delicate , that local authorities might adopt a more defensive approach to their duties if liability in damages were imposed , that the relationship between parents and social workers was frequently CARDINAL of conflict and that the plaintiff children \u2019s injuries were compensatable under LAW , it was not just and reasonable to do so . It followed that no duty of care was owed to the plaintiff parents ...", "( CARDINAL ) ( ORG dissenting ) It was arguable that the policy considerations against imposing a common law duty of care on a local authority in relation to the performance of its statutory duties to protect children did not apply when the children whose safety was under consideration were those in respect of whom it was not performing any statutory duty . Accordingly , since in the instant case , the plaintiff children were not children for whom the council had carried out any immediate caring responsibilities under the child welfare system but were living at home with their parents , and express assurances had been given that a sexual abuser would not be placed in their home , their claim should proceed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On further appeal by the parents , ORG on DATE held that it was impossible to say that the psychiatric injury allegedly suffered by the parents , flowing from a feeling that they had brought the abuser and their children together or from a feeling of responsibility for not having detected the abuse earlier , was outside the range of psychiatric injury recognised by the law , nor was it unarguable that the local authority had owed a duty of care to the parents . The GPE claim could not be said to be so certainly or clearly bad that they should be barred from pursuing it to trial and their appeal was allowed .", "CARDINAL .

That case concerned the claims of the plaintiff , who had been in care from DATE , that the local authority had negligently failed to safeguard his welfare causing him deep - seated psychiatric problems .

It is a prerequisite to there being any liability in negligence at all that as a matter of policy it is fair , just and reasonable in those circumstances to impose liability in negligence . ( CARDINAL ) In a wide range of cases public policy has led to the decision that the imposition of liability would not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances , e.g. some activities of financial regulators , building inspectors , ship surveyors , social workers dealing with sex abuse cases . In all these cases and many others the view has been taken that the proper performance of the defendant \u2019s primary functions for the benefit of society as a whole will be inhibited if they are required to look over their shoulder to avoid liability in negligence . In LANGUAGE law the decision as to whether it is fair , just and reasonable to impose a liability in negligence on a particular class of would - be defendants depends on weighing in the balance the total detriment to the public interest in all cases from holding such class liable in negligence as against the total loss to all would - be plaintiffs if they are not to have a cause of action in respect of the loss they have individually suffered .
