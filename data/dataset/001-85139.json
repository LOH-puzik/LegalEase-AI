The Government qualified this statement to read that the applicant satisfied the conditions necessary to apply for the post of consultant surgeon .", "According to paragraph CARDINAL ( c ) of the call for applications , applicants were required to have the following qualifications :", "\u201c be in possession of a recognised higher postgraduate qualification in surgery ( ORG or equivalent qualification recognised as such in ORG or the GPE ) and DATE post registration experience in vascular surgery of which DATE must be at Senior Registrar or Higher Surgical Trainee equivalent level . \u201d", "The applicant alleged that he was the only person eligible for the post but that other persons , not having the required qualifications , were interviewed . Eventually X , another surgeon , was appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendations of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . Under NORP law , this body is immune from legal proceedings .", "The Government contested the allegation that the other persons interviewed for the post did not possess the required qualifications . According to the Government , the applicant argued that the other candidates did not possess the experience required , since the period to be taken into consideration should have been calculated from the date when the candidates had officially been appointed to the post of Senior Registrar and not from a prior date when they had de facto started performing such duties .", "The Government explained that there were CARDINAL applicants for the said post . After having interviewed all the applicants , ORG ( appointed by the ORG ) , made up of CARDINAL senior members of the public medical service and a senior official from the management and personnel office , found that all the candidates interviewed possessed both the academic qualifications and the experience required . However , they found the applicant to be unsuitable for the post whilst finding the other CARDINAL candidates suitable . The ORG recommended the candidate with the highest mark as decided by ORG .", "On DATE , DATE after the said interview , the applicant complained about the decision and the composition of ORG to the ORG Chairman .", "On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that on examining the selection process , the eligibility of the applicants as determined by ORG had been correct and that none of his other allegations had been well - founded .", "On DATE the applicant reiterated his position to the ORG . On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that given that the selection process had been completed and the appointment made , representations to the ORG had to be made in accordance with the provisions of the PERSON ( \u201c code of management of the public service \u201d ) which provided for the right to file a petition with the Prime Minister ( \u201c TIME \u201d ) in respect of a selection process .", "On DATE the applicant petitioned the PM . This petition was suspended since in the meantime the applicant had lodged judicial proceedings and proceedings before ORG , which had the power to investigate allegations of corruption .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a judicial protest against the PM and the Chairman of the ORG .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG ( FAC ) to issue an injunction against the above authorities to restrain them from proceeding with the appointment of the selected candidate . On DATE ORG refused this request .", "On DATE the applicant filed a claim with ORG ( FAC ) against the PM . He alleged a violation of LAW by reason of the fact that in selecting the candidates for the post of consultant surgeon , the PM had failed to adhere to the notice announcing the call for applications . The applicant furthermore considered that , in setting up the board for the interviews , there had been a breach of the PERSON rules , which regulated the civil service and the manner in which applicants to it were recruited .", "The applicant requested that the appointment of X be declared null and void and that his own application be considered the only CARDINAL valid for the post .", "The PM objected , stating that the applicant \u2019s action was incompatible with LAW , since the action was intended to inquire into the interpretation of a call for applications made by the ORG , whereas the conduct of the ORG in such matters could not be questioned .", "In a preliminary judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the TIME \u2019s objection and ordered that the case be continued . It observed that the ORG was not a defendant in the case and that it was too early to come to the conclusion that the applicant \u2019s claims might amount to an investigation into the actions of the ORG . The applicant should know that if his action pursued such a line it would be dismissed . However , it was still open to the applicant to prove his complaint without questioning the workings of the Commission .", "The applicant \u2019s action had rightly been introduced against the PM who was not obliged to act according to the recommendation made to him by the ORG . Moreover , when TIME was taking a decision relating to the appointment of a civil servant , he was not merely giving formal effect to the wishes of the ORG . Although ORG role was not to inquire whether TIME had acted or not on the recommendation , its task was to determine whether his actions were in conformity with the law .", "The Government challenged ORG preliminary judgment , before both ORG and ORG . On DATE the appeal to ORG was withdrawn by agreement of both parties . It was agreed that the merits of the appeal should be examined by ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG found against the applicant . It accepted the ORG \u2019s plea of immunity and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action .", "ORG held that the TIME \u2019s actions \u201c in many fields \u201d could be examined by the domestic tribunals . However , according to LAW case - law , when the PM was required to perform any function in accordance with the recommendation of any person or authority , judicial examination was excluded , unless there was an allegation of a violation of fundamental human rights .", "Furthermore , it resulted from LAW ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW that when the PM was required to exercise any function after consultation with any person or authority , he was not obliged to follow the advice given to him , although when the functions were exercised on the recommendation of any person or authority , he should act in accordance with that recommendation . Therefore , when the ORG made a recommendation on an appointment to a post within the public service , TIME was bound to appoint the person indicated . What were referred to in the LAW as recommendations were in fact binding decisions and the only possibility enjoyed by the PM was to use his power to refer the recommendation back , once , for reconsideration .", "In the present case , the only allegation against the TIME was that he had acted in accordance with the decision of the ORG . In ORG opinion , the applicant was trying to circumvent LAW , which granted immunity to the ORG .", "Article CARDINAL ) of the LAW of GPE states :", "\u201c Subject to the provisions of this LAW , power to make appointments to public offices and to remove and to exercise disciplinary control over persons holding or acting in any such offices shall vest in the Prime Minister , acting on the recommendation of ORG ... \u201d", "The functions of the TIME in this regard are regulated according to LAW , which , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where by LAW the Prime Minister is required to exercise any function on the recommendation of any person or authority he shall exercise that function in accordance with such recommendation :", "Provided that \u2013", "( a ) before he acts in accordance therewith he may once refer that recommendation back for reconsideration by the person or authority concerned ; and", "( b ) if that person or authority , having reconsidered the original recommendation under the preceding paragraph , substitutes therefor a different recommendation , the provisions of this sub - article shall apply to that different recommendation as they apply to the original recommendation .", "( CARDINAL ) Where by this LAW the Prime Minister is required to perform any function after consultation with any person or authority , he shall not be obliged to perform that function in accordance with the advice of that person or authority .", "( CARDINAL ) Where by this LAW the Prime Minister is required to perform any function in accordance with the recommendation of , or after consultation with , any person or authority , the question whether he has in any case received , or acted in accordance with such recommendation or whether he has consulted with such person or authority shall not be inquired into in any court . \u201d", "The ORG is immune from proceedings regarding its functions pursuant to LAW .
