The applicant is a limited company under NORP law with its registered office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company ran an art gallery in GPE . In judgments of CARDINAL DATE and PERCENT CARDINAL , ORG ordered its judicial reorganisation , followed by its compulsory liquidation . On DATE , there being no more outstanding debts , the court terminated the liquidation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the tax authorities inspected the applicant company \u2019s accounts for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE they sent them CARDINAL supplementary tax assessments DATE and CARDINAL for DATE and DATE \u2013 inter alia for supplementary tax on precious metals , jewellery , works of art , ORG items and antiques ( hereinafter \u201c the tax on works of art \u201d ) , in accordance with the provisions of ORG CARDINAL bis A to CARDINAL bis E of LAW ( since DATE , Articles CARDINAL V bis to CARDINAL V sexies of the same code ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the additional tax , the applicant company was charged interest for late payment and a fine was imposed under LAW ( LAW ) , equal at that time to PERCENT of the unpaid tax . On DATE the company was served with a demand to pay a total of MONEY ( ( FRF ) \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) , of which the fine accounted for CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL or EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company , represented by its court - appointed administrator , lodged a complaint with the Director of Revenue seeking relief from all the surcharges and fines demanded . It alleged on the one hand that the tax on works of art could be likened either to a value - added tax , which was contrary to Directives CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC and CARDINAL of the ORG establishing special provisions applicable , inter alia , to works of art and ORG items , or to a capital - gains tax , with an effect equivalent to an export restriction or an internal taxation , both of which were prohibited by ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The applicant company also argued that the fines , which could be likened to criminal convictions within the meaning of LAW , should have been imposed by a court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of Revenue rejected the complaint , stating that the tax concerned was not comparable to a value - added tax and did not hinder the free movement of goods , in so far as it applied to sales made either in GPE or in any other ORG member ORG . ORG also pointed out that the ORG , in its GPE v. GPE judgment ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) had acknowledged that the system of administrative penalties was compatible with LAW , provided that their application was subject to court supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company brought an action before ORG seeking exemption from the supplementary tax on works of art demanded of it for DATE and from the related penalties , based on the same grounds as its earlier complaint .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the court rejected the action . Concerning the conformity of the tax penalty with LAW , it pointed out that the courts responsible for tax matters had full power of review over the facts concerned and their classification by the authorities , and decided in each case , in the light of the results of that review , either to uphold or apply the tax penalty effectively incurred in the amount provided for by law , without being able to adjust it to the circumstances of the particular case , or , if they considered that the authorities had not established that the infringements of LAW had been made out , not to fine the taxpayer . The court accordingly deemed that LAW did not necessarily require the tax court to have the power to adjust the amount of the penalty to suit the particular circumstances of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged an appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . During those proceedings , order no . CARDINAL of DATE reduced the fine provided for LAW ( which became LAW DATE ) from PERCENT of the unpaid tax .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax authorities reduced the fine by ORG MONEY , and on DATE the additional tax on works of art demanded was reduced by ORG because of a mistake in the calculation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company used the same arguments before ORG as it had before ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG , having taken note of the reductions and ruled that there was no need for it to take those amounts into account , upheld the judgment on the whole but reduced the price the tax authorities had placed on CARDINAL work acquired by the applicant company . After careful consideration it rejected the applicant company \u2019s formal and substantive arguments that the tax was at variance with Community law , for example , or that it should not have been applied to the acquisition of certain works . The court also rejected the argument under LAW concerning the fine , for similar reasons to those given by the lower court , pointing out that ORG had full jurisdiction as required by LAW , which did not require the court to be able to lower the rate of a fine when the legislation provided for a single rate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed to the ORG d\u2019Etat on points of law , alleging , inter alia , that the tax was incompatible with Community law and the fine incompatible with LAW , in so far as the court had no power to adjust it to reflect the seriousness of the taxpayer \u2019s conduct according to a statutory scale .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat rejected the appeal . Regarding the fine , it held as follows :", "\u201c Considering ... on the one hand that , in order to make the rate of the fine proportionate to the offence , the order of DATE fixed it at PERCENT , and on the other hand that the tax court , having exercised its full power of review over the facts of the appeal and the classification adopted by the authorities , decides , in each case , depending on the results of that review , either to uphold the surcharge imposed by the authorities or to cancel it if it considers that the taxpayer has not infringed the rules applicable to works of art , and that it therefore has full jurisdiction as required under the provisions of paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ... , which do not imply that even where the legislation provides for a single rate for the fine in question the court must be able to adjust it and apply a rate lower than that provided for by law ; accordingly , in not setting aside the fine provided for in LAW in the present case , the court did not commit any error of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged CARDINAL appeals with the PERSON d\u2019Etat challenging the interpretation by the Minister of ORG ( \u201c the Minister \u201d ) of the tax law found in the basic administrative documents ( in its successive versions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) , whereby the Minister defined the base of the tax on works of art as their selling price , including commission .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company pointed out that ORG alone had the power to create a tax and determine the key details of its establishment and collection , and submitted that the Minister , in whose name the administrative documents concerned had been drafted , had overstepped his powers .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the tax was completely rewritten and the numbering changed , by LAW , adopted on DATE and effective from DATE . On that occasion the provisions concerning the base of the tax , previously found in the administrative documents , and those concerning the collection of the tax , previously found in the regulatory part of LAW , were incorporated in the legislative part of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat joined the appeals and rejected them . It considered , based on the impugned provisions of LAW , that the law \u201c implicitly but necessarily \u201d intended to base the tax on works of art on the selling price and , for want of further clarification on this point , the selling price taken into account as a base for the tax should be understood to include all the costs borne by the purchaser . That being so , the PERSON d\u2019Etat considered that , in basing the tax on works of art on the selling price including commission , the Minister had correctly interpreted the impugned provisions and had not laid down any new rules or overstepped his authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged CARDINAL appeals with the PERSON d\u2019Etat to set aside the decisions by which the Prime Minister had implicitly rejected its requests to revoke the regulations governing the means of collecting the tax on works of art , issued pursuant to LAW introducing the said tax . It contended that the provisions in question were of a legal nature and had been introduced by an authority which had no law - making powers . It further alleged that the legal provisions concerning the persons to whom the tax applied were confusing and unclear , in breach of the principle , enshrined in LAW , that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat joined the appeals and rejected them . It considered that the regulatory authority had simply laid down the procedure for collecting the tax , in conformity with the provisions of LAW of DATE , and had not overstepped its authority or the terms of its remit . It further considered that the argument concerning the principle , enshrined in LAW , that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty could not be relied on in favour of setting aside the refusal to revoke the regulations in issue .", "CARDINAL . The fixed - rate tax on works of art is a particular way of taxing capital gains . It was introduced by LAW on the taxation of capital gains and the creation of a fixed - rate tax on precious metals , jewellery , works of art , ORG items and antiques . Until DATE it was embodied in ORG CARDINAL bis A to CARDINAL bis E of LAW , then until DATE in Articles CARDINAL V bis to CARDINAL V sexies of the same code . The relevant parts of those Articles read as follows .", "\u201c I. Subject to the specific provisions applicable to business profits , ... the sale of jewellery , works of art , collectors\u2019 items and antiques shall be subject to a PERCENT tax when the value exceeds FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL ; when the price is between FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL and CARDINAL , the base of the tax shall be reduced by a sum equal to the difference between ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the said price .", "...", "These provisions shall also be applicable to sales made in another member ORG of ORG .", "... \u201d", "\u201c The tax provided for in LAW bis shall be borne by the seller . It shall be paid by the intermediary taking part in the transaction or , failing that , by the buyer , within DATE and under the same guarantees as turnover tax . However , where the sale is made in another member ORG of ORG , the tax shall be paid by the seller , under the same conditions .", "The tax shall not be levied where the seller is a professional dealer in the goods concerned . \u201d", "\u201c The seller of jewellery or other objects mentioned in the second line of paragraph I of LAW bis may opt , by a declaration made at the time of the sale , for the scheme defined in LAW CARDINAL T provided that he is able to show proof of the date and price of acquisition . The conditions of this option are fixed by decree of the ORG d\u2019Etat . \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE ( Law no . DATE of DATE ) , which took effect on DATE , changed those provisions . Among other things it covered the person legally liable for the tax on works of art , the base on which the tax was assessed and how it was collected . Henceforth , Article CARDINAL ORG paragraph CARDINAL of the same code reads :", "\u201c The tax shall be borne by the seller or the exporter . It shall be paid by the intermediary resident in GPE for tax purposes who takes part in the transaction and under his responsibility or , failing that , by the seller or the exporter .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Failure to pay the tax on works of art gives rise to a fine . At the material time LAW ( which became LAW octies in DATE ) provided :", "\u201c Breaches of Articles CARDINAL V bis to CARDINAL V sexies shall give rise to a tax penalty equal to the unpaid tax and collected in the same manner as turnover tax . \u201d", "Order no . DATE on the simplification of taxation and the harmonisation and adjustment of penalties reduced the fine provided for in LAW octies from PERCENT of the unpaid tax . LAW became LAW .", "CARDINAL . Traditionally a distinction is made between a full administrative - law action ( before an administrative court having full jurisdiction ) and an appeal for judicial review seeking to have an administrative decision set aside . In the latter type of appeal the power of the administrative court is limited : it can only set aside a decision retroactively because of a legal flaw , without ruling on the merits . In a full administrative - law action , on the other hand , the powers of the administrative court are much broader : not only can it set aside or uphold an administrative decision , but it can also vary it , replace it with its own decision and rule on the rights of the interested party . It can also order the administrative authorities to pay damages . What is more , when the administrative court has full jurisdiction it examines the lawfulness of the decision referred to it in the light of the legal and factual circumstances at the time when it gives judgment ( not , as in appeals for judicial review , at the time when the administrative decision was taken ) .", "Full administrative - law actions include appeals to establish the liability of the ORG in contractual or extra - contractual matters , actions concerning fiscal or electoral matters ( municipal and district ) , appeals against administrative sanctions , and various other actions .", "CARDINAL . In the realm of tax litigation , the administrative courts have jurisdiction in matters concerning direct taxes and turnover tax , while cases concerning indirect taxes are a matter for the ordinary courts . As a result , the administrative courts have the power to cancel the taxes and related penalties demanded by the tax authorities and can also fix the sum to be paid , within the limits of the applicable legal provisions . As regards penalties , the administrative courts can replace a higher rate with a lower rate when several rates are applicable depending on the taxpayer \u2019s conduct .", "CARDINAL . On the question of the power of the courts to vary the rate of tax penalties , ORG have adopted different solutions .", "CARDINAL . Where fines are imposed in the event of late payment of the differential tax on motor vehicles ( LAW repealed on DATE ) , ORG , in a judgment of DATE , declined to apply the Article in question as being contrary to LAW in so far as \u201c it did not provide for a full administrative - law action against the administrative decision enabling the court to rule on the principle and the amount of the fine \u201d ( PERSON . com . , PERSON , ORG no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . That approach was subsequently confirmed ( PERSON . com . , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , no . CARDINAL ; PERSON . com . , DATE , PERSON , Bulletin CARDINAL IV no . CARDINAL ) . In the judgment of DATE mentioned above , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c LAW ... is incompatible with LAW ... only in so far as the court before which proceedings are brought challenging a penalty imposed on a taxpayer by the tax authorities can not rule on the principle and size of the fine , so the task of the court , before which the [ individual concerned ] argued that he had paid the tax immediately after being ordered to pay it , was to assess the proportionality of the penalty with the taxpayer \u2019s conduct ... \u201d", "ORG explained in a judgment of DATE ( PERSON . com . , PERSON , no . DATE ) , concerning PERCENT supplementary tax demand for failure to declare a gift :", "\u201c LAW ... opens up the right to appeal to a court having full jurisdiction to ensure that a fine imposed by the tax authorities is proportionate to the taxpayer\u2019 , and ... the trial court can exercise the power thus vested in it only if the party challenging the fine enables it to assess the principle and the amount of the fine ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG d\u2019Etat initially ruled on Articles DATE and DATE of LAW , which provide for different penalties depending on the taxpayer \u2019s conduct and its classification in law ( LAW , as it stood at the material time , provided for a PERCENT increase in the fine if the taxpayer had acted in bad faith , and PERCENT if there was deception ) .", "In an opinion of DATE concerning Article DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat stated :", "\u201c [ T]he law ... making penalties proportionate to the taxpayer \u2019s conduct provided for the surcharge applied to vary according to the legal classification given to the conduct concerned . The relevant court , having fully exercised its power of review of the authorities\u2019 classification of that conduct , must apply the relevant surcharge rate provided for by law , without being able to vary it in consideration of the seriousness of the offence committed by the taxpayer . \u201d ( ORG , PERSON opinion , Revue de jurisprudence fiscale ( ORG ) DATE , no . CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . In another case concerning the possibility of varying the penalties provided for in DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat gave the following explanation in an opinion of CARDINAL DATE :", "\u201c [ T]he relevant court , having fully exercised its power of review of the facts and the authorities\u2019 classification thereof , decides in each case , depending on the results of the review , either to uphold or apply the surcharge effectively incurred at the rate provided for by law , without being able to vary it in consideration of the seriousness of the offence committed by the taxpayer , or , if it considers that the authorities have failed to establish that the taxpayer is guilty of deception or of acting in bad faith , only to charge interest for late payment . The provisions of paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ... do not oblige it to proceed otherwise ... \u201d ( CE , PERSON opinion , ORG , no . CARDINAL ; see also ORG , DATE , NORP Paolo Nanc\u00e9ienne , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , no . DATE )", "CARDINAL . The PERSON d\u2019Etat used the same reasoning in respect of Article CARDINAL of LAW , which provides for different rates of fine depending on the seriousness of the taxpayer \u2019s failure to comply with the obligations concerning tax returns ( ORG , DATE , ORG , ORG , no . CARDINAL , and CE , DATE , PERSON , RJF DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the ORG d\u2019Etat transposed this approach to penalties which , although they appeared in a separate LAW , were part of a series of repressive measures that included penalties provided for in other Articles of the LAW ( see , for example , regarding the PERCENT fine provided for in DATE ( now LAW A CARDINAL ) of the LAW in the event of failure to declare an immediately deductible value - added tax , ORG , CARDINAL DATE , ORG , RJF DATE , no . CARDINAL ; regarding the PERCENT fine provided for in DATE ) of the LAW in the event of concealment or falsification of the identity or address of suppliers or clients , ORG , DATE , PERSON , ORG , no . CARDINAL , and for the PERCENT fine ( reduced to PERCENT in DATE ) imposed under LAW for obstructing a tax assessment , ORG , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , PERSON DATE no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL decisions of CARDINAL DATE , following CARDINAL preliminary questions of constitutionality concerning PERCENT tax surcharge provided for in DATE of LAW ( for , respectively , non - declaration after receipt of notice and bad faith on the part of the taxpayer ) , ORG declared the ORG in question to be in conformity with the LAW , in the following similar terms in both decisions :", "\u201c The principle of the individualisation of penalties that results [ from LAW ] implies that a tax surcharge , when imposed as a penalty , may be applied only if the authorities , subject to judicial review , expressly ordered it taking into account the particular circumstances in each case ; it can not , however , prevent the law from laying down rules to ensure the effective repression of offences ;", "...", "The impugned provision instituted a financial penalty the nature of which is directly linked to that of the offence ; the law itself adjusted the penalties according to the seriousness of the offence ; the court decides in each case , having fully exercised its power of review of the facts and the authorities\u2019 classification thereof , either to maintain ... the surcharge effectively incurred at the rate provided for by law , or to replace it by another rate provided for in the other provisions of the Article ... if it considers it legally justified [ ( LAW ) ] , or , if it considers that the authorities have failed to establish that the taxpayer is guilty of deception or of acting in bad faith , it may decide only to charge interest for late payment [ ( LAW ) ] ; it thus has the power to make the penalties proportionate to the taxpayer \u2019s conduct ; the rate of PERCENT is not manifestly disproportionate ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
