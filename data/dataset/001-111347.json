NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national born in DATE who lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Deputy Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as apparent from documents available to the public , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a rise in violent crime in the city of GPE the GPE ( PERSON ) of that city gave an order designating certain areas as security risk areas ( veiligheidsrisicogebieden ) . Relying on section CARDINALb of LAW ( PERSON ) , the PERSON designated most of the old centre of GPE as a security risk area for DATE on DATE . By virtue of such a decision , a public prosecutor ( PERSON ) was empowered , in accordance with section PERSON ) of LAW ( LOC en GPE ) , to order that for a randomly selected period of TIME any persons present in the designated area might be subjected to a search for the presence of weapons . The process came to be known as \u201c preventive searching \u201d ( preventief fouilleren ) .", "CARDINAL . The reasoning on which the order was based referred to statistics of incidents involving the use of weapons ( shootings , knifings , robberies , fatal and non - fatal casualties ) in each of the areas concerned . It was observed that such incidents occurred most often in the old centre of the city , especially around the PERSON ( the red - light district ) , the central station and around the concentrations of restaurants , bars and places of entertainment .", "CARDINAL . By order of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON designated the same area as a security risk area for DATE based on the fact that weapons were still being confiscated during searches and there had been insufficient decrease in the number of violent crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , while in the designated security risk area , was stopped by police acting on orders of the public prosecutor to conduct searches of every person present in the security risk area . The applicant refused to submit to a search . He was then arrested ( aangehouden ) and taken to a police station , where he refused to give a statement ( verklaring ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a single - judge chamber ( politierechter ) of ORG ( rechtbank ) convicted the applicant of failing to obey a lawful order under LAW ) . He was sentenced to a fine of CARDINAL ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) , which acquitted him of all charges on DATE . ORG considered that section CARDINALb of LAW imposed stringent requirements with regard to the decision to designate an area as a security risk area , especially in the light of NORP freedom of movement and respect for the right to privacy . The PERSON \u2019s decisions ( including the CARDINAL dated DATE ) did not meet the requirements of section CARDINALb as the PERSON had failed to give any reasons why the security risk area had to be designated for such lengthy periods and cover such a large area . Accordingly , the decisions were not in conformity with LAW either .", "CARDINAL . The Advocate General ( PERSON ) at ORG lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON ) against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant submitted his application to the ORG , ORG , on DATE , granted the appeal lodged by ORG . ORG held that in considering the validity of the designation order the criminal judge should follow the approach of administrative courts in the matter . On that basis , and quoting from a judgment of ORG of ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak PERSON ) of DATE ( Administrative Law Reports ( ORG ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , it found that the PERSON had a wide margin of appreciation ( beoordelingsmarge ) in assessing the need for any such order after consultation with the public prosecutor . It was for him or her to balance the interests involved , including public order and individual private life , against each other . The designation order should be limited in time and in area to what was necessary ( noodzakelijk ) to maintain public order . The PERSON \u2019s choices had to be properly reasoned and proportionate to the interference with the private life of anyone present in the area concerned . The role of the criminal courts was limited to assessing the lawfulness and reasonableness of the PERSON \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . Considering the case in this light , ORG held that ORG had correctly considered that the PERSON \u2019s decision of DATE had to be read in conjunction with his original decision of DATE . Nevertheless , in finding that insufficient reasons had been given for the decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG had failed to take into account the extensive report which had formed the basis for the DATE decision . ORG therefore quashed the judgment of ORG and remitted the case to ORG for re - hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found that the PERSON had given sufficient reasons for his decision of DATE by referring to the considerations contained in the original decision of DATE . ORG further considered that any interference with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW had taken place in the interests of the protection of public order and in accordance with the margin of appreciation awarded to GPE . For those reasons ORG found the applicant guilty of failing to obey a lawful order , but imposed no sentence on him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not lodge an appeal on points of law against this judgment .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE the PERSON again designated the same area as a security risk area for DATE as weapons were still being confiscated even though the number of violent crimes had decreased significantly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON again designated the same area of the centre of GPE as a security risk area , this time for a period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the PERSON , taking into account the judgment of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , issued a decision altering the original decision of DATE by designating the same area as a security risk area for DATE instead of the original CARDINAL . The PERSON also set out more extensive reasons for his decision , including a breakdown of the decrease in weapon - related crimes following the introduction of preventive searching in the security risk areas . For GPE city centre alone , it was noted that numbers of weapons - related incidents had dropped to CARDINAL DATE and DATE , down from CARDINAL ; DATE and DATE , from CARDINAL to CARDINAL ; DATE and DATE , from CARDINAL to CARDINAL . In PERCENT of all preventive search operations until then CARDINAL weapon had been found .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against the decision of the PERSON of DATE . The applicant submitted that the designated security risk area was too large and that there were insufficient reasons for including the different districts , considering the impact on people \u2019s right to respect for their privacy and freedom of movement . The applicant further alleged that the percentages used by the PERSON to support his decision had been calculated in such a way as to make his policy seem more effective than it really was .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , whilst awaiting the outcome of his objection , the applicant also applied for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) on the same grounds as his objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the provisional - measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG declared the applicant \u2019s request inadmissible on the ground that the applicant did not appear to have a direct interest in the decision of the PERSON dated DATE and that presumably the applicant \u2019s objection would be declared inadmissible for the same reason .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON declared the applicant \u2019s objection inadmissible as the applicant could not be regarded as a person with a direct interest ( belanghebbende ) as required by article CARDINAL:CARDINAL of LAW ( Algemene wet bestuursrecht ) . The PERSON held that a person could only be said to have a direct interest if that interest was strictly personal , real and direct and could be identified objectively . According to the PERSON , the applicant neither lived in the security risk area nor had a paid job which required him to be in the area at regular set times . The fact that the applicant claimed to be engaged in volunteer work and paid social visits to friends in the designated area did not suffice to give him a direct interest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal against this decision to ORG ; the reason he gives is that the designation order of DATE was due to expire on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The municipality of GPE commissioned ORG ( ORG Instituut voor Veiligheids- en ORG ) , a body based in GPE , to produce a series of evaluation reports on preventive searches in the security risk areas . The ORG has studied CARDINAL of these , which contain data pertaining to the time of the events complained of .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG published a report entitled \u201c Evaluation of preventive body searches in GPE : The current situation \u201d ( Evaluatie Preventief Fouilleren in GPE : PERSON stand van zaken ) . It covered the period DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In GPE city centre , DATE and DATE CARDINAL weapon had been found for every CARDINAL persons searched . DATE and DATE one weapon had been found for every CARDINAL persons searched ; DATE and DATE , again , CARDINAL weapon for every QUANTITY persons searched ; and DATE , CARDINAL weapon for every CARDINAL persons searched . In GPE , which has a far more modern and open layout than the old city centre , there were generally far fewer weapons found until the search operations were planned to cover times and places at which the risk of violent incidents was highest ; the number of weapons found then rose to CARDINAL per CARDINAL persons searched . The report mentioned that the operations that had had the greatest effect in relation to the police manpower invested had lasted for TIME or less , which could be explained by the loss of the advantage of surprise as an operation dragged on for longer .", "CARDINAL . The number of incidents involving the use of weapons had dropped during this period . In GPE city centre , DATE and DATE there had been CARDINAL such incidents ; DATE , only CARDINAL , or PERCENT fewer . The number of muggings in this area dropped from CARDINAL to CARDINAL , a reduction of PERCENT . In GPE , the number of weapons - related incidents had dropped by PERCENT in comparison of the same periods . Within the area of jurisdiction of the GPE - Amstelland Police Force as a whole , the total decrease had been PERCENT ; if the security risk areas were excluded , it had been PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . The evaluation report mentions the applicant \u2019s case , which at the time the report was published was still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report recommended that random searches be continued in the same CARDINAL areas , given their obvious effectiveness . It also made further proposals aimed at increasing efficiency .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG published a report entitled \u201c Evaluation of preventive body searches in GPE : Gains , incidents involving weapons and hot spots \u201d ( Evaluatie Preventief Fouilleren in GPE : Opbrengsten , wapenincidenten en hot spots ) . It was noted that searches had become more efficient , which had allowed more persons to be searched within a given time . DATE and DATE CARDINAL weapon had been found for every CARDINAL persons searched in GPE centre ; in GPE , the corresponding figure was one weapon for every CARDINAL persons searched .", "CARDINAL . Numbers of weapons - related incidents had continued to decline . As compared to the period from DATE until DATE , DATE there were PERCENT fewer such incidents ( CARDINAL , down from CARDINAL ) ; in GPE , PERCENT fewer ( CARDINAL , down from CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The frequency of weapons - related incidents had increased by PERCENT in GPE outside the security risk areas ; within the area of jurisdiction of the GPE - Amstelland Police Force as a whole , there had been a reduction of PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . The report identified CARDINAL \u201c hot spots \u201d outside the existing security risk areas where incidents involving the use of weapons were frequent . In CARDINAL of them the problem was so serious that preventive searches should be carried out there too .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed the ORG that the same area had been designated as a security risk area for the seventh consecutive time .", "CARDINAL .

A further appeal lies to ORG of ORG ( at the relevant time , section CARDINAL of ORG ( Wet op de Raad van State ) ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has held that a conviction under LAW is possible only if the order disobeyed by the accused was given by an official within the limits of his or her lawful authority ( see its judgment of DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . From this it follows that the criminal court has a responsibility of its own to determine whether the statutory regulation on which the order is based is actually binding , and whether the order has been lawfully given ; if the issue is raised by the defence , the criminal court must answer it , irrespective of whether or not the accused has first addressed these matters before the competent administrative tribunals ( see ORG judgment of DATE , GPE Law Reports DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , Administrative Law Reports DATE , no . CARDINAL , ORG of ORG dismissed an appeal lodged against the designation of much of the centre of the town of PERSON as a security risk area on DATE and DATE TIME . Identifying the designation order as delegated legislation ( besluit van algemene strekking ) , it held that persons wishing to contest such an order had to demonstrate an individual interest which sufficiently distinguished them from others . It noted that the appellant did not reside , or work , or carry on a business in that area ; was not compelled for any other reason to remain there for any length of time ; and had no rights to immovable property there either . In view of , in particular , the times at which the designation order was in force , the stated fact that the appellant had been a resident of PERSON for DATE ; went out in the area concerned ; and was wo nt to visit friends and family there was insufficient to distinguish her individual interest from that of others .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , no violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention could be found since there was no certainty that the appellant would ever actually be searched , and since in any case there was no particular need for the appellant to be within the area concerned with any regularity ; any interference with her rights was therefore so uncertain that it could not be considered a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the designation order . That being so , there was no \u201c arguable claim \u201d for the purposes of LAW either .", "CARDINAL . In its above - mentioned decision of CARDINAL DATE ( Administrative Law Reports DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , ORG allowed an appeal brought by the PERSON of GPE against the suspension of a designation order by the provisional measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) pending reconsideration of the order on its merits . It found that the PERSON had a wide margin of appreciation in assessing the need for any such order after consultation with the public prosecutor . It was for him or her to balance the interests involved , including public order against individual private life , against each other . The designation order should be limited in time and in area to what was necessary to maintain public order . The PERSON \u2019s choices had to be properly reasoned and proportionate to the interference with the private life of anyone present in the area concerned .", "CARDINAL . In the particular case , these requirements had been met , given the frequency of incidents involving the use of firearms in the area and the number of weapons found during earlier searches . Although searches constituted an interference with the right to respect for \u201c private life \u201d within the meaning of LAW , given the margin of appreciation of the domestic authorities the PERSON could reasonably consider such measures in pursuit of the interests of public safety and the prevention of disorder or crime to answer a \u201c pressing social need \u201d and to meet the requirement of proportionality ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
