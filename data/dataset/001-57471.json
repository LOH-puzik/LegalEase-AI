The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE . He has no fixed occupation .", "On DATE , the GPE criminal court ( tribunal correctionnel ) sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for theft , and attempted theft , committed with the aid of skeleton keys . The court also ordered that he be \" placed at the Government \u2019s disposal \" for DATE , pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG see paragraph CARDINAL below ) : it noted that Mr. PERSON was a recidivist ( LAW ) who had been sentenced by the GPE criminal court on DATE to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for aggravated theft and who manifested a persistent tendency to crime .", "The applicant and the minist\u00e8re public ( public prosecuter \u2019s department ) appealed to ORG , which confirmed the first instance decision on DATE . It found that the placing at the ORG \u2019s disposal was justified by the danger to which society and Mr. PERSON himself would be exposed were he to be released on completion of his sentence ( door het gevaar dat , na afloop PERSON die tegen hem uitgesproken wordt , de invrijheidstelling van de veroordeelde voor de maatschappij en voor hem CARDINAL zou doen lopen ) . An appeal by the applicant on a point of law was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the completion ( on DATE ) of his principal sentence , which he served at FAC prison , GPE , and then at GPE , Mr. PERSON did not remain in detention . It was true , according to the medical officer specialised in psychology ( m\u00e9decin - anthropologue ) at GPE prison , that he was incapable of self - criticism and had no sense of responsibility ( noch auto - kritiek , noch verantwoordelijkszin ) . Nevertheless , the Minister of ORG , acting on the advice of the prison governor and following a \" policy of securing as far as possible the rehabilitation of released prisoners \" , agreed to attempt to reintegrate him into society by placing him , as from DATE , in semi - custodial care ; this involved his working as an apprentice in a central - heating installation firm in GPE and attending intensive vocational training courses in a specialised institution on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disappeared , however , on DATE . DATE , on the instructions of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ( public prosecuter ) attached to ORG , he was placed on the wanted list and , on DATE , he was arrested , pursuant to a warrant issued by an investigating judge in connection with an attempt to commit aggravated theft , and detained at ORG prison , GPE . On DATE , he was found not guilty by the GPE criminal court , but on DATE the Minister of ORG decided to send him to PERSON prison , in the block reserved for recidivists placed at the ORG \u2019s disposal ( te doen overbrengen QUANTITY recidivisten te PERSON ) ; this was because the ORG \u2019s individual ORG had expressed the opinion , on DATE , that the applicant had abused the opportunity offered to him , that he was totally untrustworthy and that a further period of detention was indicated ( dat ( hij ) werkelijk misbruik heeft gemaakt van de hem geboden kans , dat hij helemaal niet is te betrouwen en dat een nieuwe interneringsperiode gewittigd is ) .", "On the strength of a favourable opinion from ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , before which Mr. PERSON had appeared on DATE , the Minister of ORG decided on DATE to release him conditionally on DATE , since the firm mentioned above was prepared to re - engage him as a trainee heating technician .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disappeared again at DATE . He was arrested on DATE and brought before the GPE criminal court on a charge of aggravated theft , where he was sentenced on DATE to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE , on the expiration of this sentence , he was released as the Minister had agreed to make a further attempt at his reintegration into society , but at DATE the agency responsible for monitoring his rehabilitation lost trace of him . He was arrested on CARDINAL DATE and , until DATE , served a sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for aggravated theft , imposed by the GPE criminal court on DATE ; thereafter he returned to PERSON prison pursuant to a detention decision ( te interneren ) taken by the Minister of ORG on DATE . He left prison on DATE : DATE previously and on the recommendation of ORG , the Minister had agreed to his conditional release ( te ontslaan ) , in the form of DATE renewable leave , with a view to rehabilitation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON accordingly went to GPE , accompanied by a member of the ORG committee , but the rehabilitation plan proved impracticable and he therefore returned to GPE . After different setbacks in hostels , he was obliged to live alone in GPE , without work and completely without resources . On DATE , the ORG , citing the risk of recidivism , proposed that \" steps be taken to detain \" the applicant at PERSON ; the Minister of ORG gave his consent on the following day . Thereupon , Mr. PERSON disappeared for the third time ; the authorities placed him on the wanted list , on account of his conduct . After hiding for DATE in the GPE and finding himself in dire financial straits , he gave himself up on DATE to the police attached to the parquet du procureur du PERSON ( public prosecuter \u2019s office ) in GPE . He was detained at once in ORG prison before being sent back to PERSON . On DATE , as he was unwilling to do the work offered to him , he was placed in the cell block rather than in the recidivists block .", "On DATE , the applicant appeared at his request before ORG , which decided to re - examine his case in DATE . At its meeting on DATE , ORG found that he had saved nothing during his detention and that he had no prospects of finding work outside prison . It therefore declined to recommend his release unless and until he had saved CARDINAL BF through his prison work .", "On DATE , the applicant was transferred from PERSON to PERSON prison .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE , Mr. PERSON , relying on section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , had filed with the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to ORG an application for release from the effects of the decision placing him at the ORG \u2019s disposal . ORG refused the application on DATE : after rejecting the arguments which he had based on Articles CARDINAL par . CARDINAL , CARDINAL par . CARDINAL , CARDINAL par . CARDINAL and CARDINAL par . CARDINAL of the Convention ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL , article CARDINAL - CARDINAL , article CARDINAL - CARDINAL , article DATE ) , the ORG found that each time the applicant had been released , he had yielded to impulse and committed further offences ; it concluded from this that he remained asocial ( zodat hij asociaal blijft ) . On DATE , his appeal on a point of law was held by ORG to be inadmissible on the ground that he was no longer entitled to contest before that ORG - as he had attempted to do by pleading the Convention - the validity of the decision complained of , that decision having been final since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged with the PERSON procureur du Roi a complaint of arbitrary detention and , in the alternative , of abuse of authority ( abus de pouvoir ) . He pointed out that since DATE the balance on his account had been CARDINAL BF ; in addition , he alleged that ORG , not being mentioned in LAW DATE , was \" unlawful \" and he accused the Minister of transforming his sentence into CARDINAL of \" forced labour \" . On DATE , the complaint was set aside as requiring no further action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON appeared again before the above - mentioned ORG . Noting that he had by then saved CARDINAL BF and had been detained for long enough ( lang genoeg ) , the ORG recommended , \" without much enthusiasm \" ( zonder veel enthousiasme ) , that he be released ( te ontslaan ) . Accordingly , on DATE , the Minister of ORG granted him DATE renewable leave , to be preceded by DATE period of semi - custodial care during which he was to be accommodated at TIME in FAC prison ( GPE ) but was to work outside the prison during the TIME . However , he disappeared on DATE after DATE out and was at once placed on the wanted list for return to the recidivists block at PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON was caught in the act of stealing in GPE and arrested . On DATE , he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment by the PERSON criminal court and , on completing that sentence on DATE , was sent back to PERSON . ORG had found , on DATE , that the applicant \u2019s return to detention did not require a fresh ORG decision since he had evaded detention on DATE ( aangezien betrokkene zich op CARDINAL . CARDINAL . QUANTITY onttrokken aan zijn internering , is geen ministeri\u00eble beslissing nodig om hem opnieuw te interneren ) .", "The case was re - examined by ORG on DATE , but the matter was adjourned until DATE . On DATE , ORG pointed out that , on account of his systematic refusal to work , Mr. PERSON had saved CARDINAL BF and it therefore proposed that he not be granted renewable leave until he had saved CARDINAL BF . On DATE , the Minister gave instructions to that effect ; he also stipulated that the applicant \u2019s release should be subject to a series of condition similar to those previously laid down by the Minister , namely submitting to the \" guidance \" of ORG , working regularly , not changing employer or address without that ORG \u2019s consent , refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and not associating with former criminals . It proved impossible to implement this decision , since Mr. PERSON failed to satisfy any of the conditions attached thereto . On DATE , he appeared once more before ORG , which confirmed the advice it had tendered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged with the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to ORG a second application based on section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This application was granted on DATE : after considering the submissions to the contrary on the part of the minist\u00e8re public and although the ORG rejected , as in DATE , the arguments based on the Convention , it held that there were by then reasons for releasing Mr. PERSON from the effects of the decision placing him at the ORG \u2019s disposal . He was set free on DATE , but shortly afterwards was again deprived of his liberty , the GPE criminal court and ORG having sentenced him on DATE and DATE to DATE and to DATE imprisonment for aggravated theft , though without applying to him FAC .", "CARDINAL . The placing of recidivists and habitual offenders at the Government \u2019s disposal was substituted for the placing under special police supervision that had been provided for in LAW of DATE ; it was introduced by LAW of DATE and is DATE the subject of sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL ( LAW ) of ORG in respect of ORG and Habitual Offenders Act of DATE ( \" the DATE LAW ) .", "According to NORP case - law , being placed at the ORG \u2019s disposal is to be classified as a penalty and not as a security measure ; this has various consequences in law ( Court of Cassation , DATE , ORG , I , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , ibid . DATE , I , pp . CARDINAL ; DATE , ibid . DATE , I , p. CARDINAL ) . Under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act , the placing at the Government \u2019s disposal is added on to a principal penalty involving deprivation of liberty imposed at the same time , becomes operative on the expiration of that penalty and applies for a period fixed by the LAW , namely DATE , DATE , or from DATE , according to the nature of the case .", "A person who has committed one indictable offence ( crime ) after another must be placed at the Government \u2019s disposal ( section CARDINAL ) , whereas in other cases - such as the applicant \u2019s - it is a matter for the court \u2019s discretion ( section CARDINAL ) : the latter rule applies where a non - indictable offence ( d\u00e9lit ) has followed an indictable or a non - indictable offence ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) , where an indictable offence has followed a non - indictable offence and to the case of \" anyone who , having committed in DATE CARDINAL offences each involving a penalty of imprisonment for a non - indictable offence ( emprisonnement correctionnel ) of DATE , is shown to manifest a persistent tendency to crime \" . In the latter cases , \" particulars of the proceedings in respect of the offences which cause the individual concerned to be classified as a recidivist have to be included in the current prosecution file \" and the court concerned must give \" specific and precise \" reasons for ordering the penalty in question ( section CARDINAL and Court of Cassation , DATE , Pasicrisie DATE , I , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . If a recidivist is sentenced to a further principal penalty of imprisonment , the effects of any prior order placing him at the Government \u2019s disposal are suspended until that sentence has been served . Such was the result , in the present case , of the judgments of DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The new sentence of imprisonment may itself be accompanied by a further order placing the individual concerned at the ORG \u2019s disposal , the latter penalty to be served after the expiry of the first order , but as regards Mr. PERSON this course was not followed by the GPE , GPE and GPE criminal courts or ORG in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the penalty of being placed at the ORG \u2019s disposal - which can be the subject of a full appeal or of an appeal to ORG on a point of law - and the principal penalty form an \" inseparable whole \" and the former penalty , like the latter , constitutes a deprivation of liberty ( DATE , Pasicrisie DATE , I , pp .

Under section CARDINAL of LAW , \" recidivists and habitual offenders who are at the Government \u2019s disposal shall , if necessary , be detained in an establishment specified by LAW \" - in the instant case the establishment being PERSON , which had been designated for males not suffering from any mental illness ( Royal Decree of DATE ) .", "As is indicated by the phrase \" if necessary \" , the LAW confers on the Government - here , the Minister of ORG - a wide measure of discretion in deciding how the penalty shall be implemented , the choice lying between detention , semi - custodial care , and remaining at liberty under supervision or on probation . The Minister may conditionally release the person concerned either at the end of the principal sentence - failing which he will be detained - or during the course of detention ; he may also revoke conditional release at a later date .", "The Minister of ORG takes various decisions in accordance with a procedure which is laid down , in part , by Ministrial Decrees . Conditional release usually occurs :", "- whilst the principal penalty is being served , on a report from the \" medical officer specialised in psychology \" and the governor of the establishment where the convicted person is held ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "- during detention , on a recommendation by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "A decision to revoke conditional release ( see paragraph CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) is generally taken by the Minister in the light of a report from the officer responsible for the \" guidance \" of the person concerned , or of an recommendation by the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral attached to ORG within whose district the placing at the ORG \u2019s disposal was ordered . These reports and recommendations will cover the manner in which the person in question is observing the prescribed conditions , his means of subsistence , his work , his conduct and the risk of recidivism on his part . If , however , he is in the process of serving a further sentence of imprisonment , revocation is normally based on reports from the \" medical officer specialised in psychology \" and the governor of the establishment ; these reports will contain information on the nature of the offences for which the sentence was imposed , the offender \u2019s criminal record , his personality , his moral character , his family and occupational situation and his future prospects .", "CARDINAL . ORG for Recidivists who have been placed at the Government \u2019s Disposal and are in Detention ( \" ORG \" ) was established by a Ministerial Decree of DATE which was modified and supplemented on CARDINAL DATE and DATE . ORG is composed of a judge or retired judge , who acts as chairman , the medical director or retired medical director of ORG ) and a senior official of ORG .

It is required to supply the Minister of Justice with an opinion - which is not binding - \" on the advisability of releasing recidivists and habitual offenders who are in detention ... and on the conditions \" which should be attached to their release .", "Offenders may apply to appear before the ORG either at the meeting before the expiry of DATE of their detention , if it began as soon as they has finished serving their principal sentence , or at the first meeting held after their return to detention , in cases where the Minister has revoked a decision granting conditional release ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They will be heard again at the meeting before the expiry of DATE of their detention , if it DATE , fixed by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) .", "Although the texts are silent on the point , a detainee will be heard without the assistance of a lawyer and without being able to inspect the prison file which contains , inter alia , the results of the social enquiry . The ORG \u2019s Secretary will communicate to him at once the opinion adopted by ORG at the end of its discussions . If the opinion is favourable , the matter will be referred to the Minister for decision .

The practice followed in implementing the Acts of DATE and DATE has developed considerably over DATE . Initially , offenders were not released until after a period of detention which varied according to the categories in which they ware placed . DATE , on the other hand , where it is the first time that the measure has been ordered and the individual is not very dangerous , the authorities\u2019 general rule is to release him on trial once the principal sentence has been served , subject to detaining him if he commits another offence or fails to observe CARDINAL of the prescribed conditions and is out of work and without means of subsistence . Moreover , detention for a long period is now exceptional : according to the Government , the offender will in practice be conditionally released - unless there is a serious danger to society - as soon as there is a real possibility of rehabilitation .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG DATE and CARDINAL of ORG ( Royal Decree of DATE ) , read in conjunction with Article CARDINAL , persons sentenced to a penalty for a non - indictable offence ( peine correctionnelle ) and then detained pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , as was Mr. PERSON , may be required to do prison work .", "CARDINAL . The ORG maintained that several remedies were available to the applicant :", "( i ) instituting or causing to be instituted a prosecution for arbitrary detention ;", "( ii ) referring to ORG any dispute between himself and the minist\u00e8re public regarding the execution of the judgment of DATE ;", "( iii ) applying to that ORG for release from the effects of the measure imposed on him ;", "( iv ) applying to the President of the court of first instance in his capacity of juge des r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s ( judge hearing urgent applications ) ;", "( v ) bringing an action based directly on LAW . CARDINAL ( article DATE ) of the Convention .", "On the third point , the ORG refers to paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above , and , on the fifth , to paragraph CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first point , anyone who maintains that he has been unlawfully deprived of his liberty , either by a private individual or by a public official , is entitled under NORP law either to file a complaint , with or without the joinder of a claim for damages ( constitution de partie civile ) , or to bring the matter before a criminal court by means of a direct summons ( ORG and CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Criminal Code ; ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the second point , ORG held , in DATE and DATE that disputes between the minist\u00e8re public and a convicted person regarding the execution of a sentence could be referred to the court which passed it , but these are isolated decisions which have not been confirmed by other judgments .", "CARDINAL . As regards the fourth remedy mentioned above , the ORG confines itself for the moment to noting that under LAW and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Judicial Code it falls to the President of the court of first instance to give a ruling , in the capacity of juge des r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s - that is to say , on a \" provisional \" basis , if the matter is urgent , and without prejudice to the \" merits \" - , if so requested by anyone claiming to be the victim of , for example , an administrative act constituting a \" voie de fait \" ( manifest illegality ) .
