{"ITEMID": "001-71267", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ITA", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "HUSAIN v. ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the Achille Lauro , an NORP cruise liner , was attacked by a NORP terrorist commando . The passengers were held hostage for TIME and CARDINAL of them was killed .", "Suspected of being one of the organisers of the attack , the applicant was charged with forgery , handling stolen goods , unlawful possession of a firearm , kidnapping , murder and assault . He and CARDINAL other defendants were committed to stand trial in ORG .", "He was not officially informed of the criminal proceedings against him because the authorities were unable to trace him at the time of the trial . In his observations to the ORG , the applicant alleged that he had left the Achille Lauro before the attack by the commando and had stayed in GPE . The NORP authorities declared him a \u201c fugitive \u201d ( latitante ) and assigned a lawyer to represent him . He was tried in his absence .", "In a judgment of DATE , the text of which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty of handling stolen goods , forgery and unlawful possession of a firearm . It gave him a prison sentence of DATE and imposed a MONEY fine . It acquitted him on the charges of kidnapping , murder and assault . It found , inter alia , that it had not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the applicant knew that the commando intended to hijack the vessel and kidnap the passengers .", "On DATE the Genoa public prosecutor \u2019s office appealed against , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s acquittal on some of the charges . It argued that , as a senior member of the terrorist organisation behind the attack , the applicant \u2019s role could not have been confined to providing logistical support .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the text of which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG granted the appeal and sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment .", "On DATE the judgment of CARDINAL DATE became final as the lawyer assigned to represent the applicant had not lodged an appeal with ORG .", "On DATE ORG issued a warrant requiring the applicant \u2019s committal to serve his sentence . The document , which was drafted in NORP , stated that ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE sentencing the applicant to life imprisonment was unappealable . It then set out the operative provisions of the judgment and , in particular , the legal classification in law of the offences of which the applicant had been found guilty , with a reference to the relevant provisions of LAW and special legislation that was applicable . ORG instructed all law - enforcement personnel to arrest the applicant . Since the applicant was not represented , ORG assigned a lawyer to his case . A copy of the committal warrant was served on him .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had been arrested in GPE . On DATE he was extradited to GPE . He was taken to the NORP police headquarters ( questura ) , where he was served with a copy of the committal warrant of DATE . An interpreter translated it into LANGUAGE for him orally . The applicant and the interpreter signed a record of the proceedings at the police headquarters .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an application to have the committal warrant set aside . He alleged that it had been drafted in NORP and that he had not been provided with a written translation into LANGUAGE , in breach of LAW ( a ) of the LAW , domestic law and the case - law of ORG and ORG . He stressed that , had he understood the document that had been served on him , he would definitely have taken the necessary steps to lodge an application for leave to appeal out of time under LAW within the statutory DATE time - limit . He would thereby have gained additional time in which to appeal to ORG and an opportunity to answer the charges that had been preferred against him .", "ORG dismissed his application in an order of DATE . It observed that LAW provided : \u201c A person charged with a criminal offence who does not speak NORP is entitled to have the free assistance of an interpreter in order to understand the charge ... and the procedural steps to which he or she is a party ... \u201d In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG had held that that provision had to be construed broadly , that is to say as applying in all cases in which , without the assistance of an interpreter , a foreign defendant \u2019s right to take part in his or her trial would be compromised . However , the view expressed by ORG in its case - law was that neither the LAW nor LAW made it obligatory to provide a written translation of every document that was served on a foreign defendant . In the instant case , the committal warrant had been translated orally by an interpreter when it was served , and that was a sufficient basis for concluding that the applicant had understood its content .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that a written translation should have been supplied in his case , added to which the record drawn up at the police headquarters did not indicate the interpreter \u2019s identity . It merely contained the signature of an unidentified person at the foot of the page .", "In a judgment of DATE , which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG found that ORG had dealt with all the issues logically and correctly and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "The relevant passages from LAW and CARDINAL of LAW provide :", "\u201c A person convicted in absentia ... may apply for leave to appeal out of time against the judgment if he is able to prove that he was not effectively notified [ of the judgment ] ... [ and ] on condition that there has been no negligence on his part or , if the judgment delivered in absentia has been served ... on his lawyer ... , that he has not deliberately refused to apprise himself of the steps taken in the proceedings .", "An application for leave to appeal out of time must be lodged within DATE of the date ... on which the accused learned [ of the judgment ] , failing which it shall be inadmissible . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
