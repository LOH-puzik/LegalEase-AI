He was taken into custody in FAC on DATE after CARDINAL detention orders had been issued by a ORG investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment by ORG for attempted intentional homicide , armed robbery , and hostage - taking with a view to facilitating or preparing the commission of a criminal offence or committing a serious crime .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG found him guilty of murder , multiple counts of attempted murder and attempted intentional homicide , armed robbery , handling stolen goods , conspiracy , possessing and carrying illegal weapons , forging cheques and using forged cheques , using explosives to destroy or damage immovable or movable property and an explosives offence . It sentenced him to life imprisonment , with a minimum term of DATE . On DATE the same court sentenced him to DATE imprisonment for unauthorised manufacture or possession of explosive substances or devices , theft , criminal damage and terrorism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for judicial review of certain provisions of circulars issued by the Minister of ORG on DATE and DATE , the former relating to prisoner searches and the latter to prisoners ' written and telegraphic correspondence . He submitted that the circulars contained provisions breaching the decrees and laws in force .", "He complained in particular about the procedure for full body searches as laid down in the technical note appended to the circular of CARDINAL DATE , arguing that it infringed human dignity and thus contravened LAW of LAW . He further objected to the fact that , with reference to LAW , the circular afforded prison staff the possibility of using force to compel prisoners to submit to such humiliating procedures .", "The applicant also complained that the circular of DATE defined \u201c correspondence \u201d as \u201c written communication between CARDINAL named persons , as distinct from bulletins , letters , circulars , leaflets and printed matter , whose content does not specifically and exclusively concern the addressee \u201d . He argued that that definition , based on the content of the document , was at variance with freedom of correspondence as enshrined both in domestic law \u2013 which did not limit the number of letters that could be received and sent by convicted prisoners and other detainees and guaranteed them free choice as to their correspondents DATE and in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . In his view , it thereby introduced restrictions not envisaged by the law and conferred an arbitrary power of censorship on prison governors . He added that by depriving those held in punishment cells of the possibility of corresponding with their friends or relatives and prison visitors , the circular imposed more restrictive conditions than those laid down in LAW of LAW , which simply provided for restrictions on correspondence .", "The applicant stated that the management of ORG had regularly sent him to the punishment block because of his refusal to open his mouth during full body searches in accordance with the first of the above - mentioned circulars . He added that on DATE the prison governor , referring to the second circular , had refused to dispatch a letter the applicant had written to a friend in another prison DATE supplying information to assist him in applying for release on licence \u2013 on the ground that the letter did not \u201c correspond to the definition of the concept of correspondence \u201d .", "In an order registered on DATE with the secretariat of ORG of the ORG d'Etat , the President of ORG transmitted the application to the ORG d'Etat . On DATE the ORG d'Etat gave the following judgment :", "\u201c As to the circular of CARDINAL DATE issued by the Minister of ORG on prisoner searches :", "Article D. CARDINAL of LAW , as worded on DATE of the impugned circular , provided : ' Prisoners must be searched frequently and as often as the prison governor deems necessary./ In particular , they shall be searched on their admission to the prison and each time they are temporarily removed from and returned to the prison for whatever reason . They may also be searched before and after visits or meetings of any kind./ Prisoners may be searched only by officers of the same sex and in conditions which , while ensuring that the checks are effective , maintain respect for the dignity inherent in the human being . '", "In the first place , PERSON seeks the annulment of the provisions of the circular of CARDINAL DATE by which the Minister of ORG envisaged that prisoners could be subjected to full body searches , during which they would be required to undress completely in the presence of a prison officer , and laid down the procedure for carrying out such searches .", "Even in the absence of any statute or regulation expressly authorising him to do so , the Minister of ORG , being responsible for the prison service , was empowered to lay down certain of the conditions in which prisoner searches would be carried out , in accordance with LAW of LAW . Accordingly , Mr Fr\u00e9rot has no grounds for maintaining that the Minister of ORG was not competent to issue the disputed rules in the circular of CARDINAL DATE .", "...", "The disputed provisions of the circular of CARDINAL DATE are designed to ' ensure that prisoners do not have any object or product on their person that could facilitate assaults or escapes , be the subject of trafficking or enable the consumption of toxic products or substances ' . It does not appear from the evidence that the aims thus set forth could be achieved in equivalent conditions without the need to carry out full body searches . The impugned rules provide that a full body search should normally be carried out by a single officer , who is not allowed to have any contact with the prisoner ' except ... when the hair is being inspected ' , and must take place in a room set aside for the purpose , unless this is impossible because of the layout of the LOC , ' out of sight of other prisoners and of anyone not involved in the operation itself ' . Regard being had to the measures envisaged to protect prisoners ' privacy and dignity , and to the particular constraints inherent in the running of custodial facilities , the Minister of Justice neither interfered disproportionately with the principle set forth in LAW ... , nor breached the provisions of LAW of LAW , by which prisoner searches must be carried out ' in conditions which ... maintain respect for the dignity inherent in the human being ' .", "It follows that PERSON has no grounds for seeking the annulment of the rules laid down in the circular of CARDINAL DATE as examined above .", "Secondly , Article D.

' In reiterating through the circular of DATE that a prisoner 's refusal to undergo a search may give rise to a disciplinary sanction and , if the prisoner persists in refusing , to the use of force subject to the conditions set out in the above - mentioned provisions , the Minister of ORG did not issue a new rule . Consequently , PERSON arguments in relation to the references in the circular to the consequences of a prisoner 's refusal to undergo a search are inadmissible .", "As to the circular of DATE issued by the Minister of Justice on prisoners ' written and telegraphic correspondence :", "Article D. CARDINAL of LAW , as in force on DATE of the impugned circular , provided : ' Detention in a punishment cell ... shall entail restrictions on correspondence other than with the prisoner 's family . However , prisoners shall retain the possibility of communicating freely with their counsel ... '", "By means of the impugned provisions set out in his circular of DATE , the Minister of ORG specified that remand and convicted prisoners placed in punishment cells would not be authorised during such placement to correspond with ' their friends or relatives ' or with prison visitors . Those provisions , which are binding , rank as subordinate legislation . On account of their general nature , they breach the regulations referred to above and constitute illegal interference with the freedom of correspondence which prisoners should continue to enjoy even when detained in a punishment cell , subject to the restrictions that may be decided by the prison governor . Accordingly , without it being necessary to examine the other arguments submitted by PERSON , his application for the annulment of the provisions in question is admissible and well - founded .", "As to the refusal by the governor of ORG to dispatch correspondence from PERSON :", "The decision by which the governor of ORG refused to dispatch a letter addressed by PERSON to another prisoner on DATE was , regardless of the content of such correspondence , an internal regulatory measure . As such , it is not amenable to judicial review . The submissions referred to above are manifestly inadmissible and can not be examined in court proceedings ; they must therefore be dismissed .", "As to the decisions by the governors of ORG and ORG to place Mr Fr\u00e9rot in a punishment cell :", "In support of his arguments challenging several decisions by the governors of ORG and ORG to detain him in a punishment cell , PERSON simply objects that the provisions of the circular of CARDINAL DATE , whose annulment he is seeking through the present application , are unlawful . It follows from the findings set out above that the applicant has no grounds for seeking the annulment of those decisions .", "DECIDES :", "Article CARDINAL : The circular by the Minister of ORG dated DATE is annulled in so far as it prohibits all correspondence between remand and convicted prisoners in punishment cells and ' their friends or relatives ' or prison visitors .", "LAW The remainder of the submissions in PERSON application are dismissed .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

From the end of the trial in DATE until he was transferred to FAC in DATE , the applicant was detained under the ordinary prison regime in ORG and subsequently in LOC ; although his activities were severely restricted and he was placed in a wing with other high - risk prisoners , he was allowed to attend mass and to go to the weights room with the other detainees . However , on being admitted to ORG , he was again placed in solitary confinement , without any reasons being given by the management . This regime continued at FAC , where he was allowed to do exercise with a fellow prisoner only after an DATE hunger strike ; his solitary confinement was ended only after he was transferred to FAC , where , as subsequently in FAC , he was granted access to the sports hall , the exercise yard , mass and IT classes . However , in DATE , while in FAC , he was awoken TIME by the TIME patrol on the management 's orders ; in his submission , he was the only prisoner affected by this measure and when he protested , he was sent to a punishment cell for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while in FAC , the applicant was for the first time required to open his mouth during a full body search . When he refused to obey , he was sent to the punishment block . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE ( when he was transferred to ORG ) he was ordered to open his mouth after leaving the visiting room on CARDINAL occasion , when leaving the prison LOC on QUANTITY occasions , and during all unannounced full body searches , which were conducted at the \u201c unusual frequency \u201d of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Indeed , these repeated and distressing acts of harassment have not diminished the strength of PERSON self - control ; all this personal hounding of him has not made him submissive or desperate , but on the contrary , such vile behaviour has undoubtedly helped to strengthen his sense of fighting to ensure respect for prisoners ' elementary rights . Even through his prolonged experience of the extreme suffering and the moments of discontent that may affect even the strongest people , PERSON has managed to control these feelings of distress and incorporate them into his DATE life ; his moments of anger and revolt have not affected his reason and he has not sunk into the despair that can push an overwhelmed person beyond the point of no return in relation to others or himself . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
