{"ITEMID": "001-57843", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 1993, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF SIBSON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection joined to merits (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Art. 11", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;John Freeland", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , who was born in DATE , was employed by ORG , formerly ORG , ( \" ORG \" ) from DATE as a heavy goods vehicle driver . He was based at its depot at ORG , GPE , together with DATE and QUANTITY other drivers . His services gave complete satisfaction at all times .", "CARDINAL . Until the events giving rise to the present case , the applicant was a member of ORG ( \" TGWU \" ) ; from DATE to DATE he was its branch secretary . In DATE all the other non - managerial employees at ORG save CARDINAL belonged to that union . At that time , however , that depot was not a \" closed shop \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Indeed , the later of CARDINAL statements of his terms of employment furnished to the applicant specified that he had the right to be a member of no trade union and that he would be informed if this right came to be modified by the conclusion of a closed shop agreement .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a fellow driver , PERSON , allegedly accused Mr PERSON of having \" milked the funds \" of the union whilst he was branch secretary . The applicant subsequently lodged with the local ORG branch a complaint to the effect that PERSON had \" disseminated false statements tending to depreciate \" him as one of its officers , but it was dismissed by the branch adjudication panel on DATE .", "Mr PERSON was so dissatisfied with that decision that he resigned from ORG by letter of DATE and joined ORG instead . Some of his fellow drivers immediately ostracised him and others obstructed him in the performance of his work .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG attempted in vain to resolve the dispute . After a period of \" uneasy peace \" , a substantial majority of the ORG members at ORG voted , on DATE , in favour of ( a ) a closed shop agreement with ORG and ( b ) industrial action if Mr ORG continued in employment at that depot after DATE .", "At a meeting on DATE between Mr Dear , the personnel manager of ORG , and the branch committee of the union it was agreed that the strike threat would be lifted if the applicant either rejoined ORG or was employed on driving work not based at ORG . On DATE the applicant told Mr Dear that he would rejoin the union only if he received an apology from Mr NORP and that he would not accept the alternative proposed by PERSON , namely a move to ORG , a depot QUANTITY away from ORG . In a letter of the same date to the applicant , PERSON summarised the discussions to date ; stated that ORG were contractually entitled to transfer the applicant to ORG , where his earnings would be similar to those at ORG ; denied that the move would be a demotion ; and expressed the hope that the applicant would give serious thought to his position because \" [ his ] dismissal [ was ] a possibility \" .", "CARDINAL . Further meetings were then held , with the participation of a senior official of ORG . The applicant declined to accept as an apology a certain statement to be signed by Mr NORP As regards a transfer to PERSON , the applicant expressed concern about conditions there , in particular his fear - which Mr Dear assured him was groundless - of losing his current lorry and allowances for TIME spent away from home ; he also said that he could not face the aggravation from other drivers which he was sure would continue at that depot .", "At a final meeting on DATE the applicant declined to accept either of the alternatives then put before him - working at ORG after rejoining ORG or moving to PERSON - and suggested that the management should dismiss him . Mr Dear refused to do that , and added that if the applicant reported to ORG for work , he would be sent home without pay . Mr PERSON , citing his solicitor \u2019s advice that that would constitute constructive dismissal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , then said that he would resign with immediate effect , which he did by letter of DATE . He did not take up Mr Dear \u2019s further offer , dated DATE , of employment at ORG with the same opportunity for earnings and expenses as previously .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON then lodged with ORG a complaint of unfair dismissal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) against ORG and ORG . In the grounds for his application he stated that he had \" been \u2018 constructively dismissed\u2019 for refusing to accept \u2018 action short of dismissal\u2019 \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . His representative in these proceedings was not legally qualified , legal aid not being available for this purpose .", "ORG and ORG contended that a closed shop agreement was in existence ( which would have made any dismissal fair ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG also denied that there had been either constructive dismissal or action short of dismissal . Mr Dear admitted in cross - examination the absence of any operational reason for moving the applicant to ORG , the sole purpose being to avoid a strike ; had a strike not been threatened , ORG would have retained him at ORG and not put any pressure on him to rejoin ORG .", "By decision of DATE , the ORG unanimously accepted the complaint of unfair dismissal ; it did not deal with the merits of the allegation of action short of dismissal . It found that Mr PERSON was entitled to refuse to rejoin TGWU because there was no closed shop agreement in force ; that the request that he move to PERSON was not reasonable since it was not made for genuine operational reasons but solely to avoid a strike ; that ORG had no right to suspend the applicant without pay ; that he was therefore entitled to treat himself as dismissed ; and that the dismissal was unfair because its only motive was his exercise of his express right not to belong to a union . The tribunal reserved the question of remedies for further consideration , the applicant having opted for re - engagement ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a majority , dismissed an appeal by ORG on points of law . It found that ORG had not erred in law , misdirected itself or reached an unreasonable conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG unanimously upheld an appeal by ORG on a point of law , confined to the question whether Mr ORG had been constructively dismissed . It found that there was an implied term in his contract that his employer could - for any reason - direct him to work at any place within reasonable DATE reach of his home ; ORG had erred in law in holding that this right could be exercised only if the direction were reasonable and that this condition would not be satisfied unless the direction was made for genuine operational reasons . Lord Justice PERSON stated , as regards this implied \" mobility term \" :", "\" I can not see how Mr PERSON could reasonably have objected to a term giving the contract this limited degree of flexibility when he entered the employment in DATE . If the evidence had disclosed any special circumstances which as at that time made it a matter of importance to him that he should be based at ... ORG ... rather than at ( say ) PERSON , ORG would no doubt have said so . \"", "ORG concluded that ORG had acted within its contractual rights in requiring the applicant to transfer to a nearby depot and that he could not be regarded as having been constructively dismissed . No question of unfair dismissal therefore arose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON applied for legal aid to appeal to ORG . On DATE legal aid was granted for the purpose of obtaining counsel \u2019s opinion on the merits of an appeal . On CARDINAL DATE counsel advised that there were no reasonable prospects of success and that leave to appeal would not be given . Further legal aid was therefore refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law in force at the time of the events giving rise to the present case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . A closed shop is an undertaking or workplace where there is in existence a \" union membership agreement \" , that is an agreement or arrangement between CARDINAL or more trade unions and CARDINAL or more employers or ORG associations having the effect in practice of requiring employees of a certain class to be or become members of a specified union ( CARDINAL of ORG DATE , as amended ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE ( \" LAW \" ) provided that , subject to exceptions not relevant to the present case , \" every employee shall have the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer \" ( section CARDINAL ) ; the remedies for unfair dismissal were compensation or , if the individual concerned so elected and if ORG in its discretion so decided , reinstatement or re - engagement ( section DATE ) . In determining whether to make a reinstatement or re - engagement order , the tribunal had to take into account , inter alia , whether it was practicable for the employer to comply therewith ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of LAW , as substituted by LAW :", "\" Subject to subsection ( CARDINAL ) , the dismissal of an employee by an employer shall be regarded for the purposes of this Part as having been unfair if the reason for it ( or , if CARDINAL , the principal reason ) was that the employee -", "...", "( c ) was not a member of any trade union , or of a particular trade union , or of CARDINAL of a number of particular trade unions , or had refused or proposed to refuse to become or remain a member . \"", "By way of exception to the foregoing , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act laid down the basic rule that , if a \" union membership agreement \" ( i.e. a closed shop ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was in existence , the dismissal of an employee for refusal to become or remain a member of a specified union was to be regarded as fair . With effect from DATE - that is , after the events giving rise to the present case - this provision was repealed by LAW DATE .", "In determining whether or not a dismissal was unfair , an ORG was directed to take no account of pressure exercised on the employer to dismiss the employee , for example by threatening to strike ; however , a third party , such as a trade union , which had exercised such pressure because the employee was not a member of a union could be joined as a party to the proceedings and ordered to pay the whole or part of any compensation awarded to the employee ( sections DATE and CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The notion of constructive dismissal was encapsulated in CARDINAL ) of LAW , which provided :", "\" ... an employee shall be treated as dismissed by his employer if ... the employee terminates [ his ] contract , with or without notice , in circumstances such that he is entitled to terminate it without notice by reason of the employer \u2019s conduct . \"", "It does not suffice , in this connection , that the employer \u2019s conduct is unreasonable ; it must amount to a significant breach going to the root of the contract of employment or showing that he no longer intends to be bound by one or more of its essential terms ( per Lord PERSON , Master of the Rolls , in GPE v. Sharp [ DATE ] Industrial Cases Reports CARDINAL , construing an earlier but identical provision ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of LAW , as amended by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Employment Act DATE , conferred on an employee ( defined by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW so as to include a person whose employment had ceased ) a right \" not to have action ( short of dismissal ) taken against him as an individual by his employer for the purpose of compelling him to be or become a member of any trade union or a particular trade union ... \" .", "The remedy in well - founded cases was compensation , which might extend beyond financial loss to such matters as injury to reputation and feelings , of such amount as the tribunal considered just and equitable in all the circumstances . Provisions relating to the existence of a closed shop and to the exercise of pressure on the employer , akin to those applicable in the context of unfair dismissal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , also applied in this area ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
