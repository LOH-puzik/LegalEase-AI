The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered the GPE on DATE and applied for asylum . In the course of interviews held with immigration officials on DATE and DATE , he stated that he feared persecution in GPE for his involvement since DATE in a clandestine , nameless opposition group and its activities which consisted in holding regular meetings , distributing pamphlets and informing people about the NORP regime by inter alia distributing publications by the NORP resistance abroad . This group had begun having problems with the NORP authorities as from DATE or DATE when a first group member was arrested . More arrests of group members followed and when virtually all his friends in this group had been arrested and detained , the applicant decided to flee GPE which he actually did by DATE without , however , having himself encountered any problems with the NORP authorities . He had left the country via an official NORP border crossing - point and holding his own , authentic passport . After his departure for GPE , the applicant 's younger brother and brotherin - law were arrested . After a brief illegal stay in GPE where he lost his passport , the applicant travelled on to GPE where he stayed for DATE , mostly in an aliens ' detention centre . Attempts by the NORP consul in GPE to have him expelled to GPE failed due to the applicant 's refusal to cooperate . In DATE , after having obtained a forged NORP passport and released from detention in GPE , the applicant travelled to GPE . After the NORP authorities had sent officials to GPE in order to trace NORP in GPE who were listed as opponents of the NORP regime and to seek the transfer of these persons to GPE , the applicant no longer felt safe in GPE and travelled to the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the applicant 's asylum request . The Deputy Minister did not find it established that the applicant had attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities . His alleged membership of a nameless opposition group had remained unsubstantiated and he had failed to give clear information about the group 's aims and manner in which it sought to realise these aims . Even assuming that the applicant was associated with this group , he had never held any function of significance within this group and had never encountered any personal problems with the NORP authorities . On this point , the Deputy Minister noted that CARDINAL persons belonging to that group had allegedly been arrested and detained in DATE whilst the applicant had stayed in GPE until DATE without having encountered any problem . Moreover , he had left GPE holding an authentic passport in his own name . The Deputy Minister therefore concluded that , even assuming that the applicant had been involved in this opposition group , this had not become known to the NORP authorities . The Deputy Minister further did not find it established that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would be exposed to a real and personal risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of LAW . On DATE the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against that decision with the Deputy Minister .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant 's objection was denied suspensive effect as regards his expulsion from the GPE , he applied on DATE for a stay of expulsion by way of a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) with ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE sitting in ' s - Hertogenbosch .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of his objection , the applicant submitted CARDINAL statements issued by \u201c ORG for the ORG GPE \u201d ( \u201c NFSL \u201d ) dated DATE and DATE , respectively . According to these statements , the applicant was a sympathiser of this organisation and had disseminated NFSL materials in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister dismissed the applicant 's objection . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG of The Hague .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG of The GPE sitting in ' PERSON granted the applicant 's request for a provisional measure and ordered the stay of the applicant 's removal until DATE after the determination of the applicant 's objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was informed that \u2013 having noted the ruling of CARDINAL DATE the Deputy Minister had withdrawn the decision of CARDINAL DATE and would take a fresh decision . Consequently , the applicant withdrew his appeal of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG started an investigation into the NFSL and the reliability of documents issued by this organisation . The results of this investigation were set out in an official report ( ambtsbericht ) , issued by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a fresh decision taken on DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG again dismissed the applicant 's objection of CARDINAL DATE , finding that the NFSL statements could not serve in substantiation of the applicant 's account . The Deputy Minister did not find it established that the applicant had attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities or that he had found himself in an acute flight situation . The Deputy Minister further found no reasons for accepting the applicant 's argument that his expulsion to GPE would be in violation of his rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG of The Hague as well as a request for a provisional measure .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE , the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie ; the successor to the Deputy Minister of ORG ) withdrew the decision of DATE . As the applicant was allowed DATE pursuant to the ruling of CARDINAL DATE to remain in the GPE pending the proceedings on his objection , he withdrew his appeal and request for a provisional measure filed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant had been heard on his objection before an official commission ( ambtelijke commissie ) , the Minister rejected the applicant 's objection of CARDINAL DATE . In this decision , the Minister further decided not to grant the applicant ex officio a residence title on account of the duration of the still pending proceedings on his asylum request ( tijdsverloop in de asielprocedure ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG of The GPE against the rejection of his objection of CARDINAL DATE as well as a request for a provisional measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection with the Minister against the decision of CARDINAL DATE not to grant him a residence title on account of the length of the determination of his asylum request , as well as a request with ORG for a provisional measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister informed the applicant that he would not be expelled pending the decision on the provisional measure request he had filed in the context of his asylum application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister withdrew the decision of DATE on the applicant 's asylum request . Consequently , the President of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE declared inadmissible the applicant 's provisional measure request filed in the context of these asylum proceedings and , pursuant to the ruling of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was allowed to remain in the GPE pending the proceedings on his objection of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant had been heard on DATE before an official commission and had submitted a statement dated DATE from the GPE - based ORG ( \u201c LLHR \u201d ) , according to which the applicant was a member of this organisation and for that reason would be persecuted and imprisoned , possibly executed , if he were to be expelled to GPE , the Minister rejected the applicant 's objections of CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE accepted the CARDINAL separate appeals filed by the applicant and remitted the case to the Minister for fresh decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was heard before an official commission on his objections of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . In the course of this hearing , the applicant was informed of the Minister 's intention ( voornemen ) to impose an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) on him , as he was considered to pose a threat to national security ( see below \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . At his lawyer 's advice , the applicant did not wish to react to that intention during this hearing .", "CARDINAL . In a fresh decision given on DATE , the Minister again rejected the applicant 's objections of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . Referring to an individual official report on the applicant drawn up on DATE by ORG ( Algemene Inlichtingen- en ORG ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the Minister noted that the ORG considered the applicant to constitute a danger to national security ( see below \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Noting that , after having been granted access to the underlying materials of the ORG individual official report of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst ) of ORG had concluded on DATE that this report , both as regards its content and procedure , had been drawn up in a careful manner and that it provided insight in a logical , transparent manner , the Minister accepted the correctness of the individual official report of CARDINAL DATE . Consequently , in accordance with the case - law of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , the finding that the applicant represented a danger to national security was , in itself , a sufficient ground for rejecting his asylum request and to deny him a residence permit on account of the duration of the proceedings on his asylum request . Moreover , the Minister found no indications in the case that in GPE the applicant would have to fear persecution within the meaning of the DATE LAW . Following an extensive examination of the applicant 's account , the Minister did not find it established that the applicant had attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities on grounds of his alleged involvement with the NFSL or his involvement with and marginal activities for the LLHR in the GPE . The Minister further did not find it established DATE on account of the criminal proceedings taken against the applicant in the GPE ( see below \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) or his very marginal opposition activities \u2013 the applicant would be exposed in GPE to a real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed CARDINAL separate appeals ( CARDINAL against the refusal to grant him asylum and the other one against the refusal to grant him a residence title on account of the duration of the still pending asylum proceedings ) and , having been informed that he was not allowed to await the outcome of those appeals in the GPE , also CARDINAL separate requests for a provisional measure with ORG of The Hague . In addition , as the Minister had decided on DATE to impose an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) on the applicant against which the applicant had filed an objection ( see below \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , he also applied for a provisional measure allowing him to remain in the GPE pending the determination of this objection by the Minister .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings on these appeals and requests for a provisional measure and with the parties ' consent , the provisional - measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE was granted access to the materials underlying the ORG individual official report of CARDINAL DATE without these materials being disclosed to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the provisional - measures judge of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE rejected the applicant 's CARDINAL requests for a provisional measure as well as his CARDINAL appeals on the merits against the Deputy Minister 's decision of DATE . After having verified personally and accepted that the conclusions drawn in the ORG official report of CARDINAL DATE were sufficiently supported by the underlying materials , the provisional - measures judge accepted the Minister 's conclusion that the applicant posed a threat to the national security and could for that reason be denied a GPE residence title , either for asylum or on account of the duration of the proceedings on his asylum request .", "CARDINAL . The provisional - measures judge further accepted the reasons given by the Minister for concluding that it had not been established that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would be exposed to a risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of LAW on account of his alleged involvement with the NFSL or his involvement with and activities for the LLHR in the GPE . Further noting that , when the applicant was presented at the NORP mission for the purposes of obtaining travel documents ( see below \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , the GPE authorities had only provided this mission with extremely neutral information about him , the provisional - measures judge also did not find it established that the applicant would be exposed to such a risk in GPE for being an expelled unsuccessful asylum seeker .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant 's further argument that , given the publicity attracted by the criminal proceedings taken against him before ORG ( see below \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) , the NORP authorities had become aware of the nature of the suspicions having arisen against him in the GPE and that he would also for that reason risk treatment contrary to LAW , the provisional - measures judge held , referring to the general principles under LAW as defined by ORG in its judgments in the cases of PERSON and Others v. GPE , ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and ORG v. the GPE , ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , that also this had not been established . No information about the applicant 's trial had been given to the NORP mission when the applicant was presented . Even assuming that the NORP authorities would have become aware of these criminal proceedings in another manner , this was in itself not sufficient for accepting as plausible that the applicant would thus risk treatment contrary to LAW GPE . Also the applicant 's reliance in this context on documents of a general nature about the general attitude of the NORP authorities was insufficient for finding this risk established . The provisional - measures judge found that the applicant had not submitted , let alone demonstrated , facts or circumstances relating to him personally leading to the conclusion that he , if expelled to GPE , would risk such treatment , and that in this respect he had only made a mere reference to the suspicions arisen against him , the ensuing criminal proceedings and speculated about the possible consequences thereof upon his return to GPE . According to the provisional - measures judge is was , however , not for the Minister to demonstrate that the alleged risk actually did not exist .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant 's request for a provisional measure in connection with his objection against the decision to impose an exclusion order on him , the provisional - measures judge acknowledged that it was difficult for the applicant to furnish proof and for the Minister to offer relief in this respect . However , as the provisional - measures judge himself had been given access to the materials underlying the ORG individual official report on the applicant of CARDINAL DATE , there was an extra guarantee for the due care with which the conclusions made in this report were drawn and formulated . The provisional - measures judge accepted that these underlying materials could carry the conclusions drawn in the report of DATE and that therefore the Minister could impose an exclusion order on the applicant on the basis of that report . In so far as the applicant relied on LAW , the provisional - measures judge reiterated his finding that the applicant had not demonstrated that he , if expelled to GPE , would be exposed to a risk of treatment prohibited by LAW . Pursuant to article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( PERSON ) , no further appeal lay against this ruling of the provisional - measures judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was placed in aliens ' detention for removal purposes . On DATE , following a hearing held on CARDINAL DATE , ORG of The Hague dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the decision to place him in aliens ' detention and his compensation claim . On DATE , ORG accepted the applicant 's subsequent appeal . Disagreeing with ORG of The Hague , it held that the applicant had lawfully stayed in the GPE until DATE when in the asylum proceedings the Minister had rejected the applicant 's objection of CARDINAL DATE ( see above LAW ) . Accordingly , it quashed the ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ordered the lifting of the detention measure , remitted the case to ORG for a determination of the applicant 's compensation claim and issued an order for costs against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having been notified of the decision to impose an exclusion order on him ( see below \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , the applicant was again placed in aliens ' detention for removal purposes . On DATE , the Brabant Zuid - Oost Aliens Police Department ( Vreemdelingenpolitie ) informed the NORP mission in the GPE of this placement in aliens ' detention and the applicant 's name . As he did not hold any travel or other identity documents , ORG wished to make an appointment for presenting the applicant at the NORP mission for the purposes of obtaining travel documents . On DATE , the applicant refused to cooperate in a presentation by telephone , as he was not allowed a prior consultation with his lawyer . Following a written protest by his lawyer , ORG ( PERSON ) informed the applicant 's lawyer by letter of CARDINAL DATE that no further contacts with the NORP mission would be made by the GPE immigration authorities or any other administration for which the Minister for ORG was responsible until the provisional - measures judge of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE had given a ruling ( see above \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in PERSON rejected the applicant 's appeal against the decision to place him in aliens ' detention and his pertaining request for compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in PERSON accepted the applicant 's appeal against his continued placement in aliens ' detention . It found that the Minister had failed to demonstrate that , despite the interim measure issued by ORG DATE , there were reasonable prospects for the applicant 's expulsion within a reasonable delay . Accordingly , it ordered the applicant 's immediate release from aliens ' detention . The applicant was released DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) sent an official report to the national public prosecutor responsible for combating terrorism ( landelijk officier van justitie terrorismebestrijding ) , part of which reads as follows :", "\u201c In the framework of its statutory task , the ORG is investigating a network active in the GPE which is associated with NORP terrorist organisations . It concerns the Groupe Salafiste pour la Pr\u00e9dication et le Combat ( PERSON ) ; an organisation that works from the same ideological basis as the ORG network . The GPE is an NORP extremist NORP organisation of which it is generally known that it has prepared and carried out attacks in GPE and elsewhere .", "The part of this network which is active in the GPE is in particular involved in providing material , financial and logistical support and in propagating , planning and actually using violence for the benefit of the international jihad . The members of this network understand jihad as the armed battle in all its forms against all enemies of ORG , including the ( for them ) unacceptable governments in LOC and GPE [ of GPE ] .", "It appears from the investigation conducted by the ORG that the part of this network which is active in the GPE is implicated in closely interwoven activities which complement and reinforce each other and which serve the same goal , namely the waging of jihad . The most important activities are the following :", "- The network is active in assisting in the entry [ into the GPE ] , housing and transit of persons having actively participated in jihad . The members of the network provide these persons with ( forged ) identity papers , money and shelter . These persons possibly include fighters coming from an area where an armed conflict is ongoing . It is not excluded that at the addresses cited below [ of the persons belonging to the part of the network active in the GPE ] persons as referred to above are also being sheltered ,", "- The network is active in recruiting young men in the GPE for effectively conducting jihad . To this end , these young men are incited to prepare for martyrdom and they are enabled materially , financially and logistically to leave for a battle scene . As an example , one can think of LOC where DATE CARDINAL young NORP men of NORP origin were killed . In this context a battle scene must be interpreted broadly , including areas where there is an armed conflict between different parties , but also terrorism ,", "- The part of this network which is active in the GPE finances its own activities with proceeds from trading in and exporting hard drugs . It must be emphasised that it has appeared to the ORG that the trade in and export of hard drugs as well as the forcing into submission of those involved in the trade and transport are religiously sanctioned . This means that the proceeds of the trade in and export of hard drugs are used for the commonly subscribed goal of jihad , and that disobedience is labelled as apostasy and severely punished . In this context , the ORG knows that a member of this network who has embezzled a quantity of drugs is regarded as an apostate and is currently searched for by members of this network active in the GPE . It appears from recorded telephone conversations that violence will be used against this person . It appears from the terminology used that there is a serious risk of liquidation ,", "- Lastly it must be noted that these activities take place in an organisational setting .

In its judgment of DATE , ORG acquitted the applicant and his co - accused of all charges , finding that these had not been legally and convincingly substantiated .

As a result , the defence had not been given the opportunity to verify in an effective manner the origins and correctness of the information set out in these official reports . ORG considered that there was no basis in law for taking another approach , to the effect that the strictness of evidentiary rules would depend on the seriousness of the offence of which a person was suspected . Consequently , although it acknowledged that the obligation of secrecy at issue was certainly justified in cases concerning national security and found that the public prosecutor had not unlawfully used the material supplied by the BVD / AIVD in the determination of the question whether there was a serious suspicion of an offence and in the decision to arrest the applicant , ORG concluded that these ORG / AIVD reports could not be used in evidence against the applicant . ORG did allow in evidence telephone conversations intercepted by the BVD / AIVD as the defence had been given the opportunity to verify their content .", "CARDINAL .
