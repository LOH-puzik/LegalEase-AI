GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Volodymyr Butkevych;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . Her domicile is unknown .", "The applicant and her husband ( ORG ) have a common son ( T. ) , born in DATE . After the separation of his parents in DATE , NORP lived with the applicant , who denied PERSON the possibility to visit his son .", "On DATE ORG requested ORG to transfer the right to decide where his child should live ( PERSON ) to him .", "On DATE the ORG heard T. in the framework of proceedings which ORG had initiated to gain access to his child .", "On DATE the GPE ORG transferred the right to decide where ORG should live to ORG as it could not rule out the possibility that the applicant would be dangerous to the child 's well - being and that she would leave GPE with her son . The court also decided to commission an expert report .", "On DATE , after having heard the parties , the GPE ORG granted ORG the right to decide where the child should live . The applicant appealed that decision .", "On DATE ORG ordered her by way of an interim injunction to hand the child over to his father and authorised the court 's bailiff to enforce that decision , if necessary by force . Relying on the submissions of ORG , the guardian ad litem and the family 's nonmedical practitioner , who contended that the mother had indoctrinated the child and kindled fears which had aggravated the situation , the court found that the child 's well - being would be best served if the right in question was transferred to the father . Moreover , the hearing of the child held on DATE , as well as the applicant 's prior conduct , proved that she had attempted to influence the child against his father in every possible way and that it was very likely that the applicant would go into hiding with T.", "On DATE an arrest warrant was issued against the applicant on suspicion of child abduction .", "On DATE ORG upheld its interim injunction after having heard the father , the applicant 's representative , the guardian ad litem and a representative of ORG , inter alia because in the meantime the applicant had gone into hiding with T. It was therefore impossible for the court to find out her address and to suggest to her in person that it should annul the interim injunction if she agreed to undergo a psychological examination and granted her husband access to T. The applicant 's counsel , however , rejected that offer on behalf of the applicant .", "On DATE , after having heard T 's father , the guardian ad litem and ORG , ORG confirmed ORG decision of DATE , relying on section DATE of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . The fact that the applicant forced her then DATE son to live in hiding would make him totally dependant on his mother , uproot him from the environment and persons he had been attached to and have deleterious effects on his physical and psychological development and on his material well - being . Moreover , it was impossible for the court to hear the applicant and her son as she was not ready to appear at the hearing , her whereabouts were unknown to the court and all attempts to contact the applicant had failed . Even if an arrest warrant had been issued against the applicant , the well - being of her child required her to leave it to the courts to settle the dispute instead of taking the matter into her own hands .", "On DATE ORG declared the applicant 's complaint against the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE disposed of , given that it had already taken a decision in the main proceedings on DATE .", "By interim injunction of DATE ORG suspended the enforcement of ORG decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE until it had decided on the applicant 's constitutional complaint .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant 's constitutional complaint , arguing that it could be deduced from the court files of the entire proceedings that the applicant had done her utmost to thwart the proper conduct of the proceedings . As she had gone into hiding and all attempts to contact her had failed , it was impossible for the courts to clarify the facts of the case , to hear the applicant and ORG and to commission an expert report . Moreover , the applicant could not plausibly argue that the arrest warrant had prevented her from attending the hearing as she had never tried to challenge the warrant , even though the courts had repeatedly informed her of that possibility through her representative . Finally , the courts understandably argued that the applicant 's going into hiding with her son would result in the boy 's social isolation and thus considerably impair his welfare . Considering that the courts tried to reach a compromise with the applicant , and given the latter 's conduct , it was unobjectionable that the courts found that ORG 's welfare would be best served if the right to decide where the boy should live was transferred to his father .", "Section DATE of the Civil Code provides that if parents sharing joint parental authority separate permanently , either parent may request to be awarded full or partial parental authority . The family courts will grant such a request inter alia if it appears that the lifting of joint parental authority and its transfer to the parent requesting it is best for the child 's welfare .", "Pursuant to Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , parental authority includes the right to determine where the child should live ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
