The neighbours stated that for DATE the applicants had been ignoring the law , had lied , and had used corrupt connections when managing their property . They also submitted that the second applicant had used his position as a GPE elder for his personal proprietary interests , instead of trying to keep an untarnished reputation . The neighbours gave a detailed list of the applicants\u2019 misdemeanours as confirmed by the authorities\u2019 decisions , where it had been mentioned that the applicants\u2019 house was too large , and that they had unlawfully occupied certain parts of a plot of land belonging to neighbours GPE and GPE , and had also occupied ORG land . The neighbours expressed the wish , however , that in future all the neighbours would be able to live in peace , and that the applicants would abide by the law .

On DATE a penalty notice for an administrative offence was issued to the first applicant for arbitrary occupation of ORG land . However , by a ruling of DATE the court found that the boundaries between the applicants\u2019 land and the ORG land had been established only after those parts of the house had been built , and that therefore the first applicant could not be held liable for the offence .", "CARDINAL .

After the article was published , on DATE the second applicant asked the newspaper to correct the part of the article he considered to be erroneous and damaging to his reputation as a GPE centre elder . He was also dissatisfied at being linked to the ORG , owned by the ORG group of companies , which was at that time under criminal investigation for bringing Inkaras to insolvency . As the newspaper did not comply with this request , he then brought a claim in the civil courts , seeking rectification of the article and compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The third party in the civil proceedings , the applicants\u2019 neighbour GPE , told the court that the article did not contain any untruths , and suggested that the civil claim be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE City Second ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s claim . The court took into account that when preparing the publication the journalist had talked to the applicants\u2019 neighbours , examined documents , telephoned the second applicant and had regard to his opinion . The court pointed out that , in accordance with LAW , the press could be held liable for defamation if it knew that information it published did not correspond to reality , that is if it acted in bad faith . However , in some circumstances the media had a right to trust certain sources of information ( for example , an official police report or a document by other municipal or ORG authorities ) . In such cases the media were exempt from the obligation to verify the accuracy of that information . On this point the court noted that the applicants\u2019 neighbours had repeatedly addressed complaints to ORG and municipal institutions about the applicants\u2019 housing projects . Those complaints had been investigated by the authorities and official replies had been received . For the court , the case file showed that both of the applicants had been held liable under administrative law for rebuilding the house without a permit and for unlawfully occupying ORG land . Conversely , the applicants\u2019 neighbours had been honest when they addressed the ORG and municipal institutions , because , as the replies from those institutions indicated , their accusations in respect of the applicants had proved to be true . These were precisely those written replies that were given to the journalist when she was preparing the publication . Given that they were official documents , the journalist had a right to trust their content .", "CARDINAL . The district court also noted that the first applicant had been named in the article as the owner of the plot of land in question . Given that no evidence had been submitted to the court to the effect that the property had been divided between the CARDINAL applicants , the presumption that the plot of land was joint property of the CARDINAL applicants as spouses was a valid CARDINAL . This explained why the article mentioned not only the first applicant but also the second applicant . It was also noteworthy that in the civil court the second applicant had acknowledged that the authorities had ordered a halt to construction on the plot of land belonging to his wife , but argued that they had obeyed the order . However , from the letter of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) it was clear that the reference in the article to administrative sanction was correct . As regards the second applicant \u2019s prior work at GPE , he himself admitted that he had worked at the Inkaras factory as head of a production unit ( cecho vir\u0161ininkas ) . Accordingly , the second applicant had failed to prove that his dignity had been insulted because of the published reference to his position at GPE .", "CARDINAL . The GPE City Second ORG next observed that defamation meant publication of material which did not correspond to reality and which in the light of law and moral and customary norms damaged a person \u2019s honour , dignity or reputation in society . It indicated further that the insulting nature of the material published did not have to be proven if the words or combination of words used were manifestly insulting . The court concluded that the publication at issue did not contain such language . Next , the court noted that in defamation cases the court had to examine the construction of the sentence as well as the whole context of the publication in order to find out the exact meaning of the word or combination of words . The court concluded that the second applicant had indicated only separate sentences but had not had regard to the whole content of the publication .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG allowed the second applicant \u2019s claim in part and ordered the DATE to print a rectification . Specifically , the documents from ORG showed that the owner of the house and of the plot of land was the first applicant . Consequently , the published material did not correspond to reality , because the evidence of inappropriate use of the property had been linked to the first applicant but not to the second . Similarly , as regards the second applicant \u2019s former post at GPE , which belonged to the ORG group , that statement was misleading , because the second applicant had in fact worked as a director at a [ subsidiary ] enterprise , PERSON padai , which he did not deny . The appellate court thus concluded that naming the second applicant separately and together with the first applicant as persons who had broken the law , and linking those breaches of the law to the first applicant \u2019s employment , as well as stating that in DATE second applicant had had links to the ORG group , was damaging to his authority as a public figure . The court considered that the journalist had deliberately ignored her obligation to provide information that was fair , accurate and impartial , in breach of LAW to the Public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took a final decision in the case . The court indicated that LAW of LAW guaranteed the right to freedom of expression . Nevertheless , that right was not an absolute one , and had to be exercised taking into account the rights of others as well as the interests of society . Furthermore , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Provision of Information to the Public obliged the media to present information correctly , without bias and in compliance with the requirements of journalistic ethics .", "CARDINAL . As regards the the publication at issue described a situation in which there was conflict among CARDINAL co - owners of the plot of land over the boundaries of that plot , the applicants\u2019 illegal construction and their unlawful occupation of the ORG and ORG land . It was clear from the content of the applicants\u2019 ORG complaints to various institutions and the replies they had received that those neighbours were trying to protect their rights which had been breached , and also to make sure that the second applicant , who was a public figure , abided by the law . The neighbours , acting in good faith , gave copies of those complaints and replies to the journalist , who in turn wrote an article on the subject . The first - instance court was correct to find that the official replies from municipal and ORG institutions , which referred to violations of law committed by both applicants in that they had reconstructed the house without a permit and had also occupied ORG - owned land and demolished part of a neighbour \u2019s wall , among others , were a sufficient basis for publication of information about a public figure , the second applicant , who had been elected GPE centre elder .", "CARDINAL . ORG also emphasised that the mere fact that the second applicant was not mentioned in the replies from the municipal authorities did not confirm that the violations could not be linked to him . Despite the fact that the plot of land and the house where both applicants lived were registered in the first applicant \u2019s name , that property had been acquired during their marriage . Accordingly , this was their joint property which they had equal rights to manage and use , in accordance with LAW of LAW . Moreover , in the event that a co - owner of the property of a public figure exercised their co - ownership rights inappropriately , the public figure ( in this case the second applicant ) had a duty to control his co - owner \u2019s actions and to prevent violations of the law , as in this case . For ORG , if a co - owner exercising the joint property rights of both spouses violated the pecuniary and non - pecuniary rights of other persons , the other co - owner incurred liability as well , the more so if that other co - owner was a public figure . Having regard to the above arguments , ORG concluded that the appellate court had wrongly interpreted LAW to the Public and erred in finding that the journalist had deliberately violated that law by breaching her responsibility to present correct , precise and impartial information . ORG concluded that those errors made the decision of the appellate court invalid . The decision of the first - instance court was upheld .", "CARDINAL .
