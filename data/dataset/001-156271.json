For DATE , until DATE , the family lived together in CARDINAL household in GPE . A. then moved to stay with friends , took the children with her , the couple agreed on alternating custody , and they started receiving marriage counselling . Nevertheless , PERSON filed for divorce , but then withdrew her petition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE left GPE for GPE , taking the children with her . The following day she informed the applicant that they had left and that she had no intention of coming back .", "CARDINAL . In DATE filed for divorce in GPE and requested that the children be entrusted to her custody by way of an interim measure . The status and outcome ( if any ) of these proceedings is not known .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application for the return of the children to GPE as the country of their habitual residence , relying on the ( NORP ) International Private and LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) , ORG ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL of DATE concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility , and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s Hague Convention application was transmitted to the Bratislava I ORG , through the intermediary of ORG responsible for implementing LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the children \u2019s return to GPE , having found that it was the country of their habitual residence , that they had been removed from there wrongfully , and that no obstacles to the return had been established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal filed by ORG and upheld the return order . The matter thus became resolved by force of a final and binding decision on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed for judicial enforcement of the return order .", "CARDINAL . Upon several unsuccessful attempts at having NORP comply with the order voluntarily , ORG acceded to the petition on CARDINAL DATE by issuing a warrant for the order \u2019s enforcement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the enforcement warrant following an appeal by A. It observed that , meanwhile , A. had challenged the decision of DATE by way of a complaint under LAW no . PERSON . , as amended ) to ORG ; that on DATE ORG had declared that complaint admissible ; and that , at the same time , it had suspended the enforceability of the return order pending the outcome of the proceedings on the merits of the complaint of A.

The applicant challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE by way of an appeal on points of law . He pointed out that there had been no hearing before ORG and that it was only from ORG decision that he had learned of ORG decisions underlying it and of other new relevant facts , such as that the applicant had applied for the enforcement proceedings to be stayed .", "As ORG decisions had not been served on him and he had had no knowledge of those facts , he had been deprived of an opportunity to comment and to consider the taking of other legal steps .", "This was contrary to the principles of adversary proceedings and equality of arms and , in the applicant \u2019s submission , he had thereby been \u201c prevented from acting before the court \u201d , which constituted an admissibility ground for his appeal under LAW ( f ) of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible . It observed that ORG had of its own motion obtained a copy of ORG decision to suspend the enforceability of the return order , that it had based its decision on it , and that a copy of ORG decision had never been served on the applicant .", "However , ORG also noted that ORG decision was binding upon ORG and considered that , therefore , having it served on the applicant and having allowed him to comment could not have had any impact on ORG decision .", "Therefore , in ORG conclusion , the ground invoked by the applicant for the admissibility of his appeal had not been given .", "CARDINAL . In consequence , it became incumbent upon ORG to rule on the applicant \u2019s enforcement petition anew , which it did on DATE by dismissing it .", "ORG observed that on CARDINAL DATE ORG had quashed the decision upholding the return order and that it had remitted the appeal of ORG against that order to ORG for a new determination ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The return order was thus pending on appeal and , as such , it was no longer enforceable .", "ORG decision became final and binding on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE challenged the decision of DATE to uphold the return order ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) by way of a complaint to ORG . It was directed against ORG and , in it , she submitted that the applicant had filed observations in reply to her appeal against the return order ; that she had not been served a copy of these observations ; that her appeal had been determined without a hearing ; and that she had accordingly been deprived of the opportunity to comment on those observations , which was contrary to her rights under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( right to judicial protection ) , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( equality of parties to judicial proceedings ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( right to comment on the evidence assessed ) of the LAW , as well as LAW ( fairness ) of the LAW .", "In addition , ORG requested that ORG indicate an interim measure to the effect that the enforceability of the contested decision be suspended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint admissible and ruled that the enforceability of the decision of CARDINAL DATE should be suspended pending the outcome of the constitutional proceedings on the merits .", "As to the latter ruling , ORG found ( i ) that the suspensive measure was not contrary to any important public interest , ( ii ) that not having the enforceability of the return order suspended could lead to an irreversible situation and \u201c cause detriment to the property sphere \u201d of A. in potential violation of her fundamental rights and freedoms , and ( iii ) that having the enforceability suspended \u201c gave rise to no risk of damage to any party concerned \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the ensuing proceedings on the merits , ORG as the defendant of the complaint submitted , inter alia , that there was no statutory requirement for observations in reply to an appeal to be communicated to the appellant for further observations , unless the former observations had a substantial impact on the determination of the appeal . However , the applicant \u2019s observations in reply to the appeal by ORG had had no such impact .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found a violation of the rights of A. as identified above ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) , quashed the decision of DATE , remitted the case to ORG for a new determination of the appeal of PERSON against the return order , and awarded her legal costs . In principle , ORG fully embraced the line of argument advanced by A.", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that the applicant had sought leave to intervene in the proceedings as a third party .", "In that respect , it observed that constitutional proceedings were conducted in the procedural framework laid down in LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended ) , as a lex specialis , and in the ORG , as a lex generalis . LAW however envisaged no standing for third parties to intervene in proceedings on individual complaints , and its quality of a lex specialis excluded the application of the third - party - intervention rules under the ORG .", "For that reason , ORG observed specifically that it had taken no account of the submissions made by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant obtained a copy of ORG judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , alleging inter alia a violation of his rights under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention ( fairness ) in the enforcement proceedings , in particular in their phase before ORG and ORG , and raising in substance the same arguments as in his appeal on points of law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant pointed out , in addition , that that it had been for substantially the same reasons that ORG itself had found a violation of the rights of A. in relation to her appeal against the return order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible . It fully endorsed the reasoning behind ORG decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and concluded that , accordingly , the complaint was manifestly ill - founded .", "The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , on DATE , ORG decided again on the appeal by PERSON against the return order of CARDINAL DATE by quashing that order and remitting the case to ORG for a new determination .", "CARDINAL . In the subsequent period a number of hearings were held at first instance and courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction dealt with various procedural matters such as translations of documents into a language the applicant understood , court fees and costs of the translations , the applicant \u2019s visiting rights in relation to his children pending the outcome of the proceedings on the merits , an injunction prohibiting A. to leave and remove the children form the territory of GPE , admission of the mother of A. to the proceedings as a third party , CARDINAL procedural fines on A. , her challenges to the first - instance judge for bias , her request for a legal - aid lawyer and establishing her whereabouts . There is no indication that any of the fines and interim rulings were actually enforced .", "CARDINAL . No decision on the merits was taken and ORG decided to terminate the proceedings on DATE . It referred to LAW last sentence ) of LAW , which permits termination of the proceedings if there is an indication that the child in question has been taken to another ORG , and observed that PERSON and the children had moved to GPE and had established residence there .", "CARDINAL .
