The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They are certified public accountants acting personally and in their capacity as partners of the partnership ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants were sued , personally and in their capacity as partners of the partnership ORG , as auditors of ORG , in a civil action by a company , ORG The latter claimed that the applicants\u2019 audit firm had acted negligently and fraudulently in its drawing up of ORG audit report / financial statements , and was therefore liable for the losses sustained by V as a result of its reliance on those documents .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicants raised a preliminary plea to the effect that reliance by ORG on the audit report when taking a particular credit decision , and knowledge on the part of the applicants of such reliance when taking that decision , were lacking . These requirements were fundamental to this type of action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed this plea in a preliminary judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested special leave to appeal the preliminary judgment under LAW ( \u201c COCP \u201d ) . On DATE , ORG in its ordinary jurisdiction granted leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having heard the parties\u2019 arguments , ORG dismissed the appeal as out of time . It noted that while the legislator had clearly established that the time - limit for lodging an appeal against an interlocutory decree ran from the date of authorisation to appeal , in respect of an appeal against a \u201c judgment \u201d the legislator had made no distinction between a \u201c judgment \u201d and a \u201c partial judgment \u201d ( senten\u017ca par\u017cjali ) . It followed that the DATE time - limit which ran from the date of delivery of a judgment according to LAW applied also to appeals necessitating prior leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings before ORG in its constitutional jurisdiction , claiming that such an erroneous interpretation by ORG deprived them of access to court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG claims , finding that a right to appeal could not arise before leave to appeal had been given . Moreover , an appellant did not have to tolerate the delays of a court in giving leave to appeal . ORG interpretation had therefore deprived the applicants of access to court in violation of LAW . It declared ORG judgment null and void .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on appeal by the Attorney General , acknowledged that the interpretation given to the law had been erroneous , thereby depriving the applicants of their right to appeal at an early stage . Nevertheless , it did not uphold the first - instance judgment , since a wrong interpretation did not suffice to lead to a violation of the ORG . While reiterating that an appeal could be heard before ORG only once , it considered that the applicants had the opportunity to appeal in the civil case after the final judgment . Thus , given that a defect in first - instance proceedings could be remedied on appeal , the right to a fair hearing would similarly not be violated if a remedy which had been inappropriately denied became available at a later stage of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c COCP \u201d ) ( LAW of LAW ) , at the relevant time , read as follows :", "\u201c Where several issues in an action have been determined by separate judgments , appeal from any such judgments may only be entered after the final judgment and within the prescribed time , to be reckoned from the date of such final judgment ; and in such an appeal express mention of the judgment or judgments appealed from shall be made :", "Provided that an appeal from such separate judgments may be entered before the final judgment only by leave of court to be read out in open court ; such request for leave to appeal shall be made either orally immediately after the delivery of such judgment or by application within DATE from such judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Article was amended in DATE , whereby the following phrase was added to the proviso :", "\u201c and when such leave to appeal from such separate judgments is granted the time for the filing of the appeal in respect thereof shall commence to run from DATE on which the said leave is read out in open court . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
