She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant had been employed by ORG ( ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myysturvalautakunta , arbetsl\u00f6shetsn\u00e4mnden ) DATE . On DATE she resigned from her post due to stress caused by a bad working atmosphere .", "The applicant applied for unemployment benefit from her unemployment fund from DATE . On DATE the fund refused the benefit for the period from DATE to DATE . It found that the applicant had not presented any valid reason for her resignation . The fund \u2019s finding was based on the binding statement of the labour commission ( ty\u00f6voimatoimikunta , arbetskraftskommissionen ) which had reached this conclusion by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "On an unspecified date the applicant requested rectification of the unemployment fund \u2019s decision . This was rejected , again on the basis of the statement of the labour commission concluded by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "Before appealing against the fund \u2019s decision to ORG , which was her previous employer and the alleged cause of her resignation , the applicant contacted ORG to ask how her right to impartial proceedings was going to be secured in her case . After receiving a positive reply from the Ministry , she appealed to ORG , claiming that she had had a valid reason to resign . She claimed that she did not like the working methods at the board , that she had been bullied and that she had developed health problems . She had applied for new jobs all the time while working for the board but without success . She felt that her only option was to resign since otherwise she would have become ill .", "The applicant \u2019s case was first prepared in ORG by a referendary , PERSON , and was then transferred to another referendary .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that a person who resigns without a valid reason is not entitled to unemployment benefit for DATE . The applicant had not had a medically valid reason to resign nor had she presented clear evidence about the alleged bullying . The internal conflicts at the work place should have been solved in some other way than by resigning . The applicant had thus not presented a valid reason for her resignation .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already submitted in the proceedings before ORG . Moreover , she claimed that all referendaries on the board , and especially PERSON , were biased against her and should have been prevented from examining her case .", "ORG asked ORG for some clarifications , which the applicant commented on .", "In DATE and DATE the applicant called ORG several times and asked about the state of the proceedings in order to accelerate them . On DATE the applicant wrote to the Minister of ORG and complained about the way her case had been treated . On DATE the applicant contacted the Secretary - General ( kansliap\u00e4\u00e4llikk\u00f6 , kanslichefen ) of the court and asked that the court speed up the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG first found that the referendary attached to ORG , PERSON , had not participated in the deliberations and had not drafted the decision . In any case , according to the legislation in force , the partiality claims had to be made as soon as the parties learnt about the fact causing the partiality . She had not given a valid reason for failing to do so . As to the merits , the court rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal by referring to the reasoning given in ORG decision .", "According to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myysturvalaki , lagen om utkomstskydd f\u00f6r arbetsl\u00f6sa , Act no . CARDINAL , as in force at the relevant time ) , those who have resigned from their employment without a valid cause shall not be entitled to a DATE unemployment allowance for DATE . According to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of the same LAW , a labour commission shall issue an opinion , binding on the unemployment fund , concerning the preconditions provided in section CARDINAL .", "LAW was revised in DATE ( Act no . DATE ) . The provisions applicable to the present case have remained unchanged in the revised LAW .", "LAW , section CARDINAL , of the revised Unemployment Security Act provides that ORG is the first - level appeal authority in matters pertaining to unemployment security . The Government shall appoint ORG chairman , vice chairmen and other members and their deputies for DATE at a time . The chairman , vice chairmen and lawyer members and their deputies shall hold a degree entitling them to hold the post of judge . When taking up their mandates the chairman , vice chairmen and members shall take a judge \u2019s oath or give a judge \u2019s affirmation as provided in the Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) . ORG rules on matters concerning the administration of justice in a division , with CARDINAL and at most CARDINAL members , which is chaired by the chairman or vice chairman of ORG . The decisions are taken by presentation which means that a referendary presents a memorandum and a draft decision to the members of the court .", "LAW , section CARDINAL , of the revised Unemployment Security Act further provides that , unless otherwise prescribed elsewhere , the provisions of LAW ( hallintolaink\u00e4ytt\u00f6laki , f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen ; Act no . ORG ) shall apply to the handling of cases by ORG . As far as partiality is concerned , ORG refers to LAW of LAW .", "LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW provides that a judge shall not hear a case if he or she is disqualified on any of the grounds mentioned in the LAW . This applies also to the other members of the court , the referendaries , record keepers and others who make decisions in court or may be present when the case is decided . The impartiality of a court is an absolute procedural requirement and the court must examine the partiality issues ex officio .", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , a judge shall be disqualified , inter alia , if , on the basis of a service relationship or otherwise , the judge has such a relationship to a party to the matter that , especially in view of the nature of the matter at hand , there is justifiable reason to doubt the impartiality of the judge in the matter . The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires ( HE CARDINAL ) clarify that a partiality issue arises , for example , when the judge is the employer of the party .", "LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW provides that a partiality claim must be made as soon as the parties learn about the fact causing the partiality . This provision allows the parties to make a partiality claim if the partial court or judge has not for some reason acknowledged the partiality ex officio ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
