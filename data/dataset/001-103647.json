On DATE the applicant made an application to ORG asking it to grant him an old - age pension . In his request he referred to the fact that he had practised as a lawyer DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant filed an objection ( PERSON ) . He submitted that the above - mentioned decision had been unlawful .
