{"ITEMID": "001-23518", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FRA", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "MIEG DE BOOFZHEIM v. FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and live at FAC . They were represented before the ORG by Mr GPE , of ORG .", "On DATE the applicants received notice that their personal tax affairs for DATE were to be investigated . The investigation concerned the terms on which a flat in FAC had been transferred and losses incurred on FAC , in which the applicants lived .", "PERSON is the manager of ORG , the company that owns the chateau , and holds a majority shareholding in it . The Revenue served assessments to additional tax on the company on DATE and on the applicants on DATE . All the assessments were contested by the applicants . However , they were confirmed by the Revenue on DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the Revenue served demands for the additional tax that had been imposed on the applicants , together with interest for late payment and a PERCENT surcharge because the applicants had acted in bad faith in declaring the losses on the chateau and been late in filing the capital - gains tax return on the sale of the flat . The sums demanded came to a total of MONEY ( FRF ) for DATE and ORG CARDINAL for DATE .", "On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal . They argued that the Revenue had miscalculated the period for which they had owned the flat in FAC for the purposes of assessing their liability to capital gains tax on its sale in DATE . They had in fact purchased the property in DATE and were thus entitled to the exemption from capital gains tax which , by law , was granted to owners who had retained title for DATE . They also sought to be allowed to deduct certain expenditure on furnishings and staff from the ORG taxable income , on the ground that it had been incurred in order to attract visitors to the chateau and because the chateau \u2019s upkeep necessitated the services of a full - time housekeeper .", "In the absence of a reply from the Revenue within the statutory DATE time - limit , the applicants applied to ORG for an order cancelling the income - tax surcharge and related penalties .", "In a decision of DATE , ORG granted relief from the capital - gains - tax surcharge , interest for late payment and related penalties for DATE in the amount of ORG CARDINAL on the principal sum due and FRF CARDINAL on the interest and penalties .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the Revenue granted relief from the surcharges that had initially been imposed for bad faith in respect of the remaining contested tax assessments ( on income from land for DATE ) in the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for DATE and ORG CARDINAL for DATE .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the applicants were granted additional relief of ORG CARDINAL in tax and ORG MONEY in penalties , in order to rectify an arithmetical error in the calculation for DATE .", "In a letter of DATE , the clerk to ORG informed the applicants that , owing to a large number of pending cases , it was not possible to say when their case was likely to be heard .", "Following a hearing on DATE ORG delivered a judgment on DATE in which it held that it was unnecessary to give a ruling in respect of the ORG claims up to ORG CARDINAL . It dismissed the applicants\u2019 remaining claims ( namely for ORG CARDINAL in disputed taxes and FRF CARDINAL in interest for late payment ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
