I saw our [ local policeman PERSON ] together with CARDINAL of our district inspectors whom I did not know . They stopped and started talking to me . [ R.S. ] said that they were coming for me and that the chief ( meaning the chief of police ) wanted to have a talk with me . I answered that if I came to the police department they would keep me \u201c overnight \u201d , taking into account the fact that the same had happened before to my friends . [ R.S. ] promised me that no such thing would happen and I agreed to go with them . We went together to the police . I and [ R.S. ] went up to the second floor . After waiting for a moment next to his office , he took me to the Head of ORG [ GPE ] . There [ PERSON ] started talking and said \u201c Grisha , what is this all about the demonstrations you are holding and the government you are changing ? You are upsetting the stability of the country \u201d and things like that[. PERSON also said that I had taken people to the demonstrations and added that I had taken with me , for instance , [ G.A. ] . I asked whether [ G.A. ] could come and prove that I had taken him to the demonstrations and added that he had his own brain to decide what to do . [ PERSON ] left the office telling me that he would be back soon . A little while later I was invited to go to the office of the deputy chief of police [ PERSON ] . When I entered [ PERSON \u2019s ] office he asked me why I was talking loudly in the hallway and why I was organising a demonstration in the building [ of the police station ] . I answered that I had not been in the hallway and had not organised any demonstration . [ PERSON ] said that I was using foul language to him there and then and ordered that a case be prepared on account of my committing an administrative offence . I and [ R.S. ] came back to his office where he , in the presence of [ another police officer , TIME ] , said that he would not prepare materials against me and left the room . A little while later [ TIME ] was called[. PERSON went away , then returned and started preparing some documents .

I answered : \u201c You do what you think is right and we will do what we consider to be right\u201d[. A]t that moment [ PERSON ] kicked me . The blow fell on the left side of my chest . He kicked me with the sharp tip of his shoe . I felt sharp pain in the area of my ribs . He immediately punched me twice in the face with his left fist . At that moment I lost my temper and to defend myself picked up the mobile phone charger from the desk and hit him with it . The cable stayed in my hand while the charger broke off and hit [ PERSON \u2019s ] face . I saw him holding his eye and screaming . At that moment [ A.M. ] entered the office and , seeing the chaotic situation , took me to the nearby office . [ PERSON and another police officer , PERSON , ] followed me there and started beating me . I fell down but they went on beating me . They were kicking and punching me .
