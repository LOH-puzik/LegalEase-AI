NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is detained in FAC . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been serving a life sentence since DATE . In DATE he was transferred to ORG . In DATE the applicant attempted to murder another convicted inmate and in DATE he was transferred back to FAC . In his written appeal concerning his conviction for the attempt of murder , the applicant asked to be transferred back to FAC and never to be returned to freedom , because he was afraid of liberty .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant married . At that time his wife was also serving a sentence in FAC but in DATE was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant wrote to the administration of FAC requesting a visit from his spouse ; the duration of the visit was not specified in the applicant \u2019s request . His request was granted ; however , the director of ORG refused to allow his wife to attend the visit , referring to the provisions of domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant complained to ORG about the refusal of ORG to bring his wife to the visit . The complaint was forwarded to ORG . In DATE it issued a response stating that the applicant did not have a right to long - term conjugal visits because he was serving his sentence in prison . ORG stated that the law did not provide for short \u2013 term visits for spouses who were both convicted and serving their imprisonment sentences . In DATE he received similar response from ORG . In DATE the applicant also received a response from ORG stating that long - term conjugal visits were not available to convicted inmates serving their sentences in prison . He was also informed that , in accordance with the provisions of domestic law , he would have been entitled to a long - term conjugal visit if he had been transferred to a correctional facility .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s proposal to amend LAW for the Execution of Sentences , so it allowed the spouses who were both serving their imprisonment sentences , and CARDINAL of them was serving his or her sentence in prison , to have CARDINAL long - term or short - term visits per year without the PERSON supervision . ORG held that the applicant \u2019s proposal did not follow the principles of just and progressive execution of sentences and that if the applicant \u2019s proposal had been adopted , the convicted spouses , both serving their sentences in correctional facilities , would have been deprived of visits , and would be discriminated . It was also observed that in a number of ORG Member GPE long - term conjugal visits were not allowed for convicted prisoners , and that they could communicate with their family members through short - term or home visits , as well as telephone conversations and letters .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought court proceedings complaining about the refusal of his request to be allowed a short - term visit of TIME from his imprisoned spouse without PERSON supervision . The representative of ORG claimed that long - term conjugal visits were not allowed if CARDINAL of the spouses was serving his or her sentence in prison . Convicted inmates , serving their sentences in prisons , had a right to short - term visits but this right was restricted by the provisions of domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG stated that the contested provision of domestic law was not applicable to convicted inmates , serving their sentences in prisons because such persons had a right only to short - term visits . But because the provisions of domestic law were silent about short - term visits when both spouses were serving their prison sentences , ORG considered that short - term visits were not available to persons in the applicant \u2019s situation . On DATE ORG held that the applicant and his wife had a right to a short - term visit of TIME and that his wife also had a right to a long - term conjugal visit of DATE . The court also noted that , under the provisions of domestic law , the applicant could see his spouse at a short - term visit without PERSON supervision , in equipped LOC , upon the approval of the prison director . The court therefore ordered ORG to organise a short - term visit of TIME for the applicant and his wife .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed , and on DATE ORG held that a convicted inmate serving a life sentence in prison and belonging to the \u201c ordinary \u201d group of prisoners had a right to short - term visits of TIME every two months . However , the court also held that the court of first instance should not have ordered ORG to organise a short - term visit and instead ordered it to reconsider the applicant \u2019s request to be allowed a shortterm visit .", "CARDINAL . Following the decision of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE ORG decided that the applicant \u2019s wife could attend a short - term visit of CARDINAL hours at FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received a response from ORG stating that it had decided to allow his wife to attend a short - term visit at FAC .", "CARDINAL .
