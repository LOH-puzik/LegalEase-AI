IRELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 8;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["Particular facts of the case", "CARDINAL . Mrs. PERSON , an NORP national born in DATE , lives in GPE . She comes from a humble family background and went to work at a young age as a shop assistant . She married in DATE and has CARDINAL children , the youngest of whom is still dependent on her . At the time of the adoption of the ORG \u2019s report , Mrs. PERSON was in receipt of unemployment benefit from the ORG but , since DATE , she has been employed . Her net DATE wage in DATE was \u00a3 MONEY . In DATE , she obtained a court order against her husband for payment of maintenance of \u00a3 DATE , which was increased in DATE to \u00a3 CARDINAL and in DATE to \u00a3 MONEY . However , Mr. PERSON , who had previously been working as a lorry driver but was subsequently unemployed , ceased paying such maintenance in DATE .", "Mrs. PERSON alleges that her husband is an alcoholic and that , before DATE , he frequently threatened her with , and occasionally subjected her to , physical violence . In DATE , in proceedings instituted by the applicant , Mr. PERSON was convicted by ORG of assaulting her and fined . In DATE he left the matrimonial home ; he has never returned there to live , although Mrs. PERSON now fears that he may seek to do so .", "CARDINAL . For DATE , Mrs. PERSON tried in vain to conclude a separation agreement with her husband . In DATE , he declined to sign a deed prepared by her solicitor for the purpose and her later attempts to obtain his co - operation were also unsuccessful .", "Since DATE , she has been endeavouring to obtain a decree of judicial separation on the grounds of Mr. PERSON \u2019s alleged physical and mental cruelty to her and their children , and has consulted several solicitors in this connection . However , she has been unable , in the absence of legal aid and not being in a financial position to meet herself the costs involved , to find a solicitor willing to act for her .", "In DATE , Mrs. PERSON applied to an ecclesiastical tribunal for annulment of her marriage . Her application is still under investigation ; if successful , it will not affect her civil status .", "Domestic law", "CARDINAL . In GPE , although it is possible to obtain under certain conditions a decree of nullity - a declaration by ORG that a marriage was null and void ab initio - , divorce in the sense of dissolution of a marriage does not exist . In fact , LAW provides : \" No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage . \"", "However , spouses may be relieved from the duty of cohabiting either by a legally binding deed of separation concluded between them or by a court decree of judicial separation ( also known as a divorce a mensa et thoro ) . Such a decree has no effect on the existence of the marriage in law . It can be granted only if the petitioner furnishes evidence proving CARDINAL of CARDINAL specified matrimonial offences , namely , adultery , cruelty or unnatural practices . The parties will call and examine witnesses on this point .", "By virtue of LAW , an individual against whom a decree of judicial separation is granted forfeits certain succession rights over his or her spouse \u2019s estate .", "CARDINAL . Decrees of judicial separation are obtainable only in ORG . The parties may conduct their case in person . However , the ORG \u2019s replies to questions put by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) reveal that in each of the CARDINAL separation proceedings initiated in GPE in the period from DATE , without exception , the petitioner was represented by a lawyer .", "In its report of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG noted that the approximate range of the costs incurred by a legally represented petitioner was \u00a3 CARDINAL - \u00a3 CARDINAL in an uncontested action and MONEY CARDINAL in a contested action , the exact amount depending on such factors as the number of witnesses and the complexity of the issues involved . In the case of a successful petition by a wife , the general rule is that the husband will be ordered to pay all costs reasonably and properly incurred by her , the precise figure being fixed by a Taxing Master .", "Legal aid is not at present available in GPE for the purpose of seeking a judicial separation , nor indeed for any civil matters . In DATE , ORG was established under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Pringle . It reported to the Government in DATE , recommending the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice in this area . At the hearings on DATE , counsel for the Government informed the ORG that the ORG had decided in principle to introduce legal aid in family - law matters and that it was hoped to have the necessary measures taken before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since Mrs. PERSON \u2019s application to the Commission , LAW Act DATE has come into force . LAW ) of the LAW provides :", "\" On application to it by either spouse , the court may , if it is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of that spouse or of any dependent child of the family requires it , order the other spouse , if he is residing at a place where the applicant spouse or that child resides , to leave that place , and whether the other spouse is or is not residing at that place , prohibit him from entering that place until further order by the court or until such other time as the court shall specify . \"", "Such an order - commonly known as a barring order - is not permanent and application may be made at any time for its discharge ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . Furthermore , the maximum duration of an order given in the ORG - as opposed to ORG or ORG - is DATE although provision is made for renewal .", "A wife who has been assaulted by her husband may also institute summary criminal proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
