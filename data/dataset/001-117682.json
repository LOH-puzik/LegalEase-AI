On DATE the Riigikogu amended LAW , creating a clear distinction between administrative arrest and arrest in offence proceedings ( that is , criminal or misdemeanour proceedings ) . A limited number of grounds for the use of administrative arrest were provided and it was stipulated that administrative arrest could be challenged before the head of the police authority concerned or by means of a complaint to an administrative court . The amendments further involved regulations on the identification of members of the public , and in certain cases allowed such individuals to be taken to police premises for that purpose . Lastly , the amendments concerned more detailed rules on the use of force , and provided for grounds and procedure to be used to prohibit a person from remaining in a given place . Some rules were also introduced specifically for use in the event of mass disorder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new Police and Border Guard Act ( GPE ja piirivalve seadus ) entered into force , replacing LAW . In so far as is relevant to the present case , it contains elements broadly similar to the DATE amendments to LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , ORG found that taking a person to police premises did not necessarily mean that he or she was being detained within the meaning of LAW . Thus , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW the police were entitled to take individuals involved in offences to the police for immediate establishment of the facts of the offence ; and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) allowed individuals to be taken to the police for a misdemeanour report to be drawn up . This was affirmed by LAW , under which a person could also be detained on other grounds than those set out in LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , ORG of ORG dealt with a complaint concerning the use of force by police officers and the use of special equipment in the context of traffic supervision . ORG considered that stopping a vehicle and checking documents were usually acts forming part of supervisory proceedings in the course of which a police officer collected additional necessary information about the elements of an offence in order to establish whether a basis for misdemeanour proceedings existed . ORG held that the use of force and special equipment within supervisory proceedings could be challenged before an administrative court , whereas in the event of complaints concerning measures applied in misdemeanour proceedings a county court had jurisdiction over the matter , pursuant to ORG DATE to CARDINAL of the Code of Misdemeanour Procedure .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that detention of a person on the basis of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW for the purposes of his or her identification , which also involved taking the person to police premises , could not be considered a supervisory measure . Under the law in force it was only possible to detain a person if offence proceedings had been initiated . For the purposes of classifying detention as the first measure applied in misdemeanour proceedings it was irrelevant whether the measure had been taken in full compliance with the rules of misdemeanour proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG made a visit to GPE . On DATE it published a report of its visit ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) , which contains the following findings :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Shortly before the visit ( in TIME DATE ) , mass demonstrations had taken place in GPE , during which CARDINAL persons had been apprehended by the police . The delegation paid particular attention to the manner in which these persons had been treated and the conditions under which they had been detained by the police . From the information gathered , it appears that , once apprehended , the persons concerned had been transported to various detention facilities ( police stations , arrest houses , court holding cells ) . However , as the capacity of the existing detention facilities was insufficient , the majority of these persons had been taken to a customs warehouse situated at Terminal D in the port of GPE ; following an identity check and questioning by the police , they had then either been released or transferred to a regular place of detention . ...", "CARDINAL . With the notable exception of the DATE events , hardly any allegations of physical ill - treatment by the police were received .", "As regards the above - mentioned events , the delegation received numerous allegations of ill - treatment and/or excessive use of force by the police . These allegations mainly concerned punches , kicks and baton blows to the head , back and legs , when the persons concerned had been brought under control . Furthermore , a number of detained persons complained of ill - treatment ( kicks or baton blows ) on arrival at the place of detention and until they were placed in a cell . Some claimed that were obliged to remain immobile for long periods of time , standing facing the wall or kneeling , while waiting to be placed in a cell ( for example , TIME standing facing a wall and TIME kneeling ) ; in some cases , movements or speaking were allegedly punished by a blow . Some allegations were also received of very tight handcuffing for lengthy periods ( from the time of apprehension to that of being placed in the cell ) , rude behaviour and insults . Most of the above - mentioned allegations concerned members of the special forces , some of whom were masked during the intervention .", "The ORG is aware of the difficulties with which any police service is confronted during such extraordinary events . However , the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is absolute , and no exceptional circumstances may justify a derogation from that principle .", "The ORG recommends that all police officers , in particular members of special intervention groups , be reminded that all forms of ill - treatment of persons deprived of their liberty ( including verbal abuse ) are not acceptable in whatever circumstances and will be punished accordingly . Police officers should also be reminded that the force used when performing their duties should be no more than is strictly necessary and that , once persons have been brought under control , there can be no justification for striking them .", "Further , police officers must be trained in preventing and minimising violence in the context of an apprehension . For cases in which the use of force nevertheless becomes necessary , they need to be able to apply professional techniques which minimise any risk of harm to the persons whom they are seeking to apprehend .", "CARDINAL . The ORG would also like to express its misgivings about the practice of law enforcement officials wearing masks when apprehending persons ( as was apparently the case during the above - mentioned events ) since this will hamper the identification of those responsible if and when instances of ill - treatment arise . The ORG considers that only exceptional circumstances can justify measures to conceal the identity of law enforcement officials carrying out their duties . Where such measures are applied , appropriate safeguards must be in place in order to ensure that the officials concerned are accountable for their actions ( e.g. by means of a clearly visible number on the uniform ) .", "CARDINAL . In their letter of CARDINAL DATE , the NORP authorities informed the ORG that CARDINAL criminal investigations into alleged cases of police ill - treatment had been initiated in connection with the DATE events , most of them on the basis of Sections CARDINAL ( physical abuse ) and CARDINAL ( abuse of authority ) of LAW . In CARDINAL cases , these investigations had been discontinued , while , in all other cases , they were still pending ...", "CARDINAL . The information gathered during the visit demonstrated that many of the persons detained by the police in connection with the DATE events in GPE were not granted the fundamental safeguards set out in paragraph CARDINAL from the outset of their deprivation of liberty .", "Many of the persons concerned were apparently allowed to contact a family member or another person of their choice and to be assisted by a lawyer only when they were brought before a judge . Further , a number of detained persons claimed that their requests to see a doctor whilst in police custody had been denied , even when they displayed visible injuries .", "The ORG would like to stress that , even in exceptional circumstances such as those of the DATE events , it is incumbent on the authorities to make every effort to guarantee that persons detained by the police enjoy the above - mentioned fundamental safeguards as from the very outset of their deprivation of liberty .", "CARDINAL . The examination of medical files at ORG revealed that injuries displayed by prisoners detained in connection with the DATE events had not always been recorded in detail upon admission to the prison . Further , the medical records often contained little or no information about the statements made by the prisoners concerned and never included the doctor \u2019s conclusion as to the possible causes of the injuries observed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In their responses to the ORG report , published on DATE ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) , ORG submitted the following , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL criminal cases were launched against officers in connection with the DATE events .

At present , the investigations of all CARDINAL cases have terminated .
