The applicant eventually undertook to hand over to him the grenade he had received as a present . At their meeting PERSON was also present and discussed the price of the grenades with them .", "Afterwards , PERSON called the applicant regularly , asking him to procure the CARDINAL grenades . The applicant contacted PERSON and requested CARDINAL hand grenades from him . On DATE the applicant obtained CARDINAL grenades from PERSON On the way home he met DATE and PERSON .

During the investigation the applicant confessed to the offence .

The Prosecutor stated that PERSON might be an undercover police officer who had secretly collected information about the applicant . However , he refused to open an investigation into the matter and took the view that the Head of ORG had proceeded lawfully throughout .", "The Budapest XIV / ORG charged the applicant with the abuse of explosives . Subsequently , he was also charged with the abuse of firearms .", "During the hearings before ORG the applicant maintained that , although he had committed the offence , he had not had any intention to trade in grenades and only did so because of the incitement by PERSON , an undercover police officer . He claimed that the officer \u2019s incitement had not been justified , since the police had no good reason to suspect the applicant of any prior involvement in selling hand grenades . He had no criminal record and there was nothing to suggest that he was predisposed to becoming involved in dealing in grenades until approached by PERSON .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of the abuse of explosives and firearms , and sentenced him , as a cumulative punishment , to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , suspended for DATE . In reaching its conclusion ORG stressed the fact that the applicant had had no previous criminal record , that time had elapsed and that the applicant had confessed .

GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-IV ) .", "For its part , ORG appealed against the leniency of the sentence imposed on the applicant , having regard to the widespread bomb attacks taking place at the material time .", "ORG examined the applicant \u2019s allegations concerning the fairness of the proceedings . It requested ORG to supply information about the identity of PERSON . It sought to have the police officer in charge of the operation exempted from his duty of confidentiality . The court intended to hear both men as witnesses . In reply to this request , the Head of ORG stated that PERSON was an informer acting on police instructions , pursuant to LAW CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW . He refused to give further information about PERSON or to exempt his handler from his duty of confidentiality .", "In these circumstances , ORG was forced to endorse the first - instance court \u2019s findings of fact . In its judgment of DATE it upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence .", "ORG held that the applicant and his accomplices would not have committed the offence without the pressure of the undercover police agent . However , it held as follows :", "\u201c The act committed by the defendants is an act which is obviously dangerous for society and which therefore matches the notion of a criminal offence ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of LAW ) . Its danger for society can not be questioned even if there was indeed a provocation by the police , that is , if instigation DATE known to or encouraged by the police \u2013 took place . \u201d", "The court considered that although the police instigation did not exonerate the applicant , his right to a fair trial was nevertheless infringed , notably in the light of the ORG and LOC cases . It also considered that the fact that the applicant would not have committed the offence , without incitement by PERSON , was a factor to be taken into account when imposing sentence . Consequently , it rejected the prosecution \u2019s request to increase the applicant \u2019s sentence , despite its own finding that the offence was particularly dangerous for society , given the frequency of bomb attacks at the time . However , it did not mitigate the applicant \u2019s sentence as requested by the latter in his appeal .", "The court also noted that , in separate proceedings , the applicant had meanwhile been convicted of an abuse of ammunition by ORG on DATE .", "Concerning the assessment of the evidence , ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c The findings of fact are based on lawfully obtained evidence , namely the defendants\u2019 admissions , the police report on their apprehension and the information contained in TIME of seizure .
