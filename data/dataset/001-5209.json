THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE , and resides in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) of ORG pronounced the divorce between the applicant and his wife , PERSON The care and custody ( voogdij ) of their QUANTITY children was awarded to PERSON The applicant was appointed as co - guardian ( toeziend voogd ) . It was further decided that the applicant was to pay ORG . CARDINAL per month for child support .", "The determination of an access arrangement for the applicant formed the subject of separate subsequent proceedings . On DATE , in proceedings on appeal against an initial decision , ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of \u2018 sHertogenbosch decided to adjourn its proceedings pending the submission of the results of an examination of the children and their parents to be carried out by ORG ( Pedagogisch ORG ; \u201c PAR \u201d ) .", "In its decision of DATE , ORG noted PERSON refusal to co - operate with the investigation by the ORG as well as her refusal to co - operate in exploring possibilities to start an access arrangement . It rejected as insufficiently weighty the arguments submitted by PERSON to the effect that the applicant should be denied access to his children . It held that , moreover , the mother \u2019s uncooperative attitude as to the examination by the ORG had resulted in a situation that it could not be established whether the applicant \u2019s access to both children would possibly be contrary to the children \u2019s interests . ORG determined an access arrangement according to which the applicant had access to the children DATE per fortnight as CARDINAL of the children \u2019s holidays .", "As PERSON refused to comply with this access arrangement , the applicant took summary proceedings ( kort geding ) against her before ORG of GPE seeking a judicial compliance order with a penalty of ORG . CARDINAL for each time PERSON would fail to comply .", "In its judgment of DATE , following proceedings in which PERSON had been declared in default of appearance , ORG ordered PERSON to comply with the access arrangement determined by ORG on DATE . It further determined a penalty of ORG . CARDINAL for DATE or part thereof that PERSON would not comply . This penalty was limited to a maximum of ORG . CARDINAL . ORG finally declared its judgment to be immediately enforceable ( bij voorraad uitvoerbaar ) .", "The applicant filed an appeal with ORG of \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch in respect of the determination of the penalty and the maximum limitation thereof . He requested ORG to fix the penalty at ORG . CARDINAL for each time of non - compliance and to allow him to off set the penalties incurred by PERSON with the child support that he had to pay .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s argument that , given the fact that PERSON had as yet failed to comply with the judgment of DATE , the penalty determined by ORG was an insufficient means of pressure . Consequently , it decided to fix the penalty for non - compliance at ORG . CARDINAL for DATE or part thereof .", "As to the maximum limitation of the penalty , ORG considered that , as PERSON had failed to appear before both ORG and ORG and thus did not find it even necessary to submit facts or circumstances in justification of her position and , therefore , rendered a judicial examination thereof impossible , PERSON behaviour should not be sanctioned . On this basis it decided not to determine a maximum limit for the penalty .", "ORG did , however , reject the applicant \u2019s request to be allowed to off set the penalty for non - compliance with the child support he had to pay . It held that PERSON , in her capacity as the children \u2019s guardian , received the child support which by its very nature was fully intended for the children . It noted that the applicant had never disputed the children \u2019s need of this support . The penalties , however , were due by PERSON in her personal capacity . The applicant and PERSON could , therefore , not be regarded as reciprocal debtors within the meaning of Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) . It further held that , also on the basis of LAW - which deals with CARDINAL situations in which a debtor is not competent to off set - in conjunction with Article LAW under ( e ) of LAW ( Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering ) , according to which payments for maintenance are exempted from seizure , compensation was not possible in this case .", "Consequently , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE in respect of the determination of the penalty and the maximum limitation thereof , fixed the penalty to ORG . CARDINAL for DATE or part thereof of non - compliance without setting a maximum limit and declared its judgment to be immediately enforceable .", "The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) , complaining that ORG had incorrectly held that to off set the penalties with the child support was not possible . He submitted that PERSON , in refusing to comply with the access arrangement , did not only act in her personal capacity , but also in her capacity as the children \u2019s guardian .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the appeal in cassation . It held that , by judgment , PERSON had been ordered , in her personal capacity , to comply with the access arrangement and that therefore , in case of non - compliance , she forfeited , also in her personal capacity , the penalty determined ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
