According to the ORG , a total of CARDINAL authorisations were issued in DATE to NORP sea - fishing boats to fish for mussel seed , CARDINAL of which operated in GPE harbour on behalf of CARDINAL mussel aquaculture operators .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the competent authorities published a notice in the national press announcing the intention to classify CARDINAL sites , including Castlemaine harbour , as a special protection area ( SPA ) within the meaning of the domestic legislation transposing Council Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE on the conservation of wild birds ( \u201c the PERSON Directive \u201d , ORG DATE L CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . The notice indicated that it was not envisaged that this would change the usage of the sites concerned . The harbour \u2019s SPA classification took effect in DATE . The applicant company continued its activities DATE , obtaining the necessary licences and permits .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the domestic authorities designated Castlemaine harbour a special area of conservation ( ORG ) within the meaning of the domestic legislation transposing ORG Directive CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora ( \u201c the Habitats Directive \u201d , OJ DATE L CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . As it was now subject to the CARDINAL ORG directives , it had the status of a \u201c FAC \u201d site .", "CARDINAL . Dating back to DATE , ORG was of the view that GPE and several other then ORG Member GPE were not fulfilling their obligations under ORG environmental law , and specifically in relation to the CARDINAL directives referred to above ( references hereafter will generally be to ORG and not ORG law ) . DATE and DATE , it addressed to the NORP authorities CARDINAL letters of formal notice warning that GPE had failed to correctly transpose and apply those CARDINAL directives . Following CARDINAL reasoned opinions issued in DATE and DATE , the ORG brought infringement proceedings against GPE in DATE , pursuant to LAW now LAW ) . It sought a declaration that GPE had failed to fulfil its obligations under several provisions of the directives , namely Articles PERSON ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , and CARDINAL of the Birds Directive , and Article CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) of the Habitats Directive . CARDINAL specific aspect of these proceedings concerned the authorisation of aquaculture in protected areas without the requisite prior assessment of the environmental impact of such activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the CJEU \u201d ) delivered its judgment in GPE v. GPE ( ORG , ORG : PERSON ) , declaring that GPE had failed to fulfil its obligations under the aforementioned directives in a number of respects . It held , insofar as relevant to the present case :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ R]egarding the aquaculture programmes , the ORG relies , essentially , on ORG in GPE carried out in DATE by GPE as the basis for its view that GPE has systematically failed to carry out a proper assessment of those projects situated in SPAs or likely to have effects on SPAs , contrary to Article PERSON ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Habitats Directive . In that context , it emphasises the importance of a prior assessment for the purpose of weighing the implications of a project with the conservation objectives fixed for the ORG concerned .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that that study covered CARDINAL authorisations for aquaculture programmes issued by ORG , ORG and ORG during the period from DATE and DATE applications yet to be decided on . Moreover , DATE licences and CARDINAL pending applications concerned aquaculture programmes situated inside or near an LOC . The authorisations issued concern , in PERCENT of the activities authorised in SPAs , oyster and clam farms .", "CARDINAL . It should also be borne in mind that , under the first sentence of Article PERSON ) of the Habitats Directive , any plan or project not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the site is to be made subject to an appropriate assessment of its implications for the site in view of the site \u2019s conservation objectives if it can not be excluded , on the basis of objective information , that it will have a significant effect on that site , either individually or in combination with other plans or projects ( Case CCARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON and PERSON [ DATE ] ECR ICARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The study carried out by GPE refers to a number of potential negative effects of shellfish farming , including the loss of feeding areas and disturbances caused by increased human activity and states that , even when an aquaculture programme is inside an SPA , very little protection is provided for bird habitats . GPE , for its part , does not allege that no aquaculture programmes have any effects on SPAs .", "CARDINAL . It follows that the authorisation procedure ought to have included an appropriate assessment of the implications of each specific project . It is clear that GPE merely stated , without offering further explanation , that the NORP scheme for authorising mollusc farms , including the provisions on consultation , does in fact provide for detailed consideration of all aspects of an aquaculture development project before a decision is taken on authorisation .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the ORG finds that GPE fails to ensure systematically that aquaculture programmes likely to have a significant effect on SPAs , either individually or in combination with other projects , are made subject to an appropriate prior assessment .", "CARDINAL . This finding is supported by the fact that GPE has not put forward any specific scientific studies showing that a prior , detailed ornithological study was carried out , in order to challenge the failure to fulfil obligations alleged by the Commission .", "CARDINAL . Under Article PERSON ) of the Habitats Directive , an appropriate assessment of the implications for the site concerned of the plan or project implies that , prior to its approval , all aspects of the plan or project which can , by themselves or in combination with other plans or projects , affect the site \u2019s conservation objectives must be identified in the light of the best scientific knowledge in the field . The competent national authorities are to authorise an activity on the protected site only if they have made certain that it will not adversely affect the integrity of that site . That is the case where no reasonable scientific doubt remains as to the absence of such effects ( see PERSON and PERSON , paragraph CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At or around the same time , the ORG found that the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE had similarly violated their ORG obligations .", "CARDINAL . In view of the judgment , the Minister considered that it was not legally possible to permit commercial activity in the sites concerned until the necessary assessments had been completed . Accordingly , when granting authorisation for mussel seed fishing for the period DATE to DATE , he prohibited it in CARDINAL locations around the NORP coast , including NORP harbour ( ORG . CARDINAL of DATE , adopted on DATE ) . The applicant company was informed of the situation by an official of ORG on DATE . It wrote to the Taoiseach ( Prime Minister ) that DATE to underline the threat to the livelihood of those affected . It recalled the terms of the notice published in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and explained that it had just purchased a new boat at a cost of MONEY . The applicant company received a reply from the ORG dated DATE . This explained that baseline data for the area had to be gathered in order to perform the assessment required by the Habitats Directive , as interpreted by the ORG . It indicated that NORP harbour had been given priority for the exercise and that work had already begun to collect the necessary data . It added that the authorities would be seeking the agreement of ORG to allow aquaculture to resume on an interim basis .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant company was issued an authorisation to fish for mussel seed in the harbour , with a starting date of DATE . The authorisation was subject to a number of conditions , including that it did not allow the holder to fish for mussel seed in an area or areas where this activity had been prohibited . On that same date , the temporary prohibition on mussel seed fishing at NORP harbour , and at CARDINAL other locations around the ORG , was maintained in force by ORG . CARDINAL of DATE . The temporary prohibition only applied to mussel seed fishing ; it did not prevent the harvesting of mussels previously fished and laid on farms for cultivation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company wrote to ORG on DATE , warning that the supply of mussel seed in the harbour was being consumed by predators and that it would hold the ORG responsible for all losses incurred . It requested a satisfactory resolution within DATE , failing which it would take advice about legal action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following successful negotiations between ORG ( see further below ) , the Minister issued ORG . CARDINAL of DATE removing Castlemaine harbour from the list of locations where mussel seed fishing was prohibited . The applicant company was therefore able to commence mussel seed fishing on the date the instrument came into operation , namely DATE . By that stage , however , natural predators had decimated the mussel seed . Since mussels need DATE to grow to maturity , the financial consequences of the temporary prohibition on mussel seed fishing in GPE harbour in DATE were only felt in DATE . DATE , the applicant had no mussels for sale , representing a loss of profit that it estimated at MONEY .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant company , there was no viable replacement for local mussel seed . Previous attempts to bring in mussel seed from other sites had not proved successful due to the high mortality of the seed and to the transport costs involved . It argued that it was therefore wholly dependent on the use of local resources . The applicant company further explained that if there had been any forewarning of the restriction on mussel seed fishing in DATE , it would not have made such a major investment in a new boat purchased in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the harbour was opened for mussel seed fishing from DATE to CARDINAL May , and from DATE to DATE . The applicant company was able to gather the usual amount of mussel seed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , in accordance with ORG law , the Minister introduced an additional requirement for fishing in SACs or SPAs , a fisheries ORG permit .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the periods authorised for mussel seed fishing in the harbour were from DATE to CARDINAL May , and from DATE to DATE . The applicant company was not able to operate during the first period , as it had not yet obtained such a fisheries Natura permit . When it eventually recommenced fishing at DATE , the mussel seed had once again been depleted by predators , although the applicant company acquired some tonnage . It estimated its loss of profits for DATE at MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The Government provided the following explanations of the action taken following the ORG judgment , which the applicant company did not dispute . They indicated that even before the delivery of the ORG \u2019s judgment they had commenced a process to determine how fisheries should be assessed in compliance with the relevant ORG directives . Following that judgment , the ORG immediately began the process of ensuring compliance with ORG law in the fisheries sector . This process involved the domestic bodies with responsibilities for fisheries ( ORG PERSON ) , marine research ( ORG ) and nature conservation ( ORG \u2013 ORG ) . Within DATE of the judgment being handed down , ORG prepared a paper in DATE on the distribution of bi - valve ( dredge ) fisheries with the potential to lead to disturbance or significant disturbance of habitat , including the fishing of mussels .", "CARDINAL . At a meeting in DATE between the ORG and ORG , the latter underlined the need to comply with the judgment by conducting the requisite assessments for aquaculture , and in so doing addressing the cumulative effects of other activities that could adversely affect DATE sites . While the Commission recognised the need for some flexibility , and the small scale of much of NORP aquaculture , it considered that the onus was on GPE to initiate a robust , proportionate and scientific process .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the relevant domestic bodies agreed on the need for an alternative approach to assess inshore fisheries on an interim basis , pending the collection of baseline data allowing the appropriate assessment required by ORG law . To this end , a series of steps was proposed . DATE , ORG prepared a working document on fisheries in DATE sites , which included a case study of NORP harbour . The study considered that the consequences of mussel seed fishing on the site were negligible . According to the applicant company , this assessment was consistent with that set out in a draft consultation document which had previously been prepared in DATE by ORG with responsibility for heritage , of which the ORG was then part .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE sent to the Commission its official response to the ORG judgment . It acknowledged that assessments were required in relation to fisheries , and that the necessary baseline data had to be collected at the sites in question . The response also indicated that the NORP authorities would seek the ORG \u2019s approval for an interim approach .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG submitted to ORG a finalised study entitled \u201c Fisheries in Natura CARDINAL \u201d . ORG was hopeful that the Commission would tolerate an interim approach to the activities in GPE harbour , where the situation was time critical . DATE , the ORG warned that in the absence of sufficient funding and staff it could not provide the necessary assurances to the Commission . It informed the ORG that the assessments available to date were not adequate , and that the ORG shared this view . Additional studies were needed . The Commission \u2019s stance was that it was prepared to give its temporary agreement to fishing at Castlemaine harbour if the additional studies were submitted and if GPE gave an undertaking to meet the terms of the judgment over a DATE period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sent to the Commission an interim assessment of mussel seed fishing in GPE harbour , indicating that on the basis of its assessment this activity was not likely to have a significant impact on the site . The Commission agreed that , on the basis of this interim assessment , fishing could be allowed in the harbour for DATE only , on condition that GPE submit more detailed assessment procedures with a view to allowing fishing there in future . The Commission sought confirmation that there was an adequate basis in domestic law to ensure fishing activities remained in compliance with the directives . It requested amendments to certain aspects of the assessment , and it also requested a monitoring report . From that point it was considered legally possible to open GPE harbour . The Minister signed ORG ( No . CARDINAL of DATE ) DATE , DATE , allowing mussel seed fishing to recommence on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the ORG maintained its robust stance , requiring a long - term plan to achieve compliance in order for the interim approach to continue . The ORG indicated the likelihood of a negative assessment due to a decline in several bird populations , and pointed to the need for additional surveys of the site .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the NORP authorities assured the Commission of its commitment to a verifiable DATE plan to achieve compliance with the directives as regards fisheries and aquaculture . They indicated an allocation of MONEY over DATE for a wide - ranging exercise to collect baseline data . In DATE , GPE submitted its \u201c roadmap to compliance \u201d with the judgment to the Commission . The latter approved an interim approach to assessment , based on best available data and the collection of limited additional data in the time available , and subject to stringent management and control arrangements .", "CARDINAL . There was further engagement between the NORP authorities and the ORG during DATE and DATE regarding compliance with the ORG judgment and the relevant directives . Public consultation was also required in relation to the regulatory changes that had to be made .", "CARDINAL . The appropriate assessment of NORP harbour was completed in DATE by ORG . Running to CARDINAL pages , it assessed the effects on the site of the different types of aquaculture carried out there and concluded that there was no reason to anticipate any environmental disturbance from mussel fishing . This was CARDINAL of multiple assessments which the respondent ORG had to undertake in light of the ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . Along with another local company , which was not directly involved in the cultivation of mussels but was a downstream retailer and exporter , the applicant company instituted proceedings in ORG in DATE against the ORG . It relied on a series of grounds , notably breach of legitimate expectation , operational negligence and breach of the constitutional right to earn a livelihood .", "CARDINAL . In view of the ORG \u2019s delay in delivering a defence to the claim , the applicant company brought a motion for judgment in default of defence , which was heard and concluded on DATE . The ORG delivered its defence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company sought discovery of documents on a voluntary basis . It then applied to the Master of the High Court , on DATE , for an order of discovery , pursuing the matter before him in DATE , DATE and DATE . The Master gave his ruling on DATE , which the applicant company appealed against to ORG . It was granted an order of discovery on DATE , directing the ORG to provide a variety of documents within DATE . The ORG swore an affidavit of discovery on DATE . It swore a supplemental affidavit of discovery DATE , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company issued an amended statement of claim on DATE , which referred to the restrictions applied in DATE and DATE as well .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company set the action down for trial and certified it ready for hearing . Over DATE there were some exchanges of correspondence between the applicant company \u2019s solicitor and the Chief State Solicitor in relation to the hearing of the action . On DATE the applicant company requested a hearing date .", "CARDINAL . The hearing took place DATE in DATE . Judgment was given on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The High Court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs . The trial judge accepted their evidence that it would not have been viable for the applicant company to purchase mussel seed from operators based in other locations . He first found that there had been a breach of legitimate expectation , stating :", "\u201c [ T]here was a representation made to the plaintiffs in both the government notice and the newspaper notice of DATE . There was comfort given . What happened from then onwards , the DATE allocation of seed collection authorisations and the constant refurbishing of the plaintiffs business gave rise to a pattern of events where the plaintiffs had good reason to rely upon the comfort given to them that there would not be a summary closure of their business without some good scientific reasons or without some consultation process before doing so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that there had been \u201c operational negligence \u201d due to the failure of the authorities to carry out the necessary scientific tests or monitoring that would have provided the data required by ORG law . It considered that the failure to undertake these steps was a mistake of law by the Minister , which led to the denial of the applicant company \u2019s access to the harbour for a period in DATE , causing financial loss . The trial judge accepted the evidence presented by the applicant company that it would have been possible to conduct the requisite analysis within DATE . Had that been done , there would not have been any disruption of the applicant company \u2019s activities .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company claimed compensation for lost profits caused by the restrictions in DATE and DATE , which it estimated at MONEY and CARDINAL respectively , making a total claim of CARDINAL . The ORG challenged both the basis for the applicant company \u2019s calculations and the quantum of damages sought . ORG decided that the applicant company \u2019s claim should be reduced by CARDINAL . This resulted in an award of MONEY for its losses over DATE in question . It awarded the other local company MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed both on the issues of liability and the quantum of damages awarded . It filed its notice of appeal with ORG on DATE . The applicant company brought a cross appeal in relation to the estimation of damages . A stay issue was ultimately resolved by ORG on DATE . On DATE the ORG certified that the appeal was ready for hearing . The appeal was granted priority by the Chief Justice on DATE . The hearing took place on DATE , and judgment was given on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG was unanimous in overturning the High Court \u2019s ruling on legitimate expectation . Addressing this issue , PERSON , with whom the other members of the court agreed , stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... [ T]he only representation which it can be said was expressly made by the Minister ... was to the effect that \u201c it is not envisaged \u201d that there would be any restriction on traditional activities . That statement was made in DATE , and was in the context both of developing NORP environmental legislation and also in the context of the process leading to the identification of areas within GPE which would be designated for the purposes of that NORP legislation . It could not be said to amount to a clear commitment on the part of the Minister that there could never be any adverse consequences . What the consequences were going to be of the designation of an area for NORP environmental purposes was a matter of NORP law .", "CARDINAL As events unfolded , it became clear that the Minister did not have the legal authority , as a matter of NORP law , to allow for the uninterrupted continuance of traditional activities in protected areas unless and until an appropriate assessment had been carried out . ... The Minister could give no greater assurance than that , in the then view of the Minister , it was not envisaged that there would be problems for traditional activities .", "...", "CARDINAL Next , reliance is placed on the fact that , as found by the trial judge , the ongoing activities of [ the applicant company ] were carried out to the knowledge of the Minister and on the basis of DATE legal measures put in place by the Minister which facilitated the so - called opening of the harbour . However ... the fact that there may have been an error in the past can not create a legitimate expectation that that error will be continued into the future . The fact that the Minister was mistaken in his view that traditional activities , of which the Minister undoubtedly knew , could continue provided that the Minister put in place the appropriate legal measures , and was also in error about the fact that those legal measures could be put in place in conformity with NORP law without carrying out an appropriate assessment , can not create a legitimate expectation to the effect that that situation would continue .", "CARDINAL While there undoubtedly was significant expenditure , and while the incurrence of expenditure on foot of a representation may form part of the ORG \u2019s assessment in determining whether it would be appropriate to allow a public authority to resile from a representation made , expenditure will not be relevant if there was no legitimate expectation in the first place .", "CARDINAL ... As interpreted by the [ CJEU ] , a permission for activity in a protected area can only be given when there is an appropriate assessment . An appropriate assessment requires that , on a scientific assessment , risk be excluded . The Minister was required , therefore , as a matter of NORP law , to be concerned not with unproven risk but rather with proven absence of risk . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the issue of operational negligence , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges upheld the ORG \u2019s appeal . CARDINAL members of the majority gave judgment .", "CARDINAL . MacMenamin J observed that strong policy considerations arose in the case . The question of how to afford redress to individuals who had suffered the detrimental effects of wrongful actions by the executive was a legitimate concern . Yet changes in the law of negligence and reformulations of ORG liability must be carefully and incrementally approached with a clear view as to their long - term consequences . While there undoubtedly was a strong public interest in ensuring a proper balance between private and public rights and duties , there was a stronger public interest in ensuring that government can actually function , and that administrators were not impeded in making decisions through fear of a morass of litigation . The courts should not become a form of surrogate unelected government , second guessing prima facie lawful government actions in areas of discretion that did not raise questions of exceeding statutory powers . Reviewing the established domestic jurisprudence , he concluded that operational negligence had not been accepted in NORP law . He considered that in the present case ORG had identified a tort with such broad headings lasting DATE that it was questionable whether there was a justiciable controversy at all . It was impossible to say whether it was a tort committed by act or by omission . It was unclear at what point in time the Minister had acted wrongfully in relation to the plaintiffs . It might be said that , by allowing aquaculture to continue DATE , the Minister had actually had regard to the applicant company \u2019s interests , even at the cost of failed adherence to ORG law . He further observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . There then arises a further unavoidable question , that is , whether , if the Minister had , in fact , acted DATE , the respondents would inevitably have incurred significant losses , by a similar necessary suspension of activity in LOC , as occurred from DATE , in order to obtain appropriate baseline data ? If the detailed surveys complained of were necessary to establish the baseline , one is only left to speculate as to how these surveys could have been carried out without exactly the same or similar cessation of activity in the harbour , albeit in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINALFrancovich breach of ORG law ( ORG and ORG , ORG : C:CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) but rather from the damage allegedly caused by the implementation of ORG law after a breach thereof was identified by the ORG . The fallacy in the case was to seek to isolate some private duty owed to the plaintiffs by the Minister from his overarching public duty to comply with and implement ORG environmental law .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , concurring , noted that LAW , the Minister had no discretion at all . He underlined CARDINAL salient facts . First , many of the CARDINAL sites designated under the LOC and Birds Directives were places of commercial activity of some sort . Following the ruling of the ORG , emergency measures had to be taken to allow economic operators some latitude for the continuation of even limited business activity within the sites . This was done essentially by NORP public servants negotiating with the ORG . There were about forty sea - based sites , including Castlemaine harbour . Second , the ORG had not given a firm undertaking that the new environmental classification of Castlemaine harbour would not affect the applicant company \u2019s activities . Third , the closing and opening of the harbour was done by valid statutory instruments . He considered that this ruled out any question of liability in negligence .", "CARDINAL . He then referred to the primary legislation governing fishing , the main objective of which was the conservation and rational management of the national fish reserves . This point was central to where any duty of care might lie . The starting point in the tort analysis had to be whether the Minister had owed a duty of care to the applicant company . There was a need for caution in holding that the public authorities owed a duty of care in particular circumstances , since it could greatly hinder their normal functioning . There were other means to deal with improper conduct by a public body , such as judicial review and the tort of misfeasance in public office . He reiterated that the authorities had not had any choice ; the Minister had acted as prescribed by ORG law . At most , it might be said that there was some choice to be made about whether to give priority to some of the affected sites over the others . Yet it was hard to argue that NORP harbour was more deserving than the other locations . Concentrating resources on some sites would have left operators in other sites waiting longer . The ORG had instead adopted a strategy of vigorous negotiation with the ORG to attempt to salvage whatever could be recovered for the benefit of users of all of the sites concerned .", "CARDINAL . The concept of operational negligence had not yet been accepted as part of domestic law . It would mean a lack of certainty in the law , and make public decision - making subsidiary to the views of experts at several removes from the pressures of government . It would mean arrogating broader functions to the courts than provided for in the LAW . The Minister had exercised powers based on statute and each decision had been correctly expressed through a statutory instrument . Given the general conservationist aims of the primary legislation , there was no statutory duty in favour of the applicant company . There was no discretion vested in the Minister to exempt any economic actor from ORG rules . There was no duty of care towards the applicant company that could found an action in negligence . Instead , the duty of care was towards the wider community , expressed as the protection of the environment .", "CARDINAL . Writing for the minority , PERSON considered that the High Court judgment , insofar as it concerned negligence , should be upheld as regards the events of DATE . Concerning the events of DATE , he noted that the applicant company had not provided evidence allowing a causal link to be established between the alleged failure on the part of the Minister and its inability to conduct its business DATE . It therefore had no cause of action against the ORG in this respect .", "CARDINAL . Applying the relevant principles to the case , PERSON clarified that there could not have been a duty on the Minister in DATE to refrain from closing the harbour until an appropriate assessment had been carried out , as this would have been contrary to ORG law . To the extent the harbour could be opened , this was only permissible in accordance with the interim measures agreed with the Commission . The real question was therefore :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... In the light of developments in NORP law , did the Minister owe a duty of care to those who , to his knowledge ( and up to then with his permission ) , were carrying out activities in protected areas , to ensure that he had appropriate survey(s ) and other scientific evidence available to enable a decision to be made for the purposes of considering whether to permit the continuance of traditional activities and , should appropriate evidence be found to be present , to allow those activities to be authorised ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . He considered that on the facts of the case the necessary elements of foreseeability and proximity were present . The Minister was well aware of the activities taking place in GPE harbour . He was also aware , in light of the statement published in DATE , that there was a potential issue that might arise in relation to such activities . Therefore , the Minister had been fully aware that any failure to place himself in a position to make a sustainable decision about the continuance of traditional activities in the sites concerned could have a significant effect on those involved in them . A private party in an analogous position would undoubtedly have been held to have a duty of care towards such persons . He further noted that it must have been clear to the Minister for some time prior to the ORG judgment that there was a risk that the position taken by ORG would be upheld over that of the ORG . In that eventuality , there would be an immediate problem due to the absence of the necessary scientific data for the appropriate assessment to be made , leading to at least the temporary interruption of the activities of the applicant company and others operating in protected areas . These formed a small and defined group of persons that , to a large extent , were actually known to the Minister and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . As to the presence of any countervailing policy factor , he reiterated that the case did not concern matters of policy , discretion or adjudication . It did not touch upon the allocation of resources or the making of statutory decisions . It was about the purported duty of the Minister to take reasonable steps to ensure that he would be in a proper position to make a decision under NORP law and any relevant NORP measures . He clarified that he did not necessarily disagree with the view of MacMenamin J that no specific duty of care on the Minister had arisen in the period after the ORG judgment . At that stage , the authorities had found themselves on the back foot , with many decisions to be made about the allocation of the resources needed to conduct appropriate assessments at the sites concerned . But the actions and decisions in DATE and later were not relevant to the duty of care as he had defined it :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... [ T]he Minister got it wrong by failing to put in place measures to secure the appropriate scientific data to enable an appropriate assessment to be carried out long after it had become clear , by reason of the position adopted by the Commission , that there was , to put it at its mildest , a significant doubt as to whether the Minister \u2019s position was correct .", "...", "CARDINAL NORP ... [ I]t seems to me that the duty of care which I suggest should be held to lie on the Minister does not derive from any balancing exercise at all and does not involve any aspect of the undoubted over - arching public duty which the Minister was obliged to perform . Against what can it be said that the Minister was balancing when he decided not to assemble the necessary scientific information and data ( despite the Commission \u2019s reasoned opinion ) prior to the decision of the ECJ ? What over - arching public duty would have been in any way impaired by the collection of such data ? There is no evidence to suggest that the failure to assemble the necessary data was based on any decision involving policy , discretion or adjudication . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , he did not agree with the majority that the applicant company \u2019s business would have been interrupted in any event if the Habitats Directive had been correctly implemented at an earlier point in time . According to PERSON , the evidence accepted by ORG was that the necessary data could have been collected and analysed in a relatively short period of time , avoiding any interruption of the applicant company \u2019s usual activities . There was thus a causal link between the failure to assemble the relevant data and conduct the assessment at an earlier point in time , and the interruption of the applicant company \u2019s activities in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In relation to damages , PERSON noted that there were many points of disagreement between the applicant company and the ORG over the manner in which the former \u2019s losses should be properly assessed . He considered that the difficulties with the evidence and the figures would have made it impossible for ORG to conduct a fair and just calculation .
