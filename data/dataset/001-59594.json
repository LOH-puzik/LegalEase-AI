The applicants are former members of ORG and of ORG ( DEP ) , which was dissolved by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor at ORG accused them of having infringed LAW and made repeated applications \u2013 on DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE \u2013 for their parliamentary immunity to be lifted .", "On DATE ORG , having deliberated on the basis of the application of DATE , decided to lift the applicants\u2019 parliamentary immunity under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Dicle and Mr Do\u011fan were taken into police custody on the orders of the public prosecutor at ORG . On DATE PERSON suffered the same fate .", "DATE the public prosecutor at ORG ordered the detention of those CARDINAL applicants in police custody to be extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . While in custody , the applicants made no statements to the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE they were brought before a judge of ORG and placed in detention pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dissolved the DEP and ordered the party \u2019s MPs to vacate their parliamentary seats .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was taken into police custody on DATE and placed in detention pending trial on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the public prosecutor at ORG had filed a bill of indictment in which he accused the applicants of treason against the integrity of the State \u2013 a capital offence under LAW . The accusation was based firstly on the activities that the applicants were alleged to have engaged in on behalf of ORG ) ( harbouring militants and providing CARDINAL of them with medical care , negotiating with local leaders or proffering threats against them to make them help the ORG establish itself in their regions ) and secondly on the content of oral and written statements by the applicants expressing support for ORG activities . On TIME of CARDINAL DATE the offences of which the applicants were accused were announced in the news bulletin of the publicly owned ORG television channel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the date of the final hearing before ORG , the applicants learned that the prosecution was proposing to alter the charge to belonging to an armed gang within the meaning of LAW . ORG invited the applicants to submit their observations on this new characterisation of the offences . The applicants\u2019 lawyers were not present at the hearing because they had decided to protest against ORG refusal to adopt a procedural measure they had requested of it .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG sentenced the CARDINAL applicants to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for belonging to an armed gang within the meaning of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW . It rejected the charge LAW , which provided for the death penalty in the event of treason against the integrity of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . It found it established that the applicants had engaged in intensive \u201c separatist \u201d activity under instructions from leaders of the ORG , a separatist armed gang seeking to found a NORP State in south - eastern and eastern GPE . In that context it noted the following points : in the run - up to the DATE parliamentary election the applicants had given speeches under the ORG banner at meetings where slogans had been shouted such as \u201c Long Live the NORP \u201d and \u201c Strike guerrillas strike , found GPE \u201d ; the applicants had provoked unrest among the population and created an atmosphere that had undermined the authority of the ORG ; they had worn ORG colours when they were sworn in as members of ORG in DATE ; at the congresses of their political parties , the ORG and the DEP , the ORG flag had been hoisted instead of the NORP flag and GPE had been described as an occupier and enemy ; conversations recorded CARDINAL of the CARDINAL applicants and heads of clans ( a\u015firet reisi ) in south - eastern and eastern ORG had revealed that the former had used threats to try to persuade the latter to join or support the ORG ; CARDINAL of the applicants had harboured a ORG militant in his official residence , had helped him to obtain medical treatment and had fraudulently induced the ORG to pay his hospital bills ; another had harboured in his home ORG militants preparing to join those who were already involved in field operations in the region ; and all the applicants had made statements on behalf of the ORG in foreign countries and spread lies about ORG intended to uphold the ORG \u2019s views . ORG also rejected an application by a co - defendant for a public hearing of a witness for the prosecution owing to the danger that the witness might suffer reprisals at the hands of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . When classifying the facts found in the instant case as offences under LAW rather than LAW , ORG referred to the case - law according to which LAW defined a crime in terms of the ends pursued and LAW in terms of the means deployed . Treason against the integrity of the ORG within the meaning of LAW was a crime which could only be made out if it was established that acts had been committed which were likely to pose a real threat to the ORG \u2019s survival . Acts of violence and terrorism could fall within the scope of LAW if they were serious enough to pose such a threat . LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , on the other hand , made it an offence merely to belong to an armed organisation which was already considered to be acting for a purpose contrary to LAW . The material element of the offence lay in the fact that the persons in question belonged to an armed organisation of the aforementioned type complete with a system of disciplinary rules and a hierarchical structure . In that context , it was not necessary for the defendants themselves to have committed acts posing a threat to the ORG \u2019s survival . However , LAW did require a specific mental element , namely that the offenders were aware that they belonged to the illegal organisation .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and the public prosecutor at ORG appealed on points of law against the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor argued that the offences were indeed punishable under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted for their part that the criminal proceedings had been brought for a political purpose , namely to suppress the opinions of members of ORG defending the NORP cause . They contended that ORG by which they had been convicted was a special political court which could not be considered an independent and impartial tribunal .", "They also asserted that they had been denied a fair trial because , among other things , their equality of arms with the prosecution had not been respected . They complained in particular that they had been denied the assistance of a lawyer during DATE in police custody ; that their representatives had not had access to the documents on the case file during the preliminary investigation ; that pressure had been brought to bear on their representatives by the government as their defence had been the subject of reports by the NORP secret services and their access to the courtroom had sometimes been impeded ; that the applications filed by their representatives had never been allowed by ORG ; that they had not been permitted to examine before that court the witnesses interviewed by the prosecution during the preliminary investigation or the experts appointed by the prosecution ; that their applications for the examination of the sound and video recordings made by the prosecution had been rejected by ORG for no valid reason ; that the evidence on which their conviction had been based had not been read out at the hearing ; and that their applications for further witnesses to be heard and second opinions to be sought had been dismissed by ORG . The applicants also argued that the difficulties encountered by certain lawyers and foreign delegations when attempting to enter the courtroom had infringed the requirement of a public hearing . Lastly , they criticised ORG for laying the activities of all pro - NORP organisations , whether legal or illegal , at their door and taking account of findings of a political nature having no probative value with regard to the accusations levelled against them .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the decision at first instance as to the applicants\u2019 guilt and the sentences imposed on them .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand it held that some of the reasons given by ORG in its judgment of DATE could not be permitted to stand . When the telephone conversations between the applicants and the head of the ORG had been recorded the statutory provisions intended to safeguard the freedom of communication had been infringed ; the fact that the applicants\u2019 diaries contained the names and addresses of ORG leaders did not prove the accusations ; and the fact that some of the defendants ( including CARDINAL of the CARDINAL applicants ) had taken part in a press conference held by the head of the ORG could not in itself be regarded as an offence .", "CARDINAL . In assessing each of the applicants\u2019 guilt , ORG took account of various public communiqu\u00e9s that they had issued . In those documents they had described the parliamentary oath as racist on the ground that it omitted any reference to the NORP identity , and asserted that the NORP government was waging war on the NORP population , that NORP uprisings had been suppressed using methods of genocide and that the national rights of the NORP people were denied by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Regarding PERSON , ORG noted the following : she had undergone political training in a ORG camp in GPE ) ; she had had CARDINAL conversations with the head of a clan in south - eastern GPE , advising him not to prevent the ORG from attacking ORG targets and encouraging him to telephone the head of the ORG , addressing him as \u201c Mr Secretary General \u201d ; she had twice visited the head of another clan to encourage him to join the ORG to help found GPE ; she had handed over to the ORG one of its opponents who had been abducted by ORG militants ; she had described slogans such as \u201c Long Live Apo [ Apo is a diminutive used to refer to PERSON , the head of the ORG ] \u201d or \u201c Long Live NORP \u201d , shouted at a demonstration in Cizre , as \u201c slogans of the NORP people \u201d ; she had declared on NORP television that she felt like a foreigner in GPE and that the NORP parliament , of which she was a member , was constantly taking decisions whose aim was to wipe out the NORP people ; and she had taken part in a demonstration and a press conference held by the ORG in GPE and had addressed the participants from a rostrum draped with the ORG flag .", "CARDINAL . Regarding Orhan Do\u011fan , ORG noted the following : he had knowingly harboured a ORG militant in his home owing to his organic links with the ORG ; he had helped the militant in question to obtain medical treatment and had fraudulently had the costs reimbursed by ORG ; he had harboured CARDINAL other ORG militants who were about to return to the organisation \u2019s camps ; he had made statements to foreign embassies to the effect that the villagers leaving GPE in DATE were actually fleeing the ORG forces ; and he had stated at demonstrations that ORG was repressing the NORP people in various ways , while describing the ORG as an army .", "CARDINAL . Regarding Hatip Dicle , ORG noted the following : he had put pressure on the head of a clan in south - eastern GPE to join the ORG , whose aims he had said were to found GPE and destroy the enemy ; he had asked the persons attending a public meeting in GPE to observe a TIME \u2019s silence in honour of the ORG \u2019s dead , asserting that the NORP army had come to the region to repress the NORP people ; he had stated in an interview given to a NORP DATE newspaper that the ORG ideal would be to found a NORP State and that they had been fighting for their freedom since LAW ( DATE ) ; he had described the ORG as a movement with popular roots ; he had stated that all those who were against the NORP should be expelled from their territory even if that would cost them their lives ; he had said that the NORP were engaged in an armed resistance to ensure their survival and that the alleged fight against terrorism amounted to an attempt to crush the ORG claims to nationhood ; he had attempted to justify the terrorist attack on the cadets of the military college for infantry conscripts , in which CARDINAL people were killed and CARDINAL injured , by saying that everyone in uniform was a potential target by virtue of the international conventions on the laws of war ; and he had stated at a meeting of his party that the ORG could not solve the NORP problem by banning the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , regarding PERSON , ORG found the following facts established : he had put pressure on the head of a clan in south - eastern GPE to accept the authority of the ORG ; he had asked the inhabitants of the village of LOC ( in south - east GPE ) to relinquish their positions as village guards , explaining that they were in GPE and that the NORP war of national liberation was soon to be launched against the fascist NORP State ; he had described police officers escorting persons in police custody on suspicion of having been active within the ORG as torturers , while stating that he would prevent the repression of the NORP by the NORP and that the NORP would demand some form of retribution ; at a meeting held by the ORG in ORG ( GPE ) , he had described the ORG as a guerrilla army fighting for the independence of GPE and the NORP people ; and in a communiqu\u00e9 sent to foreign embassies in GPE he had declared that the villagers leaving GPE in DATE had in fact been fleeing the ORG forces .", "CARDINAL .
