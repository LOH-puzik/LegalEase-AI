FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Until DATE the applicant was employed in the private sector , working mainly as a management and accountancy consultant . On the basis of the professional experience he had thus acquired , he applied for a job working for ORG under the overseas cooperation programme .", "CARDINAL . ORG recruited him \u2013 under a contract signed on DATE as a technical adviser to the Minister for ORG . As head of project , he was to be responsible for drawing up the budget of ORG investment for DATE and was to participate in the preparation of the DATE plan and the DATE programme of public investment , in liaison with NORP civil servants and international organisations .", "CARDINAL . The contract stipulated that the applicant was to be placed at the disposal of the government of GPE for CARDINAL DATE spells separated by a period of home leave calculated on the basis of DATE for DATE worked . The contract also laid down the conditions of his remuneration and in respect of all other matters referred to the regulations issued pursuant to the PERSON of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a number of local disagreements , the NORP authorities placed the applicant once more at the disposal of the NORP authorities . This caused the termination of his contract on expiry of his period of home leave ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry intended to give the applicant a new contract when he had completed his home leave , assigning him to duties in GPE . To be eligible , he had to satisfy CARDINAL prior conditions , as required of all other applicants for cooperation posts : firstly , candidates had to obtain the approval of the authorities of the country where they were to serve ; secondly , they had to be certified medically fit to serve overseas .", "CARDINAL . As the approval of the NORP authorities was slow in coming , ORG notified the applicant \u2013 by a letter of CARDINAL DATE that his contract was to be terminated and informed him that he would subsequently be removed from the ORG \u2019s establishment with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Gabonese authorities\u2019 approval was later given for a post of financial analyst at ORG . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG noted this approval and accordingly declared the striking - off decision announced on DATE null and void . The applicant was then summoned to attend the compulsory medical examination to assess his fitness to serve .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the doctor responsible for the interministerial medical service , a specialist in tropical medicine , examined the applicant and ordered an additional psychiatric report . In the light of the results of the additional diagnosis , the doctor declared on DATE that the applicant was permanently unfit to serve overseas .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted that opinion and accordingly informed the applicant that his name was to be removed from the list of the ORG \u2019s establishment with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG to set aside the decision of DATE as being unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for Cooperation and Development filed his defence .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG ordered a medical report in order to ascertain whether , on account of his state of health , the applicant had been unfit in DATE to serve as a technical adviser under the overseas cooperation programme .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the medical expert filed his report , having interviewed the applicant and given him a medical , psychological and neuropsychiatric examination on DATE . He gave it as his opinion that ORG administrative reaction had been excessive and that the applicant \u2019s state of health had not made him unfit to resume his duties after CARDINAL months\u2019 sick - leave , after which he could have gone before a medical board .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a compensation claim , seeking an order requiring the ORG to pay him CARDINAL different sums . Firstly , he claimed MONEY ( ORG ) , which he considered to be the amount of remuneration he would have received if he had remained in post ; secondly , he claimed ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for the personal , pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage he considered he had sustained on account of being struck off .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG fixed the amount payable in costs for the medical report . By a decision of DATE it corrected a clerical error in the operative provisions of the first decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG submitted his observations on the medical report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for Cooperation and Development submitted his defence to the applicant \u2019s compensation claim of CARDINAL DATE , arguing that it was unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the Minister for ORG filed a rejoinder and a number of documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a reply .", "CARDINAL . The case was set down for hearing on DATE . On DATE the applicant was informed that the case had been put off to a date to be determined later .", "CARDINAL .

By a judgment of DATE , following a hearing on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application , as regards both the request to have the striking - off decision set aside and the compensation claim . It held in particular :", "\u201c ... As to the application to set aside the Minister for ORG \u2019s decision of [ CARDINAL ] DATE", "Firstly , the documents in the file show that PERSON contract with the ORG to work in GPE as a participant in the cooperation programme was terminated when the NORP authorities placed him once more at the disposal of ORG . Although , by a letter of DATE , the Minister declared null and void the decision of CARDINAL DATE announcing that PERSON name would be removed from the list of the ORG \u2019s establishment with effect from DATE , which he did with a view to the signing of a new contract , he did not intend to reactivate the contract under which PERSON had been assigned to duties in GPE , since that contract had been automatically terminated when the foreign State placed him once more at the disposal of the French State . Consequently , PERSON may not validly argue that the decision of [ DATE unlawfully rescinded the decision of CARDINAL [ DATE .", "Secondly , in deciding to remove the applicant \u2019s name from the list of the ORG establishment with effect from DATE , the Minister was merely drawing the consequences of the fact that the contract assigning PERSON to duties in GPE expired on that date and of the fact that no new contract had been signed . Consequently , his decision was not invalidated by any unlawful retrospectiveness ; ...", "Thirdly , the medical report of CARDINAL DATE shows that on [ CARDINAL ] DATE PERSON did not satisfy the physical fitness conditions for service overseas . Consequently , he may not validly maintain that the decision of [ DATE , which cited the \u2026 opinion that he was unfit as ground for refusing him a new contract for the cooperation service in GPE , was vitiated by an error of judgment ; ...", "As to the compensation claim", "It follows from the rejection of PERSON arguments in support of his application to set aside the decision of [ DATE that he may not rely on any culpable unlawfulness making the ORG liable . Consequently , his claim for compensation from the ORG for prejudice caused by the decision of [ DATE must be dismissed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave notice of appeal against the above judgment , which had been served on him on DATE , and filed his statement of the grounds of appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for Cooperation and Development filed a pleading .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a further pleading .", "CARDINAL . The case is pending in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the law governing the position of civilian cultural , scientific and technical cooperation staff in post in foreign GPE ( in respect of which CARDINAL implementing decrees were promulgated on DATE ) provide :", "\u201c The civilian staff on whom the ORG calls to perform cultural , scientific or technical cooperation duties outside NORP territory at the service of foreign GPE , particularly by virtue of agreements between GPE and those GPE , shall be governed by the provisions of the present Law ... \u201d", "\u201c Without prejudice to the rules governing the exercise of judicial functions , the staff contemplated by the present PERSON shall serve , while performing their duties , under the authority of the Government of the foreign ORG or the body at whose service they have been placed , under conditions laid down by agreement between ORG and the foreign authorities concerned .", "They shall be required to maintain the propriety and discretion befitting persons performing their duties in the territory of a foreign ORG and inherent in the publicservice nature of the tasks they carry out ... They shall be forbidden to engage in any act or participate in any event which might be damaging to ORG , local public policy or the relations the NORP ORG maintains with foreign GPE .", "In the event of failure to respect the obligations contemplated in DATE , their turn of duty may be terminated immediately , without prior formalities , and without prejudice to any administrative proceedings that may be brought against them on their return to GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article GPE ) of LAW DATE instituting ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) provides for a derogation from the principle of freedom of movement for workers within the Community in respect of \u201c employment in the public service \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG of ORG has developed a restrictive interpretation of this derogation . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of GPE v. GPE ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON ) it decided that the derogation concerned only posts which involved direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the ORG or of other public authorities , and which thus presumed on the part of those occupying them the existence of a special relationship of allegiance to the ORG and reciprocity of rights and duties which formed the foundation of the bond of nationality .", "CARDINAL . ORG , to which LAW assigned responsibility for ensuring the correct application of Community rules , noted that a large number of posts likely to be caught by the derogation had in reality no bearing on the exercise of powers conferred by public law or protection of the general interests of the State .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a communication of DATE it set itself the task of listing separately those activities which are covered by the derogation and those which are not . It thus established CARDINAL distinct categories of activities according to whether or not they involved \u201c direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State \u201d . These categories were defined as follows :", "\u201c Exclusion of specific activities in the national public service [ from freedom of movement for workers ]", "On the basis of current ORG rulings , and bearing in mind the present conditions for establishing the single market , the ORG considers that the derogation in Article PERSON ) covers specific functions of the ORG and similar bodies such as the armed forces , the police and other forces for the maintenance of order , the judiciary , the tax authorities and the diplomatic corps . This derogation is also seen as covering posts in ORG , regional government authorities , local authorities and other similar bodies , central banks and other public bodies , where the duties of the post involve the exercise of ORG authority , such as the preparation of legal acts , the implementation of such acts , monitoring of their application and supervision of subordinate bodies ...", "Activities concerned by action in the public service sector", "The Commission considers that the functions involved in certain forms of public employment are for the most part sufficiently remote from the specific activities of the public service as defined by ORG that they would only in very rare cases be covered by the exception in Article PERSON ) of the LAW .", "The Commission proposes therefore to implement its action in the following areas by order of priority :", "\u2013 bodies responsible for administering commercial services ( e.g. public transport , electricity and gas supply , airline and shipping companies , posts and telecommunications , radio and television companies ) ,", "\u2013 public health care services ,", "\u2013 teaching in ORG educational establishments ,", "\u2013 research for non - military purposes in public establishments .", "Each of these activities also exists in the private sector , to which Article PERSON ) does not apply , or may be exercised in the public sector without the imposition of nationality requirements ... \u201d", "Where the second category is concerned , the ORG has left it open to ORG member GPE to try to show that the duties of a given post involve the specific activities of the public service ; this would , exceptionally , justify application of the derogation .", "CARDINAL . ORG has applied and developed these principles in a number of judgments . In its judgment of DATE in the case of ORG v. the GPE of GPE ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG I-CARDINAL ) , it held :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL ... in order to determine whether posts fall within the scope of Article PERSON ) of the LAW , it is necessary to consider whether or not the posts in question typify the specific activities of the public service in so far as it exercises powers conferred by public law and has responsibility for safeguarding the general interests of the ORG or of other public bodies . For that reason , the criterion for determining whether LAW is applicable must be functional and must take account of the nature of the tasks and responsibilities inherent in the post , in order to ensure that the effectiveness and scope of the provisions of the LAW on freedom of movement of workers and equal treatment of nationals of all Member GPE is not restricted by interpretations of the concept of public service which are based on domestic law alone and which would obstruct application of ORG rules ( judgment in Case ORG v. GPE [ DATE ] ECR CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "\u2026", "\u00a7 CARDINAL ... the generality of posts in the areas of research , health , inland transport , posts and telecommunications and in the water , gas and electricity supply services are remote from the specific activities of the public service because they do not involve direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law or duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the ORG or of other public authorities ( see , in particular , as regards the area of health , the judgment in Case ORG v. GPE , and , as regards research for civil purposes , the judgment in Case CARDINAL/CARDINAL Commission v. GPE [ DATE ] ECR CARDINAL ) .", "\u2026", "\u00a7 CARDINAL NORP ... the Court has already stated that the very strict conditions which posts must satisfy in order to come within the exception laid down in Article PERSON ) of the LAW are not fulfilled in the case of trainee teachers ( judgment in Case CARDINAL PERSON [ DATE ] ECR CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) , in the case of foreign - language assistants ( judgment in Case CARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON and PERSON [ DATE ] ECR CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) or in the case of secondary school teachers ( judgment in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "\u00a7 CARDINAL For the same reasons , the same applies to primary school teachers ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
