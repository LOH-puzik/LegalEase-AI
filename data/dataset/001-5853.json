THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , ORG and PERSON , are GPE nationals , born in DATE and DATE respectively and living in NORP , GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are Romany gypsies .", "DATE and DATE , they were tenants in conventional housing in ORG , in west GPE .", "On or about CARDINAL DATE , they took up residence on their own land to the north west of FAC , GPE , GPE , in CARDINAL caravans with their CARDINAL children .", "On DATE , the applicants lodged a retrospective planning application for the stationing of a residential caravan on their land . ORG ( \u201c the Council \u201d ) refused the application . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the ORG issued enforcement and stop notices .", "The applicants appealed against the refusal of planning permission and against the enforcement notices . Those appeals were dismissed on DATE . In his decision of that date , the Inspector who had held a public planning inquiry , found that the development eroded the very rural character of the area and harmed the environment . He extended the period of compliance from DATE to DATE noting that it would not be in the interests of the children to be uprooted from school within the usual DATE period .", "On DATE , the applicants pleaded guilty to the offence of failing to comply with the stop notice . The first applicant was fined MONEY ( GBP ) and ordered to pay costs of GBP CARDINAL . The second applicant was conditionally discharged . On appeal , the first applicant 's fine was reduced by ORG to GBP CARDINAL and the costs order quashed .", "On DATE , the applicants submitted a second application for planning permission , which was refused by the ORG .", "In DATE , the applicants enquired about housing with the ORG and homelessness application forms were sent to them . They were advised of a vacancy on ORG . This vacancy was again notified on DATE and on DATE a housing officer visited the applicants ' land and offered them the pitch on the PERSON site . The applicants refused . On the applicants ' evincing interest in housing options , the ORG offered to them on DATE a CARDINAL bedroomed property at Mangravet .", "On DATE , the applicants ' appeal against the refusal of planning permission was dismissed after a public Inquiry by ORG . The Inspector found the site constituted sporadic development in open countryside and was detrimental to the appearance of the rural area . He noted that the second applicant had been offered , but had declined , a site on a public site in the FAC district and was not satisfied that he would be led into breaking the law if planning permission was not granted .", "On DATE , the ORG issued proceedings in the High Court claiming an injunction , restraining the applicants , inter alia , from stationing caravans and continuing residential occupation on their land . An ex parte injunction was granted on DATE , restraining the applicants from stationing caravans on their land .", "On DATE , ORG adjourned the injunction proceedings . The ORG subsequently withdrew the proceedings .", "By letter dated DATE , the ORG informed the applicants that it was considering exercising its powers under section CARDINAL of ORG DATE . In DATE , the applicants enquired of the ORG as to the possibility of housing in NORP .", "On DATE , the applicants made a third application for planning permission which was refused in or DATE . The applicants appealed .", "On DATE , the ORG offered the applicants a CARDINAL bedroomed house in GPE . The applicants refused .", "On DATE , the ORG sent a letter to the applicants ' solicitors stating that the applicants had refused an offer of housing and that the ORG would proceed shortly to action under section CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG evicted the applicants from their land pursuant to their powers under section CARDINAL . They again offered the applicants the possibility of moving to the house in GPE . The applicants refused .", "Having nowhere else lawfully to station their caravans , the applicants moved their caravans onto the village green at NORP . This was an area of public amenity owned by ORG , including a childrens ' play area and equipment . Complaints were made by local residents inter alia concerning the coming and going of vehicles over the pavement and close to the childrens ' play area .", "On DATE , the ORG served the applicants with a direction under LAW of ORG LAW DATE . The applicants complied with the direction , removing themselves from the green . They stationed their caravans on the unmade roadway leading to the village hall , which was also land owned by ORG . A further direction was served under LAW on DATE . The applicants complied with the order and moved to a car park in the centre of the village owned by a local firm and used as the main village car park by shoppers and visitors to the village . On DATE , the site owners decided to close the car park for reasons of public safety . This caused problems of congestion and traffic difficulties . A third direction under LAW was served on the applicants on DATE , following which they moved to GPE . When a travelling circus arrived with permission to camp , the applicants left voluntarily and moved onto land adjoining LOC . The ORG received a complaint from the owner who said that he had not given permission . They took no action however as there were no issues of public safety involved . On DATE , complaints were received that the applicants had moved back onto FAC . On inspection the ORG found that there were CARDINAL other families with the applicants , and that CARDINAL caravans , CARDINAL transit vans , a pickup truck , a CARDINAL wheel drive vehicle and a horsebox were stationed on the land . On DATE , a direction under LAW was issued , forcing them to move on .", "They were prevented from returning to their land by another court injunction obtained by ORG on DATE .", "The applicants applied for leave to apply for judicial review of the ORG 's decision to take steps to secure compliance with the enforcement notices . Shortly before the hearing listed for DATE , the ORG offered to treat the applicants as being unintentionally homeless persons to whom they owed a duty under LAW DATE . The applicants were advised by their counsel and solicitors that there were minimal prospects of success in pursuing their application for judicial review and that ORG would cease to fund their application . In view of their lack of any viable alternative , the applicants reluctantly withdrew their application .", "The ORG offered the applicants a CARDINAL bedroom flat which was available . The applicants did not consider that this was suitable accommodation . The applicants went to live in their caravan in the small rear garden of a relatives 's house in GPE .", "On DATE and DATE , ORG held a public inquiry into the applicants ' outstanding application for planning permission for their land . He had visited the site and also the applicants ' present abode which he described as unsatisfactory for both the family and their neighbours although it allowed the children to continue with their schooling . The Inspector noted that the applicants ' land had highway access and that the development would not harm existing housing . While due to the hollow in the ground the development would be less obvious than on the previous site , he found that it would nonetheless form an intrusive feature and would harm the character of appearance of the rural landscape . He noted that the applicants had purchased the land encouraged by Government policy and that it was necessary , partly for health reasons , to find a more satisfactory location for the family . While he acknowledged that gypsies were a special case and sites for residence could be acceptable in some rural locations , he was not satisfied that their case was so overriding as to outweigh the development plan policy requirement to protect the countryside in this particular location . He dismissed the appeal .", "The applicants bought a house in NORP and are now resident there .", "ORG as amended by ORG DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG 's decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "Again there is a further right of appeal on a point of law to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector 's decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice , the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "New guidance on gypsy sites and planning , in the light of LAW , was issued to local authorities by the Government in Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( DATE ) .", "Councils were told that :", "\u201c In order to encourage private site provision , local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development . ... The aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves , to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control . \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "However :", "\u201c As with other planning applications , proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land - use factors . Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations , the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural , archaeological , countryside , environmental , and LOC policies . ... \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "It was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted , for example Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty or Sites of Special Scientific Interest . Nor were gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a Green Belt ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "Further guidance issued by the Secretary of ORG dated DATE concerned the unauthorised camping by gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land ( LOC above ) . Paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL required local authorities to adopt \u201c a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments \u201d :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which can not be effectively controlled , an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance . Accordingly , authorities should consider tolerating gypsies ' presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites , for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets , a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water . ...", "CARDINAL . Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government - owned land , it is for the local authority , with the agreement of the land - owning ORG , to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health . It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of ORG that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance .", "CARDINAL . The Secretaries of ORG continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly . They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land . \u201d", "Paragraphs CARDINAL further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under LAW . These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly - born children , the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson , NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE and NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE , unreported ) , ORG held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) gives to a local authority power to direct an unauthorised camper to move . An unauthorised camper is defined as", "\u201c a person for the time being residing in a vehicle on any land forming part of the highway , any other unoccupied land or any occupied land without the owner 's consent \u201d .", "Failure to comply with such a direction as soon as practicable , or re - entry upon the land within DATE , is a criminal offence . Local authorities are able to apply to a magistrates ' court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of such a direction ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
