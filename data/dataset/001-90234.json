The applicants , a married couple of NORP origin , were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s . They have CARDINAL children , who are now DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE they rented a flat in GPE , a suburb of GPE . Rule CARDINAL of the special provisions of the tenancy agreement stipulated the following :", "\u201c The tenant undertakes not to erect , without specific permission , placards , signs , sunblinds , outdoor aerials and such like on the house . \u201d", "The agreement further stipulated , as a general condition , that the tenants were obliged to take proper care of the flat and to maintain good sanitary conditions , order and good practice in the house .", "CARDINAL . It appears that when the applicants moved in , there was a satellite dish mounted on the fa\u00e7ade , next to CARDINAL of the windows of the flat . The applicants made use of this in order to receive television programmes in LANGUAGE and LANGUAGE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants ' landlord changed . The new landlord , a real - estate company , demanded that the satellite dish be dismantled . The applicants did not comply and , by letter of DATE , the company gave the applicants notice of termination of the tenancy agreement with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Further , in DATE , the landlord initiated proceedings before ORG ( hyresn\u00e4mnden ) in GPE against the applicants and some other tenants who had installed satellite dishes in the same house . The landlord sought execution of the notice of termination , claiming that the applicants ' satellite installation violated the express ban in LAW of the tenancy agreement and that , by not complying with the instruction to dismantle the dish , they had failed to maintain good sanitary conditions , order and good practice . Stating that it objected only to satellite dishes mounted on or outside the fa\u00e7ade of the house , while allowing , for instance , dishes placed on a balcony , the landlord claimed that the ban on such installations was of considerable importance as the installations a ) risked causing injuries to persons and property for which the landlord would be held responsible , b ) damaged the house physically and aesthetically and c ) obstructed rescue workers ' and the landlord 's access to the flat .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after having received the notice of termination , the applicants dismantled the satellite dish . However , in its place they installed a new device by placing on the kitchen floor an iron stand from which an arm , on which the satellite dish was mounted , extended through a small open window . The installation could be pulled back into the kitchen when not being used . At the request of ORG , an engineer , Mr S. Tornefelt , examined the installation on DATE . He found that it was very stable but recommended that , for safety reasons , a steel wire be fixed between the dish and the stand . The applicants made the recommended addition .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , as well as the other tenants summoned , contested the landlord 's claims before ORG . They stated that , by mounting satellite dishes for the reception of television programmes , some of which were broadcast in their mother tongues , they were exercising their freedom to receive information , as protected by LAW , LAW and ORG law . The landlord 's interests , as provided for in LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ( Jordabalken ) , had to be balanced against this freedom . The applicants further claimed that they had now complied with the landlord 's demand that the earlier satellite installation be dismantled . The new installation was , they claimed , in conformity with the rules of the tenancy agreement . Referring to PERSON opinion , they further maintained that it was safe and did not damage the house .", "The landlord submitted , in addition to what it had previously stated , that it was working on the possibility of installing broadband and internet access in the house , which would allegedly give access to the desired television channels .", "CARDINAL . Following an inspection of the applicants ' satellite installation , ORG gave a decision on DATE finding in their favour . ORG noted in general that the assessment of whether tenants had failed to comply with their obligations by mounting satellite dishes had to involve the balancing of the interests of the landlord \u2013 which could be more or less strong depending on how the actual installations had been made DATE and the interests of the tenants in using a satellite dish \u2013 which could also vary depending on whether there were alternative means of receiving the television channels in question . In the applicants ' case , ORG found that the fact that the new satellite installation extended through a window did not involve a breach of LAW of the tenancy agreement . With regard to the general obligation to maintain good sanitary conditions , order and good practice in the house , ORG considered that the actual installation did not and could not damage the house . Moreover , the landlord 's liability for damage to persons and property could not reasonably be incurred unless it were able to prevent the mounting and use of the satellite dish , which was not the case if the ORG found that the landlord had no right to such prevention . Moreover , having regard to Mr PERSON 's opinion and its own inspection , ORG considered that the risk of damage caused by the installation was negligible . Nor could it not find any evidence that the installation would obstruct rescue workers ' access to the flat . The only inconvenience for the landlord was the aesthetic aspect . However , the applicants ' interest in being able to watch television programmes that were not accessible by other available means weighed more heavily , and the satellite installation could not therefore be considered as contrary to good sanitary conditions , order and good practice .", "CARDINAL . NORP The landlord appealed to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) . The court held an oral hearing at which , inter alia , Mr PERSON gave evidence . It also made an inspection of the applicants ' satellite installation . By a final decision of DATE , the court found that the applicants had disregarded their obligations as tenants , under the tenancy agreement and LAW , LAW , to such a degree that the agreement should not be extended , pursuant to LAW , section DATE , subsection CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW . They were given a respite until DATE to move from the flat . The court found that the landlord had made a reasonable distinction between acceptable and unacceptable satellite installations and had submitted weighty reasons for prohibiting dishes mounted on the fa\u00e7ade or otherwise extending outside of it . It noted that the evidence showed that the applicants ' dish was virtually always positioned outside the kitchen window and thus constituted a permanent installation , and concluded , contrary to the findings of ORG , that its placement breached Rule CARDINAL of the tenancy agreement . In assessing the seriousness of this breach of contract , the court first concluded , with reference to PERSON PERSON 's testimony , that the satellite installation met the reasonable requirements of stability and safety . However , noting that the landlord 's main reason for not allowing the installation was the safety aspect , the court considered that the landlord was entitled to make general risk assessments and should not have to determine whether an individual installation was unsafe or inconvenient . It went on to state that , while the applicants ' interest in receiving the broadcasts of the television channels in question had to be taken into consideration and that it was desirable that technical solutions for such reception be found , the right to freedom of information relied on did not have such a bearing on the case that it could be considered to have any real importance . It noted , finally , that the applicants had been fully aware of the importance that the landlord attached to the issue of the placement of satellite dishes and of the consequences that could follow from a refusal to comply with the landlord 's instructions in this respect . Although their satellite installation did not pose any real safety threat , their interests could not be allowed to override the weighty and reasonable interest of the landlord that order and good custom be upheld .", "CARDINAL . NORP The landlord offered the applicants the option of staying in their flat if they agreed to remove the satellite dish . They did not agree to do this , however , and instead moved on DATE . They have stated that , largely because of the scarcity of flats for rent in the GPE area but also due to there being a court eviction order against them , they were forced to move to FAC , QUANTITY west of GPE . As a consequence , the first applicant now had much longer and costlier trips to and from work and the applicants ' CARDINAL children had had to change nursery and school and leave friends .", "CARDINAL . The renting of a flat is regulated primarily in LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides that a tenancy agreement shall be in writing if the landlord or the tenant so request . In the event that a provision in the agreement is difficult to interpret , it is in practice ultimately interpreted to the disadvantage of the person who formulated the agreement . As it is almost always the landlord who draws up the tenancy agreement , the landlord has to take the responsibility for an agreement that is difficult to interpret . In most cases , landlords use standard agreements , the content of which is the result of negotiations between rental market organisations .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL contains provisions for the term and cancellation of tenancies . A tenancy agreement which is applicable for an indefinite period , as in the present case , must be cancelled for it to cease to apply . According to section CARDINAL , an indefinite tenancy agreement can be cancelled and thus cease to apply on DATE following DATE notice . LAW provides that , in a case such as the present , a notice of cancellation shall be in writing and comply with certain rules governing service .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that a tenant may not use the flat for a purpose other than that intended .

Further , the tenant is liable to make good all damage caused by his or her carelessness or negligence .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL contains provisions on disturbances and demands on the tenant for keeping the flat sound , orderly and in good condition . Subsection CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c When using the flat , the tenant shall ensure that persons living in the vicinity are not subjected to disturbances which may be harmful to their health or otherwise impair their dwelling environment to an extent not reasonably tolerable ... . In his use of the flat , the tenant shall also in other respects do all that is necessary to keep the property sound , orderly and in good condition . ... \u201d", "Disturbances and failure to meet those requirements may result in the tenancy agreement being forfeited under section DATE .", "Special provisions and regulations can be included in the tenancy agreement . A tenant 's refusal to abide by such provisions and regulations may also constitute a failure to fulfil the requirements for keeping the flat sound , orderly and in good condition .", "CARDINAL . It follows from section DATE that if the landlord has given notice of cancellation of the tenancy agreement , the tenant may still be entitled to have the agreement extended . However , subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL lists a number of situations in which the tenant loses the right to renewal . The first situation , laid down in subsection DATE ) , is the forfeiture of the tenancy . LAW stipulates the conditions in which a tenancy agreement is deemed to be forfeited , including residential disturbances and failure to keep the flat sound , orderly and in good condition . The second situation , regulated in subsection CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , was relied on by the landlord and applied by ORG in the present case . It concerns the tenant 's neglect of their obligations . If the obligations are neglected to such an extent that it is not reasonable for the tenancy agreement to be extended , the tenant may lose the right to such renewal .", "The preparatory works to the latter provision state that the requirements of orderliness must be high in order to make it possible for the landlord to maintain the property in good order and condition ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) . The interests of the landlord shall be weighed against the reasonableness of the tenancy being terminated . Distressing personal circumstances may be taken into account . The possibility of another flat in the same area should also be considered ( Government PERSON , LAW , p. CARDINAL ) .", "Examples of negligence are , for example , failure to pay rent , subletting without permission , refusing to grant the landlord access to the flat , depositing rent without valid reasons , residential disturbances , a failure to keep the flat sound , orderly and in good condition , and a breach of clauses in the tenancy agreement .", "CARDINAL . A large number of tenancy disputes are examined by the CARDINAL regional rent review boards , whose task it is , under section CARDINAL of ORG ( Lagen om arrenden\u00e4mnder och hyresn\u00e4mnder , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , to examine disputes concerning , for example , the terms of a tenancy and disputes relating to the renewal of a tenancy agreement .
