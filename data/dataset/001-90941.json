The first and second applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were co - founders of and shareholders in a private media company ( \u201c the media company \u201d ) which owned the television channel \u201c TV CARDINAL \u201d ( \u201c the channel \u201d ) , broadcasting in GPE . The first applicant , as an anchorman of the popular talk show \u201c FAC ( Debates ) , often addressed politically sensitive issues .", "CARDINAL . Under a service agreement of DATE , the media company undertook to air several documentary films made by \u201c ORG Reporter \u201d , a private film - production company ( \u201c the production company \u201d ) . Consequently , in DATE , the latter started working on a documentary concerning certain business activities of PERSON , a parliamentarian from the presidential political party ( \u201c the ruling party \u201d ) , which held at that time the majority of seats in ORG . The object of the documentary was to expose PERSON allegedly illegal commercial activities . According to the Government , except for the applicants , nobody within the media company knew about the making of the compromising film .", "CARDINAL . After PERSON had tried in vain to persuade the journalists of the production company to drop the project , he contacted the first applicant . From DATE the parliamentarian placed numerous telephone calls , asking PERSON to block the film . Eventually , they agreed to meet and discuss the issue .", "CARDINAL . During their first meeting , which took place in TIME of CARDINAL DATE , an agreement was reached whereby the first applicant would not allow the airing of the film on his channel in exchange for MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . Immediately after this meeting , Mr B. complained to the Minister of the ORG that the first applicant had been blackmailing him . He reported to the authorities that , in the event of the compromising film being aired , it could have disastrous consequences not only for him personally but also for the image of the ruling party .", "CARDINAL . DATE , ORG initiated criminal proceedings on suspicion of extortion for the purpose of gaining vast profits . DATE , PERSON met the first applicant again . They agreed that the latter would accept the sum in CARDINAL instalments : ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In TIME CARDINAL DATE , PERSON informed the prosecution service that he would hand over the first instalment to the first applicant TIME . The MONEY notes were consequently processed with invisible chemicals and marked with a special pencil , while their serial numbers were recorded by the investigation authorities . ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) issued a ruling , dated DATE , at TIME , authorising the secret videoing of the meeting without a court order , due to \u201c urgent necessity \u201d . The camera was hidden on the parliamentarian \u2019s person .", "CARDINAL . The meeting during which PERSON handed over the money to the first applicant took place on DATE at TIME , in the apartment of a mutual friend of theirs . It was also attended by the second applicant . The conversation and the handing over of the money were videoed secretly ( \u201c the video recording of CARDINAL DATE \u201d ) by the parliamentarian . When the applicants left the meeting and got into the second applicant \u2019s car , they were arrested and searched . ORG and the car in which the money was found were seized . On DATE the ORG legalised the secret video recording .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr B. was recognised by the investigation as a victim and both applicants were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion . They pleaded \u201c not guilty \u201d and refused to testify at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the prosecutor \u2019s motions and remanded the applicants in custody for DATE . The order noted that the collected evidence \u2013 the parliamentarian \u2019s statements , the results of the on - the - spot search of the applicants , the seized materials and the video recording of CARDINAL DATE substantiated the suspicion that the applicants had committed the offence with which they had been charged . The court dismissed the prosecutor \u2019s argument that the applicants might abscond in view of the gravity of the charge as unsubstantiated . However , it endorsed the fear that they could interfere with the establishment of the truth by exerting pressure on those witnesses who were under their hierarchical authority in the media company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against this decision , complaining that their detention was not lawful within the meaning of LAW , since the prosecution had failed to prove the reasonableness of the imposition of such a measure . They complained in particular that , apart from the parliamentarian \u2019s statements , the prosecution had not submitted any other evidence substantiating the suspicion that a crime had been committed . Further , they alleged that , contrary to LAW , they had been detained not for the purpose of bringing them before the competent legal authority but in order to silence their television channel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator issued a ruling , incorporating as evidence into the criminal case file the seized GPE dollar notes , the second applicant \u2019s car and the traces of chemicals found there , as well as the applicants\u2019 fingerprints and some other results of their search and arrest on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG dismissed the ORG appeal at an oral hearing . The case file contained photographs of that hearing showing that the applicants had been kept in a barred dock , surrounded by several guards . The photographs further showed that the court room was extremely overcrowded ( for a detailed description of the hearing , see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision of DATE endorsed the reasoning of the lower court concerning the ORG managerial positions in the media company as a ground supporting the risk that they might influence the witnesses . It reiterated that the collected evidence DATE the parliamentarian \u2019s statements , the results of the on - the - spot search of the applicants , etc . \u2013 suggested \u201c with a high degree of probability \u201d that the applicants had committed the crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator incorporated the video recording of CARDINAL DATE and its verbatim transcript as evidence into the criminal case file . On DATE the investigator presented the transcript to the applicants . Calling its authenticity into question , the applicants requested leave to watch the recording .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator informed the applicants in writing that the preliminary investigation had been terminated . On DATE the case materials were presented to the applicants in prison . However , because at that time no appropriate equipment had been provided , it was only on DATE and DATE that the applicants , in the presence of their advocates , watched the video recording of CARDINAL DATE for the first time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor sent the criminal case , along with the bill of indictment of DATE , to ORG for trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the DATE pre - trial detention period expired without the court ordering its extension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a complaint with ORG , demanding their immediate release . They claimed that they had been deprived of their liberty in breach of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and LAW , since no judicial decision had authorised their detention since DATE . No immediate response from the court was forthcoming .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the administration of GPE No . FAC , where the first applicant was provisionally detained , transferred the latter from his ordinary cell to the punishment cell ( karceri ) , which measured QUANTITY and was intended for solitary confinement , as a disciplinary punishment for using a mobile telephone , the latter incident occurring for the first time . According to the first applicant , in NORP times , this type of cell was used for the confinement of those on death row . There was another person sharing the cell with the applicant ( \u201c the second inmate \u201c ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants were taken to the admissibility hearing before ORG . ORG decided to commit the applicants for trial under LAW ORG . In addition , it rejected their motion of DATE to be released or to have their detention pending trial replaced by a more lenient measure of restraint , ruling in the following terms :", "\u201c The defence incorrectly alleges a violation of the Convention as regards the fact that , after the DATE detention period expired , [ the applicants ] were not immediately brought before a court . [ In fact ] the criminal procedural law does not require that , once the case is referred to the court for a hearing on the merits , any procedural decision be taken on the measure of restraint applied to the accused . According to the ORG , the [ national ] court ought to decide on a case within a reasonable period of time . \u2018 Reasonable period of time\u2019 is defined by Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) CARDINAL of the ORG as follows . \u2018 In the course of the hearing of a criminal case by a ORG , the period of detention must not exceed DATE from the date on which the case is sent to the court.\u2019 Consequently , the [ applicants\u2019 ] detention pending trial has not exceeded its legal term . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the operative part of the decision of DATE , it was noted that there was no appeal possible .", "CARDINAL . The case file contained photographs showing that the applicants had been kept in a barred dock during the hearing of DATE and that there had been security guards armed with machine guns and wearing hoodlike black masks in the court room .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , some toxic smoke ( later explained by the authorities to have been caused by the burning of a mattress in the adjacent cell , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) leaked into the first applicant \u2019s punishment cell . Owing to the lack of ventilation , the smoke filled the cell quickly , causing the applicant and the second inmate to suffer from smoke inhalation , an inability to breathe and eye watering . According to the first applicant , they shouted and knocked on the door for TIME before the prison guard opened the door and let both inmates out until the smoke was gone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was returned from the punishment cell to his ordinary cell .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant , also provisionally detained in GPE No . FAC , was moved from his CARDINAL - bed cell , with CARDINAL inmates in it , to another cell with QUANTITY beds , where QUANTITY prisoners were kept . The inmates were obliged to take turns to sleep .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant filed a complaint with both the ORG and ORG ( \u201c the MJ \u201d ) , the authority in charge of the penitentiary system , challenging the conditions in the punishment cell and the lawfulness of his confinement there . According to the complaint , the punishment cell had no window or ventilation and was extremely damp . Tap water ran non - stop and noisily TIME a day . A narrow pipe in the corner , located QUANTITY away from the bed , was designated as a toilet . It was so narrow that it was difficult for the inmates to pass urine and excrement straight into the hole ; there was no partition separating \u201c the toilet \u201d from the rest of the cell and a stench hung in the air all the time . CARDINAL inmate could not avoid seeing what the other was doing . The cell was infested with cockroaches and rats occasionally ran through it . The only bed , infested with vermin , was not wide enough to accommodate CARDINAL persons .", "CARDINAL . In such conditions , the first applicant claimed that he had not been able either to have any normal sleep or to eat properly . During the whole period of his confinement in the punishment cell , he was never let out for a walk or other physical exercise . He alleged that he was never visited by a doctor or provided with any other care .", "CARDINAL . From DATE hearings were held almost daily . In the hearing rooms , the applicants were always kept in the same conditions as those on DATE : being displayed to the public in the barred dock , in the presence of hooded guards with machineguns .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE , the second applicant announced that he had been continuously deprived of necessary medical care and of drinking water in prison . He declared that he intended to begin a hunger strike . The judge did not respond . Shortly afterwards , CARDINAL more inmates were placed in the second applicant \u2019s already overcrowded CARDINALbed cell , increasing the total number of prisoners there to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the first applicant that it had taken note of his complaint of DATE . It also advised him that , according to ORG , the conditions in the punishment cell fully complied with \u201c international standards \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the prosecution had finalised its submissions before the court , the applicants requested , on the basis of LAW of the ORG , that their detention pending trial be replaced by a more lenient measure of restraint in view of newly discovered circumstances . In that connection the applicants referred to the fact that none of the witnesses questioned by the prosecution appeared to be under their hierarchical authority , but were rather co - founders of the media company . ORG dismissed that request on DATE . The judge acknowledged that this fact was indeed \u201c a newly - discovered circumstance ... \u201d , but ruled that it was \u201c not a significant new circumstance which could justify revision of the imposed restraint measure \u201d . The judge went on to say , \u201c This is especially true since the accused have not yet presented their submissions and have not been examined ; nor has the collected evidence been assessed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants then challenged the judge for bias , questioning her impartiality , but this challenge was dismissed as unsubstantiated by the same judge of ORG that DATE . An appeal against both decisions of DATE lay only in connection with an appeal against the final verdict .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , convicting them of conspiracy to commit extortion , sentenced the first applicant to CARDINAL and the second applicant to DATE in prison . On DATE the ORG upheld the verdict .", "CARDINAL . After conviction the applicants were transferred from GPE No . ORG to Rustavi No . ORG . They challenged the appellate decision of DATE in ORG . The case file did not contain information on any further developments in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the first applicant that on DATE it had opened a criminal case with regard to his complaint of DATE concerning his confinement in the punishment cell but , after a preliminary investigation , had decided on DATE to close it as no elements of a crime had been disclosed .", "CARDINAL . The ORG decision of DATE noted that the first applicant \u2019s transfer to the punishment cell had been , under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) of ORG , a lawful disciplinary punishment for the use of a mobile telephone , such an act representing a grave violation of detention rules . Based on the statements of the administrative staff of GPE No . FAC , as well as the prison doctor and the second inmate , the decision stated that the first applicant had been visited by the doctor DATE and offered food identical to that provided in the ordinary cells . It noted however that , according to the first applicant \u2019s statements , he had refused to consume the food due to the unsanitary conditions in the punishment cell . As to the fire incident created by the inmate in the adjacent cell on DATE , the ORG , relying on witness testimonies , stated that the first applicant had immediately been taken out of his cell until the smoke was gone and that there had been no danger to his life .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted TIME of the interview with the second inmate on CARDINAL DATE . The latter specifically mentioned that the food in the punishment cell had been of a satisfactory quality and that , in any case , he and the first applicant had had ample supplies because of their relatives\u2019 food parcels , which they had brought with them from their ordinary cells .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the examination of the punishment cell carried out by an investigative commission on DATE , the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE further stated that the cell had been equipped with an appropriate system of \u201c air filtration \u201d and inside artificial lighting , and that there had been a toilet , partitioned by a special wall from the rest of the cell .", "CARDINAL . According to TIME of the punishment cell inspection of DATE , submitted by the Government , it was conducted without the first applicant or his advocates\u2019 participation . They further disclosed that the punishment cell had been located in the basement of GPE No . CARDINAL prison , its length and width being QUANTITY by QUANTITY , and the bed had been QUANTITY wide . As to the toilet , it consisted of a hole in the ground and CARDINAL cemented bricks for placing the feet . There was no sink , and the water tap was set just above the toilet hole . The only source of lighting was an electric bulb . According to the minutes of the inspection and the attached plan of the cell , there was no window with access to daylight .", "CARDINAL . With due regard to the above findings , the ORG decided on CARDINAL DATE that the prison officials had not exceeded or abused their powers when transferring the first applicant to the punishment cell .", "DATE . On DATE the first applicant filed a complaint against this decision , claiming that the investigation had not been effective or objective . He complained that , whilst he had filed his complaint on DATE , the ORG had opened proceedings DATE on DATE . This lapse of time , in his view , had been more than sufficient for the prison administration to renovate the cell completely with a view to hiding the appalling conditions in which he had been held . In this regard , he challenged the ORG \u2019s failure to enquire as to when exactly the ventilation , lighting and the toilet partition had been installed in the punishment cell . The first applicant further complained that the ORG had inexplicably disregarded his assertions that none of the above - mentioned conditions had existed during his confinement and had arbitrarily endorsed those of the prison staff who , being potential suspects in the case , could not be said to have been impartial witnesses . He challenged the fact that , despite his statement that he had never been provided with medical care , the ORG had trusted the statements of the prison doctor , another potential suspect , without having examined any other source of information ( i.e. the relevant prison logbook of medical visits ) . He further claimed that the second inmate , being under the complete control of the authorities who were wellknown for abuses in prisons , might easily have been threatened or forced to make false statements . Finally , the first applicant complained that he and his advocates had learnt about the initiation of the criminal proceedings against the prison administration only after they were terminated on DATE . Consequently , they had not been given a chance to participate in the investigation so as to ensure its objectivity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant \u2019s complaint of DATE was dismissed by ORG . In reply to his complaint that the criminal proceedings had commenced DATE after his complaint of DATE had been lodged , the decision noted that \u201c the case materials do not support the suspicion that the cell has been renovated since the proceedings were opened on DATE . \u201d It further stated that the ORG had duly assessed the ORG statements , including those of the prison staff and the first applicant , and that nothing in the case file suggested that the second inmate might have been forced to testify against the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE was adopted without an oral hearing and pronounced in absentia .", "CARDINAL . As part of their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application , the ORG submitted a video recording of the proceedings concerning the ORG appeal against their detention on remand held at ORG on DATE . The applicants replied that this recording did not include the scenes of greatest turmoil and had been considerably edited to portray a more favourable image of the hearing , excluding , for example , images of armed men inside the court room . They agreed however that this recording should be accepted and relied on as a source of information about the hearing . The applicants additionally provided annotations to some of the scenes .", "CARDINAL . The opening scenes of the ORG \u2019s recording showed an overcrowded court room before the start of the hearing . A large number of media personnel and cameras on tripods were situated in the middle of the room . The dock was a metal cage with a barred ceiling , located at the far end and separated from the rest of the court room . The audience was comprised of civilians , with a large number of women most of whom could be identified as the ORG supporters . However , there were CARDINAL men in plain clothes who were undercover police agents , according to the applicants . Moreover , many of those men were openly identified as agents by the ORG supporters on the spot . The supporters engaged in heated argument with several men in plain clothes , complaining about the lack of space and the ORG \u2019s inability to provide a larger court room for the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL uniformed guards and several men in plain clothes escorted the handcuffed applicants into the court room . When the judge was seated , the crowd was still pressing into the room . The entrance door was blocked by the plain - clothes men from inside , while several hooded and armed guards could be seen forcing the door closed from the outside . The judge requested the people in the room to calm down . The judge specifically reproached the media representatives for their disorderly behaviour .", "CARDINAL . The general noise level in the court room remained unabated even after the hearing was declared open . The judge offered the applicants the possibility of conducting the hearing in camera but they refused . Loud male voices could be heard in the court room bitterly arguing and uttering vulgar curses . The body language of the judge betrayed resignation and frustration , as he was unable to establish order .", "CARDINAL . When the advocates spoke they were dazzled by camera flashes and halogen camera lights of the journalists . During their speech there were continual interruptions by the judge and the public , and relentless banging on the entrance door from the outside , as well as the sound of construction works nearby . Now and then mobile telephones rang and persons conducted conversations . Communication between the defence , the prosecution and the judge , constantly hampered by the unsolicited interruptions of journalists , was made possible by repeatedly requesting other people to move aside or sit down on the floor . The temperature in the court room was high , judging by the sweat on people \u2019s faces . The persons presumed to be undercover agents , and some court personnel , could be seen constantly entering and leaving the judge \u2019s deliberation room .", "CARDINAL . In order to see what was happening , respond to the judge or be heard , the applicants had to stand on the chair in the barred dock , hanging on to the metal side bars , and shout . They repeatedly asked the judge and the prosecutors to speak louder as they could not hear them . When answering CARDINAL of the judge \u2019s questions , the first applicant , hanging on the bars and grimacing as if to emphasise by body language his resentment at the situation , made the following remark :", "\u201c ... The Government might have something against me ... this I can [ more or less understand] ... but [ I can not ] understand why it is necessary to detain [ the second applicant ] ... [ unless , ] of course , the Government wish to fill up the prisons [ cixeebi]! ... [Well , ] I have been there [ in the prison ] ; unimaginable things happen there! ... There is no need for [ the second applicant] ... no place for him to be with me , here , in this cage ! [ galiaSi] ... This is my declaration ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . The immediate proximity of the prosecutor to the judge presented no obstacle of audibility for them . The dialogue of questions and answers between judge and prosecutor was unaffected . Several persons alleged to be undercover agents in plain clothes were shown behind the prosecutor and investigator .", "CARDINAL . There were episodes when the prosecutor refused to reply to the second applicant\u2019 ridiculous question ... go and ask the parliamentarian about that ! \u201d , and the question was then dismissed by the judge .", "CARDINAL . In another episode , when the second applicant asked , \u201c Could you , please , indicate the page and the paragraph in the case materials which prove that the parliamentarian ... has testified against me ? \u201d , the prosecutor started laughing in reply and answered in a sarcastic tone , \u201c Which case materials ? ! Which page ? ! Which paragraph ? ! \u201d and then murmured \u201c This man is not sane ... \u201d The judge intervened and rephrased the question as follows , \u201c Do the parliamentarian \u2019s testimonies incriminate [ the second applicant ] ? \u201d The prosecutor \u2019s \u201c yes \u201d was endorsed by the judge as a reply to the question .", "CARDINAL . In some episodes , when the applicants or their advocates asked questions which perplexed the prosecutor , the judge either directly replied instead ( i.e. by locating the necessary pieces of evidence in the case file ) or rephrased the questions in a leading manner , thereby suggesting a suitable answer for the prosecutor . Thus , CARDINAL of the advocates asked the prosecutor why it was necessary to impose detention on remand for DATE , when there were CARDINAL witnesses who remained to be examined . As the prosecutor was unable to answer , the judge interrupted with , \u201c [ Because ] the criminal procedural legislation does not envisage the imposition of detention for a lesser term \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As the judge retired for deliberations , the public were ushered out of the court room by the guards and plain - clothes men . After the deliberations , the room contained many fewer people than before . The composition of the public had changed to an almost all - male audience , avoiding the camera by ostentatiously turning their backs towards it and the judge . As the judge read the decision , the plain - clothes men stood next to him . Strangers constantly entered and left the judge \u2019s deliberation room . There were brief glimpses of CARDINAL or CARDINAL guards wearing black hood - like masks inside the court room in front of the closed door .", "CARDINAL . The closing scenes briefly showed the large number of presumably undercover plain - clothes agents leaving the court room , not hiding their irritation when filmed . A few of the applicant \u2019s supporters , readmitted to the room after the deliberations , complained that the agents had occupied almost all of the seats . They asked the cameraman to film the presence of the agents . The first applicant then stated , \u201c Look , there they are ... the agents ( TanamSromlebi ) ! \u201d and pointed to the plain - clothes men . The following remarks could be heard : \u201c Their presence was overwhelming ! ... More agents than family or friends ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the last scene , a hooded , armed man inside the court room nodded to the cameraman , apparently requesting the latter to stop recording .", "CARDINAL . The case file also contained a video recording , submitted by the applicants , showing how CARDINAL plain - clothes men , identified in the ORG \u2019s video as undercover agents , attending the hearing of DATE , left ORG through the same back door exit as the handcuffed applicants . The agents were shown being greeted with familiarity in the backyard by the special security forces waiting for the applicants . Some of the undercover agents were filmed changing from their civil clothes into police jackets . The applicants were escorted from the courthouse in the presence of a great number of guards carrying machine guns and wearing black , hood - like masks .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the second applicant informed ORG his early release from prison on the basis of a Presidential pardon of CARDINAL DATE . He maintained his intention to pursue the ORG proceedings .", "LAW of the person , respect for human dignity ... \u201d", "\u201c In the course of an investigative or judicial action , it is prohibited to exert upon a person physical or psychological pressure ... or to subject a detained person to conditions that encroach upon his or her human dignity . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .
