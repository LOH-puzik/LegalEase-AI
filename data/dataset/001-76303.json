THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 5-1;Violation of Art. 5-2;Not necessary to examine Art. 14;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant fled GPE and arrived at FAC on DATE . On arrival at the immigration desk he spoke to an immigration officer and claimed asylum . He was granted \u201c temporary admission \u201d by the immigration officer and was asked to return to the airport at TIME the following morning . TIME the applicant was permitted to stay at a hotel of his choice . On TIME he reported as required and was again granted temporary admission until DATE , DATE at TIME . When the applicant again reported as required he was ( for the third time ) granted temporary admission until DATE , DATE at TIME . Again the applicant reported as required . On this occasion the applicant was detained and transferred to FAC ( \u201c FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was given the opportunity to consult with legal representatives . The representative telephoned the Chief Immigration Officer on DATE , and was told that the reason for the detention was that the applicant was an NORP who met the criteria to be detained at GPE . On DATE , the applicant was interviewed by an official of the Secretary of ORG for ORG [ \u201c SSHD \u201d ] in relation to his claim . When his asylum claim was refused on DATE he was formally refused leave to enter the GPE . The applicant submitted a notice of appeal against the asylum refusal and was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the subsequent asylum proceedings , the applicant \u2019s appeal was allowed by an adjudicator on DATE on the ground that ORG had failed to specify how the applicant could be returned to the autonomous region of GPE . The SSHD \u2019s appeal to ORG was allowed on DATE , and the case was remitted to an adjudicator . On DATE the adjudicator found that the applicant was a refugee within the meaning of the CARDINAL Refugee Convention , and also that there was a real risk that his return to GPE would expose him to treatment contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . The applicant was subsequently granted asylum .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , together with CARDINAL other NORP detainees who had been held at GPE , applied for permission for judicial review of their detention , claiming that it was unlawful under domestic law and under LAW .", "CARDINAL . At first instance , Mr Justice PERSON did not consider the detention to be unlawful under domestic law , essentially because he was not prepared to imply into the legislative provisions a requirement that the exercise of the power to detain had to be \u201c necessary \u201d for the purpose of carrying out an examination of an asylum claim . He did , however , find that the detention was not compatible with LAW ( f ) of the LAW on the basis that once an applicant had made a proper application for asylum and there was no risk that he would abscond or otherwise misbehave , it could not be said that he needed to be detained \u201c to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry \u201d . He also considered detention disproportionate because it could not be shown that it was reasonably necessary to the stated purpose for the detention which was the speedy examination of the asylum claim .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the reasons given for the detention , Mr Justice PERSON noted that it apparently took ORG DATE to realise that the wording of the form handed to detainees was not appropriate , and on DATE and again on DATE the form was under revision . As from DATE ( DATE , according to the Government ) , a form of words was available which stated", "\u201c Reason for Detention", "I have decided that you should be detained because I am satisfied that your application may be decided quickly using the fast track procedures established at FAC . In reaching this decision I have taken into account that , on initial consideration , it appears that your application may be one which can be decided quickly \u201d .", "CARDINAL . That form of words was not available at the time the applicant was detained , and PERSON regarded it as a \u201c disgrace \u201d that the form lagged behind the policy . He continued :", "\u201c The form [ in use at the time ] clearly indicated that detention was only used where there was no reasonable alternative . All the reasons and factors reflect some possible misconduct by the detainee or the need for him to be cared for by detention ... it was wholly inappropriate for ORG detention and it is , for example , difficult to follow what reason could conceivably have been close to fitting [ the applicant \u2019s ] case . Unfortunately , the copy of the [ form ] which should have been retained on the file has disappeared and so I do not know , nor does [ the applicant ] why it was said that he should be detained . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The shortcomings as to the reasons for detention did not affect the lawfulness of the detention .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the SSHD \u2019s appeal on DATE , and ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . Both ORG and ORG held that the detention was lawful under domestic law . In connection with LAW ( f ) , and by reference to the case of PERSON ( PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions PERSON ) , they each held that the detention was for the purpose of deciding whether to authorise entry and that the detention did not have to be \u201c necessary \u201d to be compatible with the provision . The detention was therefore \u201c to prevent ... unauthorised entry \u201d , and in addition was not disproportionate , Lord PERSON holding :", "\u201c The need for highly structured and tightly managed arrangements , which would be disrupted by late or non - attendance of the applicant for interview , is apparent . On the other side applicants not living at ORG , but living where they chose , would inevitably suffer considerable inconvenience if they had to be available at short notice and continuously in order to answer questions .... Getting a speedy decision is in the interest not only of the applicants but of those increasingly in the queue . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Immigration Act DATE provides for the administrative detention of those subject to immigration control \u201c pending examination and pending a decision whether to give or refuse ... leave to enter \u201d ( Schedule CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) . Temporary admission is used as an alternative to detention . It is a form of licensed consent to enter GPE which may be subjected to conditions , including reporting requirements and restrictions on the person \u2019s residence , employment or occupation ( Schedule CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In general ( that is , in cases other than those involving FAC ) , the LOC \u2019s guidance requires an individual assessment of the need to detain to prevent absconding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON MP , Minister of State at ORG , announced a change in detention policy specifically and exclusively related to the new FAC . GPE asylum applicants could be detained where it appeared that their application was capable of being decided \u2018 quickly\u2019 , including those which may be certified as being \u2018 manifestly unfounded\u2019 . To assist immigration officers , lists of nationalities \u2013 and categories within nationalities - were drawn up in respect of which consideration at ORG could be justified because they were expected to be simple to deal with . It was said that ORG would strengthen the ability of ORG to deal quickly with asylum applications .", "CARDINAL . Further guidance was issued in the Operational Enforcement Manual in respect of individuals who were said to be unsuitable for ORG detention . Cases in which detention at ORG would not be suitable included the following :", "- any case which did not appear to be one in which a quick decision could be reached or in which there were complicating factors ;", "- unaccompanied minor asylum seekers ;", "- cases in which there was a dispute as to age ;", "- disabled applicants ;", "- persons with special medical needs ;", "- cases involving disputes as to nationality ; and", "- cases where the asylum seeker was violent or uncooperative .", "CARDINAL . NORP In addition , all persons believed to be at risk of absconding ( from GPE ) were not deemed suitable for detention at GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Oakington Reception Centre has high perimeter fences , locked gates and TIME security guards . The site is large , with space for outdoor recreation and general association and on - site legal advice is available . There is a canteen , a library , a medical centre , social visits room and a religious observance room . The following description was used in the present case :", "\u201c All of the normal facilities provided within an immigration detention centre are available \u2013 restaurant , medical centre , social visits room , religious observance and recreation . The practical operation and facilities at ORG are , however , very different from other detention centres . In particular , there is a relaxed regime with minimal physical security , reflecting the fact that the purpose is to consider and decide applications . The site itself is very open with a large area for outdoor recreation and general association or personal space . Applicants and their dependents are free to move about the site although , in the interests of privacy and safety , there are CARDINAL areas where only females and families may go . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The \u2018 House Rules\u2019 for ORG require , inter alia , that detainees must vacate or return to their room when required ; that mail may be required to be opened in front of officers ; that detainees must eat at set times and that visits can only be received at particular times . Further , detainees must carry identification at all times ( to be shown to officers on request ) ; must obey all staff and attend roll - calls .
