They wished to live with both parents . Given the ORG young age , and in the absence of information that the applicant was not performing her maternal duties properly , the service stated that residing with the applicant would not be against the children \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s husband PERSON then lodged a counterclaim , asking the court to make a residence order in his favour .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then asked the court to grant a temporary protective measure \u2013 for the girls to temporarily reside with her until the case was decided on the merits . She submitted that the girls had no citizenship . Given the level of conflict between her and ORG , she feared that he might take the girls to GPE with him and she would then face obstacles in securing their return .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC allowed the applicant \u2019s request for a temporary protective measure . The girls were thus to stay with the applicant until the end of the custody proceedings .

On DATE the Marijampol\u0117 service provided the court with conclusions indicating that the girls would not clearly state who they would like to live with . The father had suitable accommodation in which to raise them . The service concluded that the interests of the girls , \u201c as future women ( kaip b\u016bsimoms moterims ) \u201d would be better met if they lived together with the mother .

The applicant noted that the older daughter attended school in LOC , but she had not been seen at school as of DATE . He went to the apartment which the applicant had been renting in LOC , but found the doors locked . PERSON considered that the applicant abused her parental rights , obstructed him to communicate with his daughters even by telephone , and did not guarantee the girl \u2019s right to attend school . ORG suspected that the applicant could have taken their daughters to GPE . He asked the GPE service to investigate the situation and promised his full cooperation .", "In reply , on DATE the GPE service noted that since DATE the applicant had been living with her daughters in GPE .

The officer telephoned the applicant and asked her to come and take the girls . She replied that she had already contacted a bailiff and would not be going to pick them up herself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a further application for protective measures , asking ORG to restrict her husband \u2019s right to see his daughters .", "CARDINAL . ORG then deemed it necessary to ask both the GPE and LOC services to provide information , and decided to hold an oral hearing to better establish whether any circumstances had evolved .", "The PERSON service provided conclusions on DATE , stating that by agreement of the parents the girls had met their father on DATE , but he had not yet returned them . Their colleagues , child care specialists from the Marijampol\u0117 service , had visited the girls at their father \u2019s home . The girls explained that they liked and wished to be there ; their interests or rights had not been compromised . The GPE service also noted that , in accordance with LAW , a child who could express his or her views had to be heard and have his or her wishes taken into account , unless they were against his or her interests . For the PERSON child care specialists , it was desirable to have an order in place setting out how the girls could have contact with their father pending the proceedings .", "On DATE the Marijampol\u0117 service informed the court in writing that DATE they had visited ORG \u2019s apartment twice , without prior notification , on CARDINAL and DATE . The girls had communicated with their father naturally and without tension . There was no reason to believe that they were physically or emotionally unsafe at their father \u2019s home . PERSON explained that on DATE he took the girls on common agreement with the applicant . TIME , when he wished to return their daughters , the applicant could not be reached on her telephone . The applicant therefore took the girls to LOC . The service considered that the applicant \u2019s suggestions that PERSON could kidnap the girls and take them to GPE were unfounded . The service also noted that it was unclear why the applicant would not call her daughters by telephone or come to LOC and contact the service so that they could go and visit the girls together ( a point remade in its separate letter to the applicant of the same date ) . The service also stressed that the manner in which both PERSON and the applicant chose to resolve their conflict DATE which , due to their complaints , required the girls to communicate with child care specialists and police officers \u2013 negatively affected the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant declared her place of residence as GPE .", "DATE the GPE and LOC services exchanged a number of letters with the applicant , replying to various requests for information and assistance . It was noted , inter alia , that she had been asked to visit the Marijampol\u0117 service to resolve the matter of the ORG return and to go to ORG \u2019s home with police officers to take the girls , but she had declined to do so . The child care specialists also noted having visited PERSON \u2019s home , where the girls had been found . PERSON had explained to the child care specialists that his daughters did not wish to go to their mother \u2019s and that he did not want to take them there by force . The Marijampol\u0117 service enquired with the applicant why she herself had not been calling her daughters and had not applied to the service for assistance in meeting them . For the child care specialists , the manner in which the applicant chose to solve her dispute with ORG negatively affected the ORG psychological well - being , because they had to communicate with various authorities often . The applicant was also informed that it was the bailiff who was competent to enforce court decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC decided the temporary protective measures application in the presence of the applicant , PERSON , their lawyers and a child care specialist . Upon the recommendation of the latter , and given that the court hearing on the merits of the action was scheduled for DATE , when deciding on the temporary protective measure the court also deemed it appropriate not to hear the children , to avoid causing them even more stress .", "The court acknowledged that when the applicant had allowed her husband to see their daughters for TIME on DATE , he had not returned them to her home . It urged the parents to arrange the return of the girls to their mother and to reach an agreement on how ORG would contact them until the final court decision in the divorce and custody proceedings . However , each parent had their own conflicting opinions , which only served to worsen the strained relations between them . The court noted that both parents had the right to raise their children and have contact with them , and there was no information to suggest that ORG \u2019s communication with his daughters would cause them harm . Nor was there any information that the applicant was failing in her duties as a mother . Accordingly , pursuant to LAW , which required the courts to aim to protect the interests and rights of minors ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and taking into account the earlier court rulings that the girls should temporarily reside with the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court ordered PERSON to return his daughters to their mother . Should he fail to do so , the applicant could contact a bailiff , who would then take the girls and their documents and hand them over to the applicant . Until the end of the divorce and custody proceedings , the applicant \u2019s husband was granted contact with his daughters DATE from DATE TIME until TIME , when he could collect them from the applicant \u2019s place of residence and spend time with them . He was forbidden only from travelling outside GPE with them .", "On DATE , that is on DATE the applicant was explained by the Marijampol\u0117 service that execution of court rulings belonged to the exclusive competence of a bailiff . DATE the court ruling became final and thus enforceable . Pursuant to the applicant \u2019s request of DATE , the following day ORG issued her a writ of execution , which the applicant then transmitted to the bailiff on CARDINAL DATE ( also see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant asked that PERSON be fined for non - compliance with a court order requiring him to hand the children over . She also asked the court to prohibit him from seeing his daughters . In turn , PERSON asked that they remain with him , arguing that they refused to live with their mother . The Marijampol\u0117 service informed the court that from DATE the girls started attending school in GPE , and that situation had been caused by ORG \u2019s refusal to hand them over to the applicant . In DATE , on the recommendation of the Marijampol\u0117 service , CARDINAL of its psychologists saw the girls twice . She observed that they were attached to their father and had a good emotional connection with him . They also stated that they wished to stay with their father . The psychologist could not assess the emotional connection they had with their mother , because she could not be contacted . On DATE the Kaunas service informed the court in writing that because the girls did not live in GPE , it there were grounds for limiting PERSON \u2019s paternal rights , in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , following complaints by the applicant alleging inactivity on the part of both the GPE and LOC services , on DATE the PERSON for ORG ( PERSON teisi\u0173 apsaugos kontrolierius \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the PERSON \u201d ) issued a report . It noted that the relationship between the parents had broken down and that the applicant herself had been hostile . The report established that she instigated conflict , involved different ORG and municipal institutions in solving her relationship problems with her husband and gave little importance to her own personal responsibility , efforts and benevolence in looking for solutions in the best interests of her daughters . The report also indicated that she had applied to child care services and the police , submitted requests for assistance in taking the children , but as soon as they had provided her with opportunities she had refused them . It was recommended that she solve the questions of the ORG place of residence and contact by mutual agreement with the father , and in the children \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing with the applicant , PERSON , their lawyers and representatives of the Marijampol\u0117 and GPE services . Over DATE that followed CARDINAL more hearings were held and the girls were questioned by the judge in the absence of their parents and their lawyers . CARDINAL of the girls testified that she wished to live with her father . The other testified that she missed her mother and wished that both parents lived together . She also stated that she otherwise preferred living with her father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s request that the girls reside with him , and the applicant \u2019s request to forbid him from seeing them . The decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . The courts acknowledged that ORG had not avoided his duties as a father , but it had not been established that he could provide better living conditions for the girls or raise them better . Moreover , the ORG place of residence had already been decided by an earlier court ruling and it was not in their best interests to change that place DATE . The girls were not yet mature enough for their wishes alone to suffice to change their place of temporary residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the principal of the school the girls had been attending in GPE since DATE informed the child care authorities that the applicant had been visiting the girls at school and communicating with them , their teachers , the school administration and social workers on a regular basis . On CARDINAL occasion a social worker observed CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s meetings with the girls . They had talked to their mother warmly and sincerely , and had stated that they wished to live with both parents . The principal noted having been asked by PERSON to restrict the ORG contact with the applicant , but he had not acceded to that request because he considered that the girls should see and communicate with both parents .", "On DATE , in reply to letters from the applicant asking for information about her daughters\u2019 achievements at school and requesting that it arrange a meeting with her daughters on school premises , the principal informed the applicant that the school had always been open for parents . He noted having urged the applicant since DATE to come to school as often as possible , and to communicate with her daughters and their teachers . However , \u2018 the applicant had not heard that message ( deja , GPE \u0161ito raginimo nei\u0161girdote)\u2019 . The principal stressed that the school was ready to help the applicant in every possible way if she showed initiative to see her daughters ; no prior notification for her coming to school was necessary . For the school principal , the applicant \u2019s pleas were particularly odd , because it was only because of her that the girls were not fully fledged members of the school as they were not on the list of pupils . The applicant was well aware of that but had not made any effort to settle the matter . The principal concluded that if the applicant was serious about her daughters\u2019 future , he wanted her to think seriously and solve the problems which depended solely upon her .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE FAC held CARDINAL oral hearings , in which the applicant , PERSON , their lawyers and representatives of child care services participated . The court granted a request by the applicant for a psychological assessment of the girls ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , had regard to letters from the institutions where the girls attended after - school activities , and questioned the principal and psychologist of the school .", "CARDINAL . At a court hearing on DATE the principal testified to having admitted the girls to the school at ORG \u2019s request and in the ORG best interests , and that they came to school ready for lessons and well - presented . They were well taken care of , felt well at school and wished to study there . The principal also stated that the applicant could have come to school and taken the girls with her at any time . However , the applicant came to school very seldom ; the last time he had seen her there was in DATE .", "The school psychologist testified that she had told both parents that they could ask her for psychological assistance , but neither parent had followed up with such a request . Without parental agreement or a referral by child care specialists , no psychological assistance could be provided . The psychologist also testified that the ORG teachers had not contacted her with any particular concerns about the ORG well - being .", "CARDINAL . In DATE experts from ORG ( Vaik\u0173 ir paaugli\u0173 teismo psichiatrijos skyrius ) examined the girls . The experts found in respect of both girls that it was not possible to establish which parent \u2019s place of residence would best meet the ORG interests , because equal communication with both parents , who were important to the girls , was important to them both . When observed with their father , the girls were positive , active and laughed a lot . Both ORG connection with their father was \u201c positive , warm and strong \u201d . Their relationship with the mother was ambivalent and their feelings were torn ( dominuoja prie\u0161taringi ( ir teigiami , ir neigiami ) jausmai ) . Even so , there was no doubt that the mother was an important person for the girls . Having regard to the ORG age , maturity and psychological particularities , they were not yet able to formulate and express their own opinions and views as regards which parent they should live with . The ORG wish to live with their father was determined by objective factors , namely them living with him for DATE and communication with their mother being insufficient . Unnatural hostility towards the mother had only traumatised them and parental alienation syndrome , enhanced by their father \u2019s influence , could be seen in their behaviour . Lastly , both girls were attached to each other , and separating them would be traumatic .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant declared her place of residence as GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to hear the case in her absence . She maintained all her civil claims . Moreover , in the applicant \u2019s words , \u201c the forensic expertise having been performed , [ paragraph CARDINAL above ] I consider that all the evidence in the case has been collected and examined , and that the case should be terminated immediately , and I therefore ask for it to be terminated in my absence because I am ill . \u201d The applicant agreed to her lawyer representing her interests from that point forward .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing with the applicant \u2019s lawyer , PERSON , his lawyer , and the child care authorities . During the hearing it came to light that the applicant had declared her place of residence as GPE , where she was expecting a child with another man . According to ORG \u2019s lawyer , those circumstances were relevant when deciding the ORG place of residence , especially given the applicant \u2019s initial accusation of the girls being taken to GPE by their father ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court deemed it appropriate to postpone the hearing , so that the applicant could be questioned .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer provided the court with a medicate certificate issued in GPE , about her client being at risk of premature birth if she experienced physical or psychological stress . The lawyer asked the court to hear the case without her client present , or to suspend the proceedings , until after the applicant had given birth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held an oral hearing without the applicant , but in the presence of her lawyer . She confirmed that her client had declared her place of residence as GPE , the father of her future child being a NORP national , but that she intended to return to GPE to live in GPE immediately after giving birth in GPE . The lawyer also confirmed that the applicant had not communicated with the girls during DATE .", "ORG \u2019s lawyer regretted that the applicant could not be questioned at the hearing .", "Relying on the forensic experts\u2019 conclusions about parental alienation syndrome , heightened by ORG \u2019s attitude towards the applicant , the PERSON service noted that it would be more in the ORG interests to reside with their mother . It did not see the applicant \u2019s pregnancy as a factor to be taken into account when deciding the ORG place of residence . The service confirmed that the future child \u2019s father was a NORP citizen , which suggested that the applicant would live in GPE . Even so , PERSON was a NORP citizen but lived in GPE . The GPE service also noted that the applicant had approached them for a referral to psychologists so that she could find contact with her daughters easier . A referral was given to her and , as far as the GPE service was aware , the applicant had visited the psychologists for assistance . The service was of the view that the applicant had tried to establish contact with her daughters , but had been unsuccessful . She had probably not visited them at school for a while to avoid traumatising them .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing the Marijampol\u0117 service representative noted that it had known the girls and their family history since DATE , when disagreements between the applicant and PERSON had started . The girls really thought clearly and their minds had developed in accordance with their ages . The representative thought that the ORG behaviour had been conditioned by their mother \u2019s actions as she did not visit them often at school or show interest in their lives , and therefore no emotional connection between them had been formed . The girls had been heard by the court DATE , where they had expressed their wishes ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) \u2013 the court had to remember that moment and have regard to the ORG opinion . Indeed , in DATE ORG had reproached GPE for not always hearing and paying attention to the child \u2019s opinion ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The representative noted that no one could ignore the fact that it was not known where the applicant , who was currently in GPE , was about to live . It was submitted that the GPE conclusions were contradictory ( yra prie\u0161taringos ) . The conclusions noted that ORG was important to the girls ; they had a warm , positive and stable relationship with him . When communicating with their father , the girls felt safe and were actively involved in shared activities . They could easily approach their father , hug him and tell him about their achievements at school , where they took prized places in mathematics competitions . The child care specialist emphasised that a child who was psychologically distressed could not have such achievements at school .", "The Marijampol\u0117 service underlined that the circumstances had changed and thus it would always inform the court that it would provide the last conclusion during the last court hearing . Having communicated with the school , the school administration and the teachers , the Marijampol\u0117 service was finally persuaded that it was better for the girls to stay in that environment , to attend school and have friends ; at home they were also receiving all that was necessary . The applicant , however , did not approach the girls after certain court decisions but first ran to the institutions or called the police , thus traumatising the girls a lot . In the words of the child care specialist , the applicant had not attempted to first meet with the girls or establish contact with them , and had not put in any effort herself . It was odd that a mother would go without seeing her daughters for DATE and not ask if they were prepared for school .", "The Marijampol\u0117 service thus submitted that , in the light of the above considerations , ORG could take care of the girls the best and provide them what they needed . To pull the girls out of the environment they were familiar with and where they had spent most of their time would cause them significant psychological harm . The girls could always choose to tell to their father later that they wish to live with their mother . At the end the Marijampol\u0117 service representative noted that , in her view , the child care specialists from Marijampol\u0117 had observed the girls more than the representatives from the PERSON service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took a decision on the merits of the divorce and custody case . It observed that there was no information in the file to suggest that either parent was failing in their duties to raise their daughters or that their behaviour was immoral . Even so , they had not always acted with the children \u2019s best interests in mind , because during the court proceedings neither parent had attempted to find a compromise as regards their daughters\u2019 place of residence or their contact with them . The court emphasised that the children had to grow up in a safe environment they were used to . However , even though by a court order of CARDINAL DATE the girls were to reside with their mother , the actual situation was that since DATE they had been residing with their father . The girls themselves had expressed the wish to stay with him . The first - instance court thus held that although the father could have had some influence over the ORG choice as to who they preferred to live with , it was not decisive . The girls had thus already stated on DATE that they preferred living with their father ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It was the court \u2019s view that such a short time ( DATE ) between those CARDINAL dates was not sufficient for the ORG father to influence his daughters . It was thus clear that there was already then tension between the girls and their mother .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG noted that even though the applicant had declared her place of residence as GPE , since DATE she was also registered as living in GPE . For the court , the question where the father or mother would live with the children was irrelevant in any event because the girls spoke NORP ; they had previously lived in GPE and thus could adjust to living there easily . What was essential when deciding the question of the ORG residence was to ascertain who the children were more attached to , and which parent devoted more attention to their interests . The children \u2019s wishes as to where to live could be disregarded only if they were against their interests . Given that there was nothing to suggest that either parent was neglecting their parental duties , the ORG deemed it most suitable to take into account the ORG wish to live with their father .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court also ordered the applicant to pay the ORG father maintenance ( CARDINAL ( ORG ) for each daughter per month ) and set in place a contact order for the applicant to see her daughters . Even though both parents asked to see the children DATE and during DATE , in accordance with LAW the court considered ex officio that such a time - frame would be too restrictive for the applicant to be able to build up contact with her daughters . A wider contact order , allowing the applicant contact not only during DATE but also ORG holidays and certain DATE during DATE was set in place . The court stressed to both parents their obligation to take care of the children and above all be an example to them .", "The court also divorced the applicant and her husband .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the first - instance court \u2019s decision . She contested the decision about the ORG place of residence . Without explicitly asking that a hearing be held , she asked for a re - examination of the evidence and witnesses to be called and questioned .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL March DATE , the applicant also asked ORG to admit in evidence letters postmarked DATE and DATE she had sent to her daughters in GPE from GPE , which had been returned to her in the post . The applicant claimed that ORG had thus interfered with her right to be in contact with her children . She relied on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE made in written proceedings , ORG left the lower court \u2019s decision unchanged . The court noted at the outset that pursuant to ORG and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , appeals had to be heard in written proceedings unless the court deemed an oral hearing indispensable . As regards the applicant \u2019s request to have witnesses questioned , the court established that the applicant had not specified in her appeal what new circumstances essential for the case the requested witnesses could confirm , some of them having already been questioned at first instance . Nor had she explained why she had not submitted the request to the first - instance court . The court concluded that an oral hearing was not necessary , because the applicant had had the opportunity to point out all the circumstances necessary for an examination of the case to the first - instance court and also in her appeal .", "The appellate court also refused to admit documents related to the applicant \u2019s correspondence with her daughters . According to it , those pieces of evidence had not been analysed in the first - instance court , which was a general requirement for evidence to be admitted in an appeal , or lodged with it .", "CARDINAL . As to the ORG place of residence , ORG dismissed as unfounded the applicant \u2019s plea that the first - instance court did not properly examine the evidence , which included the explanations by the child care authorities , ORG reports , witness testimony and the PERSON \u2019s conclusions . On this last point the court observed the PERSON \u2019s conclusion of CARDINAL DATE stating that the applicant was conflictive and involved various authorities in her and PERSON \u2019s conflict , without giving importance to her own responsibility and good - will in finding the best solutions for the children . It also observed that the first - instance court had examined the forensic expert reports about the ORG psychological state , where it was noted that they both wished to stay with their father . In addition , psychologists from the ORG school and the school principal were questioned . The applicant \u2019s lawyer herself admitted agreeing with the forensic expert reports , and did not ask for another expert examination to be conducted .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that it was in the best interests of the children to stay with their father , who they had lived with since DATE . On that point it was also paramount that during the first - instance court hearing the girls had confirmed their wish to live with him . A fact on which the applicant had relied , that ORG had prior convictions in GPE for sexual and drug - related offences committed in DATE and DATE did not have much significance for the case , because the convictions had expired in DATE . The applicant , for her part , had a criminal conviction in GPE for forgery of document and a criminal investigation against her for fraud had been terminated . What mattered was that she had left GPE for GPE ; she had CARDINAL addresses \u2013 in GPE , PERSON and in GPE , which she had indicated as places where she lived , which suggested that she in fact had no habitual place of residence . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s contact with the girls was merely episodic , whereas the ORG father took proper care of them and actively participated in raising them . The girls lived with their father , attended school and had suitable living conditions . The evidence as a whole allowed for the conclusion that there was a close connection between the girls and their father . There was no evidence in the case file to the effect that ORG abused his parental rights , and it was for the applicant to prove the opposite , which she had not done . Moreover , under LAW on the Rights of the Child , a child had the right to be heard in all matters affecting him , which had been done in the present case . The appellate court also observed that in accordance with LAW , both parents had equal rights and obligations towards their children . Accordingly , and contrary to the applicant \u2019s suggestion that she was closer to the girls because of their gender , the gender of a parent could not be a factor which determined who a child should reside with .", "CARDINAL . As to temporary protective measures , ORG observed that , as a rule , they were aimed at guaranteeing compliance with a future court decision . Accordingly , the first - instance court , when adopting a decision after examining merits of the case , was not bound by earlier decisions on temporary protective measures .", "CARDINAL . Following a complaint by the applicant , on DATE the PERSON issued a report dismissing allegations by the applicant about the partiality of the Marijampol\u0117 service because of its failure to provide her with information and consultations . The PERSON relied on the ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) , where it did not find a violation of LAW , having found that irrespective of obstructions by the applicant \u2019s former husband , the applicant \u2019s own lack of understanding of the need for careful preparation as a precondition to effective enforcement of her custody rights played a significant role in the events . In the instant case , attempts had been made more than once to hand the children over to the applicant and meetings had been organised with psychologists , child care specialists and representatives of educational institutions as to enforcement of the court decisions to transfer the children . Moreover , the PERSON had already examined the Marijampol\u0117 service \u2019s work in DATE , and did not find that it did not take action to help the applicant to have contact with her children . The service also correctly placed the responsibility for the well - being of the children on both parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the principal of the ORG school in Marijampol\u0117 issued a note stating that during DATE the applicant had not visited the school . She did not come to school on DATE either .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON dismissed the applicant \u2019s repeated complaint accusing the Marijampol\u0117 service of failing in its duties to provide assistance and organise contact with the children . The PERSON established that even though the contact order between the mother and the girls had been set in place DATE CARDINAL DATE by ORG , she had not yet tried to make use of it . Furthermore , the Marijampol\u0117 service had asked the applicant \u2019s lawyers to meet at its LOC , offered to inform PERSON of that meeting and asked the applicant \u2019s lawyers for that purpose to choose a suitable date , but the applicant had not responded . For its part , the PERSON service had also invited the applicant for a conversation so that she could express her wishes and preferences as to her contact with the girls , and so that the service could assist her . It was only when the applicant had not shown up that the PERSON child care specialists had suggested to her lawyers that she communicate with the girls by letters via the PERSON child care specialists . It had also been indicated to the applicant that she had the opportunity to directly communicate with her daughters in the presence of a psychologist , and that could be discussed with the Marijampol\u0117 service . The ORG school in Marijampol\u0117 had also informed the PERSON that the applicant had started communicating with the girls by letters since DATE ; DATE and DATE CARDINAL letters from her had been received , though the girls had refused to accept the last one . The school had thus suggested that the applicant choose another means of communicating with her daughters and asked the child care specialists to provide facilities for that purpose . Given the child care authorities and the school \u2019s suggestions for the applicant to communicate with her daughters directly ( tiesiogiai ) , which the applicant had disregarded , it was not clear to the PERSON why the applicant preferred to communicate with her daughters by letters . On this point the PERSON pointed out that under LAW parents who lived separately had the right and an obligation to communicate with their children and be involved in their upbringing ; children , for their part , had a right to regular and direct contact with both parents , irrespective of their place of residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . Without arguing that the appellate court \u2019s decisions not to summon witnesses for examination and not to hold a hearing had affected the outcome of the litigation , she primarily challenged the lower courts\u2019 assessment of the evidence , insisting that they had erred in concluding that living with their father was in the best interests of the children . She also asserted that ORG \u2019s previous convictions in GPE for crimes of sexual violence and drug - related offences were significantly weightier in terms of his moral values than her conviction in GPE for forgery of documents . The applicant was further dissatisfied with the appellate court \u2019s refusal to admit in evidence documents related to her correspondence with her daughters , which she obtained after she had already lodged her appeal .", "In his written reply , PERSON argued that the lower courts had properly examined the entirety of the evidence . He submitted that the applicant had always known about his earlier convictions in GPE ; however , they had expired a long time ago . It was unfair for her to bring up that issue now . PERSON also observed that the proceedings had been pending for DATE . During that period the applicant had specified her claims and submitted requests to the court on CARDINAL occasion . ORG acceptance to re - examine the evidence and question witnesses would have only delayed the proceedings . Given that the applicant had not asked for an oral hearing , the appellate court \u2019s decision to pursue proceedings in writing had been reasonable .", "CARDINAL . In a final ruling of DATE , adopted in written proceedings , ORG observed that the child \u2019s interests were the primary consideration when examining custody cases . The cassation court also relied on the ORG \u2019s judgment in ORG and GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) , which said that an in - depth examination of the entire family situation was necessary to achieve the best result for the child . For ORG , such a result had been achieved in the present case . The lower courts had analysed the level of attachment to each parent and established that the girls , who lived with the father , were fond of him . Those courts had also noted ORG reports that the girls could entirely independently form their own opinion about which parent to live with , and had held that the children \u2019s opinion was CARDINAL of the criteria when evaluating the entirety of evidence , and the girls had expressed such a wish during the court hearing . Even though the fact that the girls lived with their father could influence their formation of a negative opinion about their mother , it had not been established that the mother was barred from communicating with them ; to be interested in their lives and visit them at school could thus form a positive opinion about her and make their emotional bond stronger . The first - instance court had also issued a contact order and thus the applicant \u2019s contact rights with her daughters had not been restricted . Even though the applicant had stated that she lived in GPE , the evidence showed that she had declared place of residence as GPE , where she had taken part in court proceedings so that the name of her third child could be registered . As to ORG \u2019s convictions in GPE , those offences had been committed in DATE and DATE and his convictions had expired a long time ago . There was no proof that he could have a negative impact on the girls . On the contrary , the girls studied well at school and took part in extracurricular activities . It followed that the courts had been correct in not giving particular weight to those convictions . Overall , it was thus in the best interests of the girls to stay with their father .", "Lastly , whilst noting that when refusing to admit in evidence new documents submitted by the applicant the appellate court had not explained whether they were relevant to the merits of the case , ORG held that this did not affect the overall lawfulness of the appellate court \u2019s ruling .", "CARDINAL . After FAC decision of DATE stating that the girls should reside with the applicant became final , and following the applicant \u2019s request of CARDINAL DATE transmitting her the writ of execution , the bailiff took measures to enforce it ( also see paragraph CARDINAL in fine ) . Meetings were organised with the child care specialists , representatives of the ORG school and psychologists . Both parents were involved in that process .", "CARDINAL . The first attempt to hand the girls over at their school in DATE failed because on DATE the girls fell ill and did not go to school . The court then established that their absence was proved by medical certificates , and the court order for transfer did not specify where it would take place . Accordingly , the father could not be blamed for an unsuccessful transfer .", "CARDINAL . The next attempt to transfer the girls was made in DATE , when it was decided that the girls would be handed over at their home . This attempt did not produce results because on that date the applicant was arrested on charges of forgery of documents .", "CARDINAL . The third attempt to hand over the girls was at their father \u2019s home in DATE . It failed because , even though the bailiff , child care specialists , police and both parents were present , neither girl wished to leave with their mother . During the transfer the applicant asked to be left alone in the room with the girls , and her wish was granted . However , even after that the girls expressed a clear wish not to leave with her . In the report about that attempted transfer the bailiff underlined that the transfer of a child could not be equated to the transfer of an object . Taking into account the clearly expressed wishes of the children , and to avoid psychological trauma and to protect the children \u2019s interests , physical force could not be used in that situation . The child care authorities supported this argument . The bailiff \u2019s recommendation , based on LAW , was that the manner of enforcing the court order for transfer should be changed to preserve the children \u2019s interests . The bailiff \u2019s letter specified that her findings could be appealed against to FAC . The bailiff then also asked FAC to examine how the court order for the ORG transfer should be enforced without compromising their interests .", "CARDINAL . Eventually , by a decision of DATE the bailiff discontinued the enforcement proceedings , because it had been decided that the girls should reside with their father ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE in separate criminal proceedings , a court found ORG guilty of failing to comply with the court order of DATE . He was fined approximately ORG CARDINAL ( CARDINAL NORP litai ) . The court however dismissed a civil claim by the applicant for non - pecuniary damage , noting that the girls themselves had refused to go and reside with their mother . The court also noted that no evidence had been provided to prove the applicant \u2019s contention that the children \u2019s refusal to be handed over to their mother had been a direct consequence of ORG \u2019s actions .", "CARDINAL . Alleging that the ORG father had had a negative influence on their daughters , and relying on the ORG reports about parental alienation syndrome ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE the applicant asked the prosecutor to start criminal proceedings in respect of PERSON for abusing his rights and duties as a parent ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the prosecutor refused to initiate a pre - trial investigation . He noted that earlier that LOC child care specialists had visited PERSON \u2019s home and the girls had eagerly communicated with them , without their father present . The girls felt comfortable and at ease ; they had no demands . They had also explained that the applicant did not visit them or call . The prosecutor established that ORG had not committed any unlawful acts in respect of his daughters . By a decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL , ORG upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
