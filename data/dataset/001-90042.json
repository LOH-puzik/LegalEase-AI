The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is currently employed on a temporary basis at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE he made CARDINAL applications for appointment in different sections of the civil service . On DATE and DATE both of his applications were refused by ORG on the ground that he had not performed his military service or been legally exempted from it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a judicial review application before ORG challenging the relevant decisions of ORG . He contended , inter alia , that he had refused to perform his military service with ORG as he was a homosexual and that for the determination of his sexual orientation he would have been subjected to degrading treatment contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its interim decision of CARDINAL DATE the court rejected an application for amendment of the applicant \u2019s pleadings . It noted that whether or not the applicant was entitled to be exempted from military service was not a contested issue in the pending proceedings and , as such , could not be examined . The issue under dispute in the proceedings before the court was the lawfulness of the decision by ORG dismissing the applicant \u2019s application for lack of fulfilment of the requirement of completion of military service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the judicial review application and made an order for costs against the applicant . It justified the rejection by referring to the reasons set out in its previous interim decision and , in particular , that the applicant did not meet one of the basic requirements for appointment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal before ORG against its first - instance judgment . The grounds of appeal had been drafted by the applicant \u2019s representative . On DATE the applicant filed his skeleton argument which had also been prepared by his representative . The appeal was set for a hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Until that stage of the proceedings , the applicant was being represented by a lawyer of his choice , but due to his inability to settle outstanding legal fees he had to stop receiving legal assistance from his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he filed an application for legal aid claiming that the proceedings concerned the protection of his human rights and thus fell within the scope of proceedings for which the grant of legal aid was envisaged by LAW ( I ) of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , his application for legal aid was rejected by ORG , acting in a panel of CARDINAL judges , which referred to the relevant provisions of LAW and explained that legal aid could only be provided in criminal proceedings , civil proceedings that concern determination of a litigant \u2019s human rights and proceedings lodged before the family courts . The proceedings introduced by the applicant , who sought judicial review under LAW of a decision refusing to appoint him in the civil service , did not constitute civil proceedings and , as such , his legal aid application had to be refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court referred to the arguments developed by the applicant \u2019s lawyer in the proceedings . It found that the issue of unconstitutionality had not been raised by the applicant \u2019s lawyer in accordance with the requirements set out in the relevant procedural provisions and case - law given that it had only been set out in a vague and imprecise manner in the application seeking judicial review . The court further took into account the points raised by the applicant \u2019s lawyer in his written address to the ORG . It found that the vague suggestions made concerning unconstitutionality had no legal foundation and were irrelevant to the subject - matter of the judicial review application . No other ground for annulment of the relevant decision had been raised or shown .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of GPE provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
