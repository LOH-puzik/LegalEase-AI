On DATE the court found against the applicant . With reference to the conclusions of the medical expert examiners , the court established that the applicant \u2019s diseases had no causal link to his vaccination .

The only disease that could be associated with the vaccination was urticaria ( commonly known as hives ) , which the applicant had suffered from DATE after the vaccination and which could not therefore have had any causal link to it . The court also established that the applicant had not had any acute symptoms of any disease upon vaccination and therefore that his vaccination had not violated any medical rules . Furthermore , the epidemic situation in the GPE region had called for his vaccination against diphtheria . The court noted that no physical force had been applied to the applicant and that , being an adult of sound mind , he could have refused to have the vaccination , as he had done before on several occasions . The court noted that although the vaccination had not been performed in the vaccination room as required by the regulations , it had been conducted by a qualified nurse in a doctor \u2019s office , in a doctor \u2019s presence , with prior verification of the applicant \u2019s reaction to such a vaccination , and it had not caused the applicant to have any negative side - effects . The court also noted that the applicant \u2019s allegations about the quality of vaccine had been speculative and had not been confirmed by any evidence . The court observed that none of the applicant \u2019s diseases had had a causal link to the vaccination and that the applicant had spent so much time in hospital because he had been attempting to obtain disabled status .
