TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection joined to merits and dismissed (Article 34 - Victim);Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Reasonable time);Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression -{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Paul Lemmens;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Robert Spano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a professional writer and journalist , and states that he is a human rights activist .", "CARDINAL . He published an article on the front page of issue CARDINAL of the DATE magazine T\u00fcrkiye\u2019de PERSON ( \u201c DATE in GPE \u201d ) , which came out on DATE . His article , which was entitled \u201c If the pashas [ the generals ] refuse to obey \u201d , contained criticisms of high - ranking officers who were about to retire . He hinted that some generals in the armed forces were wo nt to sound false alarms concerning an alleged advance of fundamentalism and anti - secularism , which they then used as a pretext for interfering in the country \u2019s general politics , and that they appeared to have links with certain business circles , the media , senior civil servants and even the ORG , endeavouring to create a political atmosphere that tallied with their worldview . He suggested that the high - ranking officers in question should set up a political party on retirement and present their political projects to the people , instead of \u201c deciding on the future of the nation on their own , in the name of the nation \u201d . He added that in his view the army generals who he claimed were interfering in the country \u2019s general politics were far removed from social realities and that in their approach to social affairs they lacked any empathy with and sensitivity towards the various social strata .", "CARDINAL . By an indictment of DATE , ORG with ORG in GPE applied to ORG within that ORG for the applicant \u2019s prosecution under LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , which , in the ORG \u2019s view , penalised acts vis - \u00e0 - vis high - ranking military officers geared to damaging hierarchical relations within the army and undermining confidence in commanding officers .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted an objection as to the jurisdiction of ORG to try him , on the grounds of his civilian status and relying on the LAW and his right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declined jurisdiction in favour of ORG on the grounds that the offence at issue was not military in nature and the applicant should be tried by the non - military courts for denigration of the ORG armed forces , which offence was punishable under LAW . ORG noted that by claiming that the armed forces were led by commanding officers who appeared to have links with certain business circles and even the ORG , and to be far removed from social realities , the applicant had tarnished the image of the whole armed forces . It emphasised that the commanding officers who had been criticised were plenipotentiary representatives of the armed forces empowered to act on behalf of the latter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the commanding officer of ORG lodged an appeal on points of law against the aforementioned decision to decline jurisdiction . He submitted that the impugned article constituted an act which had to be assessed under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . He argued that the military criminal provision in question constituted a lex specialis vis - \u00e0 - vis LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Military Prosecutor also lodged an appeal on points of law on the same grounds , submitting that ORG should have jurisdiction to adjudicate the case , and that the applicant had not targeted all the armed forces but had undeniably tarnished the image of CARDINAL Generals , which was liable to undermine the confidence of the rank - and - file in these officers and thus damage hierarchical relations within the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not apprised of the appeals on points of law lodged by the commanding officer and ORG , both of which were added to the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which assessed the appeals on points of law , quashed the decision declining jurisdiction and referred the case back to ORG . In its reasoning ORG mentioned the need to reclassify the facts and to assess them under LAW . It specified that the provisions of LAW and ( the former ) LAW shared the same substantive and moral elements , but differed in providing protection for individuals ( LAW ) and the Institution itself ( LAW , respectively . ORG held that even though the applicant \u2019s article had comprised elements of both the aforementioned criminal offences , the general tenor of the impugned article had apparently concentrated on the behaviour of CARDINAL specific Generals rather than the overall armed forces . Therefore , the accusation that the officers were disobedient , that is to say that they lacked discipline , was liable to undermine the lower ranks\u2019 confidence in them and thus damage hierarchical relations within the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG , having reconsidered the case , once again decline jurisdiction in favour of the non - military courts . It stated that new legislation on the press attributed to the non - military criminal courts jurisdiction to hear and determine offences committed via the press and specified that such offences no longer came under special legislation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the commanding officer of ORG lodged a fresh appeal on points of law against ORG decision declining jurisdiction . He pointed out that the CARDINAL DATE judgment of ORG had been delivered after the amendment to the legislation in question and that the provisions of LAW ( Law No . CARDINAL ) enabling civilians to be tried by military courts had not been amended .", "CARDINAL . While the case was still pending before ORG , Law No . CARDINAL of DATE made a series of amendments to LAW , inter alia abolishing military court jurisdiction for trying civilians for offences such as those with which the applicant was charged . The Prosecutor with ORG therefore referred the applicant \u2019s file to ORG , accompanied by an opinion to the effect that the military courts had no jurisdiction in such matters .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the military court once again decline jurisdiction and referred the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , following the merger of the Ba\u011fc\u0131lar and PERSON judicial districts , the case was referred to ORG . By a judgment of DATE , the latter court declined jurisdiction and referred the case to the ORG , which held jurisdiction for offences committed via the press . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG referred the case to the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y CARDINALth ORG on the grounds that that court was the former ORG . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y CARDINALth ORG referred a jurisdictional dispute to ORG . Finally , ORG decided in favour of the ORG in the jurisdictional dispute , and referred the case to that court .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the PERSON CARDINALnd criminal court declared the proceedings statute - barred under LAW .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
