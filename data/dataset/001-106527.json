The applicant \u2019s sister had died because of the consequences of ORG and the applicant had told her mother she did not want to undergo ORG , but was told that she would have to accept it . The applicant submitted that police would not interfere in what they saw as a tradition and that the other villagers might kill her if she refused ORG .", "The applicant fled from her village and stayed with a friend in a neighbouring village for DATE but had to leave due to fights that broke out in the village . The applicant then travelled to GPE on an unknown route .", "ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request for asylum on DATE and stated that her expulsion to GPE was permissible .

Consequently , she could not be considered to be in danger of treatment contrary to LAW . It stated that no national legal prohibition of ORG was in force in GPE , but several federal states had such provisions in force .

The applicant further argued that the fact that she had to flee her family because of the threat of ORG and was expected to start a new life on her own in a different part of GPE , with the risk of ending up in poverty and in degrading circumstances , already amounted to a violation of LAW .", "By decision of DATE , ORG refused legal aid and refused to deal with the complaint , holding that the complaint did not raise any issue of constitutional law and thus had no prospects of success .
