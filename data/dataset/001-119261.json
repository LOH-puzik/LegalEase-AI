The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr J. GPE , succeeded by Ms J. Chrzanowska , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a widow and has CARDINAL child . Prior to her application for an EWK pension ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) she had been employed since DATE by the same employer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application with ORG ( ORG ) to be granted the right to an earlyretirement pension for persons raising children who , due to the seriousness of their health condition , required constant care , the socalled \u201c EWK \u201d pension .", "CARDINAL . Along with her application for a pension , the applicant submitted , among other documents concerning her daughter \u2019s health , a medical certificate issued by a specialist medical centre . The certificate stated that the child ( born in DATE ) suffered from a congenital malformation of both arms ( bilateral radioulnar synostosis , zrost promieniowo - lokciowy ) and was in need of the parent \u2019s constant care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the FAC \u201d ) issued a decision granting the applicant the right to an earlyretirement pension in the net amount of QUANTITY ( ORG ) per month . In addition to the ORG pension the applicant received a family allowance and nursing benefit which , together with the pension , amounted to ORG CARDINAL net per month .", "CARDINAL . ORG initially suspended the payment of the pension due to the fact that the applicant was still working on the date of the decision . Shortly afterwards the applicant informed the ORG of her resignation with effect from DATE . The payment of the pension started on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was reemployed by her previous employer , a municipal transport company ( PKS NORP PERSON ) , and remained employed continuously until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG requested ORG doctor ( PERSON ) to specify whether the applicant \u2019s daughter required the permanent care of a parent . On an unspecified date the doctor stated that , on the basis of the medical documents , the child in question could not be considered as ever having required such care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG simultaneously issued CARDINAL decisions in respect of the applicant . By virtue of the first decision , the payment of the applicant \u2019s pension was discontinued with immediate effect ( DATE ) . By virtue of the second decision , ORG reopened the proceedings , revoked the initial decision granting a pension and eventually refused to award the applicant the right to an early - retirement pension under the scheme provided for by the ORG \u2019s Ordinance of CARDINAL DATE on the right to early retirement of employees raising children who require permanent care ( ORG PERSON .

NORP The applicant appealed against these decisions . She submitted that she should receive the benefit because her child required constant care , as confirmed by the medical certificate attached to the applicant \u2019s original application for a pension . Moreover , the applicant alleged that the revocation of her retirement pension was contrary to the principle of vested rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the appeal . ORG concluded on the basis of the evidence , including expert medical evidence , that the applicant \u2019s child suffered from a mild malformation of her arms but did not require her mother \u2019s permanent care since her state of health did not significantly impair her body functions . The domestic court held that the applicant had been rightfully divested of her right to a pension under the scheme provided by the DATE Ordinance as she did not satisfy the requirement of necessary permanent care .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further appealed against the first - instance judgment . In particular , she claimed that she had been informed by the ORG that she could continue working while in receipt of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) dismissed the appeal . The court considered that only a total impairment of the child \u2019s arms could justify the need for her parent \u2019s constant care . In the present case the malfunction did not significantly impair her body functions . The child had been going to school by herself and required only minor everyday help . Moreover , the fact that the applicant has been employed DATE while receiving the EWK pension was an important aspect of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) refused to entertain the cassation appeal lodged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Following the social security proceedings the applicant was not ordered to return her early - retirement benefits paid by ORG , despite the revocation of her right to the early - retirement pension .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted , in general , that after the revocation of the ORG pension her financial situation had been difficult .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicant had been employed continuously while receiving the EWK pension and at the time the pension was revoked . From DATE and DATE she received an unemployment allowance . In addition , in DATE the applicant and her daughter were granted a family pension following the death of the applicant \u2019s husband .
