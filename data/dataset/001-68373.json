Unable to move back into the flat , which was now occupied by ORG 's family , she had to return to GPE and move in with relatives .

In DATE the applicant filed a civil claim against ORG with ORG , claiming compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage and seeking to assert his right to free use of the flat in question . ORG in turn lodged an application to have that right withdrawn from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an intervention by the procurator at the applicant 's request , the ORG annulled its decision of DATE , finding that it had been unlawful , and restored the applicant 's rights to the flat .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's claim and granted the ORG 's application . It found in particular that , in accordance with the legislation in force and the employment contract concluded between the ORG and the applicant , the latter had forfeited his right to use of the flat concerned after taking up permanent residence elsewhere . The court also noted that , according to the statement made on DATE , the flat in question had been empty when it was entered .", "CARDINAL .

However , the court rejected the applicant 's claim for damages , observing that the criminal investigation into the disappearance of his possessions had been closed by an order of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In that connection , the court took the view that neither the amount of the claim nor the existence of the pecuniary damage allegedly caused by ORG had been borne out by the evidence provided .

Furthermore , it noted :", "\u201c In examining the aforementioned civil case , the court was not aware that ownership of the flat in question ... had been transferred to a private individual , as ORG had not informed the court of this fact when he gave evidence as a witness at the hearing . Only after the judgment had been delivered did this come to light . That being the case , neither the court nor the applicant PERSON was aware that the flat had passed into private ownership . It was for that reason that Mr PERSON lodged an application simply to be allowed to occupy the flat in question rather than to have [ T. ] evicted . \u201d", "ORG upheld that decision in a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the PERSON procurator applied to ORG on the applicant 's behalf , seeking to have the transfer of ownership of the flat to T. on DATE declared unlawful , and to have ORG evicted from the flat .", "CARDINAL .

By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON department of ORG closed the criminal proceedings , finding that no offence had been committed . On DATE the PERSON deputy procurator quashed that decision and reopened the investigation .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON department of ORG , after summarising the main findings of the investigation , closed the criminal proceedings on the ground that no offence had been committed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , it was observed that G.G.S. and GPE , on whose statements the applicant had relied , had declined to attend in person in order to provide further information to the investigating officer . In that connection it was also pointed out that ORG had refused to take ORG 's statement into account because she was related to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . T.G.M. was questioned several times on the subject of his statement , on DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . In his submissions , ORG said that he had moved the following items into the flat in question : a washing machine , a refrigerator , some chairs , a guitar , some spare parts for cars and some home - made jams . However , the investigation noted that these items had not been mentioned by the applicant in his complaints .

In addition , statements were taken in the course of the investigation from CARDINAL persons , including ORG , who lived in the same building or adjoining buildings . They all asserted that they had seen no heavy or bulky items of furniture being moved into the flat in question DATE . Taking the view that items of that nature could not have been moved in without being noticed , and on the basis of the preceding statements , the investigating officer concluded that the applicant had never moved the items into the flat , and that the alleged theft had not taken place .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the order of CARDINAL DATE accused the applicant of taking insufficient interest in the investigation , having failed to attend his appointments with the investigating officer .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , having observed some inconsistencies in the applicant 's statements concerning the date of his return to PERSON , the investigation concluded that the applicant had lodged his complaint concerning the alleged theft on fictitious grounds and with a view to material gain .
