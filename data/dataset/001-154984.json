NORP The legal framework governing the NORP parishes", "CARDINAL . Until DATE the NORP parishes owned various properties , including churches and adjacent land , parish houses and cemeteries .", "CARDINAL . ORG was dissolved by Legislative Decree no . GPE . By virtue of the same Legislative Decree , properties belonging to that ORG were transferred to the ORG , except for parish property . An inter - departmental committee with responsibility for determining the ultimate allocation of those properties never completed its task . NORP property was transferred to ORG under Decree no . ORG , which provided that if the majority of CARDINAL ORG \u2019s adherents became members of a different ORG , the former \u2019s property would be transferred to the ownership of the latter .", "CARDINAL . After DATE of the communist regime in DATE , Decree no . MONEY was repealed by Legislative Decree no . DATE . ORG was officially recognised by LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on certain measures concerning ORG with GPE ( ORG ) . LAW provided that the legal status of property that had belonged to the ORG parishes was to be determined by joint committees made up of representatives of both ORG and NORP clergy . In reaching their decisions , the committees were to take into account \u201c the wishes of the adherents of the communities in possession of these properties \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was supplemented by Government Order no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE and PERSON no . PERSON . The Decree , as amended , specified that in the event of disagreement between the members of the clergy representing the CARDINAL denominations on the joint committee , the party with an interest entitling it to bring judicial proceedings could do so under ordinary law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal situation of the applicants and of their church", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant parish , diocese and archpriesthood were dissolved on the basis of LAW no . GPE . In DATE the church and the adjoining courtyard , which had belonged to the applicant parish , were entered in the land register as having been transferred to the ownership of the PERSON I Romanian Orthodox Church .", "CARDINAL . The applicant parish was legally re - established on CARDINAL DATE . It comes under the authority of ORG ( the second applicant ) and the PERSON NORP Catholic Archpriesthood ( the third applicant ) . The applicants took steps to have the church and adjoining courtyard returned to them .", "B. The attempts by ORG and ORG to reach a friendly settlement", "CARDINAL . DATE Meetings of the joint committee", "CARDINAL . ORG and ORG convened meetings of a joint committee , composed of senior representatives of the CARDINAL denominations , with a view to determining the fate of the church buildings that had belonged to ORG . DATE the joint committee met on CARDINAL occasions . ORG party submitted a list of the churches claimed by it , including that of the applicant parish . It also proposed a friendly settlement , recommending that in those municipalities where there were CARDINAL church buildings , CARDINAL of them be restored , and that in municipalities where there existed CARDINAL church building but the CARDINAL denominations were present , religious services be organised on an alternate basis . The NORP side refused this proposal .", "CARDINAL . During the meetings , the representatives of the CARDINAL denominations noted that the dispute would be protracted and called for dialogue at local level and the construction of new church buildings for both denominations . At the final meeting the NORP side refused to return the properties and referred to the wishes of the majority of the adherents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant parish convened a meeting at local level with the NORP parish which held the property in issue , scheduling it for CARDINAL DATE . The NORP side did not attend , and nor did it attend a further meeting scheduled by the applicant party for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meeting of the interested parties under the auspices of ORG", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , at the initiative of ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) , a meeting took place at the GPE headquarters of ORG under the title \u201c Fraternal Dialogue \u201d . At that meeting , the representatives of ORG had emphasised the importance of constructing new churches in order to resolve the problem . The ORG \u2019s plans to launch a church - building programme had been welcomed . ORG had asked the NORP side to provide it with a more detailed list of the places of worship claimed by that denomination .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant parish , the NORP side had duly handed over the requested documents to the ORG , but the latter took no further action .", "C. The judicial proceedings brought by the applicants", "CARDINAL . Previously , on DATE , the second applicant , namely FAC , citing also the other CARDINAL applicants , had brought proceedings before the domestic courts against ORG and the PERSON Orthodox Parish . It requested that the expropriation of the church building and cemetery in PERSON , carried out on the basis of Decree no . DATE , be set aside , and that the church be returned to the applicant parish .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( \u201c the county court \u201d ) declared the action inadmissible on the ground that the dispute ought to be settled through the special procedure established by LAW no . DATE , that is , by means of the joint committee .", "CARDINAL . An appeal against that judgment by the second applicant was dismissed by a judgment of ORG ( \u201c the appeal court \u201d ) on DATE , which held that the action was premature . On an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) by the applicant parish and the second applicant , ORG and ORG , in a final judgment of DATE , sent the case back to the same appeal court for a fresh examination of the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in application of the legislative amendments which gave the courts jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the cases ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the appeal court upheld the second applicant \u2019s appeal and sent the case back to the county court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the case was restored to the county court \u2019s list , the action was amended in order to add the applicant parish and the third applicant as claimants in the proceedings . On DATE the claimants supplemented their action with a claim for recovery of possession of the church building in question , on the basis of ordinary law .", "CARDINAL . NORP The county court asked ORG and NORP parties to organise a meeting in order to decide the fate of the church in question , and to inform it of the outcome of the negotiations by CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a meeting was held between the representatives of the applicants , ORG and the PERSON . ORG refused to return the church , arguing that the majority of believers in the municipality were NORP . The applicant parish replied that the ownership of property was not related to the number of practising adherents in a congregation . The minutes of the meeting were transmitted to the county court , which continued its examination of the case .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the county court dismissed the applicants\u2019 action on the ground that the PERSON NORP parish had become the legally recognised owner of the property in question by virtue of Decree no . MONEY . The applicants lodged an appeal . By a judgment of DATE , the appeal court set aside the judgment of CARDINAL DATE on formal grounds and remitted the case to the county court .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the county court found in favour of the applicants and ordered that the church be returned to the applicant parish . In comparing the title deeds of the parties to the dispute in respect of the property in question , the county court noted that ORG had been entered in the land register as owner of the property from DATE , and that in DATE ORG had entered its ownership right in the land register by virtue of Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It held that the repealing of Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL had had the effect in the present case of terminating the NORP party \u2019s right of ownership over the disputed property . It added that the applicant parish did not have a place of worship and that it was obliged to rely on ORG , which rented the parish its LOC for religious services .", "CARDINAL . NORP The NORP parish lodged an appeal against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the appeal court allowed the appeal and dismissed the applicants\u2019 action . It described how the proceedings had developed and noted that the case had been instituted by the second applicant in DATE and joined by the CARDINAL other applicants in DATE , after it was restored to the county court \u2019s list . On the basis of the evidence in the case file , it noted , firstly , that the church building being claimed and the CARDINAL PERSON parish houses had been constructed DATE by members of the LOC NORP and NORP churches and that , after its construction , the church building had been used alternately for services by both denominations . It noted that in DATE the members of ORG had been obliged to \u201c move \u201d to ORG and that the church building had become the property of ORG , which had maintained it and carried out improvements .", "CARDINAL . The court of appeal questioned CARDINAL witnesses , including CARDINAL NORP believers who stated that they no longer intended to return to ORG to which they had belonged prior to DATE . The third witness stated that she was one of the few NORP in PERSON . The appeal court noted that the statements by these witnesses supported the statistical data , which showed that there were more NORP than NORP adherents in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . It further held that the county court had carried out its comparison of the title deeds without taking into consideration the wishes of the majority of those currently in possession of the building , a criterion that , as the appeal court noted , had been laid down in LAW no . MONEY . In so far as there were more NORP adherents than NORP adherents in PERSON DATE taking account also of those who had converted and no longer wished to return to ORG DATE their wishes had to be taken into consideration in ruling on the case . It found that \u201c having regard to the social and historical realities , ignoring the wishes and proportional strength of NORP adherents , who are in the majority , in relation to the less numerous NORP Catholic worshippers , would be to contravene the stability and certainty of legal relations \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court of appeal noted that the fact that Decree no . GPE had been repealed did not automatically mean that ORG title to the building was set aside , and that this Decree had represented the law in force at the time that the ownership right was transferred . In consequence , it considered that , even if it had been granted unlawfully , ORG title had been valid from the date on which the transfer had been made , with the result that the action to recover possession was ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law before ORG and ORG , alleging that the appellate court had incorrectly applied the legal provisions governing actions for recovery of possession . They emphasised that the right of ownership could not be linked to a religion \u2019s majority status , since ownership was , in their submission , a legal concept that was independent of the numerical strength and wishes of the parties .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG and ORG dismissed the ORG appeal by a majority and upheld the appeal judgment . It held as follows :", "\u201c With regard to a request for restoration of a place of worship which had belonged to ORG to GPE ( ORG ) , the appellate court correctly established the special legal framework for ruling on those claims .", "Pursuant to Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ... a distinction is made CARDINAL situations : ( a ) that in which the property is within the ownership of the State ... ( b ) that in which the places of worship and the parishes have been taken over by ORG and in respect of which [ the question of ] restitution will be decided by a joint committee made up of representatives of the clergy of the CARDINAL denominations , a committee which will take account of the wishes of the adherents of the communities in possession of these properties .", "In the light of those provisions , the appellate court , examining an action for recovery of possession of a place of worship , correctly applied the criterion of the wishes of the adherents ( NORP in the majority ) of the community in possession of the property , while simultaneously emphasising the unlawfulness of the reasoning provided by the first - instance court , which had merely compared the title deeds and ignored the special law ...", "The fact of supplementing LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] with a paragraph stating \u201c If the committee does not meet within the period established in its mandate , or if the committee does not reach a conclusion or if one of the parties is dissatisfied with the decision taken by the committee , the party which has an interest is entitled to bring judicial proceedings under ordinary law \u201d does not mean that actions for restitution governed by the special provisions are transformed into applications to establish title under ordinary law .", "A court which is required to examine such an action can not ignore the special regulations in this area , which indicate the criterion to be taken into account in resolving such claims , namely the wishes of the adherents of the community in possession of the property .", "In other words , by virtue of its full jurisdiction and in order not to compromise access to justice , a court may be called upon to decide an action on the merits , even though the prior procedure did not culminate in a decision by the joint clerical committee ; at the same time , however , it may not go beyond the limits imposed by the special statutory framework .", "The priority to be given to the criterion of the ORG wishes was decided by the legislature , which wished in this way to regulate an area which concerns the buildings assigned to a particular use ( places of worship ) , [ and so ] the court was not authorised to criticise the law .", "Moreover , in ruling on the alleged unconstitutionality of LAW no . MONEY and the criterion of the ORG wishes , ORG has stated that the text did not infringe the NORP State \u2019s principle of democracy , nor that of the freedom of religious denominations ( ORG decision no . FAC , ORG decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Democracy \u201c also implies the application of the principle of majority rule , as set out in the final part of LAW the wishes of the adherents of the community in possession of these properties \u2013 which introduces a social criterion , that of the choice of the majority of the worshippers \u201d .", "Equally , it has been established that \u201c the freedom of religious denominations implies not only their autonomy with regard to the ORG , but also freedom of religious belief \u201d ; where \u201c in the same parish there are NORP and NORP worshippers , the application of the social criterion \u2013 namely [ the wishes ] of the majority of parishioners \u2013 in deciding on the allocation of places of worship and parish houses is compatible with the democratic principle of determining the religious use of the said property , given that this is the wish of the majority of those who benefit from such use , because \u201c were it otherwise , this would mean that the NORP adherents , who are in the majority , would be unjustifiably prevented from practising their religion unless they transferred to ORG \u201d .", "In addition , the procedures for regulating social relations and restoring the assets ( averi ) of the religious communities are a matter of legislative policy ( and not of judge - made law , which would attempt to settle such issues by judicial means , to the exclusion of the special law ) ; it can not be claimed that by introducing the criterion of the wishes of the faithful the [ special ] law failed to achieve its compensatory purpose .", "The appellate court considers that \u2013 in a ORG subject to the rule of law \u2013 the fact that the ORG unlawfully dispossessed ORG of its places of worship in DATE can not be remedied by committing the opposite error , that is , in failing to take account of the wishes of the majority of worshippers at the point of adopting the given measure . However , returning the properties which belonged to ORG without respecting the criteria imposed by LAW no . DATE would infringe the stability and security of judicial relations . A right can not be reconstructed in abstracto , in disregard of social and historical realities , and mitigation for past damage must not create disproportionate new problems ...", "In order to bring an action under ordinary law for recovery of possession without being subject to the special law , the applicants must be able to claim that there existed a \u201c possession \u201d or a right of ownership to their property .", "However , through Decree no . GPE , ORG was outlawed and its assets were transferred to the ORG ; the building in dispute [ was ] registered as belonging to the PERSON I Romanian Orthodox Church .", "The fact that , through Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG to GPE ( NORP Catholic ) was officially recognised following the repeal of Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL does not mean that its title to property was restored , in so far as the right of ownership is subject to a procedure ( namely the provisions of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and its subsequent amendments ) , as the hope of obtaining title to property is not to be equated with a possession ...", "Contrary to the arguments of the parties having lodged the appeal on points of law [ recurentilor ] , the solution adopted does not infringe the freedom to practice a religion , since , as they submitted in their own observations , \u201c the practice of religion is a private matter \u201d , which consists primarily in a \u201c strong and personal spiritual investment \u201d . At the same time , the legislature provided for the scenario where the places of worship could not be returned ; thus , LAW no . MONEY provides that \u201c in those municipalities where the number of places of worship is insufficient in relation to the number of believers , the ORG shall provide support for the construction of new churches ; for that purpose , it shall make available to those denominations the necessary land if the denomination does not possess it , and shall contribute to raising the necessary funds \u201d .", "Thus , the ORG , as the authority with power to control life in society , will guarantee that the necessary conditions for the manifestation of religious beliefs are met without ... the exercise of this right being limited by the number of adherents ( a substantive limitation ) . The ORG \u2019s task here is to fulfil a positive obligation , so as to contribute to the effective exercise of the right to freedom of conscience and religion ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a separate opinion , CARDINAL of the judges sitting on the case noted that the legislature \u2019s reference to ordinary law could not be reduced to a purely procedural dimension , but was to be interpreted as the application of a rule of substantive law . Referring to the rules governing the preparation of statutes , the judge indicated that , if the legislature had wished to ascribe a specific meaning to this reference to \u201c ordinary law \u201d , it ought to have done so explicitly . He also cited Article QUANTITY no . DATE on religious freedom and the legal status of religious denominations , according to which property differences between denominations were to be resolved by friendly settlement and , where that proved impossible , on the basis of ordinary law . After indicating that an action for recovery of possession implied a comparison of the relevant titles to the property , the judge concluded that ORG did not have title to the place of worship in question .", "D. Other information about the case", "CARDINAL . According to a memorandum provided by ORG , in DATE there were CARDINAL NORP adherents and CARDINAL NORP adherents in PERSON . The applicant parish is currently holding religious services at scheduled times in LOC rented by it from ORG in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
