THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON CARDINAL ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant 's wife drowned and , shortly after , the applicant was arrested and detained on suspicion of having killed her . In the criminal proceedings that were subsequently brought against the applicant , ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE DATE on DATE and following proceedings on appeal \u2013 convicted the applicant and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . Following subsequent proceedings in cassation , ORG ( PERSON ) quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case to ORG . In the course of the proceedings before ORG and on an unspecified date , the applicant was released from pre - trial detention . On DATE , ORG acquitted the applicant of the charges brought against him .", "After the applicant had been arrested and placed in detention , his DATE then still minor DATE children were placed under supervision ( ondertoezichtstelling ) of the child welfare authorities and away from their family home ( uithuisplaatsing ) .", "In a ruling handed down on DATE , ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) , acting on a request filed on DATE by ORG ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c the Board \u201d ) , relieved the applicant of his parental authority ( ontheffing ouderlijk gezag ) over CARDINAL of his children , namely those who at that time were still a minor , and appointed ORG ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) as their guardian ( voogdes ) .", "The applicant 's appeal against his ruling was dismissed on DATE by ORG . ORG noted that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been remitted by ORG to ORG and that the proceedings before this court had been stayed until DATE on medical grounds . As regards the CARDINAL oldest of the CARDINAL children DATE who were born in DATE and DATE , respectively , and who had been heard before ORG \u2013 ORG noted that they had indicated that they did not wish to have any contacts with their father anymore and that the applicant , respecting the wishes of these CARDINAL children , no longer objected to being relieved of his parental authority over them .", "As regards the CARDINAL youngest children \u2013 twins born in DATE \u2013 ORG noted that they were staying with a foster family and that the initial arrangement for the applicant 's access to them , i.e. once per month , had been reduced by ORG to TIME DATE in the applicant 's home and contact by telephone every uneven month . ORG held in their respect as follows :", "\u201c ORG is of the opinion that [ their ] placement under supervision and away from [ their ] home do no longer suffice to protect the children against physical and moral ruin ( lichamelijke en zedelijke ondergang ) . On this point , ORG has submitted that the children require as soon as possible certainty about the place where they can grow up further . ORG considers it necessary that , noting what has occurred in their lives on account of their mother 's death , the authority over the children is to be exercised by someone else than the father . In the course of the proceedings , ORG has added that after relieving [ the father of his parental authority ] \u2013 in particular since already for DATE the father has not had any an active educational responsibility \u2013 the position of the father vis - \u00e0 - vis the children will only become clearer . ORG did also emphasise that the children are being harmed in their development by the erratic course of the criminal proceedings in which still no definite decision has yet been taken , on which ground ORG now calls for a speedy decision .", "Since DATE ... the ORG has not noted any obstruction from the side of the father anymore ; the contacts with the father run quite well . Nevertheless the ORG subscribes to the ORG 's position that a relief of parental authority is in the children 's interest ; it would be beneficial for them to have their future clearly laid out in a safe and stable situation . Also the foster family , with whom the children have now stayed for DATE and who moreover offer favourable future prospects would benefit from clarity . Certainly when growing up , children must know where they stand . To this end it is important that it will become clear that now , but also later , someone else is responsible for their care and upbringing . The current situation around the father , whether or not detained , is too disruptive for the children ; the children seek answers \u2013 that are as understandable as possible \u2013 to their questions . Parental authority must be separated from the [ issue of ] contacts with the father , which must be continued also [ if the applicant is relieved of his parental authority ] . The ORG favours maintaining the current access arrangement ; the former access arrangement was too burdensome for the foster family , who also had had to deal with access arrangements involving [ the older siblings of the twins ] . [ The foster family ] is prepared , after [ the applicant has been relieved of his parental authority ] , to set up a broader access arrangement in consultation with the father .", "ORG adopts as its own the position taken by ORG . There is a founded fear that , owing to the unsuitability or incapacity ( ongeschiktheid of onmacht ) of the father , the placement under supervision , also in view of its temporary nature , is insufficient to avert the threat for the children .", "Having regard to the father 's health condition and the fact that he is currently staying at home , ORG is of the opinion that the ORG , as indeed already proposed by it , must in that framework give attention to the frequency of the access arrangement which now has been reduced from CARDINAL to CARDINAL times per year . The clarity that a relief of parental authority entails can create space for the ORG to develop a further arrangement . \u201d", "The applicant 's appeal in cassation against this ruling was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had filed a request with ORG to restore his parental authority over the twins or , alternatively \u2013 to determine a broader access arrangement , namely an arrangement under which he would have access to the twins from TIME until TIME every fortnight .", "On DATE , ORG declared the applicant inadmissible in his request to restore his parental authority as the decision in which he had been relieved of his parental authority was not yet final as the proceedings on the applicant 's appeal in cassation against the ruling of DATE were still pending before ORG . It further decided to stay pro forma and until DATE its examination of the applicant 's request for a broader access arrangement . It requested the parties to submit information by that date to whom the parental authority had been entrusted and the ORG to submit information about the running of the access arrangement .", "The applicant filed an appeal against the decision of DATE with ORG . On DATE , ORG examined the applicant 's appeal . After having heard the parties , ORG decided to adjourn its further examination pending the submission of a report by ORG NORP ( PERSON NORP Adviesbureau NORP \u2013 \u201c NORP \u201d ) on the access arrangement issue . It decided to adjourn pro forma until DATE and , if the report had been submitted by then , to schedule a further hearing in DATE or DATE by which date the ORG should have set a time frame for an investigation into the question whether to work on returning the twins into the care and custody of their father would be in their interest .", "On DATE , a further hearing was held before ORG . It adjourned its further examination of the appeal pending a further investigation by ORG ( Ambulant Bureau PERSON \u2013 \u201c ABJ ) on specific question points to be agreed upon between the parties . Failing such an agreement , ORG would hand down an interim decision defining the scope of the further investigation by the ORG .", "In its decision of DATE , noting that the parties had been unable to reach an agreement and that they had requested the court to formulate the questions , ORG ordered the ORG to prepare a report dealing with the following points :", "\u201c a. how is the ( social - emotional ) development of the children and is the father 's concern about their development justified ;", "b. what is the significance of the foster parents for the children ;", "c. how is the relationship between the children and the father ; is there bonding ;", "d. what image do the children have of their father ;", "e. what are the father 's possibilities in a pedagogical sense ;", "PERSON are the pedagogical and other capabilities of the father sufficient for taking on again the care and upbringing of the children ;", "g. what are the possibilities of the father in respect of realising contacts between the children and their CARDINAL brothers and their sister ;", "h. is the father ( mentally ) capable to exercise access rights and/or parental authority in a responsible manner ;", "i. have other facts and circumstances become known during the investigation that might be of relevance for any decision to be taken by the court in relation to the parental authority and access ? \u201d", "ORG adjourned its further examination pending the submission of this report . On DATE , the requested report was submitted to ORG .", "In its decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG declared the applicant inadmissible in his request for a broader access arrangement , quashed the decision of DATE in so far as the applicant had been declared inadmissible in his request for restoring his parental authority , declared this request admissible and rejected it . This decision , in its relevant part , reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG has declared the father inadmissible in his request to restore his parental authority over the minor children because , in ORG opinion , it was not clear whether or not the father had been relieved of his parental authority , because the proceedings on the appeal filed by the father against the decision of DATE were still pending .", "CARDINAL . As the decision of DATE was declared as being immediately enforceable ( uitvoerbaar bij voorraad ) , it did have legal effects for the father , so that he was admissible in his request to ORG . ORG must therefore examine on appeal and anew the father 's request for restoring his parental authority .", "CARDINAL . From the examination at trial and from the ORG report inter alia the following has appeared .", "CARDINAL . Although the children are involved with the father in a positive way , this involvement is limited . The children indicate that they do not wish to live with the father . The father wishes to be restored in his parental authority in order to be able to claim a more central role in the provision of aid to the children .", "CARDINAL . The children have now lived for DATE with the foster parents . The children have difficulties , noting everything that has happened in the past , with bonding [ with others ] , they have been harmed in their ability to bond [ with others ] ( hechtingsbeschadigd ) , also because in the past their mother was only to a limited extent emotionally available to the children . The children 's bonding with the foster parents has only just begun . This bonding development ( hechtingsontwikkeling ) is in the interest of a healthy personality development . The father has little sight on the children 's problems . His wish to care for the children appears to flow mainly from a sense of duty . He can give little substance to that . He overlooks the children 's interests . A termination of the bonding process would have serious negative consequences for the children 's emotional development .", "CARDINAL . Although ORG understands the wish of the father who , owing to the sad course of events surrounding his wife 's death , has lost his parental authority , ORG finds , in view of the above considerations , that it is of the utmost importance for the children that the bonding process set into motion is continued , in which it is also of importance to create now clarity about the authority over them ; it is beneficial for them to have clarity for the future in a safe and stable situation .", "CARDINAL . In addition the children have regular contacts with [ CARDINAL older siblings ] , who play a big role in the process of dealing with the loss of the mother . The father has already since DATE no contacts anymore with [ these CARDINAL siblings ] . The children have a great interest in a continuation of their contact with [ these CARDINAL siblings ] which would be jeopardised if the father were to be restored in his parental authority .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , the ORG is not convinced that the minor children should be entrusted again to the father and it will therefore reject the father 's request to this effect .", "CARDINAL . As regards the father 's request to determine an access arrangement , ORG notes that , in the impugned decision , ORG has stayed [ its examination of ] this request . Consequently , the father is inadmissible in his appeal against this interim decision . \u201d", "The applicant 's subsequent appeal in cassation was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "The duties of ORG , as set out in LAW the ORG \u201d ) , include keeping itself informed of developments affecting child welfare , promoting cooperation between institutions concerned with child welfare and giving advice , upon request or of their own motion , to authorities and institutions . It has competence to take action in the interests of minors ( LAW ) .", "Parental authority over minor children born in wedlock is exercised jointly by both parents ( Articles CARDINAL:CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ) . It comprises the duty and the right of parents to care for and bring up their child ( LAW ) . Under caring for and bringing up is also to be understood the care and responsibility for the mental and physical well - being of the child and the furtherance of the development of its personality ( LAW of the ORG ) . A parent invested with parental authority is the child 's statutory representative ( wettelijk vertegenwoordiger ) and administers its possessions ( LAW ) . If parental authority is exercised by both parents jointly and CARDINAL of them dies , the parental authority will be exercised by the surviving spouse alone if that spouse had parental authority when the other spouse died ( DATE the ORG ) .", "According to LAW , the juvenile court judge ( kinderrechter ) may , on the application of inter alia ORG , order a minor child 's placement under supervision of a family supervision institution ( gezinsvoogdij - instelling ) within the meaning of LAW ( Wet op de Jeugdhulpverlening ) , if the child is growing up under such conditions that it is threatened with moral or physical ruin ( zedelijke of lichamelijke ondergang ) . Such an order can be given for a maximum period of DATE , but may be prolonged by a maximum of DATE on each occasion ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "If necessary in the interest of the child 's care and upbringing or for the purposes of an examination of the child 's mental or physical health condition , the juvenile court judge can further authorise that the child be placed away from its family home ( Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL of the ORG ) . Also such an authorisation can only be given for a maximum period of DATE , with the possibility of subsequent prolongations by a maximum of DATE on each occasion ( Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "Under GPE law , a parent invested with parental authority can be deprived of this authority by a decision of ORG either by being relieved of it ( ontheffing ) under LAW like the applicant in the present case \u2013 or by removal from it ( ontzetting ) under LAW . Relief of parental authority \u2013 which can only be pronounced upon a request by ORG by ORG or the public prosecution department ( openbaar ministerie ) \u2013 is based on a parent 's unsuitability or incapacity ( ongeschiktheid of onmacht ) to fulfil his / her duty of care and upbringing . Removal from parental authority \u2013 which can only be pronounced upon a request by the other parent , CARDINAL of the relatives by marriage or blood up to and including the fourth degree of consanguinity , ORG or the public prosecution department DATE is based on an imputable and wilful dereliction of duty or on an imputable unworthiness in the assumption of the task of mentor and care provider .", "A decision to relieve a parent from his or her parental authority can not be taken if opposed by the parent concerned ( LAW ) . However , this rule does not apply where it appears after a placement under supervision of DATE , or where after a placement away from the family home of DATE and DATE there is a founded fear , that this measure \u2013 by the unsuitability or incapacity of a parent to fulfil his or her duty of care and upbringing DATE is insufficient to avert the threat with moral or physical ruin ( LAW ) .", "Both forms of deprivation of parental authority entail a full loss of the authority over underage children . A request to be restored in parental authority may be filed with ORG by the parent concerned or by ORG . If ORG is convinced that a minor can be entrusted again to the parent who has been relieved or removed from his / her parental authority , it may restore this parent in his / her authority ( LAW ) . In the determination of such a request , ORG is to balance the interests of both the child and the parent .
