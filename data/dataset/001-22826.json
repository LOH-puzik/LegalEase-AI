She was then detained at a medium secure unit until DATE when she was transferred to another ward from where , on DATE , she was moved to a community - based ward .", "DATE and DATE , the continuing grounds for applicant \u2019s detention were reviewed twice by ORG ( \u201c MHRT \u201d ) . In DATE the applicant made a third application to the ORG , but then changed her mind and withdrew it . On DATE she made a further application which was received by the MHRT on DATE By letter dated DATE , the ORG informed the applicant \u2019s solicitor that his client had made an application to have her case reviewed .

Legal aid was granted by telephone on DATE , and expenditure of up to GBP CARDINAL was approved in respect of an independent psychiatric report .", "The following day the applicant \u2019s solicitor wrote to a consultant psychiatrist , asking him to prepare a report . The psychiatrist informed that applicant \u2019s solicitor that he was not free to examine the applicant until DATE .

According to the applicant , the ORG then telephoned her solicitor on DATE suggesting a hearing date of DATE , but the applicant \u2019s solicitor rejected this date since he was not available . It is not in dispute that the solicitor wrote to the ORG on DATE , reminding the tribunal that the matter was outstanding and enclosing the psychiatric report prepared on the applicant \u2019s behalf .", "The case was then listed for hearing on DATE .

A restriction order may be made if it appears to the court , having regard to the nature of the offence , the offender \u2019s antecedents and the risk of her committing further offences if set at large , that it is necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm to make the order .", "Under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act a person who is subject to a hospital order and restriction order ( \u201c a restricted patient \u201d ) , and who is detained in hospital , can apply to a ORG ( \u201c MHRT \u201d ) after being detained for DATE .
