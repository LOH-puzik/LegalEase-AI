He is currently in a forensic psychiatric clinic in GPE .", "In DATE , DATE and DATE respectively the applicant was convicted of attempted rape .", "On DATE the applicant was placed in pre - trial detention .", "On DATE the GPE am ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of attempted rape , combined with sexual assault in CARDINAL case , with assault in another case and with dangerous assault in the third case . Having consulted an expert , who had diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a schizoid and narcissistic personality disorder , the court considered that the applicant had committed his offences with diminished criminal responsibility . It sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his placement in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW , see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "The applicant was detained in prison until DATE . Since then , he has been detained in a psychiatric hospital ( apart from the period from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE during which he was in preventive detention ) , initially in PERSON and since DATE in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s detention in a psychiatric hospital has been reviewed at regular intervals ( compare Article PERSON and Article CARDINAL of LAW , see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "In particular , on DATE ORG , in a decision confirmed on appeal , rejected the request of the applicant , represented by counsel , to terminate or suspend on probation his detention in a psychiatric hospital . It had regard to the report of an external expert consulted in DATE , who had diagnosed the applicant with a schizoid personality disorder with narcissistic and sadist elements , to CARDINAL earlier medical expert reports and to a statement of the director of the GPE clinic for forensic psychiatry of DATE . The latter had agreed with the finding of the external expert that the applicant \u2019s personality disorder persisted and had confirmed that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s own assessment , the applicant had not cured his sexual sadism by meditation . ORG found that the conditions for the detention of the applicant , who kept refusing all offers of therapy made to him , in a psychiatric hospital were still met and that there was a risk that the applicant would commit further serious sexual offences if released PERSON ( Article PERSON of LAW , see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . DATE ) . It found , in particular , that the courts ordering the continuation of the applicant \u2019s lengthy detention respected the principle of proportionality . In finding that there was a risk that the applicant would commit serious offences , the courts had not only considered earlier expert reports , but also a recent statement made by the psychiatric hospital . It had not yet been necessary to consult an external psychiatric expert again . Even though the applicant \u2019s detention had lasted for DATE , its continuation was not yet excessive as the offences the applicant might commit were serious and as the applicant refused any therapy .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the request of the applicant , who had refused to be heard in person , to have his detention in a psychiatric hospital terminated or suspended on probation ( see Article DATE and LAW of LAW ) . Having regard to the applicant \u2019s written submissions and referring to its decision of DATE ( see CARDINAL.b . above ) , it argued that there had been no changes justifying a different assessment . In particular , as the director of the GPE forensic psychiatric clinic had confirmed in his statement of DATE , no progress in the applicant \u2019s treatment could be made as the applicant kept refusing all offers of therapy . The applicant still suffered from a schizoid personality disorder and might suffer from sexual sadism . Even though this did not necessarily entail a constantly diminished criminal responsibility , the applicant still risked committing sexual offences if released , similar to the ones of which he had previously been convicted .", "On DATE the GPE am ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . Referring also to the decision taken by ORG on DATE , as confirmed on appeal and by ORG , ORG found that the grounds for these decisions , in particular the applicant \u2019s dangerousness , had not changed .", "ORG further considered that the applicant \u2019s continued detention for DATE was still proportionate . There was a risk that the applicant would commit offences causing grave damage if released and kept refusing treatment even though he had himself been aware of his need of therapy since DATE , believing that he could cure himself by meditation . As had again been confirmed by the medical director of the GPE forensic psychiatric clinic in his statement of DATE , repeated attempts to motivate him to accept treatment had been to no avail .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) lodged against the decisions of ORG dated DATE and of the GPE am ORG dated CARDINAL DATE .", "ORG found that the applicant \u2019s complaint had no prospect of success . The courts dealing with the execution of the applicant \u2019s detention had had sufficient regard to the numerous external and internal expert reports obtained during the applicant \u2019s long detention and had taken into account possibly different assessments made by these experts . There was nothing to indicate that the reports drafted by external experts had failed to comply with the minimum standards required by LAW . In so far as the applicant considered himself cured , he was simply replacing by his own view the assessment made by the courts with the help of experts and by the psychiatric hospital .", "As to the question whether the applicant \u2019s continued detention in a psychiatric hospital was proportionate , ORG referred to the reasons of its decision of DATE ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , see CARDINAL.b . above ) .", "The German Criminal Code distinguishes between penalties ( PERSON ) and socalled measures of correction and prevention ( Ma\u00dfregeln der Besserung und GPE ) to deal with unlawful acts . Penalties ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) consist mainly of prison sentences and fines . The penalty is fixed according to the defendant \u2019s guilt ( LAW ) . Measures of correction and prevention ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) consist mainly of placement in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW ) or a detoxification facility ( LAW ) or in preventive detention ( LAW ) . The purpose of these measures is to rehabilitate dangerous offenders or to protect the public from them . Placement in a psychiatric hospital may be ordered against offenders who have acted with diminished criminal responsibility , in addition to their punishment ( compare LAW ) . The measure must , however , be proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed by , or to be expected from , the defendants concerned , as well as to their dangerousness ( LAW ) .", "Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides that if someone commits an unlawful act without criminal responsibility or with diminished criminal responsibility , the court orders their placement without a maximum duration in a psychiatric hospital if a comprehensive evaluation of the defendant and his act reveals that , as a result of his condition , he can be expected to commit serious unlawful acts and that he is therefore dangerous to the general public .", "Article PERSON of the Criminal Code governs the duration of detention . In its version in force at the relevant time , it provided :", "Article GPE", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Detention in a detoxification facility may not exceed DATE ...", "( CARDINAL ) If there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time - limit has not yet expired , the court shall suspend on probation further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his or her release . Suspension shall automatically entail supervision of the conduct of the offender .", "( CARDINAL ) If a person has spent DATE in preventive detention , the court shall declare the measure terminated if there is no danger that the detainee will , owing to his criminal tendencies , commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims . Termination shall automatically entail supervision of the conduct of the offender . ( ... ) \u201d", "If the court considers following the commencement of detention in a psychiatric hospital that the conditions for the measure are no longer met or that the further execution of the measure would be disproportionate , it declares the measure terminated ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW provides for the review of a person \u2019s detention , inter alia , in a psychiatric hospital . The court may review at any time whether the further execution of the detention order should be suspended on probation . It is obliged to do so within fixed time - limits ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) . For persons detained in a psychiatric hospital , this time - limit is DATE , for persons in preventive detention it is DATE ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
