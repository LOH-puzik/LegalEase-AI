FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1+6-3-d", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant and another person were suspected of having sexually abused the applicant 's CARDINAL daughters , PERSON born in DATE and J. born in DATE .", "During the pre - trial investigation , PERSON and J. were questioned on DATE and on DATE respectively .", "Subsequently , they were questioned again and the interviews were recorded on videotape . PERSON was interviewed on DATE and DATE and J. on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at the pre - trial stage , the applicant was shown the videotapes . She contested the suspected sexual abuse . She was given an opportunity to have questions put to the children , but she did not avail herself of the opportunity . Her counsel was also present .", "In her closing statement of CARDINAL DATE she maintained that she was not guilty of any offence . She also considered the children 's statements contradictory and unclear .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , among others , was charged before ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) with having sexually abused the CARDINAL children on several occasions DATE . The defendants denied the charges .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the applicant , the co - accused and QUANTITY witnesses , including a psychiatrist , CARDINAL psychologists and several persons , who had taken care of the children and offered them a foster home DATE . ORG also watched the above videotapes . The pre - trial investigation TIME and several medical reports drawn up by a psychiatrist and a psychologist were referred to in evidence . The children did not appear before the court . Nor did the defence make any request to that effect .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG noted that the oral evidence was of an indirect nature and that the case turned on the assessment of the credibility of the children 's statements . The court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced her to DATE imprisonment . She was detained .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , among others , appealed , denying the charges . She argued that the conviction was based on contradictory and indirect evidence . In her writ of appeal she did not , however , request that the children be heard before ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON visited the applicant in prison . It appears that the applicant asked PERSON whether she had ever abused her children . In front of other people PERSON withdrew her previous accusations , stating that there had never been any sexual abuse .", "CARDINAL . Having learnt of PERSON 's statement , the applicant 's counsel made a request by telephone to ORG to the effect that PERSON be called as a witness in the forthcoming oral hearing or that she be questioned in an additional investigation conducted by the police during which the interview could be videotaped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing . The applicant , the co - accused and the witnesses were reheard . ORG also heard CARDINAL new witnesses , including PERSON , a deacon , and PERSON , a social official , who had been present during PERSON 's above - mentioned visit to the prison . The videotapes , the pre - trial investigation records and the medical reports were referred to in evidence . PERSON 's foster mother testified that the girl did not want to appear before the court . Her treating psychologist stated that she did not recommend that PERSON be heard in court . She also testified that PERSON was very prone to external influence and that her ego structure contained much repression and that \u201c it would be too upsetting for her to face the deeper reality \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's counsel repeated the above request at the oral hearing on DATE and also requested an opportunity to put questions to PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the applicant stated that she had asked PERSON whether the children had been raped at their home whereas L. did not remember that such a direct question had been put to the girl at all . According to PERSON , the applicant had asked whether \u201c something like that \u201d had taken place . Given the context , PERSON had however concluded that the question had related to the events leading up to the applicant 's detention . L. considered that the girl 's reply had appeared credible and that the question had not been leading in nature . According to GPE , the applicant had cried and said that the prison was gloomy . She had gone on saying to the girl that she had not done the things that she was now imprisoned for . The girl had then answered \u201c no , you have not \u201d . PERSON considered that the applicant 's question had been leading in nature , leaving the girl with no other option than to answer the way she had .", "ORG refused the applicant 's requests . It reasoned :", "\u201c The applicant , PERSON and PERSON have given somewhat different testimonies on the discussions in prison . The applicant has stated that she had asked whether the children had been raped at their home whereas PERSON has not remembered that such a direct question had been put to the girl at all and PERSON has stated that PERSON had only replied to a question that appeared from the context . However , ORG finds it established that PERSON replied in the negative to the applicant 's question whether PERSON had given truthful statements about the sexual abuse .", "It has been established that ORG has not on her own initiative expressed her wish to alter her earlier statements in the case . It rather appears that PERSON has been trying to forget the sad events in her early childhood . She has refused to clarify them openly . Moreover , as PERSON has expressed her wish to re - approach her mother , whom she has not met for a long time , it is evident that she has been unable to give a considered response [ to the applicant 's question ] , given the circumstances in which the visit took place . It has thus not been established that the hearing of PERSON before the court or by any other means could bring additional evidence significant to the case .", "Also the fact that it would be particularly stressful for the now CARDINAL-year - old PERSON , given the personal nature and significance of the case , to be heard again speaks against hearing her . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ORG considered that as a hearing in court could be harmful to the children , now aged CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively , it was possible to use in evidence their statements during the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . It noted that the case turned on an assessment of the credibility of the children 's statements . In assessing their credibility particular regard had to be had to unclear factors such as the time that had passed since the acts and the children 's young age . Moreover , they had been exceptionally young and their family life had been chaotic . The credibility of their statements was increased by the fact that they had given similar accounts of the events . Further , they had given account of empirical details , which they could not have taken in by , for example , watching films or sexual acts between adults . Reference was here made to the nasty taste of yellow snot secreted from the penis and which they had washed away with toothpaste . A further example was the comparison made by the children between the sensation when touching with their tongue the gum in their mouth following a tooth loss and the slimy female genital area . In these circumstances , the court found that the children had been truthful when giving their statements .", "CARDINAL . As to the discussion during the visit to the prison , the court repeated the reasons in its decision of DATE . It also noted that PERSON , a psychologist , considered that PERSON was very prone to external influence . The court concluded that the discussions in prison were not relevant . The court upheld the lower court 's judgment insofar as the applicant 's conviction and sentence were concerned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested leave to appeal , arguing , inter alia , that PERSON , following her retraction of the allegations , should have been heard either in ORG or in an additional investigation . The applicant requested that PERSON be heard before ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , in person in one way or another , and that the applicant be given an opportunity to put questions to her .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL .

The competence to decide on investigation measures requested by a party lies with the head of investigation during the pre - trial investigation and with the public prosecutor after the case has been transferred to him or her ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , Act no .

Before the closing of the criminal investigation , the parties must be afforded the opportunity to present to the criminal investigation authority their statement on the material gathered during the investigation , if this is conducive to hastening or facilitating the hearing of the case in court . The statement is to be appended to the investigation record ( section DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) lays down the applicable rules on receiving testimony .", "CARDINAL . A statement in a pre - trial investigation record or another document may as a rule not be admitted as evidence in court .

If a person called as a witness is DATE , is mentally ill or mentally retarded , or his or her mental capacities have otherwise been impaired , the court shall , taking into consideration the circumstances , assess whether or not he or she may be heard as a witness ( LAW , LAW ) .
