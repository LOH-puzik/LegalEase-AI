On DATE the ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant against ORG decision . It stated that in a review of an investigator \u2019s decision not to initiate criminal proceedings under LAW CCrP a court \u2019s task was to check whether the procedure for the examination of a complaint regarding the commission of a crime had been observed . The ORG noted that ORG had examined the material gathered during the course of the inquiry and established that the applicant \u2019s arguments had been examined by the investigator . It fully endorsed ORG findings that the inquiry had been thorough and the investigator \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE lawful and reasoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE first deputy prosecutor of GPE annulled the investigator \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE as unlawful , lacking reasoning and proper assessment of evidence , and based on an inquiry which had not been thorough and had not exhausted all possibilities for collecting evidence . In particular , the applicant \u2019s allegations of illtreatment had not been refuted ; the circumstances in which he had received the injuries had not been established ; the existence of the pit at the place of the applicant \u2019s alleged ill - treatment had not been assessed ; the allegations of electric shocks had not been verified ; and the forensic medical expert had not been given all the necessary information ( including the applicant \u2019s version of the cause of the injuries ) . Consequently , the forensic expert ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not made a full assessment , in particular of the injuries recorded upon the applicant \u2019s admission to the ORG . The prosecutor further noted that ( i ) the ORG records , which recorded at what times in the period from CARDINAL until DATE the applicant had been taken from the detention facility for the purpose of carrying out investigative actions and when he had been brought back , had not been assessed , and ( ii ) the documents indicating the grounds for the applicant \u2019s absence from the detention facility were missing . It was necessary , inter alia , to establish the applicant \u2019s location and a detailed chronology of the events in which had had participated in the period from CARDINAL until DATE , taking into account the fact that he had actually been arrested at TIME on DATE , as established at the applicant \u2019s trial . The prosecutor ordered that the investigative committee of the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office carry out an additional inquiry .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s case was heard by the ORG . On DATE it ordered that a preliminary hearing be held in order to examine the applicant \u2019s request for the exclusion of some evidence as inadmissible . On DATE the applicant withdrew his request .

According to the trial records of DATE , in the course of the trial the applicant lodged a new request for the exclusion of some evidence as inadmissible , which he again withdrew .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment , the firstinstance court ( \u201c the trial court \u201d ) examined witnesses and other evidence collected in the course of the inquiry carried out by the investigative committee of the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office . In particular , it heard investigators A. and PERSON and police officers NORP and PERSON , who denied having ill - treated the applicant . A. , NORP and PERSON stated that the applicant had pointed out the location of PERSON \u2019s body . The trial court found it impossible to establish the circumstances in which the applicant had received the injuries . It noted that it could examine allegations of unlawful investigative methods as long as the admissibility of evidence was at issue , and that this was not the case because no evidence whose admissibility would have been prejudiced by the discovery of the applicant \u2019s injuries had been examined by it . It stressed that the circumstances in which the applicant \u2019s injuries had been inflicted could be established by the relevant law enforcement authorities by means of an inquiry .", "CARDINAL . In respect of an attack on PERSON in his car shortly before his murder , PERSON stated that he had seen the applicant punching PERSON to the head and body and PERSON trying to defend himself . In respect of the same episode another of the applicant \u2019s co - accused , PERSON . , who had also been in the car , stated that he had seen the applicant beating PERSON and PERSON covering himself from the blows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pleaded not guilty . When asked whether he had been taken to the place where PERSON \u2019s body had been found , he answered that he had been taken by car to an unknown place , where he had seen PERSON talking to police officers . PERSON had been covered in mud . The applicant had been told by a driver that PERSON had dug out PERSON \u2019s body with his bare hands . The applicant further stated that he had not written the statement of surrender and confession .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG established that the applicant had murdered PERSON by strangling and had stolen his car . It found the applicant guilty of murder and robbery and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The finding of the applicant \u2019s guilt was based , inter alia , on statements made by GPE and PERSON . ( his accomplices in the robbery and eyewitnesses to the murder ) . In deciding on the punishment for the robbery the ORG held that the applicant had played an active role in solving the crime by pointing out the location of PERSON \u2019s body , and that this constituted a mitigating circumstance . The applicant \u2019s coaccused , PERSON and PERSON . , were convicted of aggravated robbery and sentenced to DATE imprisonment respectively ; in DATE . \u2019s case the sentence was suspended .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against the judgment , complaining , inter alia , that the ORG should not have examined as evidence the witness statements made by A. , NORP and S. He further complained that his sentence in respect of the murder had been unfair because , in contrast with the decision on the punishment for the robbery , his disclosure of the whereabouts of PERSON \u2019s body had not been taken into account as a mitigating circumstance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the judgment of the ORG . It stated that in view of the disputed origin of the applicant \u2019s injuries the trial court had rightly not used evidence adduced at the time of the applicant \u2019s alleged ill - treatment . It agreed with the applicant that the record of his arrest had been drawn up TIME after his actual arrest at TIME on DATE , in breach of LAW . It further noted that the trial court had rectified that violation by including the time spent by the applicant in pre - trial detention in the sentence to be served ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
