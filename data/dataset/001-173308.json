NORP The applicant , Mr LANGUAGE , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was a soldier in the NORP armed forces from DATE until DATE . On DATE of his service , he was formally instructed that , pursuant to the pertinent internal regulation of the armed forces , the consumption of drugs was prohibited both on duty and off duty and was subject to disciplinary sanctions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . From DATE until DATE , the applicant consumed cannabis in his spare time on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . After another soldier had informed the applicant \u2019s disciplinary superior ( PERSON ) about this , the latter confronted the applicant with the accusation on DATE . The applicant denied having consumed drugs and agreed to have a rapid drug test carried out that same day . As the test turned out to be positive , the applicant was questioned a second time . The disciplinary superior informed the applicant of his right to remain silent by virtue of LAW of LAW of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but did not tell him about the possibility of contacting a lawyer , as this right was not laid down in the said provision . The disciplinary superior also told the applicant that , if he chose not to remain silent , he was obliged to make true statements under LAW . The applicant then confessed to having consumed cannabis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the disciplinary superior informed ORG , who launched preliminary criminal proceedings against the applicant . On DATE these proceedings were discontinued because the applicant \u2019s guilt was considered to be of a minor nature and because prosecution was not in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s disciplinary superior informed the Prosecutor of the armed forces ( Wehrdisziplinaranwalt ) that he had referred the matter to ORG . On DATE , in an internal document , the Prosecutor of the armed forces ordered a preliminary investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , of his own motion , went to see the deputy of the disciplinary superior . He again admitted to having consumed cannabis .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s second confession , his disciplinary superior advised him to see the PERSON ( \u201c person of confidence \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) so as to give him the opportunity to convince the latter to make a statement that was favourable to him . The disciplinary superior informed the applicant of his right to object to the PERSON being part of the proceedings . As the applicant did not object , the disciplinary superior also asked the PERSON to talk to the applicant . Shortly after , the applicant went to see the PERSON and told him about the background of his drug consumption .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the Prosecutor of the armed forces had asked the disciplinary superior to do so , the applicant was informed for the first time of his right to contact a lawyer . He was also asked whether he agreed to the PERSON being given access to the file . The applicant gave his consent without asking a lawyer for advice .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was formally questioned for the first time . He remained silent . DATE , the PERSON was questioned and gave evidence about the applicant \u2019s statements during their conversation , as the applicant had not objected to the PERSON being heard ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE disciplinary court proceedings against the applicant were opened . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor of the armed forces charged the applicant with the disciplinary offence of having breached his duties with intent by regularly consuming cannabis from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of a disciplinary offence pursuant to LAW on ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It ordered that the applicant be banned from promotion for DATE and that his salary be cut by a twentieth ( i.e. MONEY ) for DATE . It considered the pecuniary fine to be necessary for educational reasons , as the applicant had no realistic prospect of promotion ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG , the applicant remained silent . The court , therefore , based its findings on the result of the drug test and , mainly , on statements made by the applicant \u2019s disciplinary superior . Emphasising the difference between criminal proceedings and disciplinary proceedings , it considered that admitting these pieces of evidence did not violate the applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial . It pointed out that , when the applicant had first confessed his drug consumption to his disciplinary superior on DATE , after the latter had informed him about his right to remain silent , the proceedings were at the stage of a disciplinary investigation by a soldier \u2019s disciplinary superior ; the Prosecutor of the armed forces had not yet opened a preliminary investigation . It considered that a soldier only had to be informed of his right to contact a lawyer once the latter proceedings were opened . Hence , the evidence obtained from the applicant \u2019s first confession of CARDINAL DATE could be admitted ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , the applicant \u2019s second confession of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) could not be admitted as evidence because the prosecutor of the armed forces had ordered the initiation of a preliminary investigation prior to that date , which was why the applicant had to be informed of his right to contact a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG . It found that neither the applicant \u2019s first confession of DATE nor his second confession of DATE , nor the statements by his disciplinary superior , respectively the superior \u2019s deputy \u2013 to whom he had confessed on those occasions \u2013 could be admitted as evidence , because the applicant had not been informed of his right to contact a lawyer in advance . The court reasoned that such instruction , which was not required for minor disciplinary measures imposed by the disciplinary superior himself , was always required for evidence to be admitted in disciplinary court proceedings so as to ensure the fairness of the latter .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court considered that the finding that the applicant had consumed cannabis in his spare time , in breach of his duties as a soldier , could be based on CARDINAL pieces of evidence . First , the statement of a witness who had known about the applicant \u2019s drug consumption prior to the commencement of any proceedings . Second , the drug test to which the applicant had agreed after the initial questioning by his disciplinary superior on DATE . The court noted , however , that the examining physician had indicated that the positive result could also have been caused by passive smoking of cannabis and was not in itself sufficient to prove the applicant \u2019s cannabis consumption . Third , the statement of the PERSON about the conversation he had had with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The court found that he did not have a right to refuse to give testimony . The PERSON did not belong to the persons listed in either LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) who could refuse testimony on professional grounds . It was constant case - law of the domestic courts that this provision did not extend to employee representatives or staff council members , and there was no reason to treat the Vertrauensperson more favourably than those persons . A right to refuse testimony did not follow from LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) either , as the pertinent internal regulations of the armed forces authorised the PERSON to testify before ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that hearing the PERSON as a witness did not violate LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The fact that the applicant \u2019s disciplinary superior had advised him to contact the PERSON did not amount to \u201c deception \u201d within the meaning of LAW . When giving this advice , the disciplinary superior had not been aware of the fact that the PERSON might be heard as a witness in court proceedings against the applicant and had no intention of deceiving the applicant as to the lack of confidentiality of his statements to the PERSON . No pressure had been exerted on the applicant to confess his drug consumption to the PERSON . Referring to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court took into account that the role of the PERSON in disciplinary proceedings was a neutral one and not comparable to a defence lawyer acting on behalf of the accused soldier . The intention behind advising the applicant to talk to the PERSON was , thus , to give him the opportunity to convince the PERSON to make a statement that was favourable to him .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , LAW did not prevent hearing the ORG as a witness . Noting that the provision obliged him to observe professional secrecy vis - \u00e0 - vis third parties and that the NORP legislator , as a rule , distinguished between the obligation to observe secrecy and the right to refuse testimony , ORG observed that courts were not a third party within the meaning of that provision , which , in addition , did not contain a right to refuse testimony . The term \u201c Vertrauensperson \u201d could not lead to a different result . This formulation reflected the fact that he was elected by the soldiers , hence he had the confidence of the majority of voters , and was entrusted with the task of representing their interests . This did not imply that soldiers accused of wrongdoing could rely , without restriction , on the PERSON to remain silent in proceedings of which he was made part . Rather , LAW of ORG showed that the PERSON had an independent role in disciplinary court proceedings and his task was to provide the perspective of a fellow soldier , so as to allow for an informed exercise of discretion . The interests of the accused soldier were sufficiently protected by his right to object to the participation of the FAC in the disciplinary court proceedings prior to their opening . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG did not give the accused soldier the right to object , at a later stage , to the PERSON being heard with retroactive effect .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG found that admitting the statement of the ORG as evidence did not violate constitutional law . The applicant \u2019s right to protection of personality rights and his right to a fair trial had not been violated because , although advised to do so by his disciplinary superior , he had freely chosen to inform the PERSON about his drug consumption . He had also been aware that he was not legally obliged to talk to the FAC . Moreover , neither his disciplinary superior nor the PERSON had told the applicant that the ORG would treat the information as confidential . On the contrary , the applicant had repeatedly been asked whether he objected to the FAC being part of the disciplinary proceedings and had decided not to object . He could thus not rely on the content of his statements made to the PERSON remaining confidential .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court noted that , prior to making his statement to the PERSON , the applicant had already confessed his drug consumption to his disciplinary superior and the superior \u2019s deputy without having been instructed about his right to consult a lawyer . It acknowledged that the applicant may thus have decided to talk to the PERSON because he was under the impression that he could no longer undo his earlier selfincriminatory statements . The PERSON did not instruct him that none of his earlier confessions could be used as evidence against him ( so - called \u201c qualified instruction \u201d ) . However , the conversation the applicant had had with the PERSON could not be compared to a situation of questioning an accused , for its purpose was not to further the investigation of the matter . As the PERSON was , therefore , not obliged to instruct the applicant that he could be heard as a witness in the court proceedings , he was even less obliged to provide a qualified instruction to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG found that admitting the statement of the ORG as evidence did not violate the applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial guaranteed by LAW , noting that it could be left open whether the disciplinary proceedings at issue fell under the criminal or under the civil limb of the provision . Noting that LAW did not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such , which was therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law , the question which had to be answered was whether the proceedings as a whole , including the way in which the evidence was obtained , were fair . Referring to , inter alia , the judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) , it pointed out that the nature and degree of the compulsion , the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures , and the use to which any material so obtained was put had to be assessed when examining whether a procedure had extinguished the very essence of the privilege against selfincrimination . The applicant had talked to the PERSON voluntarily , his confession had not been elicited through subterfuge and there were no elements of oppression or coercion . The court also noted that the applicant could raise his arguments as to why the statement of the PERSON should not be admitted as evidence before domestic courts and that he could question him in person at the appeal hearing . Emphasising that the statement of the PERSON was not the only piece of evidence used and that all CARDINAL pieces of evidence used were consistent with each other , it concluded that the proceedings , taken as a whole , were not unfair .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s complaint , without giving reasons . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW on the Legal Status of Soldiers ( PERSON \u00fcber die PERSON ) provided that a culpable breach of a soldier \u2019s duties constituted a disciplinary offence . Pursuant to the internal regulation of ORG ( Zentrale Dienstvorschrift ) CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , the consumption of drugs was prohibited both on duty and off duty and was subject to disciplinary sanctions . According to the constant caselaw of the domestic courts , the consumption of drugs would normally be sanctioned by a promotion ban or , in severe cases , by a demotion ( see ORG , CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) . Pursuant to LAW of LAW of ORG ) , a salary cut may be imposed in addition to a promotion ban , if it appeared that the promotion ban did not have an impact on the soldier \u2019s career in the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW of ORG provided that , where facts become known that justified the suspicion of a soldier \u2019s breach of duty , the disciplinary superior of that soldier had to establish the facts by conducting the necessary investigations . The soldier was to be informed about the investigation as soon as possible without putting the purpose of the investigation at risk , and had to be informed at DATE first questioning of which breaches of duty he was accused . At the same time , he had to be advised that he was free to remain silent . If he chose to speak , he had to give a truthful account in relation to official matters . If the instruction required was omitted or not properly given , the statement given by the soldier could not be used to his detriment . In cases warranting the opening of disciplinary court proceedings , the disciplinary superior had to refer the matter to the Prosecutor of the armed forces ( Section CARDINAL ) . Pursuant to LAW of the same LAW , the provisions of LAW were to be applied to disciplinary court proceedings in addition to the provisions of LAW , unless the nature of the proceedings was opposed to this .", "CARDINAL . The status of the PERSON , including the mode of his designation , his competencies and powers , and his role within the hierarchy , were laid down in ORG ) . At the material time , that Act , which has since been amended , provided that the PERSON was elected by groups of soldiers for a period of DATE . He was tasked with contributing to the good cooperation between superiors and subordinates and the consolidation of comradely trust . He closely cooperated with the disciplinary superior , both in the interests of the soldiers and those of the armed forces . The PERSON had to be informed and heard with regard to measures falling within the scope of his mandate and , in certain scenarios , had a right to make suggestions to the disciplinary superior . He had to be heard with regard to day - to - DATE matters of service and should be heard on a variety of matters concerning staff . Where no agreement could be reached , it was possible to refer certain matters to a more senior level within the hierarchy . The PERSON was also concerned with staff welfare and offered counselling sessions to fellow soldiers as needed . At the material time , LAW , which has since been changed , provided that the PERSON had to observe professional secrecy vis - \u00e0 - vis third parties in relation to facts and matters he learned about in the exercise of his functions . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided , at the time , that the ORG had to be heard about the soldier concerned and the facts at issue where the opening of court proceedings against a soldier for a disciplinary offence was intended , unless the soldier objected to such hearing . That hearing served the purpose to ensure that the soldier \u2019s interests were taken into account prior to a decision being taken on the opening of court proceedings against him ( see ORG , CARDINAL ORG DATE , decision of CARDINAL DATE ) . LAW stated that a transcript of that hearing had to be recorded .", "CARDINAL .
