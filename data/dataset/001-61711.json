They did not feel that they had enough evidence to bring charges and consequently some officers from the Police , ORG and ORG started talking about using different methods of dealing with certain members of the NORP community . A special team was formed for this purpose by , inter alia , the Chief of Police , PERSON and the Chief of ORG , PERSON . This team consisted both of members of ORG and certain civilians , including PERSON . The activities of this special team were known to other members of the ORG and the Intelligence Branch of the ORG ( the GPE ) . The kidnapping and the killing of PERSON and his friends formed part of such activities . It was established that these persons were helping the ORG financially . The way they were kidnapped and killed did not bear any resemblance to the activities of a ORG or other underground organisation known to us . Police identity cards and policing methods were used during the kidnapping of PERSON and his friends , otherwise it would not have been possible to kidnap them and to kill them as there are checkpoints on the roads along which they would have been stopped . To go through these checkpoints could only have been possible by making use of an official title \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

When the photograph of the red sports car with registration number CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL was shown to PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who had given statements about the incident in DATE , they all stated that it was not like the car they had seen that day , and that a long time had elapsed since the incident .", "CARDINAL . The photo - fits were also compared with the photograph of ORG , another suspect detained in connection with the GPE investigation . The report of the criminal laboratory dated DATE concluded that CARDINAL of the photo - fits bore resemblances to the photograph and that the person in the photo - fit could be PERSON . Accordingly , on DATE ORG issued an arrest warrant for PERSON . At that time , PERSON \u00d6z was detained in the PERSON prision in GPE in connection with another crime . On DATE ORG gave a statement to the public prosecutor . He stated that he had not been in GPE DATE and DATE and that he did not know who had carried out the kidnapping on DATE . He further stated that he did not fit the description of any of the abductors as he had had a beard at the time of the kidnapping .

The prosecutor sent the investigation file to ORG which , in the prosecutor 's opinion , was the competent court to prosecute PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor attached to ORG took a decision of non - jurisdiction in respect of PERSON . The prosecutor concluded that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the killings had been carried out by or on behalf of an illegal organisation .

On DATE the ORG public prosecutor , noting that ORG had been arrested and put on trial for the killings , decided to continue the search for the other perpetrators .

Recalling that PERSON , PERSON and ORG had been kidnapped by CARDINAL persons and then killed in the area between GPE , Adapazar\u0131 and Bolu , ORG held that these killings resembled the above - mentioned killings in the same area . Considering that the defendant was already facing prosecution before another court for membership of an organisation which was allegedly responsible for killing persons who had much in common with the deceased persons in the present case and as there was no other evidence to suggest that these killings were carried out for personal reasons , ORG concluded on DATE that it was precluded from examining the merits of the case for reasons of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The case file was transferred to ORG which had jurisdiction to deal with cases involving organised crime . On DATE ORG concluded that it too did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case . The court held that according to the PERSON public prosecutor 's indictment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG was charged with multiple murders .

When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined , the difference between those NORP supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay in the financial strength the latter represented in economic terms .
