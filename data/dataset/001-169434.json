The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their former Agent , Ms E. Baltutyt\u0117 .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is a known NORP actor . The second applicant is his wife . She is also the daughter of the former President of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a NORP newspaper , \u201c PERSON \u201d , published an article entitled \u201c PERSON DATE a feast for the eyes . The GPE couple was showing off their beauty [ private parts ] in PERSON ( PERSON \u2013 desertas akims / ORG demonstravo savo gro\u017eybes ) \u201d . The article was printed on the front page and continued up to the fourth page of the newspaper , and was also published online on the newspaper \u2019s website . The front page of the newspaper had CARDINAL - page photographs of the applicants in the nude , which had been taken on the nudist beach at ORG , a seaside resort in GPE . Altogether , CARDINAL photos of the applicants in the nude on the beach were published .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Inspector of ORG concluded that the above - mentioned publication had breached the applicants\u2019 right to privacy .", "CARDINAL . The applicants instituted court proceedings , arguing a breach of privacy . They claimed that the publication had caused them great distress , given that CARDINAL photographs had been printed on the front page of the newspaper and presented in a sensational manner to increase the sales of the newspaper . From the content of the article and the photographs , it was clear that journalists had secretly followed the applicants and photographed them . This had taken place in a specific secluded environment \u2013 a nudist beach DATE where no reasonable person would wish to be photographed ( as regards the interpretation of the concept of a secluded place , the applicants relied on GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ) . After the humiliating publication of the photographs , which concerned very private aspects of their lives , the applicants and their family had been deeply psychologically affected and had also received a lot of unwanted attention . Furthermore , the photographs had been published on the newspaper \u2019s website , which meant that readers could comment on the applicants\u2019 appearance . Some of those comments were extremely insulting . The applicants also contended that , following the publication , the second applicant \u2019s health had deteriorated and the first applicant had lost a job on a television show which he had been promised .", "CARDINAL . The applicants asked the court to award each of them CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( EUR ) ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicants\u2019 claim in full . The court relied extensively on the ORG \u2019s case - law as to the need to balance the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression , as well on ORG no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) to the effect that the right to privacy entailed avoidance of being placed in a false light , non - revelation of irrelevant and embarrassing facts , and prohibition to publish private photographs ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court noted that the applicants were well - known people in GPE and that , by publishing the photographs , the newspaper had blatantly damaged their honour , dignity and right to a private life . There was no public interest in publishing the photographs , given that they were private and did not concern matters which society had a legitimate interest in knowing . On the contrary , by such an act the newspaper was attempting to satisfy readers\u2019 curiosity by creating a sensation , and was pursuing its commercial interests . For that purpose , the newspaper had consciously placed their photographs on the front page , knowing that the nude photographs of the applicants , who were well - known people in GPE , would no doubt attract the ORG attention . The fact that the applicants had been photographed on a nudist beach did not diminish the breach of privacy , because nudity was an important part of private life , and publishing the ORG nude photographs with inappropriate ( nekorekti\u0161komis ) headlines was particularly offensive .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court also noted that that issue of the newspaper had had a large print run , and that the photographs had also been placed on the newspaper \u2019s website , thus giving a great many people access to them . The court observed that , following the decision of ORG , the newspaper had had the opportunity to apologise to the applicants for the photographs , which could have lessened the damage , but it had failed to do so . Nor had the newspaper attempted to settle the case before ORG , thus confirming its malicious behaviour .", "CARDINAL . As for the sum to be awarded to compensate for the non - pecuniary damage the applicants had sustained , ORG observed that neither NORP nor international law set out criteria to determine such a sum . However , guidelines had been provided by ORG , which had underlined the need to take into account the situation of each particular case . Of relevance was whether society had an interest in making the relevant information public , the victim \u2019s reaction to the publication , and the actions of the media . In the case at hand , taking into account the particularly gross breach of the applicants\u2019 right to privacy by a newspaper which had been printed in \u201c large volume \u201d , ORG found it reasonable to award the requested sums in full , that is each of the applicants was to receive ORG .", "The applicants were also awarded LTL CARDINAL for legal costs and LTL CARDINAL for court fees , the expenses they had incurred when lodging the civil claim . Those sums were to be paid to them by the newspaper .", "CARDINAL . NORP The newspaper appealed , requesting , inter alia , that the abovementioned sum in respect of non - pecuniary damage be lowered .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision , noting that the published photographs had clearly been offensive and degrading to the applicants . The situation in which they had been photographed fell within the sphere of private life , and was one in which no reasonable person would wish to be photographed . There was no public interest whatsoever in publishing CARDINAL photographs of the sort published by the newspaper .", "CARDINAL . As to the question of the sum to be awarded as compensation for non - pecuniary damage , ORG noted that the newspaper had assets with a value of LTL MONEY ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) , and that in DATE the newspaper \u2019s statutory capital had been increased . Therefore , the newspaper \u2019s plea for the award in respect of non - pecuniary damage to be lowered on the basis of its allegedly difficult financial situation was unfounded . In this connection , the appellate court also observed that the photographs had been widely distributed because the newspaper had been sold throughout GPE , and had been printed on the front page of DATE \u2019s issue as the most \u201c gossip - worthy \u201d news of DATE . To make matters worse , the photographs had been published on the internet . Following the publication , a television programme called \u201c PERSON \u201d had been announced , which had been based on the photographs in question . The only reason the programme had not been broadcast was because of a court injunction . In such circumstances , the first - instance court had correctly found that the applicants had suffered following the publication . Also taking into account that the newspaper had been unwilling to acknowledge its transgression , the sum awarded by ORG was reasonable .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the newspaper \u2019s argument that the first - instance court had deviated from ORG guidelines as to the sums to be awarded as compensation for non - pecuniary damage . In fact , according to ORG , no case analogous or very similar to the applicant \u2019s case had [ ever ] been examined in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG ordered the newspaper to pay each of the applicants LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in respect of lawyers\u2019 costs at the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . An appeal on points of law being lodged by the newspaper , on CARDINAL DATE ORG varied the lower courts\u2019 decisions . It held that a nudist beach was not a public place . Accordingly , a person could reasonably expect privacy there . The applicants\u2019 behaviour on that beach had not been in breach of good morals . ORG entirely agreed with the lower ORG conclusion that the newspaper had gravely breached the applicants\u2019 right to privacy by abusing its right to impart information , by imparting information merely for readers\u2019 curiosity , and consequently to obtain pecuniary advantage .", "CARDINAL . ORG also observed that there were no legislative limits on the sum which could be awarded as compensation for nonpecuniary damage , thus giving the courts rather wide discretion in such matters . Nonetheless , it considered it important to follow its earlier case - law to the effect that , when assessing the sum to be awarded , the courts should take into account the value protected by law which had been compromised ( \u012fstatymu saugoma vertyb\u0117 / teisinis g\u0117ris ) ( in the present case , the applicants\u2019 right to privacy ) , and also adhere to the sums that the courts had awarded in analogous cases ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . In the case at hand , each of the applicants had been awarded LTL CARDINAL , which was equal to or in excess of the awards of LTL MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL ) \u2013 LTL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) made in cases concerning nonpecuniary damage caused by severe physical injury , where more important values ( such as life and health ) had been at stake ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG also had regard to its case - law , where awards between LTL CARDINAL had been granted in relation to breaches of the right to protection of one \u2019s image ( teis\u0117s \u012f atvaizd\u0105 pa\u017eeidimas ) or the right to privacy ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the above , ORG concluded that the award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL to each applicant was excessive . It was therefore reasonable to grant each of the applicants LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . Such sums would not contradict established case - law , and would be adequate compensation for the damage which the applicants had suffered and sufficient in respect of both defending the applicants\u2019 right to privacy and deterring the abuse of press freedom , thus balancing CARDINAL competing values which were equal in weight \u2013 privacy and the freedom to impart information .", "CARDINAL . ORG also decided that the applicants were to bear some of the newspaper \u2019s litigation costs ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , because PERCENT of the sum which the applicants had claimed had been awarded to them . ORG also noted that the sums which both the applicants and the newspaper had paid to their respective lawyers in connection with the proceedings concerning the appeal on points of law were higher than those recommended by ORG , and thus not entirely justified . As a result , the applicants were together ordered to pay the newspaper ORG for litigation costs and ORG for court fees . The applicants thus received LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in total , or LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) each .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the magazine ORG published an article about the applicant PERSON , where she explained how she had lost QUANTITY in weight . In DATE the same magazine published a story where the applicant PERSON gave an interview about his family life , also answering questions put by a journalist about the other applicant \u2019s ( his wife \u2019s ) plastic surgery , and giving details about her weight loss .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of GPE reads :", "\u201c A person \u2019s private life shall be inviolable ...", "The law and the courts shall protect everyone from arbitrary or unlawful interference in his private and family life , or from encroachment upon his honour and dignity . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The plaintiff in that case was awarded LTL CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage suffered as a result of physical injury .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in civil case no .

CARDINALK-CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG agreed that an award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL in a civil case was sufficient to compensate for the plaintiff \u2019s mental suffering where a local television station had wrongfully accused the plaintiff of having committed a traffic violation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a ruling in civil case no . ORG - CARDINAL/CARDINAL concerning a civil claim by a woman , PERSON , for breach of privacy in respect of an article in a DATE newspaper , PERSON , entitled \u201c A date with a lesbian \u201d ( \u201c Pasimatymas su lesbiete \u201d ) . The case concerned an article which had included CARDINAL photographs . PERSON was in CARDINAL of those photographs , which was in a large format . She had been photographed from the front , although her name had not been disclosed .

The court also noted that the newspaper \u2019s financial situation was good , it had a large print throughout GPE . The newspaper had not apologised to the plaintiff or paid her damages , even though it had initially promised to do so . However , the sum claimed by the plaintiff , LTL CARDINAL , was clearly excessive . It was therefore reasonable to award her LTL CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage . That sum was upheld by the appellate court , which underlined that the article \u201c A date with a lesbian \u201d was conflicting ( vertinamas prie\u0161taringai ) in a homophobic society , and people whose photographs were linked to that article could therefore experience negative consequences , as indeed in GPE \u2019s case . She had had to explain herself to her parents , colleagues at work and friends from times of studies . The award of LTL CARDINAL would also not impede the DATE commercial activity of the defendant .", "CARDINAL . The newspaper lodged an appeal on points of law , arguing that the award for non - pecuniary damage was too high . ORG noted that it was important to adhere to the principle of non - discrimination , which meant that similar cases should be decided similarly , and which also meant that , in analogous situations , awards for non - pecuniary damage should be comparable . ORG also relied on its earlier ruling to the effect that courts should not only follow the criteria established in legal norms and court practice , but should also take into account the awards already granted in analogous cases .", "CARDINAL . ORG thus distinguished CARDINAL categories of cases .", "Firstly , there were cases where a plaintiff \u2019s privacy had been breached on account of the arrangement of his or her nude photographs with offensive text and headlines ( ORG referred to the instant case of PERSON and PERSON ) , or where information regarding \u201c family secrets \u201d or health had been made public ( ORG referred to its ruling of DATE in \u017dvagulis\u2019 case ) , or where information about private life had been published together with photographs , which had amounted to a breach of the right to a private life . The awards in those cases were , respectively , LTL CARDINAL , LTL CARDINAL and LTL CARDINAL .", "As to the second category , ORG referred to some cases where the press had used plaintiffs\u2019 private photographs without permission , or had accused them of crimes , where the non - pecuniary damage awards were LTL CARDINAL .", "The third category concerned cases where photographs of plaintiffs who were well - known people in society had been published without their consent , and for the purpose of a newspaper gaining financial benefit from advertisement , where the awards for non - pecuniary damage were LTL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG then held that , in the case of GPE , the award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL was too high , because it did not correspond to the abovementioned court practice . PERSON \u2019s photograph had been published only as an illustration of the article , and neither her personal data nor information about her private life had been made public . Moreover , the photograph had been taken at a public event when PERSON was posing ( vie\u0161ame renginyje , ie\u0161kovei pozuojant ) . In the view of ORG , an award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL would be fair and adequate in respect of the non - pecuniary damage sustained by PERSON in relation to the breach of her right to protection of her image , and to prevent the abuse of freedom of expression by the press .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a ruling in civil case no . CARDINALK-CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which concerned ORG civil claim for defamation against a television channel , Tele-CARDINAL . In particular , PERSON , who is a singer , had complained that in DATE , during a television broadcast , a presenter had made statements about someone else allegedly being the father of PERSON \u2019s child , had made allegations about PERSON \u2019s actual sexual orientation , and , in the latter context , had also claimed that PERSON had been operated on in clinics in GPE DATE after \u201c he had sustained trauma to his anus from a blunt object \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that information about PERSON \u2019s fatherhood , his sexual orientation , and his unverified operation concerned his private life , notwithstanding PERSON being well - known because he was a singer . Moreover , disseminating such information had no public interest . On the contrary , having had regard to the manner in which the information had been presented , ORG held that the only aim in disseminating it had been to spread gossip to satisfy the curiosity of a certain category of television viewers . The fact that PERSON had communicated with the media before did not mean that he had lost his right to privacy . Having examined the case in the light of the ORG \u2019s case - law ( ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE , and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) [ ORG ] , ORG .

Although PERSON asked the courts to award him LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL to compensate for the non - pecuniary damage , ORG found that the lower courts had correctly applied Article CARDINAL of LAW , and had had a proper basis for their decision to award GPE CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation .", "CARDINAL . As concerns the division of legal costs , LAW states :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A court orders the legal costs of the party to the proceedings in whose favour a court decision has been adopted to be paid by the other party to the proceedings ...", "CARDINAL .
