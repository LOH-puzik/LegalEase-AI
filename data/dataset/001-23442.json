SWEDEN (no. 2)", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , PERSON , born in DATE and unmarried , lives at FAC , a suburb of GPE . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , born in DATE , lives at GPE , another suburb of GPE . The third applicant is their son PERSON born on DATE . They are represented before the ORG by Mrs S. Westerberg , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The first and second applicants have never been married and have periodically cohabited . The present application is a sequel to a previous application ( no . ORG ) lodged by them and other members of the family on CARDINAL DATE with the former ORG . The previous one concerned various complaints relating to the taking into care in DATE of J. and his brother PERSON ( born in DATE ) , subsequent refusals to lift the care order and restrictions on access as well as the procedure . On DATE the Commission declared the application admissible in respect of PERSON complaint about the length of the access proceedings and PERSON complaint about the lack of a court remedy to have a determination of his right of access to his son PERSON , while declaring the remainder of the application inadmissible . Like the Commission in its report of CARDINAL DATE ( former LAW , ORG in FAC and PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Reports CARDINAL-I ) , unanimously concluded that there had been a violation of LAW with regard to the first applicant but not with respect to the second applicant . It further found unanimously that it was not necessary to examine his complaints under LAW .", "The above - mentioned care order is still in force and the children live with their respective foster parents .", "In DATE ORG limited the mother \u2019s access to J. in accordance with his wishes . J. has since DATE refused to see his parents more frequently than twice a year and has also stated that he does not wish to see his father alone .", "In DATE the mother submitted a request to ORG for the termination of the care order . She sought in the alternative extended access rights with respect to J. Also the father made an application for a right of access .", "The ORG requested an investigation by the social services , which submitted a report on DATE . The applicants have not provided the ORG with a copy , but contents of the report are summarised in the judgment of DATE referred to below , according to which the following was stated . ORG ( Stadsdelsn\u00e4mnden ) was striving to increase the first applicant \u2019s access to J. and this would take place as soon as J. showed a sign of willingness to do so . He had however expressed that he did not wish to meet his mother more frequently or his father together with his mother and that he still refused to accompany his mother to her home . He was functioning well at school though he pursued consultations with a school psychologist . He needed calm and stability . ORG had regular contact with the first applicant concerning the children \u2019s situation and access . Her social situation remained on the whole unchanged .", "On DATE ORG decided not to terminate the care and rejected the ORG request for extended access .", "The first and the second applicant appealed against ORG decision to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) . The latter held an oral hearing , at which the first and second applicants were represented by a lawyer and PERSON was represented by a public counsel .", "In so far as concerned J. , the first and the second applicants requested the court to grant the latter , with immediate effect , access to J. every other DATE in his home , or such other location as agreed by the first and second applicants , for instance in her home , so that the whole family could meet . The access should take place without any supervision by the social authorities or the foster parents .", "The representative of ORG recalled an incident at a certain clinic in DATE when chaos had prevailed and the first applicant had struck the children . Sometime thereafter , PERSON wished to reduce the access from a normal level to twice a year , which has turned out to be satisfactory from his point of view . He did not wish to meet his father in the mother \u2019s absence .", "The public counsel , representing ORG , submitted that it would not be reasonable to force J. to increase the access . He had openly stated that meeting his parents twice a year was enough and that he did not wish to meet them beyond that .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG decision . It held inter alia :", "\u201c ORG finds that ORG decision of DATE is lawful . ...", "On DATE , when ORG reviewed the preparations for taking into public care under LAW , it found that the [ first applicant ] had such physical and psychological deficiencies that she could not provide her children with the norms and rules they needed for their social development . She was further unable to provide them with the necessary stimulation . Since the children \u2019s birth she has received intensive support from all levels but , despite this , her children appeared disturbed . From the children \u2019s birth , respectively in DATE and DATE , until theirs being taken into care in DATE , [ the first applicant ] had received extensive support as follows . After giving birth , she lived in a special home and when she later got her own home she received support in the form of contact with social welfare officers , childcare personnel , home assistance and a psychologist . For a while she even had a home therapist . Despite all of this , she did not manage to take care of her children herself . In view of this ORG found that there were such deficiencies in the children \u2019s care that it constituted a danger to their health and development .", "According to what has emerged in the present case , it does not appear that [ the first applicant \u2019s ] ability to fulfil the children \u2019s needs has improved . It is true that the children have become older but PERSON has been disturbed in his development and has a strong need for care , including [ special education ] . Beyond that he needs continuous care of not only practical but also psychological nature , as well as a foreseeable home environment , in order for his needs to be fulfilled . His foster home offers this kind of environment ... J. is talented and is doing well at school . Nothing has come to light which suggests that he has any problems in his relations with his fellows . Since early childhood his personality carries a deep emotional disturbance , which may at times be expressed through aggressive and violent behaviour and a need for a structured environment . He has a need for a continued contact with a psychologist even after enjoying a stable home environment where his strengths and weaknesses can be met with understanding and cautious guidance . His foster home provided such a home environment . ...", "As regards the question of access , this has been the subject of review on previous occasions . The competent courts had then held that closer contacts than what had been decided would prejudice the PERSON need for security and continuity in the care arrangements . As regards ORG , having regard to his fragile character and his need for structure and norms , finds his access to his mother adequate . As regards J , it finds that it is most desirable that he meets his parents more often but his own views on the matter should be respected . The access should therefore not go beyond what has been decided by ORG . On the other hand , attempts should be made to make him change his attitude in the long run . In the view of ORG it would be positive were PERSON and PERSON to meet more frequently , which could be a ground for the family to meet more often . A contact person should still be present during meetings , but in the long run , as the boys get older , ORG should try without such presence .", "In its review ORG shall apply LAW . It does not find that the limitations on the right to respect for private and family life decided in the present case under LAW go beyond what can be regarded as a justified interference under LAW .", "The ORG has further had regard to the DATE LAW on the Rights of the Child . It finds that ORG and ORG rights under LAW have been fully respected in the measures adopted by the social authroties . \u201d", "Both the first and the second applicants appealed against the judgment to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . Before the latter court the second applicant also requested termination of the care order . In DATE ORG dismissed this request on the ground that he , who was not the child \u2019s custodian , had no locus standi of his own in that issue . For the remainder , it upheld the lower court \u2019s rejection . It stated inter alia :", "\u201c Under LAW of LAW , a public care measure under section CARDINAL shall be lifted when the measure is no longer necessary or at the latest when the young person concerned has reached DATE . It is thus the young person \u2019s need for care which is decisive for whether the public care shall continue . A public care order may be lifted if the conditions at the [ biological parent \u2019s ] home are such that care outside the home is no longer justified or that the custody holder is able to provide for the special needs of the young person concerned . It must therefore be established that the conditions in the home , which grounded the taking into public care , have ceased to exist and the current situation is satisfactory . As pointed out by ORG , it must therefore be ascertained that there has been a continuing and stable improvement in the home conditions .", "[ The first applicant ] lacks on the whole insight into the defects that in DATE led to the taking into public care of her sons PERSON and J. It does not emerge that there have been any decisive changes in the situation and this has not even been claimed . The fact that the children have become older is not of decisive importance , in particular as the children have different needs that must be provided for . The public care under the DATE Act shall therefore continue .", "Under section CARDINAL of the Act , a young person \u2019s needs for contact with his parents and other person who has custody of him shall be accommodated as far as possible . If it is necessary in order to achieve the purposes of the public care , ORG may decide how access should be exercised . [ The second applicant ] is not the holder of custody with respect to J. and does not have a right of access according to a judgment or a contract . However , [ the first applicant ] , who is a custody holder , agrees that the he has the access that he claims . ORG decision and ORG judgment recognise that both of them have a right of access . There is no ground for quashing that decision in so far as concerns access .", "In view of the children \u2019s reactions during and after access with [ the first applicant ] it must be assumed that the access which now takes place corresponds , both as to time and form , to the children \u2019s present needs for contact . [ The first and second applicants\u2019 ] claim for increase access is therefore rejected . \u201d", "Leave to appeal was refused by ORG ( regeringsr\u00e4tten ) on DATE .", "The decisions disputed in the present case were taken under LAW containing Special Provisions on ORG DATE ( lagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provides :", "\u201c ORG is responsible for accommodating as far as possible the young person \u2019s needs of contact with his parents or other person who has custody of him .", "If it is necessary in order to achieve the purposes of care measures taken under LAW , ORG may", "CARDINAL . decide how the right of access to the young person shall be exercised by a parent or other person who has custody of him , or", "CARDINAL . decide that the young person \u2019s place of residence may not be disclosed to the parent or custodian .", "The ORG shall reconsider at least once DATE whether such decision as referred to in the second paragraph continues to be needed . \u201d", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW an appeal may be lodged with ORG against a decision of ORG with respect to access . ORG may review a decision by ORG in so far as its subject - matter is covered by section CARDINAL of LAW ( or LAW of LAW ; see ORG , PERSON DATE , DATE ) .", "The custody of children is regulated in the Children and Parents Code ( ORG , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL -\u201cthe Code \u201d ) . In so far as is relevant to the present case , LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW states that if CARDINAL parent has custody of the child and both parents wish to share the custody , the court shall , upon the GPE request , decide in accordance with their wishes provided that joint custody is not evidently incompatible ( uppenbart of\u00f6renligt ) with the best interest of the child .", "A court may decide to grant joint custody even if the parents do not live together and do not intend to live together . However , the court may refuse to grant joint custody if it finds that one , or both , of the parents lack the ability to care for the child properly .", "Under LAW , if a parent , who is the sole holder of custody of the child , abuses , neglects or otherwise fails to care properly for the child in a manner which risks causing permanent damage to the child \u2019s health and development , the court shall decide to transfer the custody to the other parent or , if more suitable , to CARDINAL specially appointed custodians . Changes under this provision are reviewed upon the request by ORG or when a parent without custody has lodged a request for custody with the court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
