The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the village of PERSON , in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been the editor of a DATE newspaper , ORG ( GPE \u0431\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438 ) , since he founded it in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a leaflet was distributed in PERSON and LOC concerning a member of parliament ( MP ) , PERSON , who was going to stand in the forthcoming elections . The leaflet read as follows :", "\u201c Enough of telling fairy tales ! ! ! Let us turn to the facts ! Read the NORP DATE newspaper PERSON . The fortune of the member of ORG is estimated by the newspaper at MONEY ! ! You do not believe it ? Where does the money come from ? ? ? PERSON charges MONEY for a letter with the letterhead of a member of ORG , and MONEY for an MP 's inquiry concerning a delicate matter ! ! ! Lobbying on behalf of PERSON interests in LOC \u2013 MONEY per year . The profit from trading in medicines and from the sale of overpriced medicines to GPE MONEY per year . Vote for our fellow countryman PERSON and you will surely turn him into a billionaire ! ! ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . The leaflet was either quoted or its contents were described in a number of newspapers including PERSON ( GPE \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 ) of DATE and PERSON ( LOC ) of DATE and internet news sites , including posts on www.news.nashbryansk.ru , DATE , www.vlasti.net and www.semCARDINAL.ru of DATE , a post on www.sobesednik.ru of unspecified date in DATE and a post on www.globalrus.ru of DATE . The applicant has provided copies of the newspaper articles and printouts from the internet sites .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in Bryanskiye Budni no . CARDINAL ( no . CARDINAL ) the applicant published an article entitled \u201c PERSON and GPE \u201d ( \u201c GPE \u0438 PERSON ) . The article reads as follows :", "\u201c PERSON was slandered . Ivanych . GPE . The hand reaches for an axe . Revenge ! For our workers ' conscience !", "The circulation of the leaflet distributed through towns and villages , according to ORG himself and his associates , is CARDINAL copies , and it says that GPE scraped up a fortune of MONEY . An angry rebuff of this allegation was made by ORG . He did not take it , says ORG , ORG did not chuck him MONEY for assistance in the sale of medicines either , and MONEY for an MP 's inquiry is unheard of .", "Actually , when we are talking about PERSON , it is appropriate to say that one should not look a gift horse in the mouth . PERSON gave medical equipment as a present to CARDINAL outpatient clinics , and it is impossible to count how many music boxes he gave to schools and orphans ' homes . It is clearly improper to ask the donor where he got the money for all these goods . The benefactors paid for GPE 's pretty haircut , and he justly distributed the catch among those in need .", "If there are doubts , they are caused by the unsightly history of NORP ' parliamentarism ' . Recently , in connection with the events of DATE , we were reminded how cynically PERSON bought MPs who had not yet decided which side of the barricades to run to . He promised them a rich piece of cake , and they slyly ran for this piece , swallowing their spittle . PERSON 's party was accused of bribery many times , but all our elected representatives take [ bribes ] ( except PERSON , of course ) , if we mean not only money but also greyhound puppies : favours from NORP patrons , from ORG or NORP residing in GPE . And this is a serious school , a school of venality . This is why the accusation against FAC in the clandestine leaflet fell on fertile ground . ORG took bribes or not , he will have to account for all his colleagues , for the fact that he has sat next to venal MPs in the venal PERSON for DATE . In a way , the retribution is legitimate .", "Who is the author ? He is closer to the body of ORG than the MP himself thinks . Of course , the easiest answer is : the one who intends to stand against him in the same electoral district . We have no doubts that PERSON 's ill - wishers from this camp will scribble too , but the leaflet containing a reference to the NORP source was in fact made in a different camp . Which one ? Remember who recently visited GPE . Thus , nominally these forces are GPE 's allies , but effectively they consider him a serf . And serfs need to be reminded from which barn they originate , so that they do not put on airs and are obedient .", "Unfortunately , GPE is looking for ill - wishers in the wrong camp . They should be searched for among the people who cover themselves with red rags . Their handwriting is recognisable . Their latest provocation in the press was , in fact , a supplement to LOC . They published a fake edition of Budni that criticised the opposition to LOC , inter alia , to test their undercover printing works . Although the editors lodged an official complaint , the law - enforcement authorities did not try to find the publisher . And now here is a new volley , and surely not the last one , from the underground regional committee [ of ORG ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE issued a decree declaring that the applicant 's article was intended to agitate the electorate and to encourage a negative attitude towards Mr GPE . The applicant appealed to a court against the decree .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found that the decree was unlawful . The court held :", "\u201c ... [ T]he article was published on DATE ... before the election campaign had started ... [ T]he article contains information about the distribution of a leaflet saying that PERSON had made a fortune of MONEY , and speculations by the author concerning the existence of this money and its sources . The contents of the leaflet are not quoted in the article . The text of the article contains neither information about the forthcoming elections to ORG ... , about PERSON GPE as a candidate for ORG , his political views and ideas , nor agitational calls to vote for or against PERSON or other candidates .", "... [ Mr ] PERSON stated at the hearing that in the article he had not sought to agitate but had merely stated his opinion concerning the distributed leaflet and the information contained therein . The [ defendant ] did not produce any proof to the contrary ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG of the Bryansk Region appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE brought an action for defamation against the applicant in ORG of GPE and sought damages in the amount of MONEY ( RUB ) . He claimed , in particular , that the following passages were untrue and damaging to his honour and reputation :", "\u201c Shandybin scraped up a fortune of MONEY . \u201d", "\u201c He did not take it , says ORG , ORG did not chuck him MONEY for assistance in the sale of medicines either , and MONEY for an MP 's inquiry is unheard of . \u201d", "\u201c Thus , nominally these forces are ORG 's allies , but effectively they consider him a serf . And serfs need to be reminded from which barn they originate , so that they do not put on airs and are obedient . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found for the claimant . The court held :", "\u201c ... [ T]he article PERSON and GPE as a whole , as well as particular phrases and words ( the subject of the dispute ) in it , are strongly indicative of a negative judgment and contain direct emotional judgments which constitute insulting attacks and indirect judgments .", "... [ T]he [ first ] assertion as such , in the context of the article , is insulting , and damaging to the honour and dignity of the claimant and ... to his reputation . The defendant failed to prove the contrary . The claim is well - founded .", "... The author ironically uses [ slang words ] in the [ second ] assertion so as to give it a cynical , insulting character and describes the claimant in negative terms . The assertion is beyond the limits of civilised communication and is in breach of moral standards . Accordingly , the claimant 's assertion ... concerning the disparaging character of the above quotation is well - founded .", "... The [ third ] assertion has an emotionally expressive tone of contempt and humiliation and presents the [ MP ] to the readers in a negative light , as a person capable of doing bad things for society . If used metaphorically , the words are disapproving in tone . The claimant has grounds to perceive the assertions as insulting and slanderous . The court considers this information damaging to the honour , dignity and reputation of the claimant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court held the applicant liable for RUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of non - pecuniary damage sustained by the claimant . The applicant was also ordered to provide Mr GPE with an opportunity to publish his response in LOC . NORP The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reversed the judgment in the part relating to the publication of the claimant 's response in LOC and upheld it in the remaining part . The court found that since Mr PERSON had not applied directly to LOC for the publication of the response within DATE of the publication of the defaming information , under LAW and DATE of the Law on ORG he was estopped from applying to a court in this respect . The court further held :", "\u201c On the basis of the evidence described in the judgment the [ first - instance ] court reached the correct conclusion that the assertions at issue did not correspond to the truth and discredited the honour , dignity and reputation of the claimant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL guarantees freedom of thought and expression , together with freedom of the mass media .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the rectification of information ( \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ) that is damaging to his honour , dignity or professional reputation unless the disseminator of that information proves that it \u201c corresponds to reality \u201d ( Paragraph CARDINAL ) . The defamatory information must be refuted in the same media source that disseminated it ( Paragraph CARDINAL ) .
