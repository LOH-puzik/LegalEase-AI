The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG oil refinery , a joint stock company with its main office in ORG ( \u201c Plama \u201d or \u201c the company \u201d ) , was declared insolvent . On DATE the applicant was appointed its trustee in insolvency .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , a former trustee of PERSON , lodged a statement of claim on behalf of the company in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG advised the applicant to specify whether he would confirm this action . The applicant decided to retain a lawyer , PERSON On DATE he obtained the authorisation of the insolvency court to pay Mr ORG a fee of MONEY ( ORG ) , the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) , for PERSON \u2019s legal representation in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Y.N. attended a court hearing and requested in writing that the proceedings be terminated , since the action had been brought by PERSON , who did not represent PERSON at the time . Upon request by the defendant , the case was transferred to ORG where the proceedings were subsequently terminated .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the creditors of ORG agreed upon a plan for the company \u2019s recovery . On DATE the plan was approved by the insolvency court and the applicant \u2019s functions as trustee in insolvency were terminated . However , he retained some supervisory functions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant signed CARDINAL orders for the transfer of ORG CARDINAL PERSON bank account .", "CARDINAL . Later in DATE an investigation was opened in relation to the applicant \u2019s actions . On DATE the prosecution filed an indictment against him . He was indicted with exceeding his powers ( LAW , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) in that , acting as an official with whom powers were vested by virtue of law ( \u0434\u043b\u044a\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435 ) , he had retained a lawyer to represent the company before obtaining the insolvency court \u2019s authorisation to pay the fee agreed upon , and that on DATE he had ordered that the sum of BGN CARDINAL be paid to PERSON GPE , even though by that time he had ceased to act as a trustee in insolvency of the company and was no longer authorised to act for it .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON was constituted as a civil party in the criminal proceedings against the applicant and brought an action for damages in the amount of BGN CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant as charged , sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and allowed in full PERSON \u2019s civil claim .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the verdict was upheld by ORG , which dismissed an objection by the applicant that he had not had an official capacity ( \u0434\u043b\u044a\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435 ) . It held that it was sufficient that as a trustee he had assumed managerial functions and responsibility for the company \u2019s assets .", "CARDINAL . On the first charge against the applicant , that he had exceeded his powers in retaining a lawyer to represent the company , ORG found that it had certainly not been necessary to retain a lawyer , provided that the only thing the latter had done had been to request the termination of the proceedings . Thus , the applicant had indebted the company with the lawyer \u2019s fee whereas it had not received any gain in return . The applicant had not therefore acted in accordance with the rights and powers vested in him as a trustee but with the aim of enriching Mr GPE and inflicting a financial loss on PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Similarly , ORG found that the applicant had exceeded his powers in ordering the payment of PERSON fees .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed in cassation . He argued that he had not acted as an official and that , therefore , he could not have committed an offence under LAW . He argued , furthermore , that he had acted in accordance with the law and had not unnecessarily indebted PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered a judgment on DATE . It confirmed the lower courts\u2019 conclusion that the applicant had had an official capacity . However , it held that in retaining a lawyer and ordering the payment of the legal fees he had not exceeded his powers as a trustee . Retaining a lawyer had been within his powers and , as he had continued to exercise supervisory functions after the adoption of the plan for PERSON \u2019s recovery , he had had the power to order the payment . Furthermore , LAW concerned offences against the proper exercise of ORG power , whereas it had been alleged that the applicant had acted against the interests of a private company . It followed that he could not have committed an offence under LAW . Therefore , on the charges of having exceeded his powers , ORG acquitted the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , ORG found that as the applicant had deliberately entered into a contract which was disadvantageous to the company he was guilty of an offence under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the domestic court \u2019s view , returning such an alternative verdict was procedurally lawful , per argumentum a contrario , under LAW , since it was based on the circumstances underlying the initial charges and the applicant had defended himself in respect of those circumstances throughout the proceedings . Only the legal characterisation of the facts had changed .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG convicted the applicant of deliberately entering into a disadvantageous contract and thus inflicting substantial damage on PERSON , and sentenced him to a suspended term of DATE imprisonment . It affirmed the lower courts\u2019 judgments in the part allowing PERSON \u2019s civil claim . That judgment was final .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , provided that an official in whom certain powers were vested by virtue of law ( \u0434\u043b\u044a\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435 ) , who breached or failed to fulfil his duties , or exceeded his power , with the aim of obtaining a benefit for himself or CARDINAL party , or of causing damage to others , was to be punished by PERCENT five years\u2019 imprisonment or correctional labour . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL envisaged imprisonment of DATE where considerable material damage had resulted from these acts or the offender had occupied a senior managerial post .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , an official in whom certain powers are vested by virtue of law ( \u0434\u043b\u044a\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435 ) , who deliberately enters into a disadvantageous contract which can result in substantial damage to the company or organisation he represents , is to be punished by imprisonment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the structure of LAW of DATE , Article CARDINAL was at the relevant time classified as an offence against the functioning of ORG bodies and public organisations , while LAW was considered an offence against the economy .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in force until DATE , required that the prosecution file a new indictment in cases where , at the trial stage of the proceedings , it transpired that there were grounds to substantially amend the factual basis of the charges , or to bring charges which required a more severe punishment . Under LAW , in cases where a new indictment was necessary and the parties had so requested , the domestic court had to adjourn the hearing for further argument .", "CARDINAL .
