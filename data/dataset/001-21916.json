On DATE ORG replaced the emergency care order with an ordinary order and upheld the access prohibition . It noted that immediately after having delivered the baby the applicant mother had gone into hiding in order to evade enforcement of the care order concerning PERSON The applicants had been found guilty of different crimes and had been using alcohol and narcotic substances . In such circumstances they were incapable of ensuring ORG healthy development and of providing her with a secure environment .

Under LAW of the said LAW a party shall be afforded the opportunity to reply to any claims put forward by others as well as to any evidence that may affect a decision to be taken . LAW does not lay down any minimum period of time which a party shall have at his or her disposal for preparing such a reply . A matter may be decided without a preceding hearing of a party inter alia if such a hearing would be manifestly unnecessary , would jeopardise the purpose of the decision or if the decision can not be postponed . Section CARDINAL of LAW requires that the competent authority duly investigate the matter before it and ensure the equality of the parties .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( sosiaalihuoltolaki , socialv\u00e5rdslag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a decision made by ORG is enforceable regardless of an appeal ( a ) if the decision requires immediate implementation ; ( b ) if , for reasons due to the arrangement of social welfare , the enforcement of the decision can not be delayed ; or ( c ) when ORG has ordered the decision to be enforced at once .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , a child who is being cared for outside his or her original home shall be ensured those important , continuous and secure human relations which are important for his or her development .

This duty of confidentiality does not prevent officials from disclosing information to those entitled to obtain it for the performance of their official duties ( section CARDINAL ) . Thus the social welfare authorities are entitled to obtain , from a public body such as a municipal care centre , any material required for the performance of their duties ( section CARDINAL ) . The confidentiality of patient records , as stipulated in the LAW on the Status and Rights of Patients ( laki potilaan asemasta ja oikeuksista , lagen om patientens st\u00e4llning och r\u00e4ttigheter DATE ) , may thereby be waived ( section CARDINAL of the said Act ) .

An exception to the rule of full publicity was made , inter alia , for medical and similar reports , which were accessible to the public only with the consent of the person they related to ( section CARDINAL ) . The refusal of access to a document could be submitted for reconsideration by the authority refusing such access , following which there lay an appeal under the general rules for appeals against a decision of that authority . If no right of appeal existed under such general rules , an appeal could be lodged with the superior authority . If no such authority existed , an appeal against a state authority \u2019s decision could be lodged with ORG . An appeal against a decision by another authority could be lodged with an administrative court ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .
