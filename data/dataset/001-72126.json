THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr D. Fernie , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . He is represented before the ORG by ORG , practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was a second - hand car dealer in ORG . In DATE he became a self - employed trade buyer for Deans of GPE , a specialist dealer in high performance cars .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of theft of money from Deans of GPE and he was later charged with false accounting . The prosecution \u2019s case was that the applicant had created fictitious invoices which showed purchases of non - existent cars for which he paid himself with cheques drawn on ORG bank account , and pocketed the proceeds . When the applicant was first arrested , he was bailed but not charged . He had not denied that the invoices were false but claimed that everything had been done with the knowledge of PERSON . On DATE , the applicant was interviewed again . On DATE the applicant was again bailed . On DATE he had further interviews with the police but he was still not charged . On DATE he was interviewed .", "On DATE the applicant was finally formally charged with CARDINAL counts of false accounting and CARDINAL of theft of \u00a3 MONEY .", "On DATE the applicant appeared at the GPE court . The matter was adjourned for the defence to consider advance disclosure .", "On DATE , the prosecution applied for a DATE adjournment to prepare the committal bundles . On CARDINAL and DATE , they requested further adjournments . The court directed that the papers should be served by DATE . They were in fact served at TIME the day before a court hearing on DATE . The defence applied for DATE to consider the papers .", "On DATE , the applicant was committed for trial .", "On DATE , the applicant was arrested and charged inter alia with fraudulent dealings with Mr PERSON , a local farmer who gave the applicant CARDINAL cheques to purchase some shares in a named company .", "On DATE the committals were joined .", "In DATE , the applicant stood trial charged with CARDINAL offences . At the outset of the trial , the trial judge informed counsel that although he had never met PERSON some DATE before he had been acquainted with a former partner of PERSON but had not seen him since . He also informed counsel that he lived in the neighbouring village to PERSON ; he had not met him or spoken to him but was aware that the farmer had property interests in his own village . Counsel made no objection to his continuing the trial .", "The trial judge started his summing up late in TIME DATE . TIME , trial counsel and the judge went out for dinner together . The applicant alleges that they all drank \u2018 copious amounts of red wine and port\u2019 and as a result in court DATE both the judge and the barristers appeared to be unable to function adequately . The judge made CARDINAL inaccuracies during his summing up as well as making CARDINAL misnaming errors , where he confused the names of the various witnesses and the defendant . During the same summing up , the applicant \u2019s leading counsel wrote \u2018 ORG on a piece of paper which he held up to show one of the courtroom ushers , causing her to laugh so uncontrollably that she had to leave the courtroom . This disturbed CARDINAL member of the jury who during a short adjournment complained about the barrister \u2019s conduct , describing it as a \u2018 mockery.\u2019 The barrister concerned apologised to the court and jury after the judge drew it to his attention . Later , following the applicant \u2019s complaints about his defence counsel , on DATE , ORG of ORG decided to bring charges against leading and junior counsel representing the applicant at trial .", "On DATE , the applicant was convicted on all counts ( CARDINAL counts of false accounting , CARDINAL counts of theft and CARDINAL count of obtaining a money transfer by deception ) and was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "On DATE , the applicant lodged a preliminary appeal against his conviction inter alia on grounds of the errors , misnaming and misstatements of evidence contained within the summing up . He also appealed against his sentence considering it to be manifestly excessive .", "The applicant disposed of the services of his defence counsel and submitted the final grounds of appeal himself on DATE .", "On DATE , the single judge gave leave to appeal against sentence but refused leave to appeal against conviction .", "On DATE the applicant submitted new grounds of appeal against his conviction concerning a missing personal organiser and tapes of telephone conversations .", "On DATE , ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal against sentence , reducing the total prison term to DATE as more appropriate to the offences . It referred to the delay of DATE between arrest and trial but noted that although some of the delay was not his fault he could have avoided a substantial part by pleading guilty . It did not make any reduction for delay .", "On DATE , ORG considered the applicant \u2019s renewed application for permission to appeal against conviction . They granted leave to appeal concerning the defects in the summing up and on the unused banking documents and jury bundle .", "On DATE , ORG held a hearing on the above grounds . The applicant appeared in person . In its judgment of DATE , the court rejected the grounds concerning the jury bundle and unused banking documents . As concerned the defects in the summing , it held :", "\u201c In a well - prepared and carefully delivered summing up mis - statements of the evidence and mis - naming errors should not occur . We all know , however , particularly those of us who are getting older , how easy it is to transpose names . That said , however , this summing up contained far too many errors . But what we have to consider is whether the cumulative effect of these errors casts doubt on the safety of the appellant \u2019s conviction . The question is : are the errors such as to make it reasonably probable that the jury would not have returned their verdicts of guilty if there had been no errors ... So far as mis - statements of the evidence are concerned none of them go to the central issues in the case . Had they done so , we would expect alert defence counsel to have asked the judge to correct them . No such application was made . This was , after all , not a long trial and the issues which the jury had to decide were not complicated . So far as mis - naming is concerned , in almost every case the context makes it clear that the judge has transposed the names . It is not as if this was a case in which there was a cast of CARDINAL . Most of the transpositions are between Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON who were the CARDINAL principal witnesses on counts CARDINAL to CARDINAL . It can not be said that the jury were confused . They asked no questions and returned swift verdicts . For these reasons , unfortunate though the judge \u2019s errors were , we do not think that they affected or might have affected the outcome of this trial . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant , acting in person , applied to ORG for leave to appeal to ORG . On DATE the court refused leave or to certify a point of law of general public importance . A notification was sent to the applicant on DATE .", "The applicant then applied to ORG . By letter dated DATE , ORG to ORG acknowledged receipt of his undated letter and pointed out that as his appeal was a criminal matter and ORG had not certified that it raised a point of law of general public importance ORG could not entertain any appeal . The clerk concluded :", "\u201c In these circumstances there is nothing further you need to do to satisfy the requirement , laid down by LAW ORG , that all domestic remedies must be exhausted before an appeal can by made to the ORG . This letter will be accepted by the ORG as establishing your compliance with the domestic remedies rule in respect of the jurisdiction of ORG in this litigation . \u201d", "In subsequent correspondence with ORG , the applicant complained that the trial judge had been acquainted with Mr PERSON , who was a considerable landowner in the village where the judge lived and that they had both attended certain social functions . He also complained that the judge had been acquainted with another complainant , Mr PERSON , as he had shown knowledge of Mr PERSON and his partner \u2019s business in GPE where he had practised in chambers . He further repeated his allegations concerning the consumption of alcohol by the judge and counsel . An inquiry appears to have been carried out . The trial judge wrote a letter dated DATE to the GPE setting out his response . He pointed out that through an abundance of caution he himself had drawn attention of counsel to his knowledge of CARDINAL prosecution witnesses and that they had not made any representations concerning his continued involvement in the case . He also stated that TIME the summing - up he had drunk CARDINAL glasses of wine during dinner with counsel and retired at TIME : he denied being the worse for drink then or DATE .", "By letter dated DATE , the ORG replied to the applicant , inter alia referring to ORG assessment of the case and noting that the applicant \u2019s counsel had confirmed that the judge had not been under the influence of alcohol . They concluded that there was no issue of the judge \u2019s personal conduct that required further investigation .", "By letter dated DATE , ORG of ORG informed the applicant that it had decided that his complaints about ORG conduct at his trial should form the subject of an investigation . After a summary procedure hearing on DATE , the disciplinary proceedings were dismissed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
