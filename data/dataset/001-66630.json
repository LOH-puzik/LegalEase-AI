{"ITEMID": "001-66630", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "JOHANS v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She is not represented before the ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "A bank commenced an action against the applicant and her company , claiming repayment of loans . They contested the claim , arguing that the bank had agreed to extend the term of payment .", "On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of ORG sanctioned the claim and ordered the applicant and her company to repay the loans . They appealed .", "On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) held an oral hearing during which the persons heard before FAC were reheard . During the hearing the applicant and her company argued that the ORG Judge PERSON was disqualified from deciding their case on the ground that he at the same time acted as a supervisor of the plaintiff bank . Commercial bank ORG duties within the bank \u2019s administration entail promoting and supervising a particular office \u2019s activities and acting as that office manager \u2019s supporting person .", "ORG invited X to comment on the issue , which he did . According to X , he had acted as a supervisor of effectively the same bank since DATE . All the parties filed observations on X \u2019s comment .", "By its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , rejecting the disqualification allegation , upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . As to the alleged partiality it noted that the name of Judge PERSON , who ruled on the case in FAC , had been on the list of the plaintiff bank \u2019s supervisors until DATE . However , on DATE , i.e. prior to the case becoming pending , X informed the bank in writing that he would resign as a supervisor . ORG considered that the mere fact that in DATE X still remained on the list of supervisors did not call his objective impartiality into question . There was nothing to indicate his subjective partiality . The applicant and her company requested leave to appeal .", "On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) granted them leave to appeal as far as the disqualification claim was concerned .", "On DATE ORG ( decision no . DATE ) , having first noted that PERSON , despite his declaration of DATE , had acted as a supervisor for the bank until DATE and thus , at the time when he decided the present case , rejected the disqualification claim giving the following reasons :", "\u201c A commercial bank supervisor can not be considered disqualified from deciding litigation where the bank in question is a party to the proceedings in light of LAW , LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Judicial Procedure .", "In assessing whether a judge is disqualified , attention has to be paid also to the provisions of LAW and the case - law of ORG .", "In the determination of his civil rights and obligations everyone is entitled to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal according to LAW . In light of ORG case - law , a judge must not hold a preconception or have a prejudged view of the case in question or have a desire to favour one of the parties\u2019 interests ( subjective impartiality ) . In addition , all legitimate doubts as to the judge \u2019s impartiality must be eliminated ( objective impartiality ) . In assessing impartiality from the last - mentioned point of view , attention has to be paid to whether the judge \u2019s previous activities or his relations to the parties from an objective point of view give a party reason to believe that his impartiality is jeopardized .", "In his comment to ORG stated that the credits in question had come to his knowledge when the case became pending . As he also had knowledge of also other claims related to a company previously run by the applicant and her husband which was being dissolved ... X had said in open court that the granting of additional loans to the same debtor caused him astonishment .", "In their appeal the applicant and her company argued that the above statement showed that X had a certain bias with regard to the present case .", "Having regard on the one hand to the contents of the statement and on the other to the issues in dispute , ORG considers that the statement is not a sufficient indication of X \u2019s personal bias or his desire to favour the bank \u2019s interests . Nor are there any other such indications . Accordingly , the allegation that X would have been partial from a subjective point of view is unfounded .", "Commercial bank ORG position , duties or responsibility within the bank \u2019s administration are not based on the law . However , they are based on the statute approved by the bank \u2019s board of governors . According to the statute the ORG duty is to promote and supervise a particular branch \u2019s activities and act as that branch manager \u2019s supporting person .", "If the judge deciding a litigation in addition to his or her regular post holds a position of trust and according to the description of that position has a relationship as mentioned above with the other party to the proceedings , this fact is likely to raise questions as to whether the judge \u2019s impartiality is jeopardized . According to the constant case - law of ORG , in assessing whether a judge is disqualified attention has to be paid to the impression given in the circumstances to an observer ( see the reasoning in the cases of PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINAL-XII and PERSON and PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-III , \u00a7 CARDINAL and other authorities mentioned therein ) . Having regard to the above - mentioned paragraphs in particular and the fact that the litigation concerns the acts by the branch in question , the ORG duty description in the bank \u2019s statute contains features that may give an observer an objectively justified fear that the judge may have ties of loyalty to the bank or the office \u2019s management that jeopardize his impartiality .", "The duties , obligations or expectations that attach to the ORG position are , however , not precise or strict . Also the remuneration is so modest that it can not as such be assumed to bring pressure to bear on the supervisors to render the bank or its branch special favours . The factual role of the supervisor and his or her possible ties to the bank and the branch \u2019s management in question thus depends to a large extent on the supervisor \u2019s individual attitude and may in practice be small or even non - existent .", "DATE prior to the present case becoming pending , X already considered that the supervisor \u2019s position with regard to the office of a judge may be problematic in the eyes of an observer and bring about unnecessary fear of partiality . Therefore he informed the branch in question that he was no longer at the bank \u2019s disposal as a supervisor . However , from a formal point of view , ORG \u2019s position as supervisor ended at the end of the term . Having regard to the above concerning a supervisor \u2019s factual role , ORG considers that regard has to be paid to X \u2019s letter of resignation in assessing whether he was partial in deciding the present case . X resigned specifically with a view to preventing any suspicion as to his impartiality . His conduct has been such that he can be considered to have resigned from the position as a supervisor already when he left his letter of resignation and not when his term formally ended . In these circumstances X \u2019s ties to the bank and its office in question or its management can not be considered to be such at the time during which the present case has been pending that they warrant the conclusion that there is objectively justified suspicion as to his impartiality .", "These reasons can warrant the conclusion that X was not disqualified from examining and deciding the present case \u201d .", "ORG decision became a precedent ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "The afore - mentioned bank commenced another action against the applicant and her company , claiming repayment of loans . On DATE the ORG of Vakka - GPE sanctioned the claim and ordered the applicant and her company to repay the loans . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant and her company leave to appeal as far as the disqualification claim against X was concerned . By its judgment of DATE ( decision no . CARDINAL ) it rejected the disqualification claim on the same grounds as in the first set of proceedings .", "LAW , LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) , as in force at the material time , provided in relevant part :", "\u201c ... The following shall be the legal grounds for disqualification [ of a judge ] : when the judge is related by blood or marriage to CARDINAL or the other party in a manner where marriage is prohibited under LAW , including cousinship by blood although not by marriage ; when the judge is the opposing party or a public opponent of a party ; when the judge or his or her relative here listed has an interest in the case , when they stand to obtain particular benefit or suffer particular loss as a result of it ; when the judge has served as a judge in the case in another court ; when the judge has served as an advocate or a witness in the case ; or when the judge has previously , on the orders of a court , decided a part of the case ; or when the judge has a similar case pending before another court ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
