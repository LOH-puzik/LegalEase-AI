GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicant is a retired military officer who underwent psychotherapeutic and psychoanalytical treatment from DATE onwards . He was discharged in DATE on grounds of his medical condition . The therapy was discontinued in DATE in view of the applicant having fallen in love with the therapist , who initially treated the applicant 's feelings as \u201c transference of affection \u201d ( \u00dcbertragungsliebe ) and personally sought supervision . In DATE the applicant and the therapist commenced an intimate relationship that ended in DATE .", "On DATE the applicant sued the therapist for damages of NORP marks CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( DEM ) ( euros ORG ) ) . He argued that the therapist had discontinued the therapy in view of the commencing of an intimate relationship and had thereby violated her duties from the contract governing the therapeutic treatment as well as her professional duty to remain sexually uninvolved with a client ; because of the therapeutic malpractice he had suffered from a mental breakdown that had required further therapeutic treatment for which he had incurred the damage complained of .", "On DATE ORG ordered a first expert opinion . The expert witness submitted that the therapist had seriously breached her professional duties . The court held that the expert opinion was not satisfactory as it was incoherent , not fully reasoned and did not differentiate between professional , therapeutic and ethical standards .", "In response to the opinion of the first expert witness , the defendant therapist submitted a private expert opinion that found no violation of therapeutic and professional standards and denied that the therapist 's actions were causally linked to the damage complained of . The court noted that the private expert opinion had come to different conclusions from the first expert opinion but was not in itself fully satisfactory ; the court therefore ordered another expert opinion on CARDINAL DATE .", "The second expert witness criticised the previous expert opinions for their reliance on psychoanalytical tools and denied any wrongdoing on the part of the therapist as she had conscientiously transferred the therapeutic relationship into an intimate one between consenting adults . The court noted that the second expert witness ' opinion was unsatisfactory because the parties had engaged in DATE among other therapeutic techniques \u2013 psychoanalysis and the expert witness had displayed an overly critical and biased assessment of psychoanalysis .", "On DATE the court ordered a third expert opinion pursuant to LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . The expert witness delivered his opinion on DATE ; at the applicant 's instigation , the expert witness submitted a clarification of his opinion on DATE . He stated no discernable professional standards for the gentle cancellation of a therapeutic relationship could be verified ; there were no professional standards concerning the period between the discontinuation of a therapeutic and the beginning of an intimate relationship between therapist and patient ; the only possible link between the intimate relationship and the damage complained of was the applicant 's realisation that he had not found what he had been looking for . On DATE the applicant challenged the third expert witness on grounds of bias ; on DATE the court rejected the challenge as ill - founded .", "On DATE the court dismissed the applicant 's claim at the end of an oral hearing . It held that the therapist had not violated therapeutic and professional standards and based its decision mainly on the third expert witness 's opinion , which it held to be convincing , methodically sound and precise .", "On DATE ORG informed the parties of its intention to dismiss an appeal lodged by the applicant as ill - founded pursuant to LAW see \u201c relevant domestic law \u201d below ) on the grounds that the first expert witness ' opinion had been rightly rejected by ORG . ORG noted that the therapist had acted responsibly , had not violated the therapist 's duty to remain sexually uninvolved and that there were no strict professional rules concerning the minimum period between the ending of a therapeutic and the beginning of an intimate relationship between a former therapist and patient . On DATE counsel for the applicant submitted further observations . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "On DATE counsel for the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG arguing that ORG had not taken into account the applicant 's further submissions of DATE and had treated the applicant as a perpetrator rather than a victim of sexual abuse .", "On DATE ORG , relying on the relevant provisions of its Rules of Procedure , refused to accept the applicant 's constitutional complaint for examination without giving further reasons ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Under LAW the court may order a new expert opinion by the same or another expert witness if it considers the expert opinion to be unsatisfactory .", "Under LAW , ORG may reject an appeal by unanimous decision if it is convinced that the appeal has no prospect of success , the legal matter is not of fundamental importance and the development of the law or the safeguarding of consistent jurisprudence do not necessitate that a decision be given by ORG . ORG or its presiding judge have to inform the parties of their intention to reject the appeal and the reasons thereof and have to give the appellant the opportunity to submit observations within a set time - limit . The decision under LAW is not subject to an appeal and ORG can not grant leave to appeal on points of law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
