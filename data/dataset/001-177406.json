On DATE the applicant moved to the city of GPE . She took up residence in rented property at the address A. Street CARDINALb . This address is located in the GPE district in GPE . The applicant had previously resided outside LOC ( Stadsregio Rotterdam ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that no later than early CARDINAL the owner of the property asked her and her CARDINAL young children to vacate the property as he wished to renovate it for his own use . He offered to let the applicant a different property at the address B. Street CARDINALA , also in the GPE area . She further stated that , since it comprised CARDINAL rooms and a garden , the property was far more suitable for her and her children than her A. Street dwelling which comprised a single room . However , whether the A. Street property was actually renovated or required renovation at all remains in dispute ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime on DATE , GPE had been designated under LAW ( Wet bijzondere maatregelen grootstedelijke problematiek , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as an area where only those households could move into housing who had been granted a housing permit ( huisvestingsvergunning ) to do so in relation to an identified property . Accordingly , on DATE the applicant lodged a request for a housing permit with the PERSON and Aldermen ( burgemeester en wethouders ) of GPE in order to be permitted to move to B. Street CARDINALA.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON and Aldermen gave a decision refusing such a permit . They found it established that the applicant did not satisfy the statutory requirements for a housing permit ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on the basis that she had not been resident in LOC for DATE immediately preceding the introduction of her request . Moreover , since she was dependent on social - security benefits under ORG ( PERSON ) , she also did not meet the income requirement that would have qualified her for an exemption from the residence requirement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who was represented throughout the domestic proceedings and before the ORG by the same lawyer , lodged an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) with the LOC and Aldermen .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON and Aldermen gave a decision dismissing the applicant \u2019s objection . Adopting as their own an advisory opinion by ORG ( PERSON bezwaarschriftencommissie ) , they referred to the fact that housing permits were intended to be an instrument to ensure the balanced and equitable distribution of housing and to the possibility for the applicant to move to a dwelling not situated in a \u201c hotspot \u201d area .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal ( beroep ) with ORG ( rechtbank ) . In so far as relevant to the case , she argued that the hardship clause ought to have been applied . She relied on LAW CARDINAL of the Convention and Article CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . She also submitted that the requirement of CARDINAL years\u2019 residence in LOC , as applied to her , constituted discrimination based on income status contrary to Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave a decision dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE ( ORG : NL : RBROT:CARDINAL:BDCARDINAL ) . In so far as relevant to the case before the ORG , its reasoning was as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LOC Act [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] provides for the possibility of temporary restrictions on freedom of residence in areas to be indicated by the Minister [ sc . the Minister of ORG and the Environment ( Minister PERSON , PERSON en Milieubeheer ) ] . The aim of these restrictions is to reverse a process of overburdening and decreasing quality of life ( leefkwaliteit ) , particularly by striving towards districts whose composition is more mixed from a socioeconomic point of view . The restrictions are also intended actively to counteract the existing segregation of incomes throughout the city through the regulation of the supply of housing in certain districts and in so doing improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of those districts ( Parliamentary Documents , ORG of ORG ( PERSON ) DATE , CARDINAL CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL [ i.e. the Explanatory Memorandum ( PERSON ) , see paragraph CARDINAL below ] , pages CARDINAL ) . In view of the aims of the law , as set out , these temporary restrictions on the freedom to choose one \u2019s residence can not be found not to be justified by the general interest in a NORP society . Nor can it be found that , given the considerable extent of the problems noted in certain districts in GPE , the said restrictions are not necessary for the maintenance of ordre public . ORG takes the view that the legislature has sufficiently shown that in those districts the \u2018 limits of the capacity for absorption\u2019 have been reached as regards care and support for the socioeconomically underprivileged and that moreover in those districts there is a concentration of underprivileged individuals in deprived districts as well as considerable dissatisfaction among the population about inappropriate behaviour , nuisance and crime .", "As regards the violation of LAW posited by [ the applicant ] , ORG takes the view that sufficient reasons have been given ( Parliamentary Documents , ORG of ORG , DATE , QUANTITY , no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) that in so far as these measures constitute an indirect distinction , this distinction has sufficient objective justification .", "ORG observes in this connection that the restrictions based on LOC imposed by the DATE Housing By - law [ of GPE ] ( Huisvestingsverordening DATE ) constitute only a minimal and temporary restriction on the freedom to choose one \u2019s residence . In so finding , ORG notes that it does not appear \u2013 and [ the applicant ] has not made out a case \u2013 that [ she ] can not obtain fitting housing elsewhere in the LOC or the LOC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a further appeal ( hoger beroep ) with ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) . As she had done before ORG , she invoked LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision ( ORG : NL : RVS:CARDINAL:BHCARDINAL ) dismissing the applicant \u2019s further appeal . In so far as relevant to the case before the ORG , its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The right freely to choose one \u2019s residence , provided by LAW CARDINAL , may , under the fourth paragraph , be subject , in particular areas , to restrictions imposed in accordance with law and justified by the public interest in a NORP society . The right of everyone freely to choose one \u2019s residence , laid down in LAW , shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law and are necessary to protect public order . ORG observes in this connection that the concept \u2018 public ORG in the LAW includes , in addition to the prevention of disorder , public safety , the prevention of crime and all universally accepted fundamental principles corresponding to human rights on which a democratic society is based . The arrangement set out in section CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Housing By - law constitutes a restriction on GPE \u2019s free choice of a place of residence . It is not disputed that this restriction is provided for by law and is inspired by the interest that society has in [ ensuring ] the quality of life in districts of major cities . ORG finds that , considering that the area in issue is CARDINAL designated under section CARDINAL of the Inner City Problems ( Special Measures ) Act , the LOC and Aldermen were entitled to take the view that the restriction [ on freedom to choose one \u2019s residence ] is justified in the general interest in a NORP society within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . The area in issue is a so - called \u2018 GPE , where , as has not been disputed , the quality of life is under threat . The restriction resulting from section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Housing By - law is of a temporary nature , namely for DATE . It is not established that the supply of housing outside the areas designated by the Minister in ORG is insufficient . What [ the applicant ] has stated about waiting times does not lead ORG to reach a different finding . ORG further takes into account that pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , introductory sentence and under b of GPE , the Minister is empowered to rescind the designation of the area if it turns out that persons seeking housing do not have sufficient possibility of finding suitable housing within the region in which the municipality is situated . In view of these facts and circumstances ORG finds that the restriction in issue is not contrary to the requirements of a pressing social need and proportionality . ORG therefore finds , as ORG did , that section CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Housing By - law does not violate LAW CARDINAL of the Convention or Article CARDINAL of the DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to GPE \u2019s argument that section CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Housing By - law violates LAW , first sentence , of FAC because it entails an indirect distinction , ORG holds as follows . Since a relatively large number of people are resident in the areas covered by that section who are dependent on social - security benefits under the Work and LAW , section CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) can lead to an indirect distinction being made . Such a distinction is permitted if there is an objective and reasonable justification for that distinction and the difference in treatment that flows from it . Whether such is the case must be considered in the light of the question whether the making of the distinction serves a legitimate aim and is proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved , i.e. is a suitable means to achieve that aim and the aim can not be achieved by other , less intrusive means . Section CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Housing By - law is intended by ORG ( gemeenteraad ) to effect differentiation in the districts in order to increase the quality of life . Given the seriousness of the problems the solution thereof must be considered a legitimate aim . The income requirement set by section CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Housing By - law is the final measure of a package of measures ( pakket van maatregelen ) introduced to meet that goal . It has not , or not sufficiently , been disputed that the other measures in themselves produce insufficient effect . Considering the fact that the measure is limited in time and it does not appear that GPE can not obtain suitable housing elsewhere in the LOC or the Region , ORG agrees with ORG that the PERSON and Aldermen , taking into account the fact that the legislature created the possibility to make use of this means by statute and explicitly and the legislature equally weighed the need to open this possibility in addition to the existing possibilities , had good reasons to take the view that , in addition to the measures already in existence , this measure too is necessary and proportionate .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . Finally , GPE has submitted that the PERSON and Aldermen were wrong to find that the particular circumstances on which she relied did not constitute grounds to apply the hardship clauses . These particular circumstances are that her present dwelling is too small for her and her CARDINAL children and that its poor state of repair causes her inconvenience ( voor overlast zorgt ) . It is the policy of the PERSON and Aldermen to apply the hardship clauses only in untenable situations , for example in cases of violence . Like ORG , ORG takes the view that the PERSON and Aldermen were entitled to consider that there is no such situation in the present case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to figures published by GPE , there were CARDINAL dwellings in the municipality in DATE , of which CARDINAL or PERCENT were situated in GPE . The total number of dwellings in the CARDINAL districts designated in DATE PERSON , GPE , ORG and GPE \u2013 was CARDINAL , i.e. PERCENT of the total for the municipality . With the addition of PERSON ( designated on DATE ) , the total came to CARDINAL or PERCENT .", "DATE . On DATE the population of the municipality of GPE stood at CARDINAL . Of these , CARDINAL or PERCENT were resident in GPE . The total number of inhabitants of the CARDINAL districts designated in DATE was CARDINAL , i.e. PERCENT of the total for the municipality . With the addition of GPE , the total for the designated districts came to CARDINAL or PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . An evaluation report , commissioned by GPE \u2019s own ORG ( ORG ) after DATE following the introduction of the housing permit in GPE , was published on DATE by ORG ( ORG voor NORP en PERSON ) , a research and advice bureau collecting statistical data and carrying out research relevant to developments in GPE in areas including demographics , the economy and employment ( hereafter \u201c the DATE evaluation report \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The report noted a reduction of the number of new residents dependent on social - security benefits under the Work and Social Assistance Act in \u201c hotspot \u201d areas , though not , of course , a complete stop because GPE residents of CARDINAL years\u2019 standing were not prevented from moving there .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE there had been CARDINAL requests for a housing permit . Of these , CARDINAL had been granted ; CARDINAL had been refused ; CARDINAL had been rejected as incomplete ; and CARDINAL were still pending . The hardship clause ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LOC ) had been applied in CARDINAL cases .", "CARDINAL . DATE of the housing permits granted concerned housing let by private landlords ; the remainder DATE had been granted through the intermediary of social housing bodies ( woningcorporaties ) . The latter selected their tenants with due regard to the official requirements , so that refusals of housing permits with regard to social housing were unheard of .", "CARDINAL . Of the persons refused a housing permit , DATE ( PERCENT of all those who met with a refusal ) were known to have found housing elsewhere relatively quickly .", "CARDINAL . NORP The DATE evaluation report was presented to ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG voted to maintain the housing permit system as was and have a new evaluation report commissioned for DATE .", "CARDINAL . A second evaluation report , also commissioned by GPE \u2019s ORG , was published by ORG DATE . It covered the period from DATE until DATE ( \u201c the DATE evaluation report \u201d ) , during which the events complained of took place .", "CARDINAL . During this period , the social housing bodies had let CARDINAL dwellings in the areas concerned . Since the social housing bodies could only accept tenants who qualified for a housing permit , no applications for such a permit had been rejected in this group .", "CARDINAL . Out of CARDINAL applications for a housing permit relating to privatelylet housing , CARDINAL had been accepted ( PERCENT ) ; CARDINAL had been refused ( PERCENT ) ; and CARDINAL had been pending at DATE . Examination of a further CARDINAL had been discontinued without a decision being taken ( PERCENT ) , generally because these applications had been withdrawn or abandoned ; the assumption was that many of these applications would in any case have been rejected . It followed , therefore , that if the pending cases were not taken into account , CARDINAL of this category of applications had been either refused or not pursued to a conclusion .", "CARDINAL . The reason to reject an application for a housing permit had been related to the income requirement in PERCENT of cases , sometimes in combination with another ground for rejection ; failure to meet the income requirement had been the sole such reason in PERCENT of cases .", "CARDINAL . Of CARDINAL persons refused a housing permit , CARDINAL were known to have managed to find housing elsewhere , either in GPE ( PERCENT ) or elsewhere in the GPE ( PERCENT ) .", "CARDINAL . The hardship clause had been applied CARDINAL times \u2013 expressed as a percentage of applications relating to privately - let housing , PERCENT of the total . These had been cases of preventing squatters from taking over housing left empty ( antikraak ) , illegal immigrants whose situation had been regularised by a general measure ( generaal pardon ) , assisted living arrangements for vulnerable individuals ( begeleid wonen ) , cooperative living arrangements ( woongroepen ) , start - up enterprises , the re - housing ( herhuisvesting ) of households forced to clear substandard housing for renovation , and foreign students . In addition , in CARDINAL of cases the hardship clause had been applied because a decision had not been given within the prescribed time - limit .", "CARDINAL . The effects of the measure were considered based on CARDINAL indicators : proportion of residents dependent on social - security benefits under ORG , corrected for the supply of suitable housing ; perception of safety ; social quality ; and potential accumulation of housing problems :", "( a ) It had been observed that in the areas where the housing permit requirement applied , the reduction of the number of new residents dependent on social - security benefits under the Work and Social Assistance Act had been more rapid in \u201c hotspot \u201d areas than in other parts of GPE . In addition , the number of residents in receipt of such benefits as a proportion of the total population of those areas had also declined , although it was still greater than elsewhere .", "( b ) In CARDINAL of the areas where the housing permit requirement had been introduced , the increase in the perception of public safety had been more rapid than the GPE average . GPE had shown an increase initially , but was now back to where it had been before the measure was introduced . CARDINAL other area had actually declined significantly in this respect . All of the areas where the housing permit requirement applied were still perceived as considerably less safe than GPE as a whole .", "( c ) In terms of social quality , there had been improvement in most of the parts of GPE where problems existed , GPE among them . It was noted , however , that the effect of the housing permit in this respect was limited , since it only influenced the selection of new residents , not that of residents already in place .", "( d ) Housing DATE defined in terms of turnover , housing left unused , and house price development \u2013 had increased somewhat in the affected areas including GPE , though on the whole at a slower rate there than elsewhere . Reported reasons for the increase were an influx of immigrants of mostly non - NORP extraction ( nieuwe Nederlanders , \u201c new GPE nationals \u201d ) and new short - term residents from LOC ; the latter in particular tended to stay for DATE or less before moving on , and their economic activity was more difficult to keep under review as many were self - employed .", "CARDINAL . Social housing bodies tended to view the housing permit requirement as a nuisance because it created additional paperwork . They perceived the measure rather as an appropriate instrument to tackle abuses by private landlords , provided that it be actively enforced and administrative procedures be simplified . Others with a professional involvement in the GPE housing market mentioned the dissuasive effect of the measure on would - be new residents of the affected areas .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report suggested that the housing permit requirement might no longer be needed for one of the existing \u201c hotspots \u201d ( not GPE ) . Conversely , CARDINAL other GPE districts scored high for CARDINAL indicators , while a sixth exceeded critical values for all CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .

It covered the period from DATE until DATE ( \u201c the DATE evaluation report \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The social housing bodies had let CARDINAL dwellings in the areas concerned ; as during DATE , no applications for housing permits had been rejected in this group because the social housing bodies could only accept qualifying tenants .", "CARDINAL . There had been CARDINAL applications for a housing permit relating to privately - let housing . Of these , CARDINAL had been accepted ( PERCENT ) ; CARDINAL had been refused ( PERCENT ) ; and CARDINAL had been pending on DATE . Examination of CARDINAL had been discontinued without a decision being taken ( PERCENT ) , generally because they had been withdrawn or abandoned . This meant that , if the pending cases were not taken into account , CARDINAL of applications were either rejected or not pursued to a conclusion because the household concerned had reconsidered its decision to move .", "DATE . The reasons to reject an application for a housing permit had included failure to meet the income requirement in PERCENT of cases , sometimes combined with other reasons . In the remaining cases the decision to reject had been based on the excessive number of persons wishing to take up residence in a particular dwelling ; the unlawful sub - letting of rooms ; the absence of valid residence rights ; or the fact that the person making the application was underage .", "CARDINAL . The individual hardship clause had been applied in CARDINAL cases ; as a proportion of successful applications for a housing permit , this amounted to PERCENT . In addition , in CARDINAL cases objections had been lodged against refusals ; of these , CARDINAL had been successful and had resulted in the grant of a housing permit . The grounds on which the hardship clause was applied were the same as those stated in the DATE evaluation report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In terms of social index , GPE continued to score lowest of all the GPE districts . Social cohesion was very weak , which was explained by the number of house moves but also by a general lack of participation in social life . In terms of residential environment ( leefomgeving ) , the district was vulnerable , the problem being a lack of suitable housing .", "CARDINAL . Based on the same indicators and methodology as the previous report , the DATE evaluation report concluded that the housing permit system should be continued in GPE and CARDINAL other areas ( including CARDINAL in which it had been introduced in the meantime , in DATE ) ; discontinued in CARDINAL others ; and introduced in CARDINAL area where it was not yet in force .", "CARDINAL .

Requests to that effect had been received from a number of affected cities . It was noted that not all of the cities concerned had made use of all of the possibilities offered by the LAW ; in particular , only GPE used housing permits to select new residents for particular areas . Appended to the Minister \u2019s letter was a copy of the DATE evaluation report and a letter from the PERSON and Aldermen of GPE in which they , inter alia , confirmed the desirability of extending the indication of particular areas for applying the housing permit requirement beyond DATE periods : the measure was considered a success , and a DATE programme involving the large - scale improvement of housing and infrastructure ( the \u201c ORG GPE \u201d ( ORG , see below ) ) had been started in the southern parts of GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Has the application of the measure under LAW had any actual effect on the quality of life and security in the designated areas ?", "Based on a ( modified ) Security Index we find that during DATE the designated districts have shown a more negative development in their scores than the other districts of the city . This interrelation has been examined more closely by comparing the development trend in all GPE districts , taking into account the district status and other changes in the housing markets . After these checks have been carried out it still appears that the districts covered by the LAW display a significantly worse development than the other districts of GPE .", "[ ... ]", "In so concluding it must be observed that the LAW is not necessarily the cause of these lagging developments . Changes in city policy , police and justice , education , social assistance , etc . at the neighbourhood , municipal and national level are beyond the scope of this evaluation . These findings do however suggest that the LAW has not contributed to any improvement .", "Quality of life elsewhere", "[ ... ]", "CARDINAL . What development is seen in districts with a considerable influx of house - movers who do not qualify for a housing permit as regards quality of life and security ?", "[ ... ]", "In sum , it can be stated that there is a slight negative interrelation between changes in the influx of the potentially refused and the quality of life and security of the neighbourhoods . This interrelation is , however , not uniform and the causal link is not firmly established . Although the potentially refused can cause a deterioration of the quality of life and security in a neighbourhood , the interrelation may also point the other way .
