On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible .", "At the time of ORG decision , the applicant \u2019s LAW petition was still pending before ORG on his appeal against the first - instance ruling of CARDINAL DATE in the fourth round of examination ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . above ) , after the second final and binding return order had been quashed by ORG on DATE following an extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the ORG on behalf of A. ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "As regards the length of the proceedings , ORG observed that ORG and ORG had determined the matter on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively . Therefore , at the time the constitutional complaint was introduced , these courts were no longer dealing with the case . Examination of the length of the proceedings before these courts could thus no longer aid their acceleration and , consequently , the applicant could not be deemed to have the requisite interest in having it examined . In addition , the length of the proceedings before ORG being relatively short , the remainder of the length - of - proceedings complaint was manifestly ill - founded .", "In so far as the constitutional complaint concerned ORG decision of DATE , it had evidently been lodged outside the statutory DATE time - limit and , as the proceedings on the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE were still pending , any complaint in relation to their outcome was premature .", "The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
