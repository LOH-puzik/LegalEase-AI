FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Y , born in DATE and resident in GPE , is a NORP citizen of NORP origin . He is represented before the Court by PERSON Ekman , resident in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant claims that he has been persecuted in his country of origin as follows :", "The applicant is a well - known writer and a poet in his home town Malikija , GPE . He has been subjected to persecution on grounds of his political opinion and ethnic background . He is a member of ORG in GPE , GPE , which aims at guaranteeing human rights to the NORP people and at having their land returned to them . The applicant has produced anti - government material , such as posters and poems .", "In DATE he was questioned by ORG for the first time , having recited his poems at a party . He was issued with a warning .", "On DATE he was arrested as a suspect for anti - governmental activities . The arrest lasted DATE during which the applicant was tortured ; he was blindfolded , forced to sit in a car wheel and beaten with a weapon . He was set free in the absence of evidence on the alleged activities , but his friend is still detained .", "In DATE he was arrested again , having attended a secret conference arranged by ORG . The arrest lasted DATE during which time he was denied sleep and got only a minimum amount of food . The above mentioned torture was repeated . The applicant \u2019s brother was arrested at the same time . The applicant was told that his brother became ill while in detention and died , but he suspects that the brother , who was a district leader of the party , was killed . Since DATE the applicant has been questioned many times and ORG has threatened that he will be killed or imprisoned , if he does not change his views and inform on his friends . The applicant claims that there is a warrant for his arrest in GPE and he fears that he will face at least five years\u2019 imprisonment , if he returns to GPE . He argues that also the mere fact that he has sought asylum abroad will get him arrested .", "The applicant left GPE in DATE and lived in GPE in DATE . While pursuing studies in the NORP language in DATE , he was politically active providing PERSON with his texts on the conditions in GPE . He is convinced that ORG is aware of his activities in GPE .", "The applicant returned to GPE in DATE and faced similar problems as described above . DATE he returned to GPE .", "The applicant was able to enter GPE in DATE and leave GPE again in DATE since he paid the airport police MONEY ( ORG ) . He travelled via GPE to GPE and arrived in GPE on DATE . He applied for asylum DATE . He did not present any travel documents and he had only a copy of his NORP passport on him . The applicant claims that he bought a false NORP passport in GPE for CARDINAL . He claims that he gave his NORP passport to a fellow passenger on the bus to GPE , a NORP woman , who promised to send the passport to his girlfriend in GPE . The applicant kept only a copy of the passport . He promised to bring the original passport to the NORP authorities as soon as his girlfriend returned it to him .", "The applicant \u2019s application for asylum and a resident permit was refused by ORG ( ulkomaalaisvirasto , utl\u00e4nningsverket ) on DATE and an order was issued for his removal to GPE . ORG found , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s identity had not been established , that he had not presented any travel documents and that he had not submitted any medical certificates concerning the alleged assaults . During the questioning on arrival in GPE , the applicant did not allege that he was forced to flee to GPE in DATE . The applicant had not given account for his reasons for returning to GPE in DATE , although he claimed that there was a warrant for his arrest . ORG found that it is not credible that a persecuted person , who had been issued an arrest warrant , would be allowed to leave the country . According to the applicant , he had not been arrested since DATE . Moreover , it was not credible that the NORP authorities would take such an interest in someone who read his poems on the radio in GPE that there would be a warrant for his arrest . The mere fact that the applicant belonged to the NORP minority did not constitute a ground for granting him asylum .", "On DATE ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , having held an oral hearing , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding that the story about his reasons for leaving GPE in DATE was vague and superficial . It noted that he was able to visit GPE in DATE and in DATE and that he managed to leave the country in DATE using his own passport . His activities in GPE and GPE , i.e. writing poems and texts about the NORP people \u2019s situation , can not be considered to be such that he would be in need of international protection . ORG found no evidence that the applicant would be considered an anti - government activist by the NORP authorities . There were CARDINAL NORP in GPE and the mere fact that the applicant was a NORP did not mean that he was in need of international protection . The court concluded that the applicant would not , on his return to GPE , face any individual risk of inhuman treatment .", "A request for application of Rule DATE was refused by ORG on DATE .", "According to written medical statements submitted by the applicant to ORG , the arches of his feet are low , his ankle joints are \u201c loose \u201d , his big toes are in a faulty position and his left calf does not strain normally . Moreover , his feet do not \u201c roll \u201d normally when walking . The physiotherapist considered that there was no contradiction between the applicant \u2019s symptoms \u2013 pain in his feet and legs etc . \u2013 and the finding . Moreover , the applicant has undergone a discussion therapy but is still suffering from depression and anxiety .", "The applicant has also submitted a certificate issued on DATE in Bad Salzuflen , GPE , by ORG in GPE , GPE , according to which he is a member of the above - mentioned ORG and that his life will be in danger if returned to GPE . The applicant has also submitted letters , apparently written by people who know him , according to which his life will be in danger if he returns to GPE , as he is a NORP and as he has applied for asylum abroad .", "On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal against ORG decision . It is not known whether a date has been set for the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
