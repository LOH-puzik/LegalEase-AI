Chapter III of the Prosecutor \u2019s Offices Act ( Federal Law no . CARDINAL-I of CARDINAL DATE ) identifies the jurisdiction and powers of prosecution authorities in the field of prosecution supervision . In particular , if information about a possible violation of NORP law is received , prosecution authorities should carry out their supervisory function . Prosecutors are authorised to monitor the enforcement of LAW and laws by various federal and local authorities and their officials , including the administrations of detention facilities ( section CARDINAL ) . They should also ensure that the rights and freedoms of detained individuals are respected in places of detention . In performing their task prosecutors should respond to information about possible violations of human rights and freedoms and take measures to prevent or eliminate such violations , bringing those responsible to justice , which can include instituting administrative or criminal proceedings and awarding damages ( sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) . While supervising the work of the administration of a detention facility , prosecutors are to demand that the administration creates conditions in which the rights and freedoms of detained individuals are fully respected , to check that the administration \u2019s decisions comply with domestic legal norms and to receive additional explanations from officials of the detention facility if needed ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The complexity and importance of prevention of violence in detention facilities , specificity of procedures to be employed by facility administration addressing inter - prison violence and necessity of special care , including psychiatric care , of detainees was discussed by ORG for the Prevention of Torture in its ORG . The following are the extracts from the Reports :", "\u201c DATE . Effective grievance and inspection procedures are fundamental safeguards against ill - treatment in prisons . Prisoners should have avenues of complaint open to them both within and outside the context of the prison system , including the possibility to have confidential access to an appropriate authority . The ORG attaches particular importance to regular visits to each prison establishment by an independent body ( eg . a Board of visitors or supervisory judge ) possessing powers to hear ( and if necessary take action upon ) complaints from prisoners and to inspect the establishment \u2019s premises . Such bodies can inter alia play an important role in bridging differences that arise between prison management and a given prisoner or prisoners in general .", "CARDINAL . It is also in the interests of both prisoners and prison staff that clear disciplinary procedures be both formally established and applied in practice ; any grey zones in this area involve the risk of seeing unofficial ( and uncontrolled ) systems developing . Disciplinary procedures should provide prisoners with a right to be heard on the subject of the offences it is alleged they have committed , and to appeal to a higher authority against any sanctions imposed . Other procedures often exist , alongside the formal disciplinary procedure , under which a prisoner may be involuntarily separated from other inmates for discipline - related / security reasons ( eg . in the interests of \" good order \" within an establishment ) . These procedures should also be accompanied by effective safeguards . The prisoner should be informed of the reasons for the measure taken against him , unless security requirements dictate otherwiseCARDINAL , be given an opportunity to present his views on the matter , and be able to contest the measure before an appropriate authority . \u201d", "\u201c ii ) psychiatric care", "CARDINAL . In comparison with the general population , there is a high incidence of psychiatric symptoms among prisoners . Consequently , a doctor qualified in psychiatry should be attached to the health care service of each prison , and some of the nurses employed there should have had training in this field .", "The provision of medical and nursing staff , as well as the layout of prisons , should be such as to enable regular pharmacological , psychotherapeutic and occupational therapy programmes to be carried out .", "CARDINAL . The ORG wishes to stress the role to be played by prison management in the early detection of prisoners suffering from a psychiatric ailment ( eg . depression , reactive state , etc . ) , with a view to enabling appropriate adjustments to be made to their environment . This activity can be encouraged by the provision of appropriate health training for certain members of the custodial staff . \u201d", "\u201c Staff - prisoner relations", "CARDINAL . The cornerstone of a humane prison system will always be properly recruited and trained prison staff who know how to adopt the appropriate attitude in their relations with prisoners and see their work more as a vocation than as a mere job . Building positive relations with prisoners should be recognised as a key feature of that vocation .", "Regrettably , the ORG often finds that relations between staff and prisoners are of a formal and distant nature , with staff adopting a regimented attitude towards prisoners and regarding verbal communication with them as a marginal aspect of their work . The following practices frequently witnessed by the ORG are symptomatic of such an approach : obliging prisoners to stand facing a wall whilst waiting for prison staff to attend to them or for visitors to pass by ; requiring prisoners to bow their heads and keep their hands clasped behind their back when moving within the establishment ; custodial staff carrying their truncheons in a visible and even provocative manner . Such practices are unnecessary from a security standpoint and will do nothing to promote positive relations between staff and prisoners .", "The real professionalism of prison staff requires that they should be able to deal with prisoners in a decent and humane manner while paying attention to matters of security and good order . In this regard prison management should encourage staff to have a reasonable sense of trust and expectation that prisoners are willing to behave themselves properly . The development of constructive and positive relations between prison staff and prisoners will not only reduce the risk of ill - treatment but also enhance control and security . In turn , it will render the work of prison staff far more rewarding .", "Ensuring positive staff - inmate relations will also depend greatly on having an adequate number of staff present at any given time in detention areas and in facilities used by prisoners for activities . ORG delegations often find that this is not the case . An overall low staff complement and/or specific staff attendance systems which diminish the possibilities of direct contact with prisoners , will certainly impede the development of positive relations ; more generally , they will generate an insecure environment for both staff and prisoners .", "It should also be noted that , where staff complements are inadequate , significant amounts of overtime can prove necessary in order to maintain a basic level of security and regime delivery in the establishment . This state of affairs can easily result in high levels of stress in staff and their premature burnout , a situation which is likely to exacerbate the tension inherent in any prison environment .", "Inter - prisoner violence", "CARDINAL . The duty of care which is owed by custodial staff to those in their charge includes the responsibility to protect them from other inmates who wish to cause them harm . In fact , violent incidents among prisoners are a regular occurrence in all prison systems ; they involve a wide range of phenomena , from subtle forms of harassment to unconcealed intimidation and serious physical attacks .", "Tackling the phenomenon of inter - prisoner violence requires that prison staff be placed in a position , including in terms of staffing levels , to exercise their authority and their supervisory tasks in an appropriate manner . Prison staff must be alert to signs of trouble and be both resolved and properly trained to intervene when necessary . The existence of positive relations between staff and prisoners , based on the notions of secure custody and care , is a decisive factor in this context ; this will depend in large measure on staff possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills . Further , management must be prepared fully to support staff in the exercise of their authority . Specific security measures adapted to the particular characteristics of the situation encountered ( including effective search procedures ) may well be required ; however , such measures can never be more than an adjunct to the above - mentioned basic imperatives . In addition , the prison system needs to address the issue of the appropriate classification and distribution of prisoners . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
