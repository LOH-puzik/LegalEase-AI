NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s mother owned a QUANTITY house and a plot of land of QUANTITY , which were expropriated in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the enactment of LAW in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant and her brother requested compensation for their mother \u2019s expropriated property . By a decision of DATE the regional governor of GPE dismissed the request insofar as it concerned the expropriated land , because it had already been subject to restitution , and held that in respect of the house , which had been demolished , the applicant and her brother were to receive compensation bonds .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for judicial review of the above - mentioned decision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed the regional governor \u2019s decision in respect of the applicant and found that she was entitled to compensation for the land and house , to be provided both by transferring to her a share of a larger plot totalling QUANTITY , which adjoined the expropriated plot formerly owned by her mother , and by awarding her compensation bonds , the exact value of which would be determined at a later stage ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . A limited liability company , ORG , joined the proceedings before ORG , after it was accepted that the company had locus standi because it owned a share of the plot of land of QUANTITY . CARDINAL party joined the proceedings at this time , despite the plot having several other co - owners .", "CARDINAL . All parties lodged appeals against ORG judgment , but it was upheld by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The case was subsequently sent back to ORG for the second stage of the proceedings , namely the determination of the exact amount of compensation to be awarded . In a judgment of DATE ORG held that the applicant was to receive PERCENT of the ORG - owned share of the larger plot and compensation bonds with a face value of CARDINAL NORP levs ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional governor appealed to the ORG against the judgment of ORG . However , the proceedings were stayed owing to the submission of several requests to have the first stage of the proceedings reopened ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s brother lodged an application to set aside ORG judgment of DATE , as upheld by the ORG on DATE , and to have the proceedings reopened . He referred to evidence which he considered to be newly discovered . His application was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , a Mr ORG also applied to have the first stage of the proceedings reopened , arguing that , as a co - owner of the plot of QUANTITY , he was an interested party and should have been notified of the proceedings and given an opportunity to participate . He explained that he had become aware of the judgments of DATE and DATE in DATE when he had visited the local municipality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed Mr PERSON \u2019s application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , wife of PERSON , also applied to have the judgment of DATE set aside and the proceedings reopened , arguing that she was also a co - owner of the plot and had been deprived of an opportunity to participate . She stated that she had become aware of the impugned judgment in DATE when she had visited the municipality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , a further co - owner of the plot of land , applied to have the proceedings reopened , putting forward arguments similar to those made by PERSON stated that she had become aware of the impugned judgment in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , PERSON and the company ORG sent a letter to ORG , urging it to propose that the proceedings be reopened , on the ground that some of the co - owners of the plot had not been given an opportunity to participate . The applicant alleged before the ORG that their letter had actually been received by ORG DATE and filed as part of her evidence a copy of the letter bearing the date CARDINAL DATE next to the acknowledgment - of - receipt stamp . ORG , however , submitted a copy of the same letter together with a copy of the relevant entry of the register of documents filed with ORG , which were both dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Chief Public Prosecutor introduced a proposal for the judgment of DATE to be set aside and the proceedings to be reopened , noting that PERSON and PERSON had not been notified of the proceedings and given an opportunity to participate . He pointed out that the QUANTITY women had become aware of the impugned judgment in DATE , referring to a letter he had received at his office on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG allowed the requests , set aside ORG judgment of DATE and reopened the proceedings . It considered that PERSON and PERSON applications had been lodged within the relevant DATE time - limit ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as it had been impossible to establish with certainty the date upon which they had actually become aware of the impugned judgment . The ORG also found that since PERSON and PERSON were both co - owners of the above - mentioned plot of land they had a legitimate interest in the outcome of the contested proceedings , which had directly affected their rights and obligations .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal against the above - mentioned judgment , which was dismissed as inadmissible on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following that , the ORG resumed examination of the regional governor \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . On DATE , referring to its decision to reopen the first stage of the proceedings , it quashed the judgment and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . After it started re - examining the case , ORG allowed several individuals and CARDINAL companies to join the proceedings . It gave judgment on DATE . It again quashed the regional governor \u2019s decision of DATE and held that the applicant was entitled to receive compensation for her mother \u2019s expropriated property by way of a share of the plot of land measuring QUANTITY in total , as well as through compensation bonds .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the parties lodged an appeal . On DATE the ORG upheld ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The case was subsequently returned to ORG for the second stage in the proceedings , namely the determination of the amount of compensation to be awarded to the applicant . ORG gave judgment on CARDINAL DATE . In respect of the share of the plot of land measuring QUANTITY , it held that the applicant \u2019s share could not exceed the ORG - owned share . However , it held that the relevant date on which it was to base its assessment of the ORG - owned share was DATE , because , pursuant to an express provision of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , any transfer of property after that date could not limit the interested parties\u2019 entitlement to compensation . In DATE the ORG - owned share of the plot had amounted to QUANTITY , and in DATE it amounted to QUANTITY , the remainder of the land being the property of the other co - owners . The applicant was entitled to a share measuring QUANTITY , which meant that the shares of the remaining co - owners had to be reduced accordingly . In respect of the compensation bonds to be awarded to the applicant , ORG awarded bonds with a face value of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the parties lodged appeals against the above - mentioned judgment . The ORG held a hearing on DATE , following which the proceedings were stayed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON made an application to set aside ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , as upheld by the ORG on DATE , and to have the first stage of the proceedings reopened . She referred to newly discovered evidence . On DATE the application was dismissed as time - barred by a CARDINAL - member panel of the ORG . It appears that a subsequent appeal by PERSON to a CARDINAL - member panel of that court was dismissed on an unspecified date .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the ORG resumed its examination of the CARDINAL appeals against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . On DATE it dismissed them .", "CARDINAL . After DATE of communism , ORG introduced a series of restitution laws and , in DATE , ORG ( \u201c LAW ) , which provided , in cases where restitution had been impossible , for compensation to former owners of nationalised property or their heirs , through different means , such as transfer of ORG or municipally - owned shares in properties , or the award of compensation bonds . Requests under LAW were to be addressed to the regional governor or the relevant minister .", "CARDINAL . Once the regional governor had received such a request , the procedure unfolded in CARDINAL stages . Firstly , the regional governor had to decide whether the interested parties were entitled to compensation . The regional governor then issued a second decision , based on an expert report , determining the amount of compensation to be awarded . The decisions taken at the different stages of the procedure were subject to judicial review .", "CARDINAL . NORP The regional governor \u2019s refusal to acknowledge the interested parties\u2019 right to compensation is subject to judicial review in a CARDINAL stage procedure ; the first stage established the right to compensation and the means thereof , and the second determined the amount of compensation to be awarded .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE the rules concerning judicial review of administrative measures were contained in DATE LAW , which obliged the domestic court examining an appeal against an administrative measure to notify all interested parties of the appeal ( section CARDINAL ) ) ; those parties could then join the proceedings and defend their rights . Similar provisions were contained in section ORG ) of the DATE Supreme Administrative Court Act , in force until DATE . Since DATE , such matters have been regulated by LAW , which contains similar requirements .", "CARDINAL . Before DATE the conditions and procedure for judicial review proceedings were set out in LAW ( Article CARDINAL et seq . ) A third party could apply to have such proceedings reopened in cases where they had been adversely affected by a final judgment and unduly deprived of the opportunity to participate in the proceedings . The requisite time - limit for parties to make applications for the reopening of proceedings was DATE from the date upon which the third party became aware of the judgment at issue . According to the ORG \u2019s settled practice , compliance with the DATE time - limit did not depend on the time which had passed since the judgment \u2019s entry into force , because the third parties\u2019 rights would otherwise be seriously undermined .", "CARDINAL .
