NORP In DATE , the applicant 's wife moved out of their home and went to live in GPE . The children have since lived with the applicant . Shortly after her departure , PERSON sought to obtain an interlocutory injunction granting her the sole responsibility for the DATE care of the children , arguing that the applicant had physically abused her and had an abusive consumption of medication .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been taking medication for ORG and for an earlier back injury .", "CARDINAL . Both ORG ( byrett ) and ORG ( lagmannsrett ) rejected her request . Subsequently the applicant and PERSON concluded a judicial settlement agreement according to which he was to assume the DATE care .", "CARDINAL . Concurrently with the above , PERSON reported the applicant to the police alleging that he had assaulted and threatened her . The police granted a request for an injunction prohibiting the applicant from visiting her or calling her by telephone but , after having heard the applicant , they dismissed all her complaints and lifted the prohibition .", "CARDINAL . NORP In addition , PERSON reported her concerns ( bekymringsmelding ) to the local child care authorities , alleging that the applicant was abusing intoxicating substances and that the children were at risk of violence . The child welfare services ( ORG ) at ORG ( helse- og sosialdistrikt ) opened an investigation ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the first investigation \u201d ) under section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) , in order to verify whether there was any ground for taking child care measures under LAW ( notably under section CARDINAL which sets out the grounds for compulsory taking into care of a child , such as serious deficiencies in the child 's DATE care , ill - treatment or other serious abuse occurring in the home , likelihood of parents ' inability to provide care causing serious damage to the child 's health or development ) . As a result , from DATE until DATE , the authorities carried out CARDINAL unannounced visits to the applicant 's home .", "CARDINAL . The applicant felt that ORG held preconceived views against him , due to the number of visits over DATE , inter alia in order to reveal high consumption of medicines , and that confidential information had been imparted to PERSON in this way . After exchanges between his lawyer and ORG , the matter was transferred to the child welfare services at ORG , which had their first conversation with the applicant on DATE . He was reticent to talk to begin with but , after being told that his ability to shield the children against the parental conflict was of great relevance , at a meeting on DATE he provided such information and also produced written statements by his doctor on his consumption of medicines and the possibility of reducing it .", "CARDINAL . The first investigation was discontinued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE followed a renewed call of concern to the child welfare services ( PERSON ) in GPE . The boyfriend of ORG sister had called to inform that PERSON had perceived the applicant as being drugged when speaking to him on the phone that day . Immediately , on DATE , the child welfare services carried out an unannounced visit to the applicant 's home and left after TIME , having found no evidence of intoxication .", "CARDINAL . In a report of DATE by the ORG concerning the first investigation , it was noted inter alia that the applicant 's doctor considered his consumption of medication too high and that it was desirable to reduce it , while the applicant , following his lawyer 's advice , was unwilling to come forward with information on the subject . No instances of intoxication had been found . The report concluded that the children did not live in a situation that was covered by any of the grounds for compulsory taking into public care under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , although the boys ' care situation had been made insecure and unpredictable by the parents ' conflict . The report also contained an assessment of the conduct of the mother , who appeared very assertive and was using inter alia the child welfare services in her \u201c warfare \u201d against the applicant , to the boys ' detriment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a new report of concern , this time by a named third party , Mr R , who was a police officer , the child welfare services at ORG opened a new investigation ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the second investigation \u201d ) . The source referred to an incident which he had observed while off duty near an ice hockey arena on DATE , when the applicant allegedly had difficulty standing on his feet , due to intoxication . A trainer had held him under his arm and had led him out . As the applicant wished to drive home his car keys had been taken from him . The applicant 's mother had then come to collect him . Mr R worked at the local police station and as he had returned to work he had found a message stating that somebody had called to report that the applicant had driven his children by car while in a state of intoxication . Mr R had the impression that the applicant often had turned up at the sports hall in a visibly intoxicated state .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL other sources , CARDINAL of which were anonymous , had reported respectively on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE incidents of intoxication and , CARDINAL of them , that the applicant was violent and threatening and mentioned rumours about drugs abuse .", "CARDINAL . The anonymous report of DATE recounted an incident when the applicant had been so intoxicated that he did not manage to pass the sliding door in the sports hall and that , when his oldest son assisted him through the door , the applicant hit after him . Some adults in the hall had commented that this was not the first time . The managers of the sports club had called the applicant 's mother who came to collect the children . The source was worried about the children 's situation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report of DATE had been submitted by another named third party , Mr O , recounting that some time before DATE his son and the latter 's mother had gone to the applicant 's home to fetch some money . When they arrived the applicant had fallen over due to intoxication . They had then brought the applicant 's eldest son with them to the cinema . Since the applicant was not capable of fetching the youngest son in the kindergarten , they had called the applicant 's mother and informed her . When Mr O. heard about this incident he was worried for the applicant 's children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities communicated to the applicant through his lawyer CARDINAL of the above reports of concern , namely those of DATE and DATE , with an invitation to the applicant for a meeting to discuss the allegations . In response to the above , the applicant 's lawyer pointed out that the reports of concern were of the same type as those that had prompted the investigation which had been opened in DATE and had been concluded . He explained to the authorities that the applicant had not been under the influence of drugs but had fainted in a state of malaise ; he had not had breakfast DATE and had been under duress because of the proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , who refused his cooperation in the investigation , the allegations against him must have originated from persons within his ex - wife 's entourage and were part of her attempt to obtain the DATE care of the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , with reference to an investigation conducted under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , addressed requests for information to several instances , stating that the ORG had reason to fear that the applicant 's children lived in a situation such as described in section CARDINAL of the Act . The requests , which set out specific questions capable of shedding light on the children 's situation , were addressed to the applicant 's doctor , who was also the doctor of his CARDINAL sons , the school of the eldest son , the kindergarten of the youngest son , and the police , who were reminded of their obligation under section DATE ) to disclose such information to the child welfare services . In addition , the applicant 's mother was invited to the ORG for an interview .", "CARDINAL . By a letter also dated DATE ( but posted on DATE ) to the applicant 's lawyer , ORG , enclosing copies of the above mentioned requests , informed him of the commencement of the second investigation . It referred to ORG report of DATE stating that the extent of the applicant 's use of tablets was unclear and that he , on the advice of his lawyer , had refused to comment . It had been the ORG 's intention to inform about these requests at a meeting on DATE , but since the applicant and his lawyer had objected to meet , they had been informed in writing . The ORG added that a meeting with the applicant was scheduled for DATE , by which date they expected to have received the information requested from the above instances .", "CARDINAL . ORG received information from the doctor , the school , the kindergarten and the police . The applicant 's mother declined to meet for an interview . His ex - wife gave an interview by telephone from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The investigation was concluded by a report from the child welfare services at LOC , dated DATE , which stated that they were worried that the applicant might abuse intoxicating substances ( \u201c rusmisbruk \u201d ) , were unsure as to how much his ORG diagnosis affected his ability to assume care and were uncertain as to his capability to provide the children with a sufficiently good up - bringing and about his potential for development . It recommended support measures under section CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , to be evaluated by DATE . The measures included assistance such as designating a support home which the children could visit , providing the applicant with guidance on how to master his ORG illness and problems related to drug taking , while at the same time assuming responsibility as a carer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disputes this assessment , which had not been based on any further unannounced visits to his home , nor on information provided by his doctor , but on circumstantial evidence collected outside the home .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had instituted proceedings before ORG to obtain a declaratory judgment ( fastsettelsesdom ) , maintaining that there was no legal basis for conducting an investigation against him . He also requested an interlocutory injunction suspending the investigation pending judgment in the case . ORG found that it was not possible to bring the matter before the courts and on DATE dismissed ( avviste ) the case . It observed that the matter could not be viewed as a \u201c decision \u201d taken in the exercise of official duties in the sense of Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Code of Civil Procedure . As interpreted in light of the requirement of \u201c legal interest \u201d in Article CARDINAL , this term clearly referred to \u201c individual decisions \u201d ( \u201c enkeltvedtak \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicant , ORG , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , upheld ORG decision , by a judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The majority considered that a decision taken by the child welfare services to carry out an investigation was not decisive for the applicant 's rights and obligations and thus was not a \u201c decision \u201d in the sense of LAW . The applicant did not have a legal interest in the case under LAW . A decision to implement an investigation was only a step in the child welfare services ' preparation of the case and thus was not decisive for his rights and obligations . Nor was there any conflict with Articles CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The minority found that the appeal should be admitted for review ( fremmet ) , considering that the applicant had a legal interest in having it judicially established whether the authorities had unjustifiably interfered with his right to respect for private life .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought to appeal against ORG decision by challenging its application of the law . He maintained that from ORG DATE and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure and Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , it followed that he should have a right to have the lawfulness of the investigation carried out by GPE reviewed by ORG . He requested ORG to quash ORG decision of DATE which upheld ORG dismissal of his case and to refer the case back to ORG for examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG decided that the case as a whole should be determined by ORG , under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( GPE - lov om forandring i lovgivningen om PERSON , DATE no . CARDINAL ) . On DATE the President of ORG decided that it should hear the parties according to the rules applicable to ordinary appeals ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . In his letter to the applicant 's lawyer of DATE , notifying the applicant of the above decisions , the Registrar of ORG pointed out that , having regard to the fact that the case concerned the application of the law , it was assumed not to be necessary ( to commission a first instance court ) to collect evidence for use by ORG . Should the parties nonetheless be of the view that this was necessary , their representatives should by DATE give an account of what evidence should be collected and how . Within the same time limit the representatives of the parties were requested to confer about possible dates for oral hearing and shortly thereafter ORG would contact them to fix the hearing date . The rapporteur judge had estimated that the hearing would last for DATE and the representatives of the parties were invited to express a view on the presumed duration of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The child welfare services of ORG submitted their concluding report of DATE . Otherwise the state of the evidence was the same as before the lower courts . Neither of the parties had responded to the above - mentioned communication of DATE by asking that additional evidence to be collected for use by ORG .", "CARDINAL . After holding an oral hearing , at which both parties were legally represented , ORG in a decision of DATE upheld , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , ORG dismissal of the case .", "On behalf of the majority , PERSON Justice PERSON gave the following reasons :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) By way of introduction , I would point out that this case concerns a further interlocutory appeal , in which the jurisdiction of this court in principle is limited pursuant to LAW . In this instance , however , ORG , and now ORG , has full jurisdiction , since the lawsuit filed by [ the applicant ] was summarily dismissed ' because the case is not a matter for the courts of law ' , see Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) .", "( CARDINAL ) I will first consider the suit in relation to the conditions for filing a lawsuit under traditional NORP procedural law , set out in LAW . Under this provision , it is a procedural condition that the suit shall concern ' a legal relationship or a right ' . Furthermore , there must be a ' legal interest ' in having the case decided , which inter alia means that the plaintiff must have an actual need for a judicial clarification .", "( CARDINAL ) The investigation was opened on DATE and had to be carried out as soon as possible and within CARDINAL , alternatively DATE at the latest , see section TIME ( CARDINAL ) of the [ DATE ] Act . The final report is dated DATE and was sent to [ the applicant 's ] lawyer on DATE , with notification that the investigation was closed .", "( CARDINAL ) [ The applicant ] has contested the fact that the final report represented the end of the investigation . Reference is made to the fact that the report culminated in a recommendation that family assistance be provided in the home , subject to evaluation within DATE , so that there was still a ' case ' in progress .", "( CARDINAL ) To this I would comment that the purpose of an investigation , as expressed in section CARDINAL of the [ DATE ] Act , is to ascertain whether there is a basis for taking measures pursuant to the LAW , and section CARDINAL - CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , first sentence , states that ' an investigation [ pursuant to section CARDINAL ] is regarded as completed when the child welfare services have made an administrative decision to implement measures or it has been decided to drop the case . ' Thus such measures do not represent a continuation of the investigation , but its conclusion .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP Since the investigation has been closed , it is difficult to see how a judicial decision could have any legal significance for [ the applicant ] . It will not affect the implementation of the voluntary assistance measures recommended in the final report . Nor will it make any difference as regards the right to initiate a possible investigation in the future , based on new circumstances , or to decide to implement other measures pursuant to LAW , if warranted by circumstances .", "( CARDINAL ) According to precedent it is undoubtedly the case that the requisite legal interest may cease to exist after legal proceedings have been instituted , with the consequence that the case must then be summarily dismissed . This may even occur - as in the present case DATE after judicial remedies have been pursued against a decision made in a court of second instance .", "( CARDINAL ) I would add that a decision to carry out an investigation pursuant to section CARDINAL of the [ DATE ] Act is not an individual decision in the sense of LAW . The same applies to the measures initiated in the course of the investigation , in this instance the obtaining of information pursuant to section DATE of LAW . As a general rule , it is not possible to make the lawfulness of such procedural steps the object of a separate lawsuit pursuant to LAW . However , any errors made at this stage could be significant in a lawsuit brought against any administrative decision that might be taken , and could possibly also form the basis for a claim for damages .", "( CARDINAL ) [ The applicant ] has undoubtedly experienced the investigation as a strain , also because it was started shortly after the end of a prior investigation , and any judgment in his favour might seem like redress . However , this is not sufficient either to justify a legal interest , see PERSON ( Supreme Court Legal Reports - \u201c Rt\u201d)-CARDINAL - CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) Accordingly , I conclude that under traditional NORP procedural law [ the applicant 's ] suit had to be summarily dismissed .", "( CARDINAL ) [ The applicant ] has claimed that a summary dismissal of the case will constitute a breach of the right of access to a court under LAW in cases relating to ' civil rights ' .", "( CARDINAL ) I find it unnecessary to express a view on whether a demand that the child welfare services shall not make an investigation concerns a ' civil right ' at all . In any event , the ORG accepts that national law must have some latitude to impose limitations on the right of access to a court . However , this is conditional on the limitations having a legitimate purpose , and a proportionality criterion also applies , which means that there must be a reasonable relationship between the purpose of the limitations and the effects they have . Finally , the limitations must not have such far - reaching consequences that the very essence of the right to a court is impaired , see the judgment of ORG in the case of O v. GPE ( DATE ) , Series A No . CARDINAL , which states that the right to a court can not be precluded in more substantial disputes .", "( CARDINAL ) In the Rt-CARDINAL - DATE , the first voting judge points out that ' sparing society \u2013 both courts of law and involved parties \u2013 lawsuits which , even if they were to succeed , would have no significance for the plaintiff 's legal position ' , constitutes a legitimate aim , and that the proportionality requirement does not militate against maintaining the requirement of a ' legal interest ' either . I concur with this . Nor can I see either that the limitation on the right to bring special lawsuits regarding the type of procedural decisions at issue in this case affects the essence of LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) In my opinion , therefore , the summary dismissal of [ the applicant 's ] suit does not represent a breach of LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) Accordingly , I shall move on to the question of whether the suit must be allowed in pursuance of LAW ... . [ The applicant ] has asserted that the investigation was a breach of LAW right to respect for his private and family life ' . The parties are in agreement that in this case there existed no right to lodge an appeal to a superior administrative body , in connection with either the opening of the investigation or the specific steps that were subsequently taken . Thus any review provided for in LAW must be carried out by a court of law .", "( CARDINAL ) The Convention was incorporated into NORP law by LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL and , in the event of a conflict , takes precedence over provisions in other legislation , see section CARDINAL . This means , as stated on page CARDINAL , first column , of ORG . CARDINAL to the PERSON [ the larger division of GPE ] ( DATE ) , that ' should a situation arise , after incorporation , where ... LAW the right to a judicial hearing whereas no corresponding right is provided by LAW , a judicial hearing must be allowed ' .", "( DATE ) It is my understanding that the LOC acknowledges that the grounds that would lead to a summary dismissal of [ the applicant 's ] lawsuit pursuant to LAW are not tenable pursuant to LAW . I concur . Pursuant to LAW , the question of whether LAW has been breached must be regarded as a legal issue and be made the object of a declaratory suit [ fastsettelss\u00f8ksm\u00e5l ] , even if the breach has ceased to exist . The doubt as regards the right to demand a judgment for non - compliance with a convention that existed in DATE , the so - called ' FAC case , must be regarded as having been dispelled by the adoption of LAW and the rule of precedence set out in section CARDINAL of the said Act .", "( CARDINAL ) Nevertheless , under the case - law of ORG , Article CARDINAL only requires the availability of a remedy before a national authority if there is a reasonable ground for claiming that the LAW has been breached ; there must be an arguable claim . This criterion is interpreted in accordance with LAW , pursuant to which a complaint to ORG shall be summarily dismissed if it is ' manifestly ill - founded ' ; see inter alia paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( DATE ) , Series A No . CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) Since the right to take legal action pursuant to LAW has been extended as a result of the incorporation of LAW , there is reason to consider whether the limitations developed in the LAW case - law should also apply in NORP law . The question will then be whether the courts shall summarily dismiss a suit which , after a preliminary substantive assessment , is considered to be clearly unfounded . In that event , it is not a question of limiting rights that are already protected under NORP law , but of the degree to which they are to be extended . Thus no conflict with LAW can arise either , as [ the applicant ] has argued .", "( CARDINAL ) In the continuation of the passage I cited above from ORG . CARDINAL ( DATE ) to the PERSON , it is stated that ' [ the Ministry ] will however obtain an assessment ... of whether LAW should be amended so that it is clearly evident from the statute when lawsuits concerning alleged breaches of human rights conventions are to be allowed and when they are to be summarily dismissed ' , and that the question was to be considered by the committee that was to be appointed to examine LAW with a view to its revision . The report of LAW recommends that no substantive ' screening system ' should be introduced for lawsuits concerning possible breaches of the Convention ; see PERSON ( ORG \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d CARDINAL:CARDINAL page CARDINAL . On the other hand , the ORG points out that lawsuits that clearly can not succeed could be decided by means of a proposed simplified court hearing . No such possibility exists in our current procedural system , but it will , if it is introduced as proposed by the ORG , largely satisfy the considerations regarding the saving of time and costs in legal proceedings that have been advanced as the main arguments in favour of a screening system .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG the issue should be resolved in the current dispute seems uncertain . I find it natural to take as the point of departure the fact that LAW establishes by statute DATE while at the same time limits \u2013 the right to bring any declaratory suit before a court . In the absence of statutory regulation of the issue , it is my view that the relaxation of the statutory conditions for bringing a lawsuit that follows from the LAW can not in principle go beyond what would be a direct consequence of the LAW and its incorporation into NORP law . Admittedly , some might object that it is foreign to NORP law to assess the merits of the claim in order to decide whether the case shall be heard . But the question concerns a right to take legal action that until now has not had a clear basis in NORP law .", "( CARDINAL ) I would add that filing a suit such as the CARDINAL at hand , which has aimed at halting the investigations of the child welfare services , could entail considerable disadvantages . It will draw resources away from the real functions of the child welfare services , and might make its work more difficult in situations where it is necessary to react without undue delay . This reinforces the need for a simple , rapid assessment of whether there is any substance at all in the plaintiff 's claim . This concern will be met by applying the ORG 's own rule of summary dismissal if the claim is not arguable .", "( CARDINAL ) The consequence of my view is that the question of summary dismissal will depend on whether the suit , based on LAW , must be considered manifestly ill - founded .", "( CARDINAL ) I would add , however , that I have not thereby concluded whether the threshold for summary dismissal should be as low as that applied by ORG . As emphasized by PERSON in GPE Journal of Jurisprudence ) DATE , page CARDINAL , there are good reasons why national courts should follow a less stringent practice as regards summary dismissal . However , as will be shown below , the present case is in no way on the borderline in that respect .", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) I find that the investigation constituted an interference with [ the applicant 's ] right to respect for his private and family life under LAW . On the other hand , however , I find it clear that it was an interference that was justified under the exception clause in LAW .", "( DATE ) The decision to make an investigation is subject to a statutory condition - there must be ' reasonable cause to assume that circumstances prevail which may provide a basis for measures ' ; see section CARDINAL of the [ DATE ] Act . However , as stressed by the GPE , this criterion is linked to a professional assessment by the child welfare services , and the threshold for initiating an investigation is meant to be low . In Proposition No . DATE ) to the PERSON , it is also emphasized that interests of privacy will often have to yield to the child 's best interests ; see pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) The investigation in dispute was opened on DATE . DATE , a first investigation had been completed , in which it had been concluded that the children ' are living in an insecure and unpredictable care situation ' . When a new child concern report was received on DATE , under section CARDINAL of the [ DATE ] Act the child welfare services had to consider whether it should be followed up by investigations pursuant to section CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) [ The applicant ] has maintained with vigour that this child concern report DATE which had given cause to suspect that he was intoxicated when he was with the children and misused pills , which was also the basis for the previous investigation \u2013 was unwarranted . I offer no opinion on this question , but can not see it otherwise than that the child welfare services had to carry out an investigation pursuant to section CARDINAL , with a view to obtaining confirmation or disproving that there was cause for concern in regard to the children 's care situation . The fact that there was an objective basis for initiating investigations was otherwise corroborated by new child concern reports and information from the school and day care centre indicating that the children had special care needs which it was doubtful that [ the applicant ] could fulfil . Finally , this was also confirmed by the assistance measures recommended by the child welfare services in their final report .", "( CARDINAL ) In relation to LAW it is particularly important to consider the specific steps that were taken during the investigation . In this case , it was a question of obtaining information pursuant to section DATE ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL of the [ DATE ] Act .", "( CARDINAL ) I find it clear that it can not be claimed that any breach of the [ the DATE ] LAW had occurred . Admittedly , in its final report , the child welfare services found no basis for making an administrative decision under section CARDINAL . However , in order to collect information it was sufficient that there was a substantiated suspicion that the children were in a situation such as described in the said provision . I would add that [ the applicant 's ] unwillingness to cooperate with the child welfare services was also unlikely to calm their basically justified uneasiness about the children 's situation .", "( DATE ) Nor is there any ground to claim that the investigation did not pursue legitimate purposes or was unnecessary . In this respect it suffices to refer to ORG Right 's decision of inadmissiblity of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON , in which precisely the children 's best interest were emphasised . The Commission stressed that the obtaining of information , as in the present case , was proportionate to the legitimate purpose and an interference of limited extent , since the public administration was also subject to a duty of confidentiality . Finally , it was also emphasized as a factor that the person whom the interference concerned was kept informed as to the information that was disclosed , as was done in [ the applicant 's ] case .", "( CARDINAL ) Accordingly , it is my view that point CARDINAL of the operative part of ORG decision must be upheld .", "( CARDINAL ) The interlocutory appeal has not succeeded . However , the case has raised hitherto unsettled questions concerning the relationship between traditional NORP law and LAW . In my view , the circumstances must be said to be so special that [ the applicant ] should not be ordered to pay costs either before ORG or ORG . ORG hearing has also been conducted in accordance with the rules for appeals , with the consequences that this has for the amount of the costs . Otherwise as regards ORG , the legal representatives were appointed at public expense ....", "CARDINAL . The dissenting member , Mr ORG , stated :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) It is my opinion that the lawsuit must be admitted to ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) I agree with the first voting judge that the suit would have had to be summarily dismissed in accordance with ' traditional NORP procedural law ' . I also agree that such a dismissal would not constitute a breach of the right of access to a court guaranteed by LAW CARDINALof the Convention .", "( CARDINAL ) The first voting judge expresses the opinion that , as a consequence of incorporation of the LAW into NORP law by LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL , a claim may be made for a declaratory judgment asserting that there has been a breach of the Convention . I concur in this opinion . The view taken by the majority as regards this question in Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , the ' ORG case , can not be maintained following the adoption of LAW . Given the relatively limited requirements that can now be made in this respect for this type of suit , I also find that [ the applicant ] has a sufficient actual interest in the suit ; see PERSON QUANTITY , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) On the other hand , I do not agree with the first voting judge that a suit regarded as manifestly unfounded must be summarily dismissed . Once it has been accepted that a suit may be brought with a claim for a declaratory judgment asserting a breach of the LAW , the way in which such a claim should be dealt with depends , in my view , on NORP rules of procedure . It is therefore not decisive that the screening system , which according to the first voting judge should be applied , will not be contrary to the LAW . Under NORP procedural law , the assessment of whether the conditions for filing suit have been satisfied is based on the plaintiff 's submissions with regard to the claim he or she is putting forward . If the claim \u2013 in the event manifestly ill - founded \u2013 can not succeed , judgment must be given for the respondent after a hearing on the merits of the claim . In my view , it would be contrary to this principle to procedurally dismiss on a non - statutory basis manifestly unfounded lawsuits regarding breaches of the LAW after a summary examination on the merits , cf . the majority vote in DATE , ORG CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , and PERSON : NORP med kommentarer ( The Code of Civil Procedure , with commentary ) , CARDINALnd edition , p. CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) I can not see that the provision in LAW prescribing that a complaint to ORG shall be summarily dismissed after a summary examination [ ... ] if it is manifestly ill - founded can be transposed , on a non - statutory basis , as a procedural condition to lawsuits concerning breaches of the Convention that are brought before NORP courts . I would also note that the considerations that serve as grounds for the various dismissal provisions in LAW may appear in a different light as regards lawsuits brought before national courts . A rule on summary dismissal of the kind at issue in this instance will , in my view , give rise to several procedural problems , concerning notably the legal force of the orders . My objections to such an arrangement also hold good if a rule of summary dismissal departing from LAW were to apply on a non - statutory basis , for instance if one were to apply a less stringent practice of summary dismissal than that of ORG or if the scope of the summary dismissal rule were to be limited in another discretionary manner .", "( CARDINAL ) I agree with the first voting judge that filing a suit like the one at hand could give rise to significant disadvantages for the work of the child welfare services . However , such suits are DATE in my view \u2013 a consequence of the fact that it has now been made permissible to file suit complaining of a Convention breach irrespective of whether a judgment of this nature would entail specific legal effects for the plaintiff . In my view , an attempt must be made to reduce the problems that arise in this connection by adopting rules regarding simplified judicial hearings as has been proposed by ORG . In this connection , I wish to comment that the purpose of the screening system in question here will in actual fact be to introduce , on a non - statutory basis , a simplified hearing on the merits of the claims covered by the arrangement . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
