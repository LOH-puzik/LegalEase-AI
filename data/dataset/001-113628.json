The Government of GPE were given notice of the application and they informed ORG on DATE that they would not exercise their right to intervene in the present case .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) against GPE under former LAW . The applicant alleged that he had been in effect kidnapped and tortured by the authorities of GPE , that he had never been informed of the reasons for his arrest , that he had not been brought promptly before a judge , that he had been unable to obtain review of his detention , which had been unlawful , and that he did not have an effective remedy before the courts of the Republic .", "CARDINAL .

The application was then considered by the ORG which gave judgment on DATE ( PERSON v. GPE , no.CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG ORG ) . In its judgment the ORG accepted the findings of fact made by ORG ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE of the judgment ) . It first rejected the respondent Government \u2019s preliminary objection of non - exhaustion of domestic remedies to the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW . In this respect the ORG noted that although the ORG had opened the way for the institution of criminal proceedings against the officers involved in the applicant \u2019s alleged ill - treatment , the Attorney - General had refrained from taking any action ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of the judgment ) . The ORG considered that the competent authorities of GPE would have discharged their obligations under the LAW by instituting criminal proceedings against the officers named in the ORG \u2019s report , irrespective of the outcome of such proceedings ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of the judgment ) . This was , in the ORG \u2019s complaint to the ORG should have normally brought about this result ( \u00a7 DATE of the judgment ) . ORG then held that the ill - treatment to which the applicant had been subjected had been inhuman in breach of LAW ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the judgment ) . Further , the ORG held that there had been a breach of LAW as the authorities had not conducted an investigation capable of leading to the punishment of the officers involved in the applicant \u2019s ill - treatment . The ORG observed that such an investigation was \u201c the only remedy that was appropriate for the kind of violation complained of \u201d ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of the judgment ) ; however , the ORG , who was the official in charge of bringing criminal proceedings in the Republic , had not taken any steps in this direction ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of the judgment ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a former President of ORG was appointed as an independent criminal investigator ( \u201c the investigator \u201d ) by the Attorney - General acting ex officio .", "CARDINAL . The Government , in giving their factual account , relied on a letter sent by the investigator to the Attorney - General dated DATE in which the former set out the various developments that had taken place in the investigation and , in particular , the problems he had faced in trying to obtain a statement from the applicant . The Government submitted that in DATE , the investigator , after having carried out all the background preparatory work , had contacted PERSON , the lawyer who had represented the applicant before ORG and the Ombudsman ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the judgment ) , who informed him that the applicant would see him for the purpose of giving a statement . The investigator also made arrangements for an interpreter so that the statement could be taken in the NORP language . Mr PERSON was informed of this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a person who stated that he was the applicant \u2019s friend , visited the investigator and suggested that the applicant be paid a sum of money in return for a statement to the effect that he did not have a complaint and that the case be closed .

The investigator stated in his letter ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that he expected that the applicant would contact him but that had not happened . Neither the applicant nor his lawyer contacted the investigator after this . In his letter the investigator informed the Attorney - General that it would not be possible to continue a criminal investigation without the complainant \u2019s statement and sought the instructions of the Attorney - General as to how to proceed .", "CARDINAL .

He stated that he had contacted the investigator who had informed him after a long period of time that he could not register the applicant \u2019s complaint against the police officers because the Government had not appointed an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . In the revised memorandum of DATE , a revised version of the memorandum presented at the ORG meeting of ORG , the ORG considered that the information provided by the Government on the measures adopted until then indicated that sufficient improvements in existing procedures and safeguards had been introduced .

The NORP authorities have stated that the investigation process is confidential . However , the complainant \u2019s participation in the investigation process is important , whether the alleged offence was committed by police officers or members of the public .", "CARDINAL . From the outset of the investigation process , where the alleged offence was committed by a police officer , the complainant is informed by a letter from the Attorney General that an independent criminal investigator has been appointed to investigate his or her allegations ; the letter includes the name and particulars of the investigator . A copy of CARDINAL such letters was forwarded to the ORG on CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Complainants participate in investigations by giving their own testimony , upon which the investigation is based . The complainant is always the first to be interviewed ; he or she supplies information and his or her statement is taken by the investigator . The investigator can come back to the complainant for any clarifications and supplementary statements or information as the investigation proceeds , thereby giving the complainant the opportunity to challenge the statements of other witnesses . The complainant is not , however , given the statements of other persons interviewed in the course of the investigation ; nor are the latter given the complainant \u2019s statement . Criminal investigations proceedings in GPE are modelled on those of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Complainants are also prosecution witnesses in the criminal proceedings . Thus , during a criminal trial , complainants can give their own testimony in front of the ORG . Indeed , the prosecution bases its case on the testimony of complainants .

The fact that such investigations are not to be closed in cases where an obstacle temporarily prevents the investigation from being pursued further is also noted .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the NORP authorities have taken a number of measures to strengthen the effectiveness of investigations into allegations of human rights violations committed by members of the police . In addition , following the events that gave rise to the present judgment , a possibility has been introduced of opening a fresh , independent investigation into the allegations at the basis of the present violation and such an investigation has indeed been opened , which , in the circumstances of the present case , appears to meet the requirements of execution . In the light of the foregoing , it would now appear that the guarantees surrounding such investigations , combined with the appointment of an independent investigator in the present case , are sufficient to allow the ORG to close its examination of the individual measures taken in the present case . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
