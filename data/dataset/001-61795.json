During DATE , the ORG returned their possessions , including a washing machine , drier , microwave , gas bottles , kettle and clothing . This was dumped on the roadside some distance away from the applicant \u2019s caravan . The ORG stated that on CARDINAL DATE the ORG removed from the plot to safe storage goods and personal property that the applicant and his family had failed to take with them . At the request of the applicant , the ORG returned these goods and personal property to the family who had meanwhile taken up occupation on land nearby at FAC owned by ORG , where the presence of gypsies was sometimes tolerated for short periods . As they claimed it was not possible to get into the field to deliver the goods directly , the ORG unloaded the goods at the edge of the field , informed the applicant and kept watch until they were collected .", "CARDINAL . A group of gypsies was at that time on the land at FAC for the purpose of attending a wedding . This group did not however leave by DATE as previously agreed , staying on to attend the funeral of a baby who had died on DATE . The ORG prepared eviction proceedings and included the applicants as \u201c persons unknown \u201d .

An application for adjournment of the possession proceedings was rejected by ORG on DATE . The applicant and his family moved from the land and travelled around the GPE area stopping for DATE at a time .", "CARDINAL . The Government stated that the applicant and his family had returned to the caravan site CARDINAL times since as trespassers . The ORG applied for an injunction to ban the applicant and his family from entering the site . The outcome of these proceedings is not known .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that following the eviction he and his family were required to move on repeatedly . Partly at least due to the stress and uncertainty , the applicant \u2019s wife chose to move into a house with the younger children and they were separated in DATE . PERSON lived for a while with the applicant . Following the eviction , he did not return to school . The applicant stated that he continued to travel in his caravan , with his son PERSON and occasionally PERSON , but that they were unable generally to remain in any place for DATE . He continued to have chest pains for which he received medication and tests . As he had no permanent address , he used his wife \u2019s address for postal purposes , including medical appointments .", "CARDINAL . Prior to DATE , LAW DATE provided in section CARDINAL that it should be the duty of local authorities \u201c to exercise their powers ... so far as may be necessary to provide adequate accommodation for gypsies residing in or resorting to their area \u201d . The Secretary of ORG could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary ( section CARDINAL ) . In addition , MONEY ( GBP ) was spent under a scheme by which MONEY grants were made available to local authorities to cover the costs of creating gypsy sites .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Justice and LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which came into force on DATE , repealed sections CARDINAL of LAW and the grant scheme referred to above . The change in policy underlying the repeal was explained by the Parliamentary Under - Secretary of ORG :", "\u201c In DATE the number of gypsy caravans stationed on unauthorised sites has remained broadly the same ... The shortfall in provision has been largely due to natural growth in the gypsy population . Plainly site provision is barely keeping pace with the growth in demand and is not reducing the shortfall ...", "We recognise that council site provision has contributed to alleviating the difficulties experienced by the gypsy community . Indeed the predicament of gypsies in GPE and GPE is now far different from in DATE . At that time , probably CARDINAL per cent of gypsy caravans in GPE and GPE were stationed on authorised sites , whereas the figure is now MONEY . A further MONEY are on authorised private sites , and many more are stationed on tolerated sites where they are allowed to stay with reasonable security from eviction . ...", "We believe that public provision of sites has now reached an acceptable level . Public accommodation has been provided for MONEY of the total number of gypsy caravans in GPE and GPE . We do not believe that it is in the public interest to continue to maintain what has become an open - ended commitment to provide sites for all gypsies seeking accommodation at the public \u2019s expense . It is our view that the right approach now is to encourage more gypsies to establish their own sites through the planning system . We know that many gypsy families would prefer to establish their own sites rather than reside on council sites . ORG has for a long time supported the case for private provision . Private site provision has increased by CARDINAL per cent since DATE . Our intention is to encourage that trend . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Local authorities remain empowered to provide gypsy sites under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act and such sites remain the largest single component of the overall supply . Under current policy guidance , the Government have emphasised the importance that local authorities maintain their existing sites and consider if it is appropriate to provide further sites ( Circular CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL ) . In DATE , the ORG announced that they were making available MONEY over DATE to help local authorities to maintain their sites .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act gives to a local authority power to direct an unauthorised camper to move . An unauthorised camper is defined as", "\u201c ... a person for the time being residing in a vehicle on any land forming part of the highway , any other unoccupied land or any occupied land without the owner \u2019s consent \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Failure to comply with such a direction as soon as practicable , or re - entry upon the land within DATE , is a criminal offence . Local authorities are able to apply to a GPE court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of such a direction ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Guidance issued by the Secretary of ORG dated DATE ( Circular CARDINAL ) concerned the unauthorised camping by gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land ( CJPOA above ) . Paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL required local authorities to adopt \u201c a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments \u201d :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which can not be effectively controlled , an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance . Accordingly , authorities should consider tolerating PERSON presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites , for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets , a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water . ...", "CARDINAL . Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government - owned land , it is for the local authority , with the agreement of the land - owning ORG , to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health . It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of ORG that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance .", "CARDINAL . The Secretaries of ORG continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly . They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs CARDINAL further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions DATE . These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly - born children , the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson , NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE , and NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE , unreported ) , ORG held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages .", "CARDINAL . Occupiers of gypsy caravan sites run by a local authority receive limited security of tenure pursuant to Part CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . An occupier \u2019s contractual right can be determined by DATE notice and he may only be evicted by court order . Local authorities are in addition required to have regard to the guidance on best practice in managing gypsy sites , e.g. such as set out Circular CARDINAL concerning statutory duties to support children , to house the homeless and make appropriate educational provision for school - age children . A local authority failing to have regard to that guidance might be subject to challenge by way of judicial review .", "CARDINAL . The Mobile Homes Act DATE ( LAW ) confers further protection upon a person who lives in a caravan or mobile home as his only or main residence . Such a person may not be evicted save by court order and on the site owner having established CARDINAL of the stated grounds , inter alia , that the court is satisfied that the occupier is in breach of the licence agreement and has failed to remedy that breach within a reasonable time and that it is reasonable for the agreement to be terminated . This protection was conferred on occupiers of caravans on privately owned residential sites and also the occupiers of local authority sites . However , section CARDINAL ) excluded land run by the local authority as a caravan site for gypsies . The effect of this exclusion was analysed by ORG in ORG v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL HLR CARDINAL :", "\u201c ... the intention of the legislature in the Act of DATE was clearly to exclude from the definition of \u2018 protected ORG sites such as that at ORG provided by local authorities in discharge of their duty under section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE to accommodate those whom they bona fide believe to be gypsies because they are nomadic for part of DATE , notwithstanding that they may establish a permanent residence on the site by returning from DATE ; such a site will not become a \u2018 protected ORG even if some of the erstwhile nomads , as well they may , give up their nomadic way of life entirely . It would be different if the local authority adopted a policy of offering vacancies on the site to static residents with fixed full time employment ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Secure tenants of conventional flats or houses provided or managed by local authorities under LAW DATE enjoy a similar regime of security of tenure to that conferred upon occupiers of a residential caravan site by LAW .", "CARDINAL . A number of cases have been brought in the domestic courts challenging the lack of security of tenure on local authority gypsy sites .", "CARDINAL . In this case , a gypsy , whose licence to occupy a local authority site had been revoked for alleged misbehaviour , claimed in the proceedings brought for possession of the plot , that the eviction would be in breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and sought a declaration of incompatibility .", "CARDINAL . In rejecting the gypsy \u2019s claims and ordering possession , the High Court judge , Mr Justice PERSON , found that the eviction of the applicant would interfere with his rights under LAW but that the statutory framework , as a matter of general principle and policy , satisfied the requirements of LAW . He noted CARDINAL general points :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... First , statutory regulation of housing and the consequences of such regulation are matters of some complexity . For example , while security of tenure may be to the advantage of existing tenants or licensees , it may be to the disadvantage of tenants and licensees generally . In the DATE \u2019s , security of tenure for residential tenants and control of rents were reimposed under ORG . Doubtless those measures were in the short term interests of residential tenants . However , in the long term they led to a reduction in the supply of privately - rented accommodation , which , on CARDINAL view , was disadvantageous to residential tenants and potential tenants generally . There is no simple equation between security of tenure and the public interest .", "CARDINAL . The second general consideration is related to the first . Housing is very much \u2018 the area of policy where the court should defer to the decision of ORG ... The need for , and the consequences of , legislation in this area are matters for ORG , not the court ...", "\u2018 ... We do not lose sight of the fact that courts are not primary decision - makers in areas such as housing policy . GPE confers a wide margin of appreciation in such matters ... our own courts will give a margin of discretion to elected decision - makers , all the more so if primary legislation is under ORG . ORG v. Smart [ DATE ] EWCA Civ . CARDINAL per ORG", "CARDINAL . NORP The policy behind the exempting provisions was clearly stated by FAC in his speech in ORG in PERSON at DATE ... :", "\u2018 Any other construction of \u2018 protected ORG in section CARDINAL ) of the Act of DATE would , it seems to me , cause great difficulties both for local authorities and for most of the gypsy community and would undo much of the good work which has been done in this difficult field . Those already established on sites like Thistlebrook would , of course , enjoy full DATE security of tenure . But local authorities in the position of the council would need to start de novo to discharge their duty under LAW of DATE . Many existing designations under section CARDINAL would have to be revoked or would perhaps be automatically invalidated ... For the future , local authorities establishing new sites providing accommodation for gypsies would have to be vigilant to prevent their residence acquiring any degree of permanency . This , I think , they could in practice only do by applying a short rule - of - thumb limit of stay , which would be quite contrary to the interests of the gypsy community.\u2019", "CARDINAL . [ Counsel for the defendant gypsy ] submitted that this statement was no longer applicable as a result of the abolition of the duty of the local authority to provide sites for gypsies . I do not accept this submission . The statement of Lord Bridge is equally applicable to the sites which local authorities continue to provide , although they are under no duty to do so . Furthermore , as has been seen , central government guidance is that it is important for those sites to be maintained . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge quoted at length the evidence of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s department on the aims of the CARDINAL statutory frameworks , CARDINAL applying to all local authority gypsy caravan sites and the other to all other residential caravan sites run by local authorities and private owners :", "\u201c \u2018 CARDINAL . With Part I of LAW , and with the DATE and DATE Acts , ORG sought to address specific problems of commercial exploitation experienced by occupiers of private sites . There has never been any evidence to suggest that such problems extend to local authority Gypsy sites , and accordingly those legislative provisions that are directed at those problems have not been extended to such sites . The problems faced by NORP were wholly different , relating primarily to the acute shortage of sites available to meet their particular accommodation needs . The said problems were addressed by Part II of LAW , and supplemented by the departmental guidance circulars issued to local authorities . By DATE , the scheme of part II of the DATE Act was found to have served its purpose as far as it could reasonably be expected to do . There was now a substantial and valuable supply of Gypsy caravan sites provided and operated by local authorities . The emphasis of Government policy has now changed to CARDINAL of encouraging NORP themselves to add to that existing supply . Nevertheless existing local authority supply remains an essential component of the Government \u2019s strategy of securing an adequate level of accommodation for LANGUAGE . The policy of LAW is to maintain and safeguard that distinct source of supply .", "CARDINAL . Thus , I draw particular attention to the fact that the statutory protection afforded by Part CARDINAL of the DATE Act and the DATE and DATE Acts has been and still is available to NORP if they choose to reside at sites other than those provided by local authorities specifically for NORP . In general , the key difference between such sites has been the greater flexibility , which is usually available on local authority Gypsy sites , in order to accommodate the nomadic lifestyle of occupiers . This may allow NORP to remain on a site on a short - term basis , or to retain a site for DATE , while paying a reduced rent as a retainer during DATE while they may be travelling in search of seasonal work . Other local authority sites and private sites , in general , are aimed at longer - term residential occupiers , without the need for such flexibility because they are not pursuing a nomadic lifestyle .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , there are of course a number of NORP who occupy sites on a long - term basis , and other mobile home residents who do not consider themselves to be GPE , but who prefer to occupy private sites on a more short - term basis . The aim of the separate statutory frameworks is to ensure diversity of provision to meet the varying needs of different individuals and families ; it is not to classify or categorise individuals or families . Accordingly , NORP seeking to settle on a more permanent site may occupy private or local authority ( non - Gypsy ) sites and benefit from the scheme put in place by Part I of the CARDINAL Act and LAW . This diversity of public and private site provision reflects that which is available in housing generally .", "CARDINAL . The separate statutory framework allows for flexibility in meeting the accommodation needs of NORP . It appears that the Defendant is effectively arguing in these proceedings in favour of a single statutory framework applicable to all caravan sites , including local authority Gypsy sites . In my view , such a single statutory framework would be detrimental to the interests of NORP throughout the country . If the security of tenure provisions of that framework applied equally to local authority Gypsy sites , it would undermine the flexibility that such sites provide in catering for the varied lifestyles of GPE . Some may move from site to site on a regular basis , while others may be more permanently based on a site , possibly travelling for DATE to take on seasonal work . If each Gypsy were able to rely on security of tenure then every site , whatever its designation , could potentially become a permanent site with no scope to accommodate short - term occupiers . Furthermore , if there were no longer a distinction in the statutory framework allowing flexibility for the provision of Gypsy sites , then there would be nothing to prevent any person residing in a mobile home seeking to occupy a Gypsy site , whether or not they pursue a nomadic lifestyle . Inevitably , fewer sites , if any , could be made available specifically for NORP pursing a nomadic lifestyle .", "...", "CARDINAL . Experience suggests that local authorities would face difficulties in managing sites if eviction were subject to broad discretionary powers of the courts to suspend or attach conditions to orders . There is a balance to be struck between the latter and the merits of flexibility ( already mentioned ) that such sites offer in catering for the varying accommodation needs of NORP . To this ( and in favour of the existing position ) must be added the fact that in reaching decisions about evictions local authorities , as responsible bodies , need to take into account the range of obligations and considerations outlined in paragraph CARDINAL above . These amount to significant safeguards against unscrupulous or unjustified evictions . Furthermore local authority decisions in relation to eviction are open to challenge by way of judicial review.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . While I am not over - impressed by the vagueness of the statement in paragraph CARDINAL that \u2018 experience suggests\u2019 , applying the guidance given by ORG in Smart , this evidence satisfies me that the exempting provisions are \u2018 necessary in a democratic society\u2019 , and a proportionate response to a social need , and do not amount to an infringement of LAW . It is true that occupiers of exempted sites do not have the benefit of the safeguards applicable to introductory tenants . In practice , however , they are able to bring judicial review proceedings where the circumstances justify them , and I do not think that the absence of those safeguards substantially prejudices persons such as the Defendant . Moreover , any such safeguards would detract from the flexibility that ORG has decided is appropriate for exempted sites . ...", "CARDINAL . I can deal with LAW quite shortly . The exemption in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG is justified by the special position of local authorities and the policy considerations referred to above . The exemption is section CARDINAL of the MHA depends on the status of the site owner as a local authority , and not on any personal quality of the licensee or tenant . It therefore raises no question of discrimination contrary to LAW .", "Conclusion", "...", "CARDINAL . This conclusion is consistent with that of the Commission in P v. GPE ( App . No . CARDINAL ) which rejected as inadmissible the complaint by gypsies that their eviction from an exempted site infringed their rights under ORG CARDINAL and DATE . Mr PERSON submitted that this decision was no longer applicable by reason of the abolition of the duty of local authorities to provide sites for gypsies . As I stated above , I do not regard this as a valid distinction between the present position and that DATE . There are still sites provided by local authorities for gypsies , and indeed if there were none there would be no scope for LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In this case , a NORP gypsy , threatened with eviction from a council site , sought a declaration that the provisions of LAW were in breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention insofar as it failed to provide the protection given to secured tenants of local authority conventional housing . In rejecting the application , Mr Justice PERSON noted that the parties had agreed that there had , in the past , been objective justification for the lack of security of tenure of gypsy occupiers of council sites and that the claimant \u2019s case was that , in light of changes , that was no longer the case . He summarised the Secretary of ORG \u2019s case for justification for the absence of security of tenure as follows :", "\u201c i. Nomadism . The whole raison d\u2019\u00eatre for gypsy culture and identity , and indeed its defining factor , given the absence of necessary ethnicity - not all gypsies are PERSON , not least the so - called New Travellers - is nomadism . Hence the definition in LAW ...", "ii . Site availability . There must be a substantial availability of sites for gypsies . PERSON referred to the problem of \u2018 balance\u2019 in general terms in PERSON in paragraph CARDINAL : [ cited above ] .", "The submission is thus that there is no good clogging up all the caravan sites with those who do not move , and effectively removing them from the stock of available sites , by giving security of tenure .", "iii . Flexibility . This is reflected in the decision in PERSON . There is a stock of secure pitches on private sites , where there is security of tenure by virtue of the FAC . It is in respect of private sites that protection from commercial exploitation is necessary , and in any event the safeguard of administrative law remedies is not available . Thus the necessary \u2018 GPE of private and council , secure or insecure , pitches , is maintained .", "Mr PERSON [ Director of Housing at ORG and the Regions ] most clearly sets out the effect of these justifications in combination at paragraph CARDINAL of his reply witness statement :", "\u2018 There are limited resources for providing publicly funded accommodation , whether it be for gypsies or members of the \u2018 ORG community . The Government is trying to make sure that there is provision for gypsies who have a nomadic way of life . There are other alternative forms of occupation for those with a settled way of life , which are as equally available to gypsies as they are to any other person . However if accommodation which was intended for those with a nomadic way of life could become converted into accommodation for those with a settled way of life just by the life choices made by the occupants , then this would make planning for nomadic persons by local and central Government very difficult.\u2019", "PERSON [ Chairman of ORG , expert witness instructed by the claimant ] , while not challenging the historic justification , submits that it no longer applies :", "\u2018 CARDINAL . Mr PERSON states that the legislation regarding gypsy accommodation is tailored so as to facilitate a nomadic way of life ... The fact is that the nomadic way of life is ending for most gypsies , and therefore the existing legislation is unsatisfactory ...", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the situation DATE is very different from what was envisaged at the time of the DATE ... Act and the [ ORG ] . The examples I have given of the low turnover and lack of vacancies show that council sites are becoming permanent residences for most of the families . They often have mobile homes and utility buildings . In this changed situation there seems no reason why residents should not have the same right as the tenants of council housing or non - Gypsy mobile home sites.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge summarised the statements of both PERSON and PERSON PERSON concerning the differing patterns of life chosen by gypsies : Mr PERSON emphasised the flexibility necessary to cope with those who move on a regular basis or were permanently based on CARDINAL site but possibly travelling DATE while PERSON stated that position had substantially moved on from the time of LAW when it was anticipated that PERCENT of families travelled , that local authorities even encouraged families to become permanent residents by allowing them to leave for periods and pay CARDINAL rent and that for the small minority that travelled all year round there were the existing small number of transit sites . The judge then summarised the conclusions of the DATE report ( see below ) which was found to be the most significant feature in the evidence before him .", "CARDINAL .

It is plain from the passages of the DATE Report that I have cited that it is now accepted that there is a substantial majority that no longer travels for any material period , albeit that there is a substantial minority that does travel . No figures have been produced , and , as PERSON himself has pointed out , no statistics as to turnover yet exist , but the varied passages from the ORG which I have cited in paragraph CARDINAL ) show that it is accepted that some thinking must now be done . Nevertheless when asked by me whether the Secretary of ORG wanted an adjournment to consider the position further , Mr Mould clearly stated that no such adjournment was sought , and that his case remains that , rethink though there plainly is going to be , the Secretary of ORG still accepts the onus of showing that the present legislation can still be justified . This is not a case , as adumbrated in PERSON and PERSON , where the Government now accepts that the position can no longer be justified but asserts an entitlement to a period to correct discriminatory effects before a declaration is made ... but rather a situation where the Government is still in the process of monitoring the position and , until it reaches a conclusion , asserts that the present position can be justified .", "CARDINAL . If this were simply a matter of concluding that there is now a substantial majority of gypsies who are no longer nomadic , whose position can be immediately safeguarded by some new legislation of the kind discussed in general terms in paragraph CARDINAL above , I would not feel inhibited either by the well - established principles of allowing deference and/or a margin of appreciation to Government or ORG ... nor in particular by the principle enunciated by ORG ... whereby the \u2018 possible existence of alternative solutions does not in itself render the contested legislation unjustified\u2019 . However I am satisfied that the position is not so straightforward . There is , in my judgment , quite apart from any simple question of giving security of tenure to those in council caravan sites , a necessary , indeed , crucial , concomitant question to be considered and resolved , before it can be concluded that the present position is unjustified . I conclude that there is a very difficult question of how to define gypsies , to whom security of tenure in such sites is to be given ( if it is ) . If security of tenure is to be given to all long - term caravan occupiers on council sites , as they are on private sites , then how , if at all , is there to be any differentiation between gypsy / traveller occupiers and any other occupiers who wish to place a mobile home on a local authority site , with security of tenure ? And if there is to be no such differentiation , then the last state of gypsies whose cultural heritage or spiritual and cultural state of mind is nomadism or travelling may be worse than the first . At present that actual or potential nomadism ( \u2018 a substantial nomadic habit of life\u2019 ) is the justification both for the lack of security of tenure and also for the special arrangements for local authority sites catering especially for them , i.e. within section CARDINAL of GPE and ORG DATE . PERSON himself refers obliquely to the problem , in paragraph CARDINAL of his witness statement : \u201c The residents of council sites do not have to retain their Gypsy status ( by travelling for an economic purpose ... ) in order to retain their pitches . \u201d ...", "CARDINAL . I am satisfied that ... the absence of security of tenure for all gypsy / travellers on all local authority sites , is still appropriate and justified . I have no doubt that the ORG will give further thought to the position , as indicated in DATE , will obtain the necessary further statistics and will , pursuant to its own declared intention to give protection to gypsies and their way of life , continue monitoring the present position . Meanwhile , the safeguard of judicial review remains , and , although there is some discussion in the ORG ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) about the present lack of security of tenure , eviction of residential gypsy occupiers on local authority caravan sites is not flagged up as a present problem ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In this case , which dealt with local authority housing for the homeless that fell outside security of tenure provisions , ORG rejected the ORG claims that their summary eviction breached ORG CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Convention :", "\u201c If this court were to hold that a tenant in the circumstances of either of these appellants is by force of Article PERSON ) entitled to have the county court judge ( or the judicial review court it matters not ) decide on the particular facts whether her eviction is disproportionate to the council \u2019s aim ( in essence ) of managing its housing stock properly , we would in effect thereby convert the non - secure tenancies enjoyed by homeless persons into a form of secure tenancy . We should be imposing a condition , not unlike the requirement of reasonableness presently applicable in relation to secure tenancies under LAW , which takes the judgment whether possession of the LOC should be obtained from the landlord council and gives it to the court ...
