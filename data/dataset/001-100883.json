The judge in the minority gave a dissenting opinion . He pointed to the fact that the work schedule of ORG had been modified several times in the course of DATE without any acceptable explanation . There was no indication that an objective and transparent method for the reassignment of cases had been established and applied . Moreover , during the relevant period no similar steps had been taken at ORG to redistribute cases in differing categories despite the far heavier case load in those other categories .", "CARDINAL .

II . \u00daS CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG held in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE in case no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL that the right \u201c not to be deprived of his or her lawfully appointed judge \u201d attaches to the person of the judge and not to a court . A ' lawfully appointed ' judge is one who , fulfilling the statutory requirements for being a judge , has been assigned to a case under the work schedule of the court concerned .", "CARDINAL . ORG has also held ( by a decision of DATE in case no . II . \u00daS CARDINAL ) that the right of a person \u201c not to be deprived of his or her lawfully appointed judge \u201d can not be interpreted in so broad a manner as to pertain to a specific , individual judge .", "The purpose of this constitutional right is therefore satisfied if an individual 's rights are decided upon by a judge who has been duly appointed to a court which has jurisdiction ratione loci and ratione materiae and is at the appropriate level of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . In reviewing the additional constituent elements of the notion of a \u201c lawfully appointed judge \u201d under LAW , ORG held that it is not only statutory provisions , in particular those of ORG , that are of relevance but above all the provisions of the LAW , chiefly LAW , which provides that everyone may claim his or her rights by way of a procedure established by law before an independent and impartial court ( judgment of DATE in case no . III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has also held ( in its judgments in cases nos . II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL and II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that , in principle , a \u201c lawfully appointed judge \u201d is the judge assigned to a specific case under the work schedule of the court concerned . However , if there are circumstances justifying the reassignment of the case or of the entire agenda to a different judge for the reasons envisaged in sections CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Rules , any newly assigned judge becomes a lawfully appointed judge . Such circumstances comprise , for example , the long - term absence of a judge , significant differences in workload among judges , or sudden events preventing a judge from taking specific steps in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE in case no . II . \u00daS CARDINAL , ORG held that a president of a court must not use his discretion , contrary to the law , to take a case away from a lawfully appointed judge and assign it to another judge in order to accommodate one of the parties without providing a precise ground of justification for the reassignment .", "CARDINAL . The Rules were issued by the Minister of ORG . As then in force , they defined the internal rules of ORG and the discharge of tasks by those courts .", "Section CARDINAL of the Rules governed courts ' work schedules , that is to say the distribution of cases among court divisions and judges .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL , the distribution of work at courts was to be determined in a work schedule for a whole calendar year . The schedule of work was also to provide for the substitution of judges .", "CARDINAL . Under paragraph CARDINAL , where a judge was absent for a long period or where there were substantial differences in the workload of judges at the same court , the President of the court was given power to decide that a certain amount of work be transferred to a different division of the court .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL provided that , where a sudden event prevented a judge from carrying out individual acts in a case , the court 's president might charge a different judge to take the action required .", "CARDINAL . Under paragraph CARDINAL , a court 's president was to take the measures indicated in paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL in accordance with the rules concerning the replacement of judges as defined in the work schedule , unless a different action was required with a view to ensuring the proper functioning of the court .", "CARDINAL . No further statutory rules on the status and creation of courts ' work schedules existed at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL .
