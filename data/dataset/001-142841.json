The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) issued an enforcement order ( hereinafter \u201c the first enforcement order \u201d ) against the applicant \u2019s movable assets for unpaid mobile telephone bills in the period DATE and DATE . This decision was served on a certain GPE on DATE , and subsequently became final .", "CARDINAL . At the plaintiff \u2019s request , on DATE ORG ordered the enforcement ( hereinafter \u201c the second enforcement order \u201d ) by way of attachment of the applicant \u2019s earnings . This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against both enforcement orders . She argued that she could not have made the said telephone calls , because she had been in prison DATE and DATE and the police seized her mobile telephone . She enclosed a receipt to show that her mobile telephone and ORG cards had been taken from her .", "CARDINAL . She further argued that the first enforcement order had never been served on her as she was in prison at the time .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicant requested the quashing of the certificate of enforceability ( klauzula ovr\u0161nosti ) of the first enforcement order .", "CARDINAL . The recipient of the applicant \u2019s submission of DATE was ORG , which forwarded it to ORG PERSON u ORG ) as an appeal against the second enforcement order .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal inadmissible as lodged out of time , finding that DATE for lodging an appeal was DATE , whereas the appeal had been lodged on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to rectify its decision , as in fact she had lodged her appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for rectification . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c ... the ORG can rectify mistakes in names and numbers and other obvious mistakes ... and flaws ... In this case , the complaint was indeed erroneously declared inadmissible as out of time ... Nevertheless , a mistake of this sort is not an obvious mistake ... which can be rectified , but it is an erroneous decision binding the ORG after its service on the parties , notwithstanding its invalidity ...", "It should be mentioned , however , that the enforcement debtor did not suffer any disadvantage as a result of such a decision . The enforcement debtor in fact appealed against the enforcement order ... of DATE on the grounds of a serious breach of procedural rules , arguing that the enforcement order was not served on her . Since the enforcement order in question was merely a decision changing the means of enforcement , and a decision of such nature can be appealed against only if it orders enforcement of objects and rights exempted from enforcement ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) ... the enforcement debtor \u2019s appeal should have been dismissed .", "If the enforcement debtor \u2019s claim that the initial enforcement order was never served on her were true , that decision could not have become final and the enforcement debtor should , in the view of this ORG , have asked the first - instance court to duly serve the enforcement order on her , so that she could appeal against it ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently made a constitutional complaint , following which ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) separated that complaint into a complaint against the decision of ORG to declare the applicant \u2019s appeal inadmissible and a complaint against the refusal of ORG to rectify its previous decision . ORG declared both complaints inadmissible on DATE , on the grounds that they did not concern decisions on the merits of the case and as such were not susceptible to constitutional review .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( PERSON ) about the length of the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that it lacked jurisdiction , and forwarded the case to ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time , awarded her CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) in compensation , and ordered ORG to complete the enforcement proceedings within DATE of service of its decision .", "CARDINAL . It appears that ORG failed to meet that deadline ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
