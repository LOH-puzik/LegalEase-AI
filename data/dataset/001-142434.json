NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a sole trader , registered on an unspecified date under the name ET Atev \u2013 PERSON , with an office in Letnitsa . He is engaged in various commercial activities . Under NORP law his business does not have a distinct legal personality .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant registered his business for value - added tax ( \u201c VAT \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicant purchased electrical devices from another sole trader ( \u201c the supplier \u201d ) . The supplier issued the relevant invoices and , as it appears , indicated on them the ORG charged . In DATE the tax authorities conducted a VAT audit of the supplier . On DATE he was issued with a tax assessment which made no mention of the goods supplied in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the GPE ORG conducted a NORP audit of the applicant for the periods , in particular , from DATE and from DATE . On DATE it issued him with a tax assessment whereby it refused him the right to deduct the VAT of MONEY ( ORG ) , ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) , which the supplier had charged him in DATE and DATE . It also ordered that interest be paid in the amount of BGN CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the DATE tax assessment . On DATE the director of ORG upheld the DATE tax assessment in its entirety . The authorities stated that in order to recognise the applicant \u2019s entitlement to have the input ORG deducted , the ORG had to be entered in the accounting records of the supplier ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Therefore , they would have to crosscheck those records and verify that the LOC had been properly reflected as an obligation to the ORG budget . When the cross - check was carried out , however , the supplier declared that the relevant accounting records had been lost . Since the authorities could not verify whether the ORG had been reflected accordingly , they refused to deduct it . As for the applicant \u2019s argument that his supplier \u2019s DATE tax assessment did not contain any irregularities regarding the said supplies , the authorities dismissed it as being irrelevant for the proceedings at issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought judicial review . During the proceedings and following a request on the part of the applicant , ORG ordered an expert report . The applicant put questions to the expert . In a judgment of DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the DATE tax assessment . The court found that the tax authorities\u2019 refusal to recognise the applicant \u2019s right to have the ORG he had paid deducted was correct because the supplier \u2019s accounting records had been lost , making it objectively impossible to verify whether the ORG had been properly charged and reflected as an obligation to the ORG budget . The court also noted that although the applicant had had an opportunity to do so , he had not questioned the expert about those supplies and had failed to rebut the statements of the tax authorities in the tax assessment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal , and in a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the tax assessment . The court found that during the proceedings the applicant had submitted only documents originating from his own accounting records . Those documents , however , could not have served as evidence given the subject matter of the case . The court further noted that the applicant had failed to question the expert about the contested supplies . Having regard to the applicant \u2019s failure to rebut the authorities\u2019 findings and in the absence of the supplier \u2019s accounting records , the court concluded that it had been impossible to establish whether the ORG had been entered in them , which was CARDINAL of the pre - conditions sine qua non for allowing the applicant to have the input ORG deducted .", "CARDINAL . It is unclear whether the supplier was penalised for his failure to keep his accounting records diligently and in line with the relevant domestic provisions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant paid part of the debt under the DATE tax assessment , namely ORG EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . In DATE enforcement proceedings were instituted against the applicant for the collection of the remaining debt . It is unclear how the proceedings unfolded until DATE , when they were apparently resumed . The proceedings were still pending at the time of the latest information from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW DATE , input GPE , referred to as \u201c tax credit \u201d in domestic legislation , was the amount of GPE which a taxable person had been charged on goods or services received under a chargeable transaction or from the importing of goods or services ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . The LOC was to be charged by the supplier ( section CARDINAL ) ) . The recipient should have been in possession of a LOC invoice which met the statutory requirements ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) ) . In order for the recipient to have the right to deduction of VAT , it was mandatory for the supplier to have reflected the LOC charged to the recipient in his accounting records as an obligation to the ORG budget ( section CARDINAL ) with reference to paragraph GPE ) of LAW DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW DATE , which replaced LAW , are summarised in the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . In particular , the supplier \u2019s obligation to reflect the ORG that he has charged in his accounting records remained unchanged ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) in relation to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . The VAT Act DATE replaced the DATE Act to include in national legislation the latest GPE legislation in the sphere of GPE . The explicit requirement that , in order for the right to have input ORG deducted to arise , the supplier had to have reflected it in his accounting records , was abandoned .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , accounting documents relating to tax obligations must be maintained by the trader for a period of DATE after the expiry of the statutory time - limit for the relevant obligation ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) ) . Failure to observe that obligation is sanctioned by an administrative penalty ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The general rules of the law of tort are set out in sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that everyone is obliged to make good the damage which they have , through their fault , caused to another . Under section ORG ) , fault is presumed until proved otherwise .", "CARDINAL . In that connection , a recipient may successfully seek pecuniary damages from a supplier when the latter has acted in violation of the relevant LOC provisions , resulting in the LOC refusal to deduct the input ORG ( for example , if the supplier has failed to issue an invoice and to enter the tax in its accounting records , issued invoices but failed to enter the tax in its DATE declaration to the authorities , or failed to submit the relevant documents proving that he has discharged his LOC reporting obligations to the authorities ) ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 DATE \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043d\u0430 ORG \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , IV \u0433. \u043e. ; \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043d\u0430 ORG \u043f\u043e \u0442. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u0433. , NORP \u0442. \u043e. ; \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433. \u043d\u0430 ORG \u043f\u043e \u0442. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , NORP \u0442. \u043e. ; \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 DATE \u0433.
