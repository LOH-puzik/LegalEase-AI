In support thereof , on CARDINAL and DATE , the applicant wife stated that she and her parents had moved around a lot within GPE and had lived both in northern and central GPE and in GPE . The applicant wife went to school for DATE after which she worked as a pre - school teacher . Her family was under surveillance by the police because her father and sister were involved with ORG ( NORP ) . The applicant had also been a member of and worked for the NORP for DATE , when she lived in the north . She told the ORG that she was unable to take part in their training because she had asthma . They demanded that she work for them and she thus carried out social work and made sure that the children could attend school and that they were provided with food and medicine . The applicant wife 's parents did not like this and sent her to GPE , where she lived at a boarding house for NORP . In DATE , it appears , she and all the women at the boarding house were detained by the police , suspected of having blown up a bus . They were not provided with anything to eat or drink during the detention . Subsequently , she was arrested and interrogated on several occasions , including by ORG and the military . Her father paid for her release and arranged for her to leave GPE around DATE . Her case in GPE was undecided but she remained on a list of suspects .

NORP In an asylum application of DATE the applicant husband stated that he had been a member of the ORG from DATE . Having completed his training , he distributed propaganda for the organisation . He owned a garage at which he repaired cars , minibuses and jeeps . Both the ORG and the military brought their vehicles and would threaten him to work for CARDINAL party . The ORG also asked him to place a bomb in a military jeep . He refused and was then accused of being an informant . He kept a low profile for a while and sold his garage so that he could leave the country . If returned to GPE , the ORG would give him a death sentence .", "CARDINAL . According to an interview report of DATE , prepared by ORG ( Udl\u00e6ndingestyrelsen , now GPE ) the applicant husband added , inter alia , that when he was a member of the ORG in DATE he trained with them CARDINAL times a week , after school or after lunch breaks . He ended his membership because he wanted to finish training to be a mechanic . The ORG told him that he could still assist them by putting up posters . He did not always comply with their orders because he was afraid of being caught by the authorities . The latter asked him frequently about the NORP and its whereabouts and he would tell the authorities that he did not know anything . Nothing further would happen . The applicant husband was never wanted , detained or convicted and he had no criminal record . While working as mechanic , he had both the military and the NORP as customers . In DATE , he refused a request by the ORG to place a bomb in a military vehicle . He begged them not to cause any problems for him and eventually they left . In the end he felt so much under pressure and suspicion by both parties that he decided to leave the country . His departure was not triggered by a specific event , rather the general problems with the NORP and the military forces had become too much . In DATE or DATE he sold his garage . Thereafter he married and in DATE he travelled on his own to GPE with a view to leaving GPE . DATE he left for GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to an interview report of DATE , prepared by ORG , the applicant wife added , inter alia , that she had lived with her family at a boarding house in GPE for DATE . Before that she had lived at a refugee camp for NORP who wanted to go to GPE . Before that , from DATE , she had been a forced member of the ORG 's students ' organisation and carried out social work for the NORP . Her father had also carried out social work . He had not been a member of the NORP but was accused of being a supporter , which caused problems for the family . Her father was detained once in DATE or DATE , and in DATE he was detained many times . The police would come to their home which was situated in an area controlled by ORG . It was due to their NORP ethnicity that the family had so many problems with the army . The applicant wife did not know her sister 's exact position in ORG , as she had not been in touch with her for DATE , but she assumed that her sister had been a rank - and - file member of the ORG for DATE . When the applicant wife was detained in GPE in connection with the bombing of the bus , she spent DATE at the police station . It was a female suicide bomber wearing sandals who had blown up the bus , and the police therefore checked all girls wearing sandals , including the applicant , who was innocent . Her sister was also arrested in that connection . If returned to GPE , the applicant wife feared problems with the GPE army , which would know that she had been away from her country for DATE .

A prohibition on his entry into GPE had been issued against him until DATE . The applicant wife and the oldest child had also been granted refugee status in GPE on DATE and been granted unlimited protection on CARDINAL and DATE , respectively .

The applicant wife and the CARDINAL children had a right to stay in GPE even though their residence permit and passport had expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' request for asylum was refused by ORG finding that the applicants ' previous connection with ORG was unknown to the Sri - NORP authorities and that none of them would face a real and concrete danger of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW upon return to GPE . Thus , they failed to fulfil the criteria under LAW ( PERSON ) to be granted asylum .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the decision to ORG ( PERSON ) , before which an oral hearing was held on DATE . The applicant wife stated , among other things , that her father had led a humanitarian organisation which supported the ORG . Moreover , while being a member of the ORG 's students ' organisation she organised DATE meetings and made speeches and read out poetry . She was a publicly known person and NORP supporter . Her speeches were not political but concerned the situation in the country and the people who had given their lives for it . She had no connection with the high - ranking members of the NORP and she never carried out any military activities for the organisation . After the marriage , her husband ran into problems with the army and they left because he was wanted .", "CARDINAL . At the same oral hearing before ORG , the applicant husband changed his explanation and stated that he had sold his garage already in DATE and lived in hiding for DATE until he left GPE . He had to leave because the army knew about his work for the ORG . At some unknown time , several men from the army had pointed at him and said \u201c tiger \u201d and beaten him . The applicant husband submitted a declaration in LANGUAGE from a lawyer in GPE of DATE to \u201c whom it may concern \u201d stating that the applicant husband was one of several suspected of helping NORP and that he was \u201c wanted by the NORP NORP police and that there was a case pending against him \u201d . The applicant husband explained that the police had come to his home and delivered the letter to his mother . Subsequently , his mother had contacted the said lawyer who had contact with all NORP authorities . The lawyer had said that the applicant husband was wanted for a criminal offence related to the abduction of a man who had worked at his garage . The applicant husband was therefore a wanted person in GPE and would be killed by the authorities upon return .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG upheld the refusal to grant the applicants asylum . It found that the authorities were not aware of the activities carried out by the applicant wife which ended DATE before her departure . Likewise , it found that the applicant husband 's activities had a low profile character . Moreover , having regard to the time that had passed since the activities took place , there was no basis for assuming that the applicants were at risk of persecution upon return . Finally , it found that the applicants ' new changed explanations before it lacked credibility and it did not attach any value as evidence to the declaration submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' request for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds was refused by ORG ( NORP for flygtninge , indvandrere og integration ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) , an NGO , requested ORG to reopen the case . It referred to the applicants ' previous explanations and the general deterioration of the security situation in GPE . In addition it alleged that the applicant husband was of interest to the authorities , most recently in connection with a bombing in DATE , and that the same applied to the applicant wife , who was of interest to the authorities due to her extensive activities for the ORG ; her many arrests ; her sister 's high - profile membership of the NORP and subsequent television exposure ; and her father 's and cousin 's affiliation with the NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the applicants ' behalf , ORG also submitted a letter to ORG requesting that it stay the applicants ' deportation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG decided to apply Rule CARDINAL of ORG , indicating to the Government that it was in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicants should not be expelled to GPE pending the ORG 's decision .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE ORG extended the time - limit for the applicants ' departure until further notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to reopen the applicants ' asylum case .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicants ' representative forwarded a CD - ROM to ORG with a copy of a television broadcast which allegedly showed that the applicant wife 's sister was active with the ORG as a high - profile \u201c training master \u201d . The representative maintained that in DATE the applicant wife had talked to her father in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to suspend the examination of all asylum cases concerning ethnic NORP from northern GPE , including the applicants ' case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of the most recent background information concerning GPE including , inter alia , a Memorandum of CARDINAL DATE prepared by ORG , ORG decided to review the suspended cases , including the applicants ' case .", "CARDINAL . ORG obtained the files on the applicants from the NORP and the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . During a hearing before ORG on DATE the applicant wife submitted a photograph of a stage performance and explained that she had played before an audience of CARDINAL people at such theatrical events . The play in question concerned the life story of an NORP member , who was a martyr . The applicant wife believed that there were people present among the audience who informed the Government about the plays . Furthermore , her father had been deeply involved with the NORP . The applicant wife added that just before her departure in DATE she was arrested by the criminal police in GPE , who said that she was to be interviewed again at a different location . Her father bribed the police and DATE after , she left the country . The last time the applicant wife had contact with her family was when she spoke to her cousin in DATE . She last spoke to her mother and sister in DATE . The applicant did not know where her family was . The applicant wife showed a video clip from GPE to ORG , allegedly showing her sister with other NORP members in DATE . The applicant had last seen her sister in DATE when they lived at the boarding house in GPE . The applicant did not know where her sister was . Finally , the applicant wife submitted that in GPE , she has participated in demonstrations against the hostilities in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the outset of the hearing before ORG on DATE the applicant husband stated that he was mentally well and capable of being interviewed . He stated that he and his father were attacked by NORP in DATE . His father was killed and the applicant sustained an injury to his hand . Moreover , he had inherited the garage from his parents in DATE . DATE the ORG had asked the applicant husband to place a bomb in a military vehicle . He had refused but hid the bomb in his garage , where it remained even after he sold the garage for CARDINAL rupees in DATE . He was afraid that the bomb had been discovered and that he was therefore wanted by the authorities . He left GPE using a false passport with his own picture . The applicant husband had no contact with his family . He last spoke with them in DATE . However , in DATE and DATE he received CARDINAL letters from his mother who stated that the buyer of the garage had informed the authorities about the bomb in the garage and that the secret police sought her out in order to find him . It appears that he submitted the CARDINAL said letters from his mother , dated DATE and DATE , alleging that the authorities were looking for the applicant husband . It also appears that the applicant husband submitted yet another declaration from the same lawyer , who had made the declaration in DATE . It was dated DATE to \u201c whom it may concern \u201d and stated , inter alia , that the search for the applicant husband \u201c had been intensified by the police , intelligence unit of ORG and the parliamentary groups \u201d and that \u201c there were several cases against him for allegedly supporting the NORP \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused to reopen the applicants ' case . It found that the most recent general background information would not lead to a revised assessment of the case . More specifically in its letter to the applicant 's representative it stated as follows :", "ORG finds that the applicants have provided new and/or extended information during the reopened proceedings , and that this gives rise to critical doubt about the credibility of the applicants ' information , as there appears to be no reasonable explanation for the late appearance of the information , even in view of the information regarding the applicant husband 's mental difficulties , see counsel 's pleading of DATE with exhibits . The applicant wife has thus stated that the reason why she did not inform ORG of her NORP theatre performances in the previous asylum proceedings was that at the time she was not in possession of the photograph now submitted ... ORG finds that this is not a reasonable explanation why she did not , at the beginning of her asylum case , inform ORG of the high profile that she now invokes . The applicant wife further stated that , in connection with the arrest where her father paid a bribe for her release , she was the only one arrested and that she was to be questioned again at a different location , and that this arrest was the reason for her departure DATE . ORG finds that this statement contradicts her statement at the interview of DATE as reported by ORG according to which she was arrested with the sister who now lives in GPE and that her father paid for the release without any conditions . It appears from her asylum application form that the arrest for which her father paid a bribe took place in DATE . Her departure was in DATE . ORG finds that the applicant wife 's statement appears to have been extended on essential points and it only considers it a fact that her father did social or humanitarian work in the local community in his home town ... without being a member of the ORG , that as a member of the NORP DATE , the applicant wife also did social work for the NORP , including distribution of food and medicine , that she lived in various places after DATE , at which time she was exposed to general , brief periods of detention , and that DATE prior to her departure she lived in GPE , from where she departed using her genuine national passport . Moreover , ORG noted that the information provided by the applicant wife , that the last time she had contact with her father was in DATE , does not correspond with the information provided by ORG in its letter of DATE . ORG further notes that the applicant wife 's brief arrests were in the nature of general detention in which several other NORP were detained by the authorities in connection with situations where the ORG was considered responsible for specific actions . The applicant wife was released unconditionally every time . She stayed in GPE for DATE with part of her family before her departure . They were registered with the authorities in GPE . She departed using her own , genuine nationality passport . At the above interview , the applicant wife stated about her sister in the NORP that she had been a member of the NORP for DATE and that she assumed that her sister was a rank - and - file member , but that she had no contact with her . This statement contradicts the information about the sister provided by ORG in its letter of DATE .", "The applicant husband stated to ORG that , contrary to what he stated in DATE , he did in fact own the garage until DATE . He further stated that ORG left a bomb in his garage , that he hid the bomb there and that that was the reason why he chose to sell the garage ... in DATE for CARDINAL Sri NORP rupees . Thereafter , he stayed in various locations until DATE when he took up residence in or near GPE . He did not use his own name and was not registered with the authorities , and in DATE he left using a false passport with his picture inserted . ORG finds that this statement contradicts the applicant husband 's previous statements , including the interview report of DATE according to which he stated that he refused to help the ORG plant the bomb , that the NORP had eventually left , and that the NORP as well as people from the NORP army continued to force him to work for them , that he needed the money but that they did not pay very often , and that he eventually could not stand it and therefore sold his garage in DATE or DATE , that he stayed for DATE in GPE before his departure , and that he departed lawfully using his genuine passport in which a study visa had been inserted . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the idea that the applicant husband was the subject of a specific search at his mother 's house , and on the basis of an assessment of the applicant 's statement at the current ORG hearing , ORG does not find that the current statement and the letter from the mother , which dates from DATE , ... [ can ] lead to a revised assessment . Therefore , concerning the applicant husband , ORG only considers it a fact that he sustained an injury to his hand in DATE in connection with the assault where his father was killed , that he trained with the ORG for DATE and subsequently left without problems to continue his education , that he probably inherited the garage from his mother 's family in DATE , that he ran the garage , that he sold the garage in DATE because both the ORG and the Sri NORP authorities were pressuring him to work for them , and that thereafter he stayed in various locations , most recently for DATE in GPE before departing from the airport in GPE in DATE using his own name and his own genuine passport .", "... As the applicants ' statements are assessed , ORG thus deems it a conclusive fact that neither applicant stood out at all in DATE and DATE . Neither of them was wanted by the Sri NORP authorities nor did they have any specific conflicts with the authorities . Both departed lawfully . In the assessment of whether , if they were to return to GPE , including via GPE , the applicants , who are ethnic NORP from northern GPE , would risk persecution or assault as covered by section CARDINAL of LAW , including treatment as covered by LAW ORG , particularly because a video clip exists on PERSON of the applicant wife 's younger sister who allegedly was a high - ranking so - called training master in ORG according to the information received , ORG notes that in the sequence shown the person pointed out in the video clip - in part together with others and in part alone - is seen wearing a uniform and carrying weapons and ammunition and agitating for the ORG 's fight . The person in question speaks directly to the camera . ORG notes that there is no other information available about the applicant 's younger sister apart from that provided for the case by the applicant wife herself . In this connection , it gives rise to some uncertainty with ORG that the applicant wife stated at the hearing that the last times she had contact with her parents was in DATE , but that a cousin told her in a brief telephone conversation in DATE that the family was staying in PERSON According to the information from ORG ... on DATE , the applicant wife stated that in DATE she was contacted by her father who informed her that he was with her sister , but that they would move to M as soon as possible . Even if it is considered a fact that the sister in question is the person pointed out in the video clip on GPE , ORG finds that , in view of the applicants ' insignificant profile as described above , their return would not put them at risk of persecution or assault as covered by section CARDINAL of LAW . This assessment takes into consideration that the applicants departed lawfully from GPE in DATE and are now CARDINAL and DATE , respectively . Although the applicants are ethnic NORP from northern GPE , neither of them has had specific conflicts with the Sri NORP authorities and can not be considered to be wanted or having been wanted previously . In this respect , ORG finds that the circumstance that as ethnic NORP from northern GPE the applicants may risk being questioned by authorities when entering the country does not lead to a revised assessment of the case in terms of asylum law . In this assessment , consideration has been had to the background information available to ORG , from which it appears that the individuals at particular risk of being detained and investigated upon entry in GPE are young NORP , men in particular , from northern and eastern GPE : those without ID ; those not resident or employed in GPE ; and those recently returned from the LOC , see GPE ORG to GPE , GPE DATE . It further appears from the background material available to the ORG that , in general , individuals who have previously supported ORG on a lower level are not of interest to the authorities , see ORG , Operational Guidance Note , GPE , DATE , and ORG to GPE , GPE DATE . Therefore , ORG finds that , following an overall assessment of the specific circumstances of the present case , including the specific assessment that must be made according to the ORG 's decision of DATE , ORG . v. GPE , the applicants can not be considered to be in such a position upon return that it justifies asylum . The injury to the applicant husband 's little finger on his right hand is found not to lead to another assessment . The circumstance that the applicant wife has participated in demonstrations in GPE as CARDINAL of several GPE demonstrators is also found not to lead to another assessment . Accordingly , the applicants are still not entitled to a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW as they , if they return , are not considered to be at risk of persecution that could motivate asylum or of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as covered by section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ... No time limit for departure is fixed as ... the ORG has requested ORG not to return the applicants by force for the time being with reference to LAW . If the applicants ' basis for lawful residence in GPE lapses , they must leave GPE immediately ... If the applicants do not leave voluntarily , they may forcibly be returned to GPE ...", "CARDINAL . At some unknown time thereafter the applicant husband moved to GPE and obtained a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) , asylum is granted to aliens who satisfy the conditions of LAW . Applications for asylum are determined in the first instance by the former ORG ( now called ORG ) and in the second instance by ORG .", "CARDINAL .

Although the government has gradually reduced the military presence in the camps and has pledged to start the progressive return to their villages of origin of the majority of those in the camps , it is clear that this may take a considerable amount of time .

More recent claims from contacts in government ministries suggest that this practice has either ceased or is used less frequently . At the very least it appears that the security forces only conduct these when there is another reason to suspect an individual , and are not looking for particular scars as such , but anything that may indicate the suspect has been involved in fighting and/or military training . There is no recent evidence to suggest that these examinations are routinely carried out on immigration returnees . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
