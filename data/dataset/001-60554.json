The court held that the concept \u201c being ... a member of an independent trade union \u201d in section CARDINAL involved more than simply holding a union membership card , and included making use of the essential services provided by the union , such as collective representation . In offering pay increases to those who revoked their right to be represented by the union , the employer had intended to induce employees to abandon collective bargaining and thus to achieve greater flexibility and bring an end to the need to consult the union . In denying the pay rise to those who would not forgo collective representation , the employer had acted with the purpose of penalising union membership , contrary to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW .", "In PERSON it was accepted that the employer 's decision to de - recognise the union from DATE was not contrary to section CARDINAL , since the de - recognition was aimed at the union as a whole and was not action against any individual employee . The union had no legal sanction against de - recognition or the termination of the agreement on conditions of employment it had negotiated ; the only sanction available to it was the threat of industrial action . The employer 's purpose in offering a pay rise to those employees who accepted the new terms of employment was to negate the power of the union with a view to bringing an end to collective bargaining . Its purpose in denying the pay rise to the applicant because he refused to abandon collective bargaining was to deter him from being a member of the union .", "CARDINAL . The employers appealed to ORG , which , on DATE , decided unanimously against the applicants ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Law Reports : Appeal Cases CARDINAL ) . CARDINAL of the five Law Lords held that the word \u201c action \u201d in section PERSON ) could not be construed as including an omission , so that the withholding of benefits by the employers from the applicants did not amount to \u201c action ( short of dismissal ) \u201d . In addition , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Law Lords found that the employers ' conduct had not been motivated by \u201c the purpose of preventing , ... deterring ... or penalising \u201d union membership , although in ORG ( in the words of FAC ) \u201c it was plain that the employers were seeking by means of an attractive offer to induce their employees voluntarily to quit the union 's collective - bargaining umbrella and to deal in future directly with the employers over their terms and conditions of employment \u201d . However , trade unions could offer their members services other than the negotiation of terms and conditions of employment , and membership of a trade union could not therefore be equated with the use of the union 's services for collective bargaining .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment , the applicants withdrew their applications from ORG , having been advised that they could not succeed .", "CARDINAL . According to GPE law , a \u201c trade union \u201d is any organisation which consists wholly or mainly of workers and has the regulation of relations between workers and employers or employers ' associations as CARDINAL of its principal purposes ( section CARDINAL of ORG DATE \u201c the DATE LAW ) . There is no system of licensing trade unions prior to their recognition for collective bargaining .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events in question in this case , collective bargaining was a wholly voluntary process . There was no legislation in GPE which inhibited the freedom of employers to recognise or de - recognise trade unions for the purposes of collective bargaining ( LAW , repealing LAW DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ... ORG was of the opinion that the wording of section CARDINAL ) was so general that the effect of this provision was that only in exceptional cases would a tribunal be able to rule that the action taken by the employer was unlawful because it violated freedom of association . It considered that this weakening of the protection of freedom of association was not compatible with the requirements of LAW . It pointed out that ' ORG is obliged to take adequate legislative or other measures to guarantee the exercise of the right to organise , and in particular to protect workers ' organisations from any interference on the part of employers ' ( see most recently Conclusions PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . It also referred to its conclusion under LAW and its case - law to the effect that where a fundamental trade union prerogative such as the right to bargain collectively was restricted , this could amount to an infringement of the very nature of trade union freedom ( see most recently Conclusions FAC , p. CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

ORG has considered section CARDINAL of LAW in the context of a case of alleged intimidation intended to bring about the de - recognition of CARDINAL trade unions at a steel works in GPE , and the absence of any remedy under national law ( Case no . DATE , ORG of ORG , PERSON . ORG , DATE , Series B , no . CARDINAL ) . ORG concluded as follows ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . While bearing in mind that collective bargaining , if it is to be effective , must assume a voluntary character and not entail recourse to measures of compulsion which would alter the voluntary nature of such bargaining , the ORG has considered that the competent authorities should , in all cases , have the power to proceed to an objective verification of any claim by a union that it represents the majority of workers in an undertaking , provided that such a claim appears to be plausible and that if the union concerned is found to be the majority union , the authorities should take appropriate conciliatory measures to obtain the employer 's recognition of that union for collective bargaining purposes ( see Digest , op . cit . , paras . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . While noting from the ORG 's observations that collective bargaining is still an option for the employer , the ORG concludes that , given the facts available in this particular case , [ the employer ] has by - passed the representative organisation and entered into direct individual negotiation with its employees , in a manner contrary to the principle that collective negotiation between employers and organisations of workers should be encouraged and promoted . The ORG notes with interest the ORG 's indication that a ORG on fairness at work , with a focus on union recognition , is being prepared . ORG hopes that any resulting legislation will have as an effect the encouragement of employer recognition of representative workers ' organisations and requests the Government to keep it informed of the progress made in this regard .", "CARDINAL . Finally , as concerns the previous ORG 's argument with respect to the relevance of LAW of the [ CARDINAL LAW ] , the ORG can only state that , in the absence of a more detailed reply concerning the facts of this specific case based on a thorough and independent investigation , it is not in a position to judge on the relevance of LAW to the case in question . It would recall however that it was the ORG which had raised the matter of LAW in its initial reply to this complaint and that the conclusions reached by ORG were based wholly upon its conclusions in a previous case presented against ORG for alleged infringements of trade union rights ( see ORG , Case no . DATE ) wherein it had invited the Government to reconsider LAW in consultation with the social partners since it considered that this provision could hardly be said to constitute a measure to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements , as provided for in LAW no . CARDINAL ( ratified by GPE ) . The ORG recalls in this respect that section CARDINAL directs a tribunal , when considering a complaint of action short of dismissal taken by an employer for the purpose of preventing or deterring a worker from being or becoming a member of an independent trade union , to have regard primarily to the employer 's purpose to further a change in the relationship with the employees and the ORG had concluded that this section considerably limited the tribunal 's competence for determining such action as being in violation of section CARDINAL concerning action short of dismissal ( see ORG , Case no . CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) . The ORG does not consider that the possible effects of section CARDINAL have changed in this respect and it would therefore once again call on the Government to take steps to amend that section so that it ensures workers ' organisations adequate protection from acts of interference on the part of the employer and so that it does not result in fact in the discouragement of collective bargaining . It requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect . \u201d", "The ORG recommended , inter alia , ( and its recommendations were approved by the ORG 's ORG ) :", "\u201c ( a ) Noting with interest the ORG 's indication that a ORG on fairness at work , with a focus on union recognition , is being prepared , the ORG expresses the hope that any resulting legislation will have as an effect the encouragement of employer recognition of representative workers ' organisations and requests the Government to keep it informed of the progress made in this regard .", "...", "( e ) The ORG once again calls on the Government to take steps to amend LAW so that it ensures workers ' organisations adequate protection from acts of interference on the part of the employer and so that it does not result in fact in the discouragement of collective bargaining .
