The writs of execution issued on DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively , by ORG and ORG , were transferred to the competent bank and were listed among the charges on the debtor \u2019s account .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions thereafter the bank informed the competent courts that enforcement was not possible because the budgetary funds intended for that purpose had already been spent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , Mr PERSON , complained of the non - enforcement to ORG the LAW \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( decision no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG found a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW in Mr PERSON \u2019s and QUANTITY other cases on account of the prolonged non - enforcement of the final judgments in the appellants\u2019 favour .

The court notes that the judgments [ in favour of the appellants ] have not been enforced due to the lack of funds on the debtor \u2019s bank account .", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterates that under LAW and LAW all levels of government must secure respect for individual human rights , including the right to enforcement of final judgments under LAW and the right to property under LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention ... The scope of that obligation is not reduced in the present case , notwithstanding the large number of judgments ... [ T]he ORG notes that in NORP v. ORG , and again in \u010coli\u0107 and Others v. ORG , ORG reiterated that \u2018 it is not open to a ORG authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt . Admittedly , a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances , but the delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under LAW ...", "CARDINAL . ORG agrees with the position taken by ORG ... it is nevertheless aware of the effects the global economic crisis had on GPE ... The court notes that the federal and the cantonal governments had taken certain steps with the view to enforcement of final court decisions . LAW DATE provides that the final judgments against the GPE and the cantons shall be enforced within the amount of budgetary funds designated for that purpose ... and that the creditors shall enforce their claims in the order in which they acquired the enforcement titles ... In DATE and DATE the amount of funds for that purpose in the budget of the LOC was MONEY .", "...", "CARDINAL . The court finds that the crux of the problem in the present case is that the Zenica - Doboj GPE did not identify the exact number of unenforced judgments and the aggregate debt ... without which it is impossible to know when all the creditors will realise their claims against this canton . Furthemore , there should exist a centralised and transparent database of all the claims listed in chronological order according to the time the judgments became final . It should include the enforcement time - frame and a list of partial payments , if any . This will also help to avoid abuses of the enforcement procedure . These measure and adequate funds in the DATE budget would ensure that all the final judgments are enforced within a reasonable time ... and the LOC would ensure the respect of its obligations from LAW and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "...", "CARDINAL . The court considers that the adoption of section CARDINAL of the Enforcement Procedure Act DATE had a legitimate aim , because the enforcement of a large number of judgments at the same time would jeopardise the normal functioning of the cantons . However , the limitation of the enforcement in the present case is contrary to the principle of proportionality enshrined in LAW No . CARDINAL which requires that a fair balance is struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual \u2019s fundamental rights ... Section CARDINAL places a disproportionate burden on the appellants ... they are placed in a situation of absolute uncertainty as regards the enforcement of their claims ...", "...", "CARDINAL . In order to comply with its positive obligation , the government of the Zenica - Doboj GPE must , as explained above , calculate the total amount of the aggregate debt arising from the final judgments and prepare a comprehensive and transparent database ... This court will not specify what a reasonable time - limit should be ... but , in any event , it must be in accordance with LAW and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... The current situation does not give any guarantees to the appellants that their claims against the Zenica - Doboj GPE will be enforced within a reasonable time . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
