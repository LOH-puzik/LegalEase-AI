NORP The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently detained in PERSON . The President decided of his own motion to grant the applicant anonymity ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He is represented before the ORG by ORG s.r.o . , a law firm with its registered office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is of Ingush ethnic origin .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he left GPE for GPE , GPE , GPE and , ultimately , GPE , where he arrived in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently returned to GPE and then to GPE , where he applied for asylum on DATE under a different identity .", "CARDINAL . While the asylum proceedings in GPE were pending he left for GPE , where he remained , unsuccessfully seeking asylum , from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s asylum request in GPE was dismissed on DATE and then again on CARDINAL DATE , after the first decision had been quashed on administrative appeal . The applicant \u2019s subsequent administrative - law appeal was declared inadmissible as belated at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction . The dismissal of his asylum request thus became final and binding on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant left GPE for GPE , where he unsuccessfully applied for asylum in DATE and was ultimately returned to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After this the applicant applied for asylum in GPE and GPE applied for his extradition in order for him to be tried on charges related to acts of terrorism allegedly committed by the applicant with others on the territory of GPE . This resulted in CARDINAL sets of proceedings , which ran in parallel and are described below in turn .", "CARDINAL . On his return to GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE , the applicant claimed asylum again , this time under his true identity .", "CARDINAL . The claim was examined at the first administrative level by ORG , which dismissed it on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE . However , all these decisions were quashed by administrative courts following administrative - law appeals by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The last - mentioned decision was quashed by ORG on DATE and the matter was remitted to ORG for reconsideration .", "The principal ground for this decision was that ORG had failed to follow binding instructions issued by the court as part of its previous judgments quashing ORG decisions , namely to examine properly :", "( i ) the applicant \u2019s allegations that he was suffering from amnesia due to torture at the hands of NORP law - enforcement officers and resultant concussion ;", "( ii ) the applicant \u2019s allegation that , in view of his PERSON origin and the political situation in GPE where he was wanted , he would be in danger if extradited there , while these allegations were to be examined in the light of existing reports on the police and justice situation in GPE ;", "( iii ) the existing documentation concerning the situation of the individuals whose depositions had provided the basis for the charges against the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) ;", "( iv ) the validity of the guarantees given by ORG ( \u201c the OPGRF \u201d ) to the NORP authorities as regards the applicant \u2019s treatment in the event of his extradition to GPE ( in particular those specified in a letter of CARDINAL DATE ) ; and", "( v ) reports by non - governmental organisations concerning the applicant \u2019s individual case and the situation in the requesting country in general .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s second asylum request for the fourth time and decided not to grant him any subsidiary protection .", "It observed that at various stages of the proceedings the applicant had given CARDINAL different time references ( DATE , DATE and DATE ) to his allegation that he had been arrested and mistreated by the police in GPE , that there had been inconsistencies as to the length of his ensuing hospitalisation , and that there were further incongruities between the time and scope of the offences imputed to him in the official extradition documentation and those referred to by the applicant himself .", "Moreover , the applicant had never before relied on any of the statutory grounds for granting asylum , and his present allegations of persecution on political , religious and ethnic grounds were entirely novel , while his prosecution in the requesting state had no political or ideological connotations . The applicant \u2019s account of the facts was therefore found to be untrustworthy .", "ORG observed that the available documents confirmed that the applicant had been hospitalised in a traumatology department from CARDINAL May to DATE with a number of injuries . There was however no evidence showing that his injuries were in any way attributable to the ORG .", "His present digestive problems could not be linked to those injuries , because the applicant had been suffering from them even before his alleged mistreatment . As to his alleged amnesia , by which he sought to explain the incongruities in his factual submissions , ORG considered it improbable , because his recollection of other facts was clear and precise . Nevertheless , ORG had obtained expert evidence concluding that the concussion he had sustained in DATE could neither have produced amnesia , nor could it have had any permanent effects on his health .", "Furthermore , ORG observed that the requesting ORG , through the OPGRF , had provided assurances as to the applicant \u2019s treatment in the event of his extradition on DATE , and that these guarantees had been confirmed and amended on CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "According to these guarantees , the applicant would have at his disposal all existing legal means of asserting his rights , including the assistance of a lawyer . He would not be exposed to torture or any other form of illtreatment , and the death penalty would not be imposed on him . His prosecution was not motivated politically , racially , religiously or ethnically . He would not be prosecuted for any other offences than those for which his extradition was sought , and he would not be extradited further to another ORG without GPE \u2019s consent . NORP diplomatic representatives would also be free to monitor compliance with the guarantees given .", "In its assessment of these guarantees ORG took into account that they had been provided by the OPGRF and that there was no indication that they would not be effective in LOC . Once the applicant \u2019s criminal proceedings were completed and any sentence served , he would be free to settle in any other place , not necessarily LOC . There was no precedent for GPE not to comply with the diplomatic guarantees given to GPE in a similar context .", "ORG pointed out that GPE did not have a record of systematic human rights violations , that the guarantees were clear , specific and individualised , that they had also been confirmed by the requesting ORG as an intervening third party in the proceedings before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , that their observance was subject to diplomatic monitoring , and that their validity had been recognised by ORG in the extradition proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "As to the various reports concerning the situation in GPE , ORG considered them general in nature and in the circumstances not capable of prevailing over the specific and individual guarantees provided by the OPGRF .", "Concerning the available material on the applicant \u2019s co - accused , which included their pre - trial depositions , ORG found that it was general , contained no more than allegations , was flawed by inconsistencies , and did not constitute proof of the allegations that they had been mistreated . The applicant was mentioned only once , in CARDINAL of the pre - trial depositions , and this mention did not implicate him in any way . Moreover , when the applicant \u2019s co - accused changed their versions before the court , their submissions were properly examined in adversarial proceedings . Therefore , this material did not represent a probability that , in the event of his extradition , the applicant would himself be mistreated or that he would be denied a fair trial in the proceedings against him .", "In sum , there was no trustworthy indication of the existence of any grounds for granting the applicant asylum . Moreover , with reference to his state of health as established in a report from a prison hospital of DATE , ORG found no humanitarian reasons linked to the applicant \u2019s health or otherwise for providing him with subsidiary protection .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the decision of CARDINAL DATE by way of an administrative - law appeal , arguing in principle that ORG had yet again completely ignored the binding instructions of the administrative court and had simply reaffirmed its previous line of decisions with all the errors therein .", "That appeal is still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of the ORG North Ossetia - GPE ) issued a warrant for the applicant \u2019s arrest on the charges of membership of an existing armed illegal group and of perpetration of assaults organised by it , illegal possession of firearms and explosives , terrorist acts , homicide of QUANTITY or more persons , and other offences committed in GPE - GPE DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE respectively the applicant was arrested and placed in preliminary detention in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE asked for the applicant \u2019s extradition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG remanded the applicant in custody pending his extradition to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively ORG and , following the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal , ORG , ruled that the applicant \u2019s extradition was permissible .", "The courts found that none of the statutory grounds preventing extradition had been given and , in particular , that the applicant \u2019s extradition was not precluded by his asylum claim of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) as this was a repeated claim . In reaching that conclusion , they ascribed significant importance to the guarantees provided by the OPGRF as regards the applicant \u2019s treatment in the event of his extradition by the requesting State .", "In addition , the courts took into account that the requesting ORG was a member ORG and a ORG to the LAW . Moreover , they referred to the case - law of the ORG , including its decision of DATE in the cases of GPE v. GPE and GPE v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "In so far as the applicant had argued that the case against him in GPE was concocted and based on evidence obtained by torture , these allegations were to be examined in the proceedings on the merits of his charges in GPE , the NORP authorities being by no means equipped to assess them , not least as they did not even have the relevant case files at their disposal .", "Lastly , the courts observed that , in so far as the applicant \u2019s argument was based on generally worded reports by non - governmental organisations , these reports were outweighed by the individualised and specific guarantees of the requesting ORG , and there were no obstacles to the nongovernmental ORG monitoring the fairness of the applicant \u2019s proceedings in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acceded to the applicant \u2019s request of DATE by indicating an interim measure suspending ORG decision of DATE . At the same time , it declared admissible the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint that that decision was in violation of his rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE was in violation of the applicant \u2019s Article CARDINAL rights , quashed it , remitted the case to ORG for a new examination of the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal against the decision of DATE , and awarded him costs . It found that ORG assessment of the case was formalistic , superficial , and inadequate , in particular as regards ( i ) the available reports on the general situation with respect to human rights in GPE and especially in the LOC , ( ii ) the applicant \u2019s allegations that he and his co - accused had been ill - treated by the police and that his charges were based on evidence obtained by the ill - treatment of his co - accused , and ( iii ) the validity of the diplomatic guarantees of the requesting ORG in the light of the ORG \u2019s case - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled again on the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeal against the decision of ORG DATE , as instructed by ORG in its judgment of DATE . In its decision ORG again dismissed the interlocutory appeal . It did so having observed that the offences of which the applicant stood accused had taken place DATE , that the CARDINAL consecutive asylum proceedings had together taken DATE and were still not completed , that the applicant had been detained pending extradition for DATE , and that the maximum duration of such detention was not limited by statute . It held that the length of the asylum proceedings was unreasonable and that in the circumstances it was inappropriate for ORG to await the ultimate resolution of the asylum proceedings .", "ORG summarised the requesting ORG \u2019s guarantees ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and concluded that they were sufficiently specific , individualised and reliable . As there had not been any specific instance of extradition from GPE to GPE , there was no concrete experience of or practice in monitoring compliance with guarantees given , nor was there any instance of failure to respect the guarantees .", "The general reports on human rights situation in GPE were to be seen in the light of the applicant \u2019s specific circumstances .", "Moreover , ORG referred to reports on the DATE and DATE visits of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c the CPT \u201d ) to GPE and the measures taken by the NORP authorities in response to the ORG \u2019s findings . In addition , ORG again referred to the ORG \u2019s assessment of the guarantees provided by GPE in GPE and ORG ( both cited above ) and other cases . Lastly , it considered that it was not the task of the courts in extradition proceedings to take a stance as regards the lawfulness of the prosecution for the purposes of which a person was to be extradited .", "CARDINAL . There was no appeal available against ORG decision of DATE and , accordingly , the ruling that the applicant \u2019s extradition was permissible became final and binding on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently contested ORG decision by way of a constitutional complaint , which ORG declared inadmissible without examining its merits on DATE , on the ground that it fell manifestly short of the applicable formal requirements .", "CARDINAL . The final decision on the applicant \u2019s extradition now lies with the Minister of ORG , who has discretion to allow or disallow extradition subject to various considerations under LAW , including specifically those under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The request of GPE of DATE for the applicant \u2019s extradition ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was accompanied by guarantees from the OPGRF as regards the treatment to be accorded to the applicant in the event of his extradition .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE from ORG before ORG to ORG of GPE , the guarantees in question were confirmed and summarised as follows : the applicant would enjoy all the fair trial guarantees which existed in international law , would only be tried for the crimes for which he had been extradited by GPE , would not be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , would be free to leave GPE on the completion of his proceedings and after serving any sentence , and would not be extradited to a third country without GPE \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the OPGRF responded to GPE \u2019s request for an amendment of the guarantees in question by pledging that , in the event of his extradition , the embassy of GPE in GPE would be informed of the place of his detention and officers of the embassy would be allowed to visit him and speak to him without the presence of a third person .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , in reply to a further request by GPE , the OPGRF confirmed the guarantees previously given .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims that in DATE he was arrested and interrogated by police in GPE ) on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities . As he refused to confess , he was beaten and otherwise tortured for DATE . He was subsequently provided with a lawyer , and it took a further DATE until he was released and then immediately admitted to hospital , where he spent DATE with concussion and multiple other traumas .", "CARDINAL . Once the applicant had learned of the arrests of his acquaintances on terrorist charges ( see below ) , he went into hiding in GPE , GPE and elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . His home was subsequently searched and his relatives interrogated as to his whereabouts . These included an uncle whose property was plundered and who was beaten during his interrogation before being released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that in DATE CARDINAL acquaintances of his , PERSON , PERSON , and PERSON , were arrested on charges of terrorist acts in GPE ; that they were taken to a police station in NORP where they were interrogated , beaten and tortured into confessions ; and that CARDINAL of them had given the applicant \u2019s name .", "CARDINAL . The case - file contains documentation concerning these individuals , including expert reports on injuries suffered by ORG in TIME DATE and on the mental condition of PERSON ; what appears to be parts of transcripts of undated court hearings of a witness PERSON , an accused PERSON , PERSON lawyer , PERSON , and PERSON mother ; and a statement issued by the mother of ORG .", "This documentation contains allegations of ill - treatment and coercion with regard to PERSON , ORG , ORG and ORG .", "In so far as the applicant is concerned , in CARDINAL of the transcribed submissions , PERSON stated that he had never seen PERSON and the applicant together , admitted having seen the applicant once , but submitted that he had had no personal or telephone contact with him . In addition , in her statement concerning principally the convictions of her son and his associates , which according to her was based solely on self - incriminating evidence extracted from them by torture , the mother of ORG stated that the convicts had been coerced into implicating other people , including the applicant .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , ORG and ORG introduced an application of their own under LAW against GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It has been communicated to ORG of GPE for observations and is still pending .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in addition to the material referred to in the subsequent paragraph , the applicant relied on a number of international documents including from ORG , ORG , a Special Rapporteur of ORG of ORG , the Commissioner for Human Rights of ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG on the independence of judges and lawyers and ORG on the independence of judges and lawyers originating from or pertaining to the period DATE .", "CARDINAL . A number of relevant international instruments and reports concerning the situation in GPE are summarised , for example , in the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of PERSON GPE ( no .
