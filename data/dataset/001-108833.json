They were born in DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively , and they live in GPE . The first applicant was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE . The second and third applicants were represented before the ORG by Ms C. Almond , a solicitor with PERSON and ORG , GPE . The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "At CARDINAL on DATE the applicants were re - arrested pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE with a view to being taken to ORG ( \u201c SCC \u201d ) and charged with membership of the IRA . In TIME of DATE they were brought before the SCC and charged : the period prior to charging was later calculated by ORG to be TIME . They applied for and were refused bail and remanded in custody on a number of occasions ( including on consent ) until finally remanded for trial to begin on DATE . The applicants did not object to the jurisdiction of the SCC during their initial appearance or during the subsequent DATE remand period .", "In the meantime ( in DATE ) , PERSON O\u2019Brien was arrested and brought before the SCC to be charged with membership of the IRA arising out of the same events to which the charges against the applicants related . He immediately challenged the jurisdiction of the SCC ( prior to his arraignment ) arguing that , since he had not been brought \u201c forthwith \u201d before the SCC , he had not therefore been \u201c lawfully brought \u201d before the SCC so that the SCC did not have jurisdiction to try him . Consequently , the present applicants also objected to the jurisdiction of the SCC to try them . Their objection was joined with that of PERSON O\u2019Brien . Following a hearing on CARDINAL DATE , the SCC rejected those objections on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicants\u2019 trial began . It lasted DATE and the applicants were convicted . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) refused leave to appeal , that court having examined and rejected the \u201c forthwith \u201d jurisdiction argument .", "In the meantime , Mr. PERSON had requested and obtained leave to apply for judicial review pending which his trial was adjourned . While ORG refused leave , on DATE ORG accepted his appeal ( O\u2019Brien v. The SCC and Another , [ DATE ] DATE ) finding that he had not been brought \u201c forthwith \u201d ( TIME ) before the SCC , that he was not therefore lawfully before the SCC and that the SCC did not therefore have jurisdiction to try him .", "DATE the applicants took habeas corpus proceedings ( Article CARDINAL ) of the LAW ) relying on ORG judgment in the O\u2019Brien case arguing that , since the SCC had had no jurisdiction to try them , their imprisonment was unlawful . They sought release .", "On DATE ORG rejected their application : while their cases were identical to PERSON and while the SCC clearly did not have jurisdiction in their cases , their right to raise that issue was spent since they had not objected to the jurisdiction of the SCC at the earliest opportunity before it ( prior to arraignment ) and they had not explained why .", "By an ex tempore judgment of DATE ( the written judgment was delivered on DATE , PERSON and Others v. the Governor of Portlaoise Prison and Another [ CARDINAL ] DATE ) , ORG rejected the ORG appeal . Since an application had not been made CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( for a certificate that the case concerned a point of law of exceptional public importance requiring examination by ORG ) , the decision of the ORG on the jurisdiction point had become final and was res judicata . A habeas corpus action did not lie when the jurisdictional issue had already been determined to the point of statutory finality : the principle of finality would be subverted if habeas corpus could be used as a perpetual right of post - conviction appeal . The court did acknowledge that that there might be exceptional cases where a fundamental jurisdictional defect could be established in a habeas corpus action which defect , through nobody \u2019s fault , had not been raised in the appeal processes . However , the present applicants could have raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the SCC earlier in the process , as in the O\u2019Brien case , but they had failed to do so . On the contrary , they applied for and were refused bail and remanded in custody including on a consent order . They neither applied for judicial review nor for an adjournment of the trial pending same . Having permitted their trial to proceed , after unsuccessfully raising the jurisdictional point before the ORG , they could have , but did not , apply for a certificate under LAW of LAW . ORG confirmed that , if PERSON O\u2019Brien had not objected to jurisdiction early and brought judicial review proceedings , his trial would have been joined with the trial of the applicants ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
