The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was a journalist on the nationwide magazine CARDINAL p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the National Conciliator ( valtakunnansovittelija , riksf\u00f6rlikningsmannen ) at the time , and B. , his female friend , entered late at night A. 's home where his wife was present . The situation escalated , the police were called and the incident , which subsequently involved also A. 's grown - up children , led to ORG 's arrest . Following the incident , criminal charges were brought against both PERSON and NORP on DATE . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) sentenced PERSON to a DATE conditional prison sentence for resisting arrest and for criminal damage ( vahingonteko , skadeg\u00f6relse ) , and PERSON to a fine for assault . On DATE ORG ( valtioneuvosto , statsr\u00e5det ) dismissed PERSON from his post as ORG . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) upheld the judgment with respect to B. As regards PERSON , the case was discontinued as he had died on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused PERSON leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 magazine published CARDINAL articles written by the applicant about A. and PERSON The first article was entitled \u201c A. collects his female friend DATE from work , the relationship continues \u201d and it concerned A. 's and B. 's relationship . B. 's conviction as well as her workplace were mentioned as background information but the major part of the article concerned the journalist 's eyewitness statements about how A. and PERSON spent their free time . The caption of the article stated that \u201c A. 's female friend PERSON visits his home DATE \u201d . Also , several pictures of B. were published . The second article was entitled \u201c The police laughed at the ex - national conciliator , PERSON arrested the journalists \u201d . It was about A. and his behaviour in certain encounters with the media , and PERSON 's name was mentioned only in passing . The caption of the article stated that \u201c PERSON requested executive assistance from the police in order to take his female friend secretly to his home \u201d . Prior to these articles , PERSON 's identity had been revealed and her picture had been published in the media .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and PERSON requested that criminal investigations be conducted against journalists who had written about the incident of CARDINAL DATE and the circumstances surrounding it . On an unspecified date they made such a request with respect to the applicant , claiming that the articles published in CARDINAL p\u00e4iv\u00e4\u00e4 had invaded PERSON 's privacy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges under LAW , section CARDINAL(a ) , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW against the applicant as well as the editor - in - chief ( see PERSON and others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , in ORG . The charges brought against the applicant clearly indicated that the applicant was charged only for having written the articles in question . He was not charged for having been responsible for the headings , pictures or in which part of the magazine the articles were to be published .", "CARDINAL . B. concurred with the charges brought by the public prosecutor . She pursued a compensation claim jointly and severally against the applicant , the editor - in - chief and the publishing company , which was joined to the criminal charges . Charges brought against the other journalists of the magazine as well as the editor - in - chief were examined in the same proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court , after having held an oral hearing , first decided to declare all parts of the case file secret for DATE except for the applicable legal provisions , the conclusions and the summary of the case . Additionally , PERSON 's identity was not to be revealed in the public parts of the case file . As to the merits of the case , the court accepted the statement of facts indicated in the charges and noted that the applicant was not responsible for the headings , pictures or in which part of the magazine the articles were to be published . It sentenced the applicant to pay DATE - fines , amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) , for invasion of PERSON 's private life . Moreover , the applicant was ordered to pay PERSON , jointly with the other parties to the case , ORG CARDINAL plus interest for non - pecuniary damage as well as her costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the facts mentioned in the articles were of a kind to which the protection of private life typically applied . ORG had already found in DATE that the national television broadcast on DATE , in which ORG 's name had been mentioned twice in the context of an interview with A. , had invaded her private life . PERSON did not hold such a position in society that the exception in LAW , section CARDINAL(a ) , paragraph CARDINAL of LAW was applicable . The fact that she was a friend of such a person and that she had been involved in the incident that subsequently led to the dismissal of A. from his post as ORG did not justify revealing her identity . Nor was PERSON 's conviction of a kind that would justify revealing her identity . The Penal Code provision in question did not require that intent to harm be shown but it was sufficient that the dissemination of information about the private life of a person was capable of causing him or her damage or suffering . The applicant , therefore , had had no right to reveal facts relating to B. 's private life .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , requesting , inter alia , that an oral hearing be held and if not , that he be given a possibility to submit additional comments . Moreover , he claimed that the disclosure of a convicted person 's name could not be considered as falling within the scope of private life , and that ORG judge had had a fixed idea about the outcome of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without holding an oral hearing , upheld the ORG judgment . The court balanced the freedom of expression against the protection of private life in the light of the ORG 's case - law . It found that , according to the preparatory works and the national and the ORG 's case - law , the facts mentioned in the articles were of a kind to which the protection of private life typically applied . ORG had already found in DATE that PERSON was not a public figure , and the fact that she was a friend of such a person and that she had been involved in the incident that subsequently led to the dismissal of A. from his post as ORG did not justify revealing her identity . Nor was PERSON 's conviction of a kind that would have justified revealing her identity . The fact that PERSON 's identity as A. 's friend had previously been revealed in the media did not justify the subsequent invasion of her private life .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant applied for leave to appeal to ORG , reiterating the grounds already presented before ORG . Moreover , he claimed that ORG had not reasoned its judgment sufficiently , and that the judgment was written in a manner suggesting collective criminal liability . This conflicted with the presumption of innocence . Further , he claimed that the restrictions on freedom of expression were neither necessary nor justified in this case .", "CARDINAL .
