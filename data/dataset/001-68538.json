Mr PERSON informed the applicant , who then wished to intensify her contact with X , that the latter did not wish to have any contacts with the applicant anymore .", "The applicant 's auxiliary guardianship ended on DATE , when an amendment to LAW entered into force abolishing the institution of auxiliary guardianship .", "In DATE , the applicant married her new partner Mr PERSON and , together with him , moved from the GPE to GPE where they are currently still residing .", "On DATE , DATE before X was to come of age and shortly before the entry into force of an amendment to several relevant provisions of LAW ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) ( see below ) , PERSON and PERSON filed a request with ORG for X 's adoption by her stepmother PERSON . They submitted that , since DATE , they had jointly provided for X 's care and education , that X did not have any contacts with the applicant and that X fully supported the adoption request .", "In DATE , the applicant informed ORG that she objected to X 's adoption by PERSON . She submitted inter alia that the fact that X supported the adoption request and that there had not been any contacts between her and X for a certain period of time did not justify severing the legally recognised family tie between them . In the applicant 's opinion , to sever a legally recognised family tie would only be justified in cases where a child had nothing to expect from the mother anymore .", "On DATE , Mr Z. and PERSON submitted a copy of a letter of DATE by a social worker to ORG .

When X gets a bit older , the need increases to discuss the bad contact as she perceives it , in the hope of being able to come closer to each other .", "She discovers that that does not succeed .

Owing to this [ impairment ] she only started attending [ regular ] primary school as from ORG CARDINAL [ at DATE CARDINAL ] . The transition from the school for the hearing - impaired to a regular primary school was [ a ] big [ change ] , she says . She was picked on there , as well as in the beginning of secondary school .", "Concluding :", "On the basis of my opinion that complaints of depression have a deeper cause than that of people paying insufficient attention to their own needs , I have found it appropriate to support X in this procedure by way of this letter .", "Despite her insecurities in life , I note that this adoption request is a conscious decision of hers , about which she has clearly reflected .", "When I ask X , \u201c Why this radical measure ? \u201d , she says she is not acting out of rancour .

It heard the parties ' arguments . It further heard X on the adoption request .", "In its decision of DATE , overruling the applicant 's objection , ORG granted the request for PERSON 's adoption .", "As to the applicant 's objection , ORG held that she had insufficiently taken into consideration the manner in which her daughter had developed over DATE and had insufficiently realised that PERSON 's interests in being adopted should prevail over her own interests . In that light , it considered that the applicant 's objection was to be regarded as a slight form of misfeasance ( misbruik van recht ; i.e. an abusive use of a right ) .", "The applicant 's appeal against the decision of DATE to ORG ( gerechtshof ) was examined at a hearing held on DATE . X , who was heard before ORG during that hearing , made the following statement :", "\u201c This is a picture of the family to which I belong . That is what it is all about . I consider my stepmother as my mother . I really want the adoption very much . The contact with my biological mother is just not right . Sometimes she wants me and then again not . She did try to do nice things with me but I was always only briefly there . I have never understood why she did not want to see me regularly . When she finally returned to the GPE DATE had passed . Then it did not work out anymore . I do not have the feeling that she takes me seriously . I have sought contact with her in DATE . Then she did not want to answer questions which I had . The same thing happened when we spoke over the telephone in DATE in connection with the filing of the adoption request . The contact that I have with Carmen [ X 's stepmother ] is the most important . I just feel that way . She was already there as from DATE . There is a strong bond between us . She has taught me to speak with my hearing disability and has taught me how to ride a bicycle . I do understand why my biological mother disagrees with the adoption request . I have things sorted out much better now . I have also been able to do that because I fight for my interests . At school things are now also better . I realise that the adoption will not change things very much but I want to show that PERSON is my real mother . [ Emotionally speaking , ] I have taken leave from my biological mother already a long time ago . This adoption is a confirmation of that . I have severed the ties with my biological mother a long time ago . Now I want to express , also in a legal sense , the connection I feel with PERSON . I have no contact any more with my maternal family . I have often tried to have a serious conversation with my biological mother but she just wanted to keep things on a cosy [ superficial ] level . For the rest , I refer to what I have put in writing . \u201d", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal and upheld ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . This ruling , in so far as relevant reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL ORG has noted ... a written statement by X. ...", "CARDINAL The court agrees with Mr PERSON and PERSON that the requested adoption is in the apparent interests of X.", "CARDINAL In this finding , the court takes into account that X , also noting her age , has nothing to expect anymore from [ the applicant ] as regards care and education . It further takes into account the long period during which X has been cared for and educated by PERSON and PERSON , as well as X 's explicit agreement with the adoption request and her reasoned statement on this point .", "CARDINAL It appears from her statement made before the court , as well as from her written statement referred to in CARDINAL , that X considers PERSON as her sole mother and that already for some considerable time DATE in any event since DATE or DATE \u2013 this has been the case . According to X , she then broke off ties with [ the applicant ] because the latter was , in GPE 's opinion , not prepared to have or capable of having anything other than superficial contact with her . In or around DATE X did , according to her statement , seek contact CARDINAL more time with [ the applicant ] . That meeting also resulted , according to X , in disappointment , because once more she did not feel she was being taken seriously . The last experience was during a telephone conversation she had with [ the applicant ] in DATE in connection with the filing of the adoption request . [ The applicant ] has not disputed X 's statement on this point .", "CARDINAL As already mentioned above , X considers PERSON as her mother , because she has taught her to speak NORP having been unable to do so [ for a long period ] owing to her hearing impairment \u2013 and to ride a bicycle , and has always supported her . In short , PERSON wishes that , in addition to the existing de facto family unit tie ( gezinsband ) between Mrs Janssen \u2013 and the CARDINAL children born out of the marriage between Mr PERSON and PERSON \u2013 and herself , a legal tie is also to be established by which their mutual relation is also legally confirmed . \u201d", "CARDINAL Unlike [ the applicant ] \u2013 who contends that X has incurred emotional problems as a result of the filing of the adoption request \u2013 the court accepts that , already prior to the filing of this request , X had contacted a social worker in order to , in her own words , talk about her feelings , and it was thus not the filing of the adoption request as such which caused her to be emotionally burdened . On this point X has declared that those feelings of frustration and anger had already existed a long time and had , according to her , been caused by [ the applicant 's ] incapacity or unwillingness to have a more than mere superficial contact with X. She further felt that she had never been taken seriously by [ the applicant ] in her wish to obtain answers to questions she had .", "CARDINAL The above does not lead to a different finding as to X 's apparent interest in the requested adoption and does not entail that the court , for the determination of the case , requires further information from an expert on ORG 's interest in the adoption by PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL The [ applicant 's ] right of veto , which she invokes , under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW is only limited by the legal rule that a power can not be invoked when it is being abused .", "CARDINAL [ The applicant ] submits that , in exercising her right of veto , she is led by X 's interests . According to [ the applicant ] it is in X 's interests , in particular as regards her identity , that a legally recognised family tie between her and X remains in existence . If adoption were to be pronounced , X would be confirmed in her incorrect opinion that she has a bad mother who has left her . That can not be in her interests .", "CARDINAL Although the court , noting [ the applicant 's ] own statement made at the oral hearing on appeal , assumes that [ the applicant ] wishes the best for X , and that the absence of a close contact between them is a result of the absence of regular contacts between them DATE which has also been caused by [ the applicant 's ] stay in GPE for the period from DATE , it does not subscribe to the interest advanced by [ the applicant ] in exercising the right of veto . In this respect it refers to the above considerations as to ORG 's apparent interests in the adoption by PERSON .", "CARDINAL The veto expressed by [ the applicant ] will be disregarded by the court . In the court 's opinion , [ the applicant ] abuses her power to exercise this right because [ the applicant ] , taking into account the disproportionality between the interest advanced by [ the applicant ] in exercising her [ veto ] power and X 's interest in adoption by Mr PERSON and PERSON which is harmed by the exercise of that [ veto ] power , in all reasonableness should not have exercised that power . In the assessment of ORG 's interest in being adopted by PERSON , the court takes particularly into account that X \u2013 who was DATE when Mr PERSON and PERSON started to cohabit and who turned DATE in DATE \u2013 has for a long time has been cared for and educated by PERSON and PERSON jointly . \u201d", "The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) in which she raised CARDINAL complaints , namely that ORG had failed to take into account her arguments as regards the question whether the adoption would be in X 's interest , that ORG had given insufficient reasons for rejecting her request to obtain a further expert opinion and for its finding that X had already contacted a social worker before the adoption request had been filed , and lastly that ORG had unjustly concluded that her reliance on her right of veto constituted a misfeasance .", "In its decision of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal in cassation , holding :", "CARDINAL [ The first complaint ] fails , because it lacks a factual basis . As appears from its legal considerations under CARDINAL and CARDINAL [ in its ruling of DATE ] , ORG has , unlike what is asserted [ in this complaint ] , examined and rejected the mother 's arguments .", "CARDINAL [ The second complaint ] is that the rejection of the mother 's request to involve an expert is incomprehensible and insufficiently reasoned , and that the same applies to the consideration in which ORG finds that X , already before the filing of the adoption request , had contacted a social worker .", "It is left to the insight of the judge hearing the facts of the case to decide whether he finds it necessary to obtain further expert information . That is why the first [ limb of this ] complaint fails .", "On grounds of ORG 's statement referred to in its legal consideration under CARDINAL , ORG accepted that X , already before the filing of the adoption request , had emotional problems . On that ground the second [ limb of this ] complaint fails .", "CARDINAL [ The third complaint ] is about the finding of ORG that the mother has abused her right of veto .", "In the examination of this part , the following must be put first . Although the right of veto has been allocated to the other parent because adoption would entail , for him , the far - reaching consequence of the termination of the existing legally recognised family tie between him and the child , the other parent should , in exercising this right , attach great weight to the interest of the child . Furthermore , as a rule the interest of the child in being adopted by the adoptive parents increases the longer it has been cared for and educated by them ( PERSON , DATE , nr . DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "By finding , on the grounds set out in its legal consideration CARDINAL , that the mother abused her right of veto , the legal opinion of ORG has not therefore been shown to have been incorrect . That opinion is also not incomprehensible or insufficiently reasoned . For the remainder it can not , being interwoven as it is with assessments of a factual nature , be further examined on its correctness in cassation proceedings . \u201d", "This ruling by ORG was published in LAW ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c GPE \u201d ) DATE , no .

LAW ( d ) stipulates that an adoption request can only be granted if neither legal parent opposes the request . However , according to LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , the opposition by a legal parent can be overruled if the child and parent have not or hardly lived together as a family unit ( gezinsverband ) ; if the legal parent has abused his or her authority over the child or has grossly neglected its care and education , or if \u2013 in respect of the minor \u2013 the legal parent has been convicted of CARDINAL of the offences defined in Sections XIII to ORG and ORG to PERSON of the Second Book of the Criminal Code ( Wetboek van Strafrecht ) .", "The Explanatory Memorandum on the bill , which eventually led to the enactment of this provision , makes it clear that the possibility to overrule a legal parent 's opposition to adoption was possible only under very limited conditions , although it was explicitly stated that ORG caselaw concerning misfeasance remained pertinent and , referring to ORG and CARDINAL:CARDINAL of LAW , that an opposition by a legal parent serving no other purpose than to harm another could already on that ground be overruled . It remained for the judge to assess whether or not in a concrete case a legal parent 's opposition was to be overruled . In cases of adoption by a legal parent and a step - parent of a child whose care and education they had provided during DATE , a large degree of reticence should be displayed in overruling opposition by a legal parent who has not been entrusted with the care and custody of the child . As , in general , there would be no serious grounds that would result in such a parent being deprived of parental authority , and often such a parent would have lived with the child as a family unit , it was considered preferable that , in such situations , more meaning be given to the factual relationship of care and education between the step - parent and the child by way of joint custody ( medevoogdij ) , for example ( GPE ( Parliamentary Documents ) , session DATE , CARDINAL no .

This criticism concerns mainly the fact that step - parent adoption after divorce can be used to ban entirely from the life of the child the existence of the legal parent not entrusted with care and custody . There is further criticism about the artificial manner in which this adoption is regulated ( CARDINAL of the parents must indeed adopt his child ) . ... I have taken this criticism to heart . Step - parent adoption is not rendered impossible , but the conditions applicable to an \u201c ordinary \u201d adoption also apply to the step - parent adoption : the adopting step - parent must have cared for and educated the child for DATE . Also the condition of the ( minimum ) difference in age applies . Furthermore , the same limited possibilities to overrule the opposition of a parent , as in the case of an \u201c ordinary \u201d adoption , are applicable .
