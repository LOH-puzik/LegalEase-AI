The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been employed by ORG as a system operator since DATE . She submitted that , on account of the nature of her duties , she had held a security clearance permitting her access to classified information constituting ORG secrets . According to the applicant \u2019s job description , being in a possession of such a security clearance had been a prerequisite to her holding her post .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) was promulgated in ORG . Under LAW , permits granting access to classified information that had been issued under the legal provisions existing before the entry into force of the LAW were to remain valid until their replacement by security clearance allowing access to classified information . The heads of organisational units employing persons who possessed an access permit and whose positions required that they have access to classified information were to request the issuance of security clearance , in accordance with the requirements of the LAW . Non - compliance with that provision would result in the invalidation of the respective existing access permits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in compliance with that obligation , the Director of ORG issued a decision refusing the applicant security clearance allowing access to classified information . The applicant submitted that that decision had been based on a psychological test . The decision did not contain any reasoning in respect of the refusal , apart from a reference to LAW of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against the refusal with ORG . The latter , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , upheld the refusal . That decision was final and not amenable to judicial review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Director of ORG ordered that the applicant be dismissed . The reason given for the termination of her employment was the refusal to grant her security clearance , possession of which was an indispensable condition of her being able to perform her duties .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged her dismissal at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction . She contested the objectivity and the lawfulness of the dismissal procedure , arguing that she had fulfilled all conditions for the issuance of security clearance and that she had been dismissed on account of the negative personal relationship between her and her direct supervisor . In the applicant \u2019s view , the clearance had probably been refused because she had suffered from depressive neurosis in DATE , a condition which according to her was no longer relevant . The applicant \u2019s request that a report by a psychiatric expert be commissioned was refused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . By its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims , reasoning that the refusal of the Director of ORG to grant security clearance to the applicant was a final and valid administrative act , and it rendered the applicant \u2019s dismissal inevitable because she was no longer able to perform her duties . The court added that the refusal was not amenable to any judicial review ; therefore , the court was not competent to examine , within the framework of the dismissal proceedings , any substantial or procedural questions related to its lawfulness .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , ORG , by a ruling of DATE upheld the lower court \u2019s decision , endorsing its reasoning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG upheld those rulings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
