On CARDINAL DATE the application lodged on DATE was finally considered . On CARDINAL DATE , in judgment no . DATE , the plenary of ORG dismissed the application . It observed that , pursuant to PERSON no . DATE , a decision taken by the general meeting of shareholders of a company set up in accordance with that PERSON could be challenged only by shareholders who held PERCENT of the capital , had been present at the meeting when the decision was taken and had opposed it . ORG had had good reasons to restrict the right of access to the courts in such a way . The right to challenge decisions of the general meeting should be vested only in shareholders who were closely associated with the company \u2019s activities , in which small shareholders were usually not interested . In addition , the company \u2019s competitors could very easily acquire a small number of shares and attempt to harm its interests . The same restrictions applied to the right of access to a court for the purpose of challenging administrative decisions approving those of the general meeting of shareholders . Shareholders who held PERCENT of the capital could challenge an administrative decision of this type only if they could prove that it affected them personally . An increase in the company \u2019s capital could not in itself harm the interests of a shareholder who held PERCENT of the capital . Moreover , the same rules were applicable where the decision to increase the capital had been taken by a temporary administrator . In the instant case , on DATE the applicants had held PERCENT of the ORG \u2019s capital ( CARDINAL having PERCENT and the other PERCENT ) and would therefore not have been able to challenge the increase in capital if it had been decided upon by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders . The applicants could not rely on the fact that they now held a lower proportion of the shares in order to establish that their personal interests had been harmed by the decision to increase the capital . Nor had they pleaded any other fact which could warrant such a conclusion . Accordingly , ORG decided by a majority to dismiss the application for judicial review , on the ground that the applicants did not have locus standi .", "CARDINAL . On DATE some of the applicants brought action no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL against the ORG and others in ORG , seeking a declaration ( a ) that the first increase in capital was null and void on the ground that the second temporary administrator ( Mr I. Papakonstantinos ) had not been empowered under NORP law to take such a decision , which was the prerogative of the general meeting of shareholders , and ( b ) that the allocation of CARDINAL new shares to the defendant shareholders by the third temporary administrator ( Mr S. GPE ) had been unlawful and was null and void , and that in law it had not conferred on any of these persons the status of shareholder , a right to attend general meetings of ORG \u2019s shareholders or any other right vested in its shareholders . A hearing was listed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . However , on DATE of the applicants withdrew from action no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . In their notice of discontinuation ( no .

According to the applicants , the court took this decision at the GPE request . On the other hand , the Government referred to the text of the decision , which stated that it was necessary to adjourn consideration of action no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL because its outcome depended on the validity of the appointment of the third temporary administrator ( Mr S. GPE ) and the legality of the decision taken by the previous temporary administrator ( Mr I.

On DATE some of the applicants brought action no . DATE against the ORG in ORG , seeking a declaration that the second increase in capital had been in breach of NORP law and was null and void .

A hearing was listed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to adjourn consideration of action no . DATE until DATE .
