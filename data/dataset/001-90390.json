Until DATE the applicant worked as the head of the legal department of GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG opened an investigation into the activities of several of the company \u2019s senior executives , including PERSON , PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON , PERSON ORG , PERSON and others . Some of them were arrested in DATE on suspicion of having committed large - scale fraud and embezzlement of the shares of several NORP oil refineries , including ORG . In particular , PERSON , one of the company \u2019s lawyers , was arrested . According to the Government , in her statement of DATE , confirmed in DATE , she testified that the applicant , as her manager , had instructed her in relation to the illegal operations with ORG shares , qualified by the prosecution authorities as embezzlement .", "CARDINAL . At the same time the tax authorities sued the company , seeking to recover unpaid corporate taxes . In DATE the courts delivered several judgments ordering the company to pay considerable tax arrears and considerable penalties . Enforcement proceedings commenced ; as a result , a large - scale corporate conflict broke out , opposing the company \u2019s shareholders on CARDINAL side , and the ORG , the company \u2019s largest creditor , on the other .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution opened an investigation into the alleged misappropriation of the shares of several NORP oil companies by several former senior managers of GPE . Charges were brought against Mr ORG , who , by that time , had fled GPE , and , sometime afterwards , against several other people . The investigation was pursued in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , in DATE investigators from ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) started questioning staff members of ORG and affiliated companies . The questioning sessions were accompanied by threats of criminal prosecution if the staff members cooperated with the senior executives appointed by the then major shareholders of the company . Those threats were also made to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the shareholders of ORG appointed the applicant as executive vicepresident of the company . That appointment was supposed to take effect on DATE . On DATE the applicant was summoned by a ORG investigator and questioned . According to the applicant , during the questioning the investigator warned the applicant to \u201c stay far away \u201d from the company \u2019s business . When he replied that he had no intention of leaving his post at the company , the investigator responded : \u201c This is the first time I have seen a person volunteer to go to prison \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime bankruptcy proceedings against the company commenced . On DATE ORG of GPE imposed a supervision order on the company and appointed an interim receiver . DATE the applicant , as a vice - president of the company , initiated a reorganisation of its management structure . It appears that the reorganisation was regarded by the receiver and the ORG authorities as an attempt to hinder the bankruptcy proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of ORG of GPE dated DATE Yukos was declared bankrupt , and the court replaced the company \u2019s previous management with a bankruptcy trustee . The ORG was appointed with the consent of the ORG - owned \u201c Rosneft \u201d company \u2013 CARDINAL of the major creditors of GPE at that time .

On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General requested the ORG of GPE to authorise criminal prosecution of the applicant in connection with his alleged participation in the embezzlement of the property and shares of several oil companies and refineries in DATE ( GPE , GPE refinery , ORG , etc ) . The ORG claimed that in DATE , when the applicant had been the head of the legal department of GPE , he had advised the company \u2019s executives and thus participated in their criminal activities . The shares in these companies had subsequently been \u201c legalised \u201d through a chain of financial operations . In their request the ORG referred to the materials from the criminal case , without , however , identifying them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Simonovskiy District Court in an open hearing , examined the request by the ORG . The applicant was present at both hearings . On DATE the case was adjourned . According to the applicant , the court informed the parties that on DATE it would deliver its decision on the prosecution \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG , at the ORG \u2019s request , authorised searches in the applicant \u2019s home and country house . In its decision the court summarised the charges against the applicant as forwarded by the prosecution , noted that the applicant was a lawyer and a member of ORG , and indicated his de facto and de jure addresses . The court identified the items or information sought as \u201c documents in paper or electronic format , correspondence , drafts and handwritten notes , other documents and objects important for the investigation \u201d . The court gave no reasons for its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s premises were searched by the ORG investigators and certain documents were seized . In particular , the ORG searched a flat situated at CARDINAL , Bakinskikh PERSON street , GPE , and a house situated at CARDINAL , GPE , in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court declared that the applicant \u2019s involvement with the company \u2019s activities in DATE contained \u201c elements of a criminal offence \u201d . As follows from the court \u2019s decision , it reached this decision \u201c after having heard the participants of the proceedings , and having examined the material [ \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b ] submitted by the ORG \u201d . Consequently , the court authorised criminal prosecution of the applicant . Unlike his lawyer , the applicant was not present at that hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was at the flat of an acquaintance , Mr S. , a member of ORG . At TIME the police arrived at the flat and rang the doorbell . According to the applicant , he heard the doorbell ringing but did not open the door , since the owner of the flat was absent and he did not have the keys . Having received no reply , the police forced the door , broke into the apartment and arrested the applicant . TIME the ORG lodged a request with ORG of GPE seeking the applicant \u2019s further detention pending investigation . The prosecution submitted a police report on the applicant \u2019s arrest , attesting that the applicant was arrested not at his permanent place of residence but in another flat , that he had failed to appear before ORG and that , according to some unidentified \u201c operative information \u201d , he had intended to leave GPE in order to evade arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the detention request . The applicant and his lawyer were present at the detention hearing . They pleaded that the applicant should not be remanded in custody . The applicant \u2019s arguments may be summarised as follows . The prosecution case against the applicant was very weak and was based on inadmissible evidence . ORG had not done its job adequately and had not provided reasons for its conclusions . The applicant had always cooperated with the ORG in the course of the investigation ; the investigation had already lasted DATE and the applicant had always gone to the ORG offices when investigators needed to question him . The applicant had not made any attempt to flee from justice or otherwise obstruct the course of the investigation . The applicant was the single parent of a minor child and the only source of support for his elderly parents . Finally , the applicant maintained that his poor health was incompatible with detention .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution maintained their detention request . They produced to the court a number of procedural documents issued by the prosecution authorities in the course of the investigation , witness statements , copies of electronic documents , financial documents concerning the business activities of several oil companies , etc .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the parties\u2019 arguments , the court held that the applicant should be remanded in custody . The court held that the request for the applicant \u2019s detention had been lodged by a duly authorised prosecution official and that all the necessary formalities had been complied with . The court also held that if the applicant was dissatisfied with the decision of ORG , it was still possible to appeal against it . The court further held as follows :", "\u201c The court takes into account that [ the applicant ] is charged with having committed criminal offences which are qualified as serious or especially serious and which are punishable by imprisonment of DATE . The circumstances in which those crimes were committed , information about the applicant \u2019s personality and his occupation [ all ] give the court enough reasons to conclude that , if he remained at liberty , [ the applicant ] might abscond from the investigative or judicial bodies , adversely influence the victims , witnesses and other participants in the criminal proceedings , take measures to destroy evidence and objects and documents which are important for the investigation but which have not yet been found by the investigative bodies , might contact his accomplices who are hiding from justice and [ thus ] obstruct the course of the proceedings , which is confirmed by the results of the search ( case file no . CARDINAL , pages MONEY ) and by the report of the [ ORG ] to [ the ORG ] as to information concerning [ the applicant \u2019s ] plans to leave GPE . The court also takes into account the applicant \u2019s age , family situation and medical condition and the fact that he has a minor child and lives permanently in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s allegation that the case against him was very weak and based on inadmissible evidence , the court held as follows :", "\u201c ... As to the argument of [ the applicant and his lawyer ] that materials produced [ by the prosecution to the court ] contain no evidence of [ the applicant \u2019s ] involvement in the crimes imputed to him , the court can not take [ this argument ] into account , since the questions of guilt or innocence , [ and ] proof ... of [ the applicant \u2019s ] participation in the crimes are to be decided at the trial on the merits , and [ therefore ] should not be examined at the present hearing \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG searched in a house situated at CARDINAL , GPE village , in LOC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged several appeals : against the decisions of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE ( authorising searches ) , DATE ( authorising criminal prosecution of the applicant ) and DATE ( ordering his detention ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first appeal and confirmed the decisions of CARDINAL and DATE . ORG held that the decisions of ORG were sufficiently reasoned and lawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the defence \u2019s second appeal and upheld the decision of DATE . ORG held , inter alia , that at that stage it was not its task to examine the specific acts with which the applicant was charged or the evidence produced by the parties . Otherwise its work would amount to an examination of the case on its merits . The defence could not therefore rely on alleged violations of domestic or international law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , in addition to the previous charges , the applicant was charged with personal income tax evasion allegedly committed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the request of the prosecution , extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing the ORG claimed that they needed to perform a number of additional investigative actions , namely , to obtain expert reports , to obtain replies to the court \u2019s rogatory letters and to obtain decisions on the extradition of PERSON and PERSON PERSON to GPE . Further , the ORG had to \u201c question witnesses , seize documents in ... organisations , banks , tax inspectorates and , based on the evidence thus collected , bring new charges against [ the applicant ] and perform other investigative actions aimed at completing the preliminary investigation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parties\u2019 arguments before the court were broadly similar to their previous position . The prosecution emphasised that the applicant \u2019s accomplices had fled from justice . The applicant , in turn , provided the court with more detailed information on his state of health . Further , he claimed that while in detention he had never been questioned in connection with his case .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that the applicant \u2019s situation had not changed , and that therefore there was no reason to apply a measure of restraint milder than detention . As to the applicant \u2019s state of health , the court noted that despite information about the applicant \u2019s diseases , there was no evidence that his medical condition was incompatible with detention . The court also held that it was not competent to examine evidence against the applicant and the legal qualification given by the prosecution to the facts of the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyers appealed against that decision . They submitted to the court of appeal additional documents concerning the applicant \u2019s state of health . They also complained that ORG had not examined the possibility of applying a milder measure of restraint . On DATE ORG dismissed their arguments and upheld the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand . The prosecution referred to a document seized in DATE in the office of Mr PERSON , CARDINAL of the former legal advisers of GPE , from which it followed that the GPE management planned to put pressure on the law - enforcement bodies through political channels . They also referred to information received as a result of the operational and search activities , which showed that the applicant had tried to contact other co - defendants who were hiding abroad .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing the applicant opposed that request , repeating his earlier arguments . Thus , the applicant claimed that the ORG \u2019s allegations that he would abscond or interfere with the course of justice were not based on any facts . Finally , the applicant alleged that he should not be detained because of his poor health .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s defence also claimed that his initial arrest had been unlawful . The decision of the Simonovskiy District Court of DATE , authorising criminal prosecution of the applicant , became final only on DATE . Before that date the ORG had no power to perform any investigative actions in his respect , let alone to arrest him .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the case under investigation was quite complex and that the applicant \u2019s detention on remand should therefore be extended . The court also repeated the wording of the first CARDINAL detention orders justifying detention . To the previous reasoning the court added that there was a risk that the applicant might continue his criminal activities . It also referred to the information received by the prosecution as a result of the operational and search activities . As to the lawfulness of the initial detention order , the court noted that , since the decision of DATE had been confirmed by the court of appeal , the applicant \u2019s detention was lawful . The court held that the argument of the defence about the lack of evidence of crime should not be examined within the detention proceedings . As a result , the applicant \u2019s detention was extended anew , until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The defence appealed , claiming , inter alia , that the continued detention of the applicant amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court again examined the arguments of the parties , \u201c materials \u201d produced by the prosecution and the applicant \u2019s arguments in favour of his release . In addition to the previously stated reasons the court referred to the risk of collusion with PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON , all of whom had left GPE . The court also referred to the fact that on DATE the applicant had not attended the hearing at which the court had read out its decision authorising criminal prosecution against him . The court also referred to the fact that the applicant had not been arrested in his usual place of residence and that he did not open the door when the police officers arrived to arrest him . In addition , the court referred to an electronic document seized in DATE in the office of Mr PERSON , entitled \u201c Summary analysis of the criminal - law aspects of the activities of senior managers and shareholders of the PERSON - Rosprom - Yukos group \u201d . That document , according to the court , described various measures which the shareholders and senior managers of Yukos were preparing to undertake in order to apply pressure , through their connections in the political milieu , on law - enforcement officials , by bribing them , through fictitious claims and complaints , by organising a denigration campaign in the mass - media , etc . The court finally referred to the \u201c operational information \u201d provided by the prosecution authorities which showed the applicant \u2019s intent to establish contact with other suspects who had fled GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation was completed . On DATE the applicant obtained a copy of the investigation file , which contained CARDINAL volumes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was extended at the request of the prosecution . The prosecution noted that due to the applicant \u2019s poor eyesight the examination of the materials of the case was taking a long time . They claimed that the applicant had connections in GPE and abroad , that he could flee from justice , put pressure on witnesses and otherwise obstruct the investigation . The court decided to keep the applicant in remand , referring to the applicant \u2019s character , the danger of absconding , the risk of collusion with other former senior executives of GPE , and to the factual circumstances referred to in the prosecutor \u2019s request . As to the applicant \u2019s state of health , the court decided , on the basis of the applicant \u2019s medical file , that it was not incompatible with his participation in the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention on remand was extended until DATE , DATE in aggregate . The reasons given for that extension repeated the reasons relied on in the previous detention orders . The defence asked the court to summon and question the applicant \u2019s doctors from ORG . However , that motion by the defence was refused by the court , which referred to the certificates from the prison hospital by which the applicant was declared fit to support criminal proceedings and to stand trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was extended until DATE . The court analysed , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s medical situation . It established that the applicant had refused to take prescribed treatment in the conditions of the remand prison hospital . However , the applicant did not show that the ORG treatment could not be administered within the remand prison hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ruled that the defence should finish the reading of the case file by DATE . In the ruling the court noted that due to the applicant \u2019s poor eyesight he had been unable to read the documents himself , and that the investigator in charge of his case had been reading the case file aloud to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Upon his arrest on DATE the applicant was examined by prison doctors at remand prison CARDINAL of GPE . They established , inter alia , that the applicant had serious sight problems ; he had floaters in the right eye ( which he himself describes as \u201c effective blindness \u201d ) and overall impairment of visual acuity .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the applicant was given an opportunity to have a blood test in the laboratory but he refused for religious reasons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims that after DATE spent in the remand prison his eyesight had deteriorated to the extent that the investigator in charge of his case had to read to him the materials of the case file . The applicant also developed photophobia .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was found for the first time to be HIV - positive . The applicant \u2019s illness was qualified as being of the \u201c third degree \u201d of gravity . Later it was re - qualified to \u201c fourth degree \u201d . The doctors concluded that the applicant could be held in the remand prison without unfavourable development of the HIV infection provided he received regular check - ups in a specialist [ Aids ] institution , including medical monitoring of his health and timely application of specialised therapy .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over DATE medical examinations showed a further deterioration in his medical condition as a result of the HIV infection . From the applicant \u2019s medical record it follows that he received medicine from his relatives and had consulted with the prison doctor .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , at the investigator \u2019s request , the applicant \u2019s medical file was examined by a group of specialist doctors . In a report completed on DATE the doctors concluded that the applicant was fit to be detained and to participate in the investigative activities . At the same time the doctors noted that the applicant \u2019s condition was worsening , and recommended FAC ( Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy ) treatment and regular monitoring of his health in a specialised medical institution ( DATE , or more often if necessary ) . The doctors also concluded that the applicant \u2019s right eye was completely blind and that the eyesight of his left eye was seriously impaired ( high - level myopia and complex astigmatism ) . However , the doctors declared themselves incompetent to decide whether the applicant \u2019s illnesses could be treated in the conditions of the remand prison ( point CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the prison hospital had all the necessary medication . In addition , in CARDINAL the applicant received CARDINAL parcels with medicine from his relatives . As to the LAW medication , it could have been obtained by the applicant \u2019s relatives in a specialised pharmacy in GPE , on the presentation of a prescription issued by ORG . In support of their submissions , the Government referred to letters signed by PERSON GPE , the head of the remand prison , and sent to the Court in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government produced further written depositions by CARDINAL former cell - mates of the applicant . They were addressed to the remand prison administration . The first deposition , dated DATE , was signed by Mr GPE , the second , dated DATE , was signed by PERSON PERSON . Mr PERSON was detained with the applicant in DATE . He testified that the conditions of detention were satisfactory , and that \u201c the applicant had received medical assistance in full , both from the remand prison hospital and his relatives \u201d . Mr PERSON was detained with the applicant from DATE until DATE . He repeated the account given by Mr PERSON . He added that on several occasions the applicant was taken for examination to external medical institutions .", "CARDINAL . The Government produced a copy of the applicant \u2019s medical file . From that file it follows that the applicant received medicines from his relatives and from the prison pharmacy . The medicines mentioned in the medical file included aspirin , antibacterial and antiviral drugs ( \u201c ORG \u201d and \u201c Cyclovir \u201d ) , locally acting anti - inflammatory drugs ( \u201c FAC ) , anti - allergic drugs ( \u201c Suprastin \u201d ) , activated charcoal , immunostimulating drugs ( \u201c FAC ) , nootropic substances , etc . Most of them were received from the applicant \u2019s relatives .", "CARDINAL . As follows from the medical file , in DATE the applicant did not refuse treatment or examination by the prison doctors . On DATE the applicant was taken to ORG for examination . NORP The entry of DATE attests that the applicant refused to accept an injection before having consulted his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant developed severe headaches and pharyngalgia . On CARDINAL DATE he asked the investigator for referral to ORG for examination and treatment . He also complained that medical checks had been carried out only sporadically and that he had not received the previously prescribed treatment . In his reply of DATE the investigator informed the applicant that medical aid to detainees was within the competence of the prison authorities , and that his request had been transmitted to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed in ORG for a new medical examination . The applicant was informed of the possible side effects of the FAC treatment ; he signed a paper in which he expressly accepted the treatment . That paper informed the applicant , inter alia , that the treatment was not capable of curing his disease completely and that it could have side - effects , of which the applicant had been informed . That written waiver also contained the names of the medicines prescribed to the applicant : the entry of DATE in the applicant \u2019s medical file attests that the applicant had agreed to undergo anti - retroviral therapy .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , after DATE , when the applicant signed an information notice and accepted ORG treatment in writing , he refused that treatment , insisting that it should be administered in the specialised hospital itself and not in the remand prison hospital . The Government referred to a report signed by the deputy head of the prison hospital , a doctor from that hospital and a paramedic , in which they certified that the applicant had refused ORG treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s medical file , produced by the ORG , contains CARDINAL entries related to DATE and DATE , attesting that the applicant refused to undergo treatment or examination by prison medical staff ( the first entry was dated DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that the medication prescribed within the ORG treatment had not been made available to him , despite his requests . In support he referred to the letter from the investigator , dated DATE , in which the investigator had mentioned that the applicant had asked him to start the ORG treatment . The applicant maintained that on DATE a paramedic from the prison hospital , while conducting his TIME rounds , had offered him boxes which apparently contained some medicine . The paramedic did not tell the applicant what was in those boxes . The applicant , who was almost completely blind , refused to take them , because he did not know about any new treatment being prescribed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant complained to the investigator that he did not receive medical examination and treatment . On DATE the investigator forwarded his letter to the prison authorities , requesting that the applicant be transferred to ORG for medical examinations . In his letter the investigator asked the prison authorities \u201c to secure timely medical examination of the applicant and his treatment , including the FAC treatment recommended by the forensic report \u201d .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant suffered from a swinging fever of DATE C , lost MONEY of his body weight and was anaemic . In addition , he developed a number of opportunistic diseases . Thus , he contracted shingles and developed stomatitis , with evidence of oral candidiasis and associated dysphagia . There was evidence of marked neurological problems , with encephalopathy , poly - neuropathy , optic atrophy and corneal dystrophy . His eyeballs were sunken and he had chronic blepharitis . Further investigation apparently indicated persistent liver lesions with evidence of chronic cholecystitis , and other diseases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken to ORG for consultation . On DATE the applicant underwent yet another medical examination , which revealed a dramatic deterioration in his condition as a result of the HIV infection . On DATE he was examined in the GPE AIDS Centre anew . A report by PERSON and Dr PERSON concluded that the applicant was suffering from Aids ( CARDINALrd ( CARDINALth ) stage \u201c B \u201d ) . The applicant \u2019s condition was described as \u201c moderately severe ( unsatisfactory ) \u201d . The report also recommended that the applicant undergo in - patient examination and treatment in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The defence contacted PERSON , a NORP expert on ORG at the PERSON and ORG , GPE . Having examined the applicant \u2019s medical record , PERSON concluded as follows :", "\u201c It is my opinion that [ the applicant \u2019s ] medical condition is such that there is imminent threat to his life should he remain untreated both in respect of the opportunistic infections , and the HIV infection itself . There is also a major imminent risk of irreparable damage to his health should these treatments not be initiated straight away .", "Were [ the applicant ] to be imprisoned in the GPE , he would undoubtedly be released on compassionate grounds or at least transferred to a specialist hospital until his condition ha[d ] been diagnosed , treated and stabilised . It is of great concern that his numerous serious and indeed life- ( and sight- ) threatening problems have not been urgently addressed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prison authorities informed the applicant \u2019s lawyers that they had obtained the necessary prescriptions from the doctors of ORG , and that the applicant \u2019s relatives could purchase the necessary medicines for him . According to the prison authorities , however , the applicant was able to take these drugs in the remand prison and did not require transfer to an outside hospital for in - patient treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred from remand prison CARDINAL to the hospital of remand prison CARDINAL .", "DATE .

On DATE the investigator decided that , due to the critical state of the applicant \u2019s health , he should be released on bail . However , the applicant was not released ; instead , on DATE the investigator brought a motion before ORG , seeking to obtain the authorisation of the applicant \u2019s release on bail . The amount of bail requested by the prosecution was MONEY . In the application for release the investigator stated , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s diseases could not be treated in the conditions of the remand prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE examined the investigator \u2019s request . According to the applicant , at the hearing a ORG representative opposed the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . The court decided that it was not competent to deal with the matter . The court also noted that , under LAW , it was the investigator in charge of the case who was competent to order a suspect \u2019s release on bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator took a new decision , this time dismissing the application for release . The investigator noted that it was for the detention centre \u2019s administration to decide whether the applicant should be treated in a civil hospital . The investigator further stated that , according to information received from the detention centre \u2019s medical facility , the applicant had refused the treatment proposed by the doctors working there . The investigator also took into account the decision of ORG of DATE , dismissing the application for release . The investigator concluded that he was not competent to decide whether the applicant should be transferred to a specialised medical institution . The defence appealed , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand . With regard to the applicant \u2019s state of health , it referred to the certificate delivered by the prison hospital , which attested that the applicant had been fit for detention and could participate in the criminal proceedings . It also attested that the applicant had refused to be examined by the doctors of the prison hospital and had refused to take the FAC treatment prescribed to him . The court also referred to the conclusions of the \u201c complex forensic medical examination of the applicant \u201d . It appears that the court was referring to the examination carried out in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .
