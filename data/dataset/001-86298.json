This means that considerably more than ordinary probability is required , albeit not the same strength of evidence being required as for establishing that the perpetrator is guilty in a criminal case .", "[ The applicant ] and [ Ms C. ] spent TIME from TIME DATE at ORG at PERSON . [ ... ]", "On the basis of [ Ms C. ] \u2019s evidence and the requirement of clear of probability on the balance of probabilities in order to fulfil the requirement of proof , the High Court finds it established for its decision on compensation that the applicant called her at her hotel room during TIME with the pretext that he needed to borrow or to get some drinks as he himself had \u2018 gone dry\u2019 . [ Ms C ] was lying asleep when the telephone rang and was irritated about the disturbance , but she replied that he could come and get something from her mini - bar .

There was no question of serious use of violence [ alvorlig voldsbruk ] , only of overpowering by holding [ Ms C. ] \u2019s arms . Even though the victim had different alternatives for escaping the situation , which she for different reasons did not find that she could use , this does not alter the basic character of the act which was wilful violation by the use of violence [ vold ] .", "Against the background of the majority \u2019s finding that it has been established that on the balance of probabilities it was clearly probable that [ the applicant ] , by the use of violence [ vold ] has gained [ tiltvunget seg ] sexual intercourse with [ Ms C. ] , the conditions for making an award of compensation have been fulfilled . [ ... ]", "The minority , ... , has found that the conditions for ordering the accused to pay compensation have not been fulfilled .", "The minority does not find it has been made sufficiently probable that [ the applicant ] understood that the sexual intercourse was not consensual on [ Ms C. ] \u2019s part or displayed gross negligence in this respect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of ORG judgment , the applicant \u2019s appeal within the company against his dismissal from his job as a pilot for ORG was refused .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG against ORG procedure , assessment of evidence and application of the law . The appeal on the latter point was on the ground that , contrary to LAW , ORG had failed in its judgment to make it sufficiently clear that the order to pay compensation did not affect his acquittal of the charges . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG granted leave to appeal with respect to this ground of appeal , while refusing such leave for the remainder .", "CARDINAL . NORP In support of his appeal against ORG application of the law , the applicant argued , inter alia the following . For a judgment awarding compensation to be rendered after an acquittal , there was a requirement under ORG case law relating to LAW that the reasoning stated in the judgement be worded in such a way as not to cast doubt on the correctness of the acquittal . This entailed firstly that the judgment must make a clear distinction between the acquittal on the criminal charge and the decision on compensation . It ought to be made clear that the subject - matter for the CARDINAL issues , respectively criminal and civil liability , are different and that the award of compensation did not weaken the acquittal . In this case , ORG had failed to create the necessary distance between the CARDINAL issues , since the reasoning in the judgment went on immediately thereafter to deal with the subject of compensation . Moreover , no express reservation had been stated with regard to the acquittal .", "Furthermore , the applicant argued , it was necessary to avoid the use of formulations that might serve to raise doubts about the acquittal . In several places , ORG had used such formulations , including the expressions \u201c guilty \u201d , \u201c the use of force \u201d and \u201c sexual intercourse by force \u201d . This came so close to establishing that the conditions for criminal sexual assault had been fulfilled that the presumption of innocence must be deemed to have been violated . Extra care ought to be exercised when formulating the reasoning in a judgment where the questions of criminal liability and civil liability to pay compensation are decided in the same case . In this connection the applicant relied on the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in NORP v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALII ) .", "The applicant , again referring to the aforementioned Y v. GPE judgment and also to LAW , submitted that , if ORG were to find a breach of the Convention in the present case , it would have to quash the lower court \u2019s judgment . Where a decision suffered from such defects , due process required that there be an entirely fresh assessment of the evidence . If there was no basis for setting the impugned judgment aside , then at the very least a declaratory judgment ought to be rendered , stating a violation of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG unanimously rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment on compensation , finding no breach of LAW .", "The first voting judge , PERSON , gave the following reasons :", "( CARDINAL ) I have concluded that the reasons given by ORG do not contravene the presumption of innocence in LAW [ ... ] and accordingly that the appeal will not succeed .", "[ ... ]", "( CARDINAL ) With regard to the details of the provision applied in our case , it is in my view appropriate to base our assessment on the judgment rendered by ORG on DATE in Case No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . This judgment was rendered after the guiding judgments by ORG of DATE in NORP v. GPE [ cited above ] and GPE v. GPE [ no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALII ] . Reference is made to the thorough discussion of the decisions DATE and past case - law of ORG \u2013 contained therein . Therein it is stated that LAW protects any person suspected of a criminal offence against any affirmations being made in court decisions on other statements by public authorities that he is guilty of a criminal offence , without his having been convicted in a criminal case .", "( CARDINAL ) It is accordingly clear \u2013 and undisputed \u2013 that it is not contrary to the presumption of innocence for a person who has been acquitted of a criminal charge to be ordered to pay compensation in a civil case , even if in terms of content the material facts upon which the claim for compensation is based correspond to the conditions for criminal liability . However , where a person who has been acquitted of a criminal charge is ordered to pay compensation , it is a requirement that the grounds on which the compensation order is based must not be formulated in such a way as to cast doubts over the correctness of the acquittal . Moreover , provided that the compensation order is not formulated in this way , LAW [ ... ] does not constitute an obstacle to the person acquitted of the criminal charge being ordered to pay compensation in the same case for the act to which the indictment related .", "( CARDINAL ) According to LAW , ... a legal claim that the victim or other injured parties have against the accused may be adjudicated in the criminal case , provided that the claim derives from the same act as the criminal case . The possibility to review the claim for compensation in the criminal case has clear advantages from the point of view of procedural economy and saves the victim from the financial and emotional burden of undergoing CARDINAL trials . The evidentiary requirements in civil actions are less stringent than those that apply in criminal cases . An unavoidable consequence of this is that a person who has been acquitted of a criminal charge may be ordered to pay compensation in the same case , based on the finding that he committed the act in respect of which s / he had been acquitted . In order to enable this without creating doubts about the acquittal , strict requirements should apply to the reasoning contained in the judgment awarding compensation .", "( CARDINAL ) The ground for the appeal is that the reasons given in ORG judgment on this point violated the presumption of innocence . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found that an appeal lodged on this basis must be regarded as an appeal on the ground of procedural error . This too is my finding .", "( CARDINAL ) Under LAW ) of LAW , the reasoning in a judgment in a civil case must \u2018 state precisely and exhaustively the facts on which the ORG bases its decision ... \u2019 . In our case the basis for compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage is sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b)of LAW DATE . It is a condition in both of these provisions that the tortfeasor has inflicted on the victim a violation of the type provided for in LAW . The court must therefore make it clear that it has found proven a fact which from an objective point of view constitutes a breach of this provision . The subjective conditions for liability also coincide to some extent , namely that compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage requires intent or gross negligence and that LAW also makes sexual assault by gross negligence a criminal offence .", "( CARDINAL ) Given the manner the conditions for compensation have been formulated , it is not possible to avoid coming close to a criminal- law assessment . In order to do this , without casting doubt on the acquittal , the court must in my view take as a starting point what inter alia distinguishes the legal consequences , i.e. the requirement of proof that the conditions have been fulfilled . The finding that , in objective terms , a breach of LAW has occurred can not be avoided . The same applies to the subjective conditions for compensation . What must be avoided is casting doubt over the correctness of the acquittal , in view of the strict evidentiary requirements that apply in criminal cases .", "( CARDINAL ) The High Court opens the section of the judgment in which the compensation issue is decided by stating that notwithstanding the acquittal of [ the applicant ] , under NORP law [ Ms C. ] has not forfeited her right to claim compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage under the rules on civil compensation for the tortuous act which she says has taken place . The ORG continues :", "\u2018 Because other and weaker requirements of proof apply for establishing that an act has occurred under the civil law on tort than when there is question of imposing criminal liability for the same act , an award of compensation for pecuniary / non - pecuniary damage would not in itself amount to setting aside the acquittal.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) The defence has argued that the interjection \u2018 in itself\u2019 constitutes a reservation that opens the way for the conclusion that doubt is cast on the judgment . I do not agree with this , nor that ORG , when providing in a subsequent paragraph a further description of the evidentiary requirements , refers to [ PERSON ] \u2019s claim that [ the applicant ] was \u2018 guilty\u2019 of an aggravated act towards her for which he has been acquitted in terms of criminal law . The expression \u2018 guilty\u2019 , which in fact was a quote from PERSON submissions , must be viewed with reference to the evidentiary requirements applicable in compensation cases of this nature and to the other conditions .", "( CARDINAL ) After having outlined the chain of events that it has found established , ORG concluded that \u2018 it is clear on the balance of probabilities that on TIME [ the applicant ] had sexual intercourse with [ Ms C. ] and that this intercourse was not voluntary on her ORG . This can not in my view be regarded as an attack on the acquittal . Nor does it go any further than what is necessary in order to establish that the conditions for compensation are present . The same applies when the majority of ORG states that on the balance of probabilities it was clearly probable that [ the applicant ] realised that PERSON did not want sexual intercourse with him and that \u2018 [ the applicant ] by the use of violence has gained sexual intercourse with [ Ms C.].\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) To sum up , I note that ORG provided a clear account of the differences between the evidentiary requirements for punishment and those applicable to compensation . Moreover , the assessment of the conditions for compensation took place on an independent basis without any reference to the indictment or the written list of questions put to the jury . Furthermore , as I have already noted , I do not find that expressions of a typically criminal- law character were used . Factors of this nature were found to be decisive when ORG ruled on DATE that the presumption of innocence had been violated in that case , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the decision . In our case , I am accordingly of the view that ORG marked the necessary distance to the criminal case and that it did not cast doubt on the acquittal in other ways .", "( CARDINAL ) I have concluded on this basis that the appeal must be rejected . \u201d", "The CARDINAL other judges agreed with the first voting judge \u201c in the main and the conclusion \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has submitted a letter of DATE from ORG ( Kontoret for voldsoffererstatning ) . It states that by a decision of CARDINAL May CARDINAL the ORG had granted PERSON CARDINAL in compensation , \u201c having found it shown on the balance of probabilities it was clearly probable that she had been inflicted personal injury as a result of a criminal act . \u201d It further notified the applicant that the ORG might seek restitution of ORG CARDINAL from him .", "CARDINAL .

Section CARDINAL , referred to in the above provision , expressly applies to misconduct mentioned in , amongst others , LAW .", "CARDINAL . A claim for compensation for nonpecuniary damage submitted by a victim under section CARDINAL of the LAW is subject to his or her showing that the alleged perpetrator , with intent or gross negligence , committed the wrongful act . The test is normally the balance of probabilities and the burden of proof lies with the claimant . However , in a landmark ruling of DATE concerning civil liability for forced sexual intercourse ( PERSON , p. CARDINAL , at p. CARDINAL ; GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALII ) ORG held that the requirement as to the strength of the evidence had to be stricter than that which applied to the test of the balance of probabilities , bearing in mind the burden which an allegation of reprehensible conduct might have for the defendant and the serious consequences it might have for his or her reputation . In a case of the kind under consideration , the test had to be whether on the balance of probabilities it was clearly probable that the alleged abuse had been committed ( \u201c klar sannsynlighetsovervekt \u201d ) . This burden was heavier where liability may have serious consequences for the respondent \u2019s reputation , though it was less than for criminal liability .", "CARDINAL . The objective constitutive elements of acts which may give rise to both criminal liability and civil liability to pay compensation are not always the same . The subjective constitutive elements in principle differ : normally criminal liability requires intent whereas liability to pay compensation requires gross or simple negligence . There may be exonerating circumstances \u2013 such as self - defence , necessity , provocation or ignorance \u2013 which exclude criminal liability but which do not exclude liability to pay compensation ( see PERSON GPE ORG ) CARDINAL \u201c Erstatning til ofrene hvor tiltalte frifinnes for straff \u201d ( Compensation to Victims in Cases where the Accused has been Acquitted of ORG ) , study by Mr PERSON , Professor of LAW , sub - chapter CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The purposes of the criminal law and the law on compensation are not identical . While deterrence and restoration are important considerations in both areas of law , the former places emphasis on retribution and the latter on the spreading of financial loss . The CARDINAL systems also supplement one another in important respects . While criminal law sanctions are particularly designed to deter the actual and potential offenders from committing offences , those of the law of compensation are particularly designed to meet the aggrieved person \u2019s need for economic redress ( ibid . , LAW , subchapter CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned study identified several justifications for maintaining the possibility to award compensation in connection with criminal proceedings even after an acquittal . It may serve the interests of economy of procedure and also psychological stress may be saved by treating criminal charges and compensation claims in joint proceedings . In comparison with civil proceedings , such joint proceedings were cheap both for the accused and for the victim who would be able to benefit from free legal aid for the handling of the civil claims . If the compensation proceedings had to await a final outcome in the criminal case ( at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction ) , it could take DATE before they could start . For the victim , and also for the acquitted , this could involve a considerable extra psychological burden . Moreover , in joint proceedings , the demands for thoroughness that were inherent in the criminal process would contribute to increasing the quality of the examination of the civil claim . Furthermore , the exonerating effect of an acquittal was not likely to be greater in split proceedings than in joint ones . On the contrary , in view of the problems related to examining the criminal evidence twice , the effect would tend to be more consistent under the latter . Finally , in criminal cases giving rise to CARDINAL civil claim , deciding them all at the same time in connection with the criminal process would ensure a greater degree of \u201c procedural equality \u201d and coherence ( ibidem , LAW , sub - chapter CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL and CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
