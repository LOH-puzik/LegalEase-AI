The applicant is the father of Mr PERSON , deceased ( hereinafter GPE ) . He was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE FAC ( a First Lieutenant in ORG ) was detailed to guard a military airdrome of ORG ( hereafter \u201c the Unit \u201d ) . He was issued a handgun with CARDINAL live cartridges . Around TIME he was found dead in the guardroom with CARDINAL gunshot wounds to his head .", "CARDINAL . A criminal investigation into his death was opened DATE and an investigator from ORG ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , PERSON , inspected the scene . In his report he described the position of the body and a Makarov handgun lying near a foot , loaded with CARDINAL cartridges . No traces of a struggle were found either at the scene or on the deceased . There were bullet holes in a window and the ceiling , as well as CARDINAL spent cartridges . A black ink pen was retrieved from GPE \u2019s pocket . The report drawn up on that occasion stated that the inspection had been conducted by the Commanding Officer ( hereafter \u201c the CO \u201d ) of the Unit , Colonel PERSON , and witnessed by CARDINAL other officers from the Unit .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , TIME , ORG partner , went to his apartment and saw that it was open and that Lieutenant - Colonel NORP ( the Executive Officer of the ORG , hereafter \u201c the EO \u201d ) with other persons was conducting a search .", "CARDINAL . The official documents state that the apartment of the deceased was searched at TIME However , First Lieutenant M. testified that at TIME several officers , including himself , had been detailed to conduct an inventory at FAC \u2019s apartment under the supervision of the EO .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and PERSON alleged that GPE had kept MONEY in a side - table . During the search no money was found there . Instead , First Lieutenant PERSON , an inquiry officer ( an officer of ORG , who had been appointed by the ORG to conduct an inquiry into the possible crime ) found a suicide letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was questioned by PERSON as regards her relations with the deceased . She stated that the deceased had been \u201c a clever person and one worth communicating with \u201d who had never expressed any thoughts of suicide . On DATE , when GPE was going on duty , he had invited her to come over .", "CARDINAL . According to the testimony of ORG , on DATE he visited the Unit because of the tragic incident . On DATE he informed the assembled ORG about the event and , whilst allowing the possibility of murder , nevertheless read out several extracts from the suicide letter . However , several other witnesses testified that ORG said nothing about murder , but focused on the alleged suicide , stating that FAC had long prepared himself to die at his own hand by , inter alia , reading occult philosophy written by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Typed copies of the alleged suicide letter were disseminated among the staff of the ORG by the ORG , who gave a copy to the applicant when the investigator refused to allow him to make a photocopy of the handwritten original .", "CARDINAL . During the applicant \u2019s interrogation on DATE , Captain PERSON remarked that he was almost completely sure that GPE \u2019s death had been a suicide and refused to add to the protocol the applicant \u2019s comments about the disappearance of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By DATE PERSON had questioned a number of witnesses - mainly those who had seen the applicant \u2019s son on DATE of the tragic event and those who were closely acquainted with him . The questions asked were focused on GPE \u2019s mood before the incident , his interest in PERSON \u2019s philosophy and occult practices , his possible abuse of alcohol or drugs and whether he played with his gun on duty .", "CARDINAL . A.S. \u2019s friends stated that the deceased had been very careful with alcohol and weapons , and had been a calm , respectful person . The witnesses did not know if he had ever used any drugs or practised any occultism . Mr ORG . , GPE \u2019s former roommate , claimed to having heard the applicant \u2019s son saying that he had meditated , but had never seen this for himself . The moral welfare officer submitted that the deceased used to abuse alcohol , but long before the incident he had given up drinking . A.S. had not been considered a suicide risk by either the moral welfare officer or his friends . None of those who saw the deceased on DATE of the incident spotted any peculiarities in his conduct .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the line of interrogation was changed to include questions about whether GPE had had any enemies and whether there had been any assaults on the sentries . Some of the previous witnesses were questioned again . None of the witnesses could positively answer either of these questions .", "CARDINAL . Mr Pk . , who claimed to be ORG friend ( but was not identified as CARDINAL by other witnesses ) , while describing the deceased as a calm , equable person , said , nevertheless , that the fact of his suicide \u201c had not been a surprise to him \u201d . Mr Y. ( whose relation with the deceased is unclear ) , re - interrogated on DATE , also stated that the suicide of GPE \u201c had not been a surprise to him \u201d . In his subsequent interview on DATE , Mr Y. recalled that in DATE he had seen the deceased smoking a cigarette with a suspicious smell . Mr NORP testified that the deceased had thought himself \u201c cleverer than others \u201d and read philosophical books . He had also heard that GPE had meditated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator refused to grant the applicant the status of a victim in criminal proceedings on the ground that the collected evidence strongly suggested that his son had committed suicide .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to a higher prosecutor . His complaint about the refusal of victim status was rejected . However , certain instructions to the investigator were apparently given which triggered a new series of interviews in DATE of the persons involved in the search of GPE \u2019s apartment on DATE and of his superiors , including Lieutenant - Colonel PERSON and Major - General O. Lieutenant - Colonel PERSON testified that he had twice reprimanded the deceased , but did not think there had been any bias or partiality on his part regarding GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the Ivano - Frankovsk Garrison informed the applicant that the case had been assigned to another investigator and that his request for victim status in the proceedings could not be granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG disjoined the investigation into the death of GPE from the criminal proceedings for theft .", "CARDINAL . The handgun found at the scene and CARDINAL cartridges from its magazine were examined by a ballistics expert . According to his report of DATE , the gun was serviceable and could not have been fired without pulling the trigger . The rounds were also serviceable . The spent cartridges had been fired from that gun .", "CARDINAL . The body was examined by a pathologist . According to the autopsy report , the cause of GPE \u2019s death had been CARDINAL gunshot wounds . Both had been inflicted when the victim was still alive . The apparent first wound injured the neck , tongue and mouth ( inlet on the left side of the tongue and the outlet near the right ear ) . The second wound , which was the direct cause of death ( inlet on the forehead ) , damaged the frontal bone , brain and occipital bone , where the bullet was found . The pathologist concluded that the first shot had been fired into the victim \u2019s mouth and the second into the forehead . Both were fired from a short distance .", "CARDINAL . The additional forensic examination concluded that , after the first shot , the individual could still have retained the ability to make further movements for a short period .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator also ordered a graphology forensic examination of the suicide letter found in GPE \u2019s apartment , and asked the expert to establish whether it had been written by the deceased . On DATE the expert gave a positive answer to that question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a chemical expert concluded that the ink on the letter matched the CARDINAL from the pen found in the GPE \u2019s pocket .", "CARDINAL . According to the post - mortem psychological inquiry , the mental state of GPE did not exclude the possibility of suicide . In particular , it was mentioned that he had had overrated self - esteem and insularity , which had led to , inter alia , conflicts with his superiors .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator , First Lieutenant Sk . , completed the preliminary investigation and drew up a final report . He concluded that the mental state of the deceased , the possibility of movement after the first shot , and the suicide letter written under the influence of PERSON philosophy , proved that GPE had committed suicide . This conclusion was supported by references to the aforementioned expert opinions and CARDINAL witness testimonies to that effect .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged this decision before a court . He stated , inter alia , that his son had been killed because of his involvement in the criminal schemes of his superiors . He alleged that the investigation had been from the very beginning focused on proving the suicide . The investigators did not even attempt to examine other versions , although the final report mentioned the victim \u2019s \u201c conflicts with his superiors \u201d . In this respect the applicant also indicated that the Ukrainian Code of Criminal Procedure vested the commanding officers of military units with the authority to make the preliminary inquiry , comparable with that of the police . He thus challenged the ORG \u2019s active participation in the criminal proceedings which practically excluded the possibility that the investigators could take account of the applicant \u2019s views on the incident .", "CARDINAL . The applicant mentioned the investigation \u2019s inability to detect the origin of a bullet hole in the guardroom ceiling and to explain why the first shot \u2019s trajectory was from left to right , although his son had been righthanded . He complained about the prosecution authorities\u2019 refusal to grant him the status of \u201c a victim of the criminal offence \u201d , thus denying him access to the case file . In this respect he also complained about his inability to examine the suicide letter and to give an opinion on the likeness between the handwriting in the letter and that of his son . However , he alleged that the style of the letter did not match ORG usual way of writing . The applicant , therefore , requested that an independent expert examination of the letter be conducted . He finally challenged the decision to disjoin the proceedings concerning his son \u2019s death and the theft of money from his apartment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the Ivano - Frankovsk Garrison rejected the applicant \u2019s complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ( hereafter \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) allowed the complaints , quashed the ruling of DATE , and ordered further inquiries . The court specified the following irregularities in the investigation :", "the failure to conduct a reconstruction of the events to establish the possibility that , in the circumstances , the body could naturally have fallen into the position in which it was found ;", "the failure to detect the origin of the bullet hole in the guardroom window ; and", "the failure to establish with sufficient clarity the mental state of the deceased before the incident .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to grant him victim status . The court also found no reason to rejoin the investigations into the death and theft . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal on these issues .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another investigator , ORG , drew up a final report which generally repeated that of DATE . The only further action taken by the investigator was that of ordering a post - mortem psychiatric inquiry , which revealed that GPE had not suffered from any mental disorder , though his general mental state could have led to suicide . The investigator thus concluded that FAC had committed suicide and closed the case . On DATE the GPE - PERSON refused to provide the applicant with a copy of this report on the ground that he was neither the defendant nor the victim in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG sent the applicant a copy of that report .", "CARDINAL .
