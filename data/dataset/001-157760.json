In DATE the applicants wrote a letter to ORG , to the President of ORG and to the Governor of BD concerning the appointment of a director of the ORG public radio station . They referred , in particular , to PERSON candidacy for that position . PERSON was the entertainment editor at the BD public radio at the material time .", "The relevant part of the letter reads as follows :", "\u201c We acknowledge and appreciate your support and the effort you put in creating a multiethnic radio ... Unfortunately , it appears that there was a major oversight at the very beginning of this important venture . The panel for the selection of the director [ of the radio ] was created in contravention of the Statute of Br\u010dko District . It is composed of CARDINAL NORP members , CARDINAL NORP and one PERSON . Thus , yet again , the LAW , which requires proportional representation of the CARDINAL constituent peoples in public institutions , was disregarded ... Unfortunately , nothing has been done to correct this . The unofficial information we received to the effect that PERSON was proposed for the position of the radio director by the NORP members of the Panel ... although the former director was PERSON , confirms the above . This proposal is unacceptable , all the more so because it concerns a person who lacks the professional and moral qualities for such a position .", "According to the information we received ...", "in an interview published in \u201c NIN \u201d , discussing the destruction of FAC in GPE , PERSON said that NORP were not people , that they did not possess culture and that , accordingly , destroying FAC could not be seen as a destruction of cultural monuments ,", "... on the radio \u2019s premises ... she made a point of removing from the wall ( and tore to pieces ) the calendar with the schedule of religious services during DATE ,", "... on the radio \u2019s premises she covered the coat of arms of GPE with the coat of arms of ORG ,", "as the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value .", "We firmly believe that the above - described acts absolutely disqualify PERSON as a candidate for the position of the director of the multiethnic ORG of GPE ...", "We hope that you will act accordingly ...", "In the absence of any action on your part , we will be forced to contact the media as well as the other competent national and international bodies . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Shortly thereafter the letter was published in CARDINAL different DATE newspapers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE initiated civil defamation proceedings against the applicants and claimed compensation of MONEY ( BAM ) . M.S submitted that she had learned about the content of the letter shorlty after it had been sent by the defendants , but that she did not know who gave it to the media . After the letter was published , ORG annulled the proceedings for the appointment of a director of the public radio station .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) rejected the claim . It held that the applicants could not be liable for the alleged defamation because they had not published the letter in the media . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c From the GPE letter , it is clear that it was privately sent to the Governor , to the President of the ORG and to the Supervisor for GPE ... and it was not sent to the media ... [ T]he aim of the letter was not dissemination of unverified information to public , but bringing the attention of the competent authorities to certain issues and to enable them to draw certain conclusions on verification of that information .", "Having examined the articles published in the media , the court concludes that none of them was published by the defendants in this case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed against that judgment to ORG ( \" ORG \" ) . On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and decided to hold a new hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE after having examined several witnesses ( including the CARDINAL employees of the ORG public radio from whom the applicants received the information presented in their letter ) , ORG found that the contested letter contained some value - judgments but also the statements of facts which had been untrue and damaging to M.S.\u02bcs reputation . It held that for the liability for defamation to be established under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE it was irrelevant that the applicants did not publish the letter . ORG ordered the applicants to inform ORG , the President of ORG and the ORG \u2019s Governor about the retraction of their statements within DATE , in default of which they had to pay BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL in damage to GPE , together with default interest at the statutory rate from DATE . They were further ordered to publish the judgment at their own expense .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON filed a request for the enforcement of the above judgment to ORG . She proposed , inter alia , that the court send the judgment of DATE for publication at the ORG expense .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a writ of execution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants paid BAM CARDINAL ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) by way of the enforcement of the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG closed the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicants complained about the violation of their right to freedom of expression to ORG \" LAW \" ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG held that the interference with the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression was \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d and concluded that there had been no violation of Article II/CARDINAL.h ) of the LAW of GPE and LAW . The relevant part of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c DATE . At the outset ORG notes that the appellants did not deny that their liability for defamation was based on LAW DATE and that , therefore , the interference with the right [ to freedom of expression ] protected by LAW was prescribed by law ...", "CARDINAL . The impugned judgment was delievered in a civil defamation proceedings initiated by the plaintiff against the appellants ... accordingly , the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of the \u201c reputation or rights of others \u201d .", "CARDINAL . What remains to be determined is whether the interference complained of was \u201c necessary in a democratic society \u201d ....", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG considers that ORG established without doubt that the impugned factual statements about PERSON were false and that the appellants were liable for defamation . From the submissions of the CARDINAL witnesses , from whom the appellants received the information presented in the letter [ concerning the part of the letter in which it was stated that PERSON \u2018 made a point of removing from the wall ( and tore to pieces ) the calendar with the schedule of religious services during DATE and as the editor of the entertainment programme she banned broadcasting of sevdalinka arguing that that type of song had no cultural or musical value\u2019 ] , ORG established that there was an evident inconsistency between that what had been said to the appellants and that what they had reported in the letter . Furthermore , the statement from the impugned letter that PERSON gave an interview concerning the destruction of mosques was refuted by another witness who submitted that a subsequent verification had revealed that PERSON had not been the author of the said interview . Finally , the appellants failed to prove the veracity of the allegations that PERSON covered the coat of arms of GPE with the coat of arms of ORG . In view of the above , ORG considers that in the present case the right of the appellants to report irregularities in the conduct of an official to a body competent to deal with such complaints can not be premised on ascertaining manifestly untrue facts which go beyond the limit of acceptable criticism of civil servants . Accordingly , the court considers that ORG correctly concluded that there was \u2018 a pressing social ORG in the present case [ for the interference with the appellants\u2019 right to freedom of expression ] .", "DATE . Furthermore , ORG notes that ORG awarded non - pecuniary damage to GPE because her reputation was affected by the untrue statements made in the impugned letter . ... ORG has already stated in its previous jurisprudence that a person \u2019s reputation forms part of her personal identity and psychological integrity ...", "...", "CARDINAL . The appellants ... failed to verify the impugned statements beforehand as was their duty . ORG established that the appellants had damaged GPE \u2019s reputation by making untrue allegations , which caused her mental anguish ... When deciding on the claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage and its amount , ORG took into account the purpose of those damages , as well as that it should not favour aspirations that are incompatible with its nature and social purpose .", "CARDINAL . [ T]he ORG considers that a measure imposed on the appellants in the present case was proportionate to the aim pursued ... The court further considers that ORG did not go beyond its discretionary power in deciding on the claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage ... [T]he ORG finds that the reasons the ORG gave were \u2018 ORG and \u2018 LOC within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , ORG considers that the interference with the appellants\u2019 right to freedom of expression was \u2018 necessary in a democratic FAC and that , therefore , there has been no violation of Article II/CARDINAL.h ) of LAW and LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
