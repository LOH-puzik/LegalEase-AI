NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , the GPE . The second applicant is her son born on DATE . The applicants are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The first applicant \u2019s father died when she was at DATE . Thereafter her mother remarried . According to her doctor the first applicant was treated several times by a psychiatrist as she was very depressive , especially in DATE . As part of the treatment she was from time to time provided with medication . The first applicant had a sister and a stepbrother . The latter , who died in DATE , was according to the first applicant shot dead by the police while in police custody in GPE . Following her brother \u2019s death the first applicant became further psychologically imbalanced and went on sick leave for DATE . Her mother attempted suicide ( by taking pills ) and had alcohol problems .", "At the time of the events described below the first applicant had no previous criminal record and had been in gainful employment as a secretary since DATE . She had a partner with whom she did not cohabit .", "On DATE , the first applicant explains that she bought on a street in GPE a Citroen CARDINALCV from a person who she knew just as \u201c PERSON . She had the car registered and drove towards LOC in the evening of the same day . DATE beforehand , she had deliberately tried to become pregnant and when she left she was aware that she had succeeded in this . She was pregnant with the second applicant .", "On DATE , the NORP Police stopped her having been notified by the NORP customs authorities that she had given them peculiar information concerning her travel destination , etc . The first applicant was arrested after the police had found QUANTITY of amphetamine in ORG that she had driven from the GPE to GPE . The drug had a particularly high degree of purity ; CARDINAL - CARDINAL weight per cent , with a street value assessed at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The first applicant stated to the police that she had neither knowledge of GPE nor any acquaintances in the country , she was in possession of a limited amount of money upon arrest and had no credit card , to her employer in the GPE she had said that she had to go on a holiday with her mother who had been to hospital after taking an overdose .", "On DATE she was remanded in custody at ORG . On DATE she was transferred to LOC , as she had made an attempt to flee , assisted by CARDINAL persons visiting her from the GPE who had left a filing tool under the prison fence . On DATE she was transferred back to ORG .", "After a hearing on DATE , ORG ( lagmannsrett ) jury answered the charges in the negative , whereupon the judges sitting in the case unanimously set aside the first applicant \u2019s acquittal by the jury as obviously erroneous and ordered a retrial .", "In order to facilitate the applicant \u2019s particular situation and to co - ordinate future measures vis - \u00e0 - vis the mother and child , several discussions were held between representatives from the child care authorities , the relevant hospital , the prosecution , the police and her lawyer , who throughout the first applicant \u2019s stay in GPE , until she unilaterally decided to send the second applicant to his grandmother in the GPE , were in close co - operation with one another . To this end also a meeting was held at FAC between all the persons concerned , including the first applicant and her lawyer . She was able to communicate fluently in LANGUAGE . After the first applicant \u2019s attempted flight , security became an issue and different options were considered .", "DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the first applicant went CARDINAL times to ORG in GPE for prenatal checks , including ultra sound examinations . Most times she was accompanied by uniformed police officers and was obliged to wear handcuffs during her transportation and while in the waiting room with other patients . She felt humiliated vis - \u00e0 - vis other patients because of the presence of uniformed police and the use of handcuffs . The handcuffs were removed before the actual medical examinations and , with CARDINAL exception , before she entered the examination room . Some times the first applicant was accompanied by plain - clothed police officers from the anti - drugs squad who did not apply handcuffs , as they felt they had sufficient knowledge of her and her case to keep her under constant surveillance without applying handcuffs . The first applicant found it unacceptable that she could not always be accompanied by the latter police officers . On CARDINAL occasion , when the applicant had an ultra sound examination , CARDINAL male police officers followed her into the examination room , as it was on the ground floor with windows whereby one could leave the building . CARDINAL of the officers then assisted as an interpreter at the request of the midwife who did not master LANGUAGE . He inter alia explained to the first applicant what could be seen on the screen during the examination . The examination was limited to a plain ultra sound examination . Only at a later time did the first applicant complain about the police ORG presence in the room during the ultra sound examination .", "On DATE the first applicant gave birth to the second applicant at FAC in GPE , CARDINAL of the best - equipped hospitals in the country . During her hospitalisation , which lasted DATE , she was guarded by CARDINAL police officers . At that time there had already been one incident in GPE where a female detainee had fled in connection with giving birth at a hospital . There were other incidents were a detainee had fled when taken to hospital for medical reasons . On CARDINAL such occasion , at the least , the detainee had been armed .", "Shortly before the first applicant gave birth , the CARDINAL uniformed police officers followed her at a close distance as she and the female deputy director of the prison , serving as her support person , walked up and down the corridor . While the first applicant gave birth , the CARDINAL officers sat outside the delivery room . The door to the room was closed and a folding screen was positioned between the first applicant \u2019s bed and the door . At the first applicant \u2019s request , the deputy director attended the birth as her support person . The latter was a psychologist specialised in social psychology who had spent much time talking to and assisting the first applicant during her detention . In retrospect it had been observed that , on the whole , the efforts made by the prison staff in order to accommodate the first applicant \u2019s wishes and needs had almost been at the expense of those made vis - \u00e0 - vis other prisoners . The first applicant \u2019s mother came to visit and assist her daughter DATE after the second applicant was born .", "On DATE the first applicant was released from the hospital and transferred back to the prison . It was not deemed suitable that the son stay with his mother in GPE prison , which did not have the necessary facilities . This institution was considered unsuitable for keeping small children , in view of inter alia its architectural disposition , the outdoor areas , the sanitary conditions and the composition of the prison population . The latter comprised all categories of detainees , including mentally unstable persons held in security detention . A number of detainees were struggling with poor mental health , infectious diseases , consumption of intoxicating substances as well as deviant behaviour .", "The second applicant was instead placed in the Aline Child Care Centre offering high quality services for the mother and the newborn . The FAC was situated in GPE at a relatively close distance to the ORG prison . Arrangements were put in place to enable the baby to be fed with his mother \u2019s milk . Until DATE the first applicant was transported CARDINAL times a week to visit the boy at FAC TIME each time . On a few occasions , she was accompanied by police officers . Some times , as was the case during the prenatal checks , the officers wore uniform and applied handcuffs on the first applicant until she received her son . On other occasions her guardians were plain cloth police officers from the anti - drug squad who did not apply handcuffs on her . Thereafter , for DATE , the boy was brought to the prison for TIME a day on DATE and TIME a day on DATE .", "From DATE , the second applicant was hospitalised at FAC because of a lung virus . Its paediatric ward was located on the ground floor . The first applicant was able to visit him once for a duration of TIME , on which occasion she was wearing so - called transport cuffs \u2013 that was a chain attached to a foot and the opposite arm . Under these conditions she was permitted to be alone with the baby in a separate room while being observed by the police only through a screen . However , she could hold her baby , but was allegedly unable to nurse him and put him back in bed . Afterwards the mother received her son in the prison DATE .", "On her return to the prison after the above - mentioned visits , the applicant was regularly body searched , although some prison guards omitted to do this . The searches were carried out in accordance with standard practice . In a separate room she had to undress completely before a female prison officer , who , without any physical contact with her , inspected her hair , ears , mouth , arm pits and the crotch and made her squat and swing to and fro to ensure that she would not bring any unauthorised items into the prison .", "After DATE , such searches were occasionally also carried out after the boy had visited his mother in prison . ORG had on DATE received information suggesting that the son showed signs of nervousness , and it was thought that it might be due to drug abuse by his mother", "Because she had refused CARDINAL times to allow a body search , the first applicant was placed in an isolation cell only equipped with a mattress , for a duration of TIME and once for TIME . She made a complaint in writing . As of DATE she was no longer searched after her son \u2019s visits as she accepted to give urine samples enabling the prison administration to verify possible drug abuse . The tests proved negative .", "On DATE , after a retrial , ORG convicted the applicant and sentenced her to DATE imprisonment , from which DATE already spent in custody were to be deducted . This was deemed to be a relatively lenient sentence for such a serious drug offence , the reasons being her pregnancy , the birth in detention on remand and the fact that it would be an extra burden for her to serve a long prison sentence in a foreign country , with language difficulties and the absence of close relatives .", "On DATE , at the initiative of the first applicant , the second applicant left GPE with his maternal grandmother , who then assumed the care for the second applicant in the GPE . This was before her conviction and sentence had gained legal force and before the NORP authorities had taken a stance on where the first applicant should serve her sentence . The prosecution , for its part , had in a letter of DATE to the prison authorities expressed the view that , since she was a NORP national without any links to GPE , the service of the sentence should not be postponed ; otherwise she would have to remain in detention on remand . Although there was no general agreement about the serving of sentences between the GPE and GPE , the prosecution was not opposed to the first applicant serving the sentence in her home country .", "The first applicant was allowed to call ( free of charge ) her mother and son for TIME a week , in accordance with the applicable rules . On DATE she sought to have the time extended . Her request was rejected by the Prison Director on DATE , which decision was upheld by ORG on DATE , as there were no extraordinary circumstances to warrant an extension of the time offered . As of CARDINAL DATE , she was granted an extra call per week at her own expense .", "As of DATE , the first applicant was transferred to a wing with a more lenient regime , on a contractual basis of good behaviour . Thereafter , there was no time restriction on her use of the telephone .", "On DATE the first applicant requested a pardon from ORG , which request was rejected . It was observed that the condition of her health and the interests of the mother and child in being reunited could not outweigh the interest of avoiding giving an undesirable signal with respect to the use of pregnant women as drug couriers . Her subsequent appeal against this refusal was successful , having regard to her depressive and psychotic mental state and concerns about the child \u2019s future care and development . The first applicant was released on DATE and returned to the GPE where she reunited with her son . In the meantime , she had several times been visited in the prison by her son and mother who had come from the GPE .", "Prior to being pardoned , the first applicant had already brought proceedings against the ORG seeking a declaration ( fastsettelsess\u00f8ksm\u00e5l ) of a violation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , as well as compensation . Her claim was rejected by ORG ( byrett ) in DATE and dismissed by ORG in DATE , which decision was upheld by ORG of ORG in DATE . She then sought compensation under a different procedure , requesting an executory judgment ( fullbyrdelsess\u00f8ksm\u00e5l ) . By judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG above - mentioned judgment , as did ORG in a judgment on DATE .", "Before ORG , the first applicant unsuccessfully challenged the participation of CARDINAL of its judges , Mr Justice PERSON . The judge in question , who normally served as President of ORG , had as a temporary ( konstituert ) judge occupied a seat in ORG from DATE to DATE , vacated by a judge who had retired , and had replaced another judge on sabbatical leave from CARDINAL DATE to DATE . On each occasion , ORG had first inquired of him whether he might be willing to take on the assignment and , after he had given an affirmative answer , the King , sitting in ORG , had taken the decision to appoint him as a replacement judge for the period in question . At the material time PERSON had not applied for any vacant seat in ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
