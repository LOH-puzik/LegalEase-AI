The judge held that the applicant \u2019s detention was necessary because some further physical evidence had to be collected , and in order to prevent him from coordinating his defence with the second suspect , who was still at large .

The applicant considered that that was not possible , because according to the available information the second suspect lived in GPE and , given the media coverage of the proceedings at issue , it was unlikely that he would come to GPE .

It should be noted that that the suspects at issue were police officers who most certainly knew a lot of people and could therefore easily get in touch with the second suspect , ORG This risk could not be averted by the seizure of their passports , because they could travel to certain countries with their identity cards alone and could easily meet the second suspect somewhere else . The analysis of the telephone conversations shows that the fifth suspect [ PERSON ] previously contacted the second suspect and that therefore he more or less knows where to find him and how to reach him , while the sixth suspect is his colleague and friend , and [ therefore ] they could both get in touch with the second suspect without difficulty .
