SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , NORP GPE ( ORG ) , is a nationwide non - profit association open for membership to all serious , commercial airline companies . The second applicant , ORG , is a private limited airline company based in GPE and is a member of the applicant association . The applicants are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "ORG ( PERSON , hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) is a public utility , wholly - owned by ORG . The activities of the ORG are directed by the Government and subject to their decisions . The ORG operates CARDINAL airports in GPE and is responsible for , inter alia , air traffic services and air safety in the country . The aviation infrastructure is financed through charges levied by the ORG on the airline companies wanting to use ORG airports . CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s budget is financed by these traffic charges .", "The Government specify the economic goals and restrictions applicable to ORG authorities , such as the ORG , through so - called letters of regulation ( regleringsbrev ) , which are binding . The letter of regulation relevant to the instant case was issued by a Government decision dated DATE . It stipulated guidelines for , inter alia , the overall targets and the financial conditions of the ORG and specifically fixed the financial targets of the ORG for the period DATE . The letter also stipulated the following limitation on permissible increases in traffic charges :", "\u201c As a restriction on price increases , the traffic charges , excluding land routing charges , security charges and noise charges , must not increase on average over DATE more than the net price index , calculated as of DATE . \u201d", "Following consultations with NORP and foreign airline companies , the ORG , on DATE , decided to adopt a regulation which established new norms for air traffic charges at ORG airports ( MONEY Statutes of the ORG \u2013 Luftfartsverkets f\u00f6rfattningssamling DATE LFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . The regulation was published on DATE and entered into force on DATE .", "By a letter of DATE , the first applicant , on behalf of its members , filed an appeal with the Government against the decision of the ORG . It argued that the increase in air traffic charges amounted to PERCENT , which was too high having regard to the situation in the country with hardly any inflation and low interest rates . It also pointed out that the new charges heavily disadvantaged smaller aircraft , imposing on them relatively high price increases compared to heavier aircraft . The first applicant also stated that the airline companies had not had sufficient time to alter their customer prices in line with the increase since the decision had been made by the ORG on DATE and had come into force already on DATE .", "The ORG submitted its comments to the Government in a letter dated DATE . The ORG initially stated that the appeal had been received on DATE and had thus been made in time . ( The stated date is obviously incorrect ; the correct date appears to have been CARDINAL DATE . )", "However , the ORG opposed the appeal since the increase in the charges was necessary to fulfil the financial demands imposed on the ORG . It stated that the total increase in charges amounted to PERCENT , which corresponded to an DATE increase in its income of MONEY ( SEK ) . The main increases had been made in relation to passenger charges , charges for local air flight services and the minimum charges for landing . The increase of the CARDINAL latter charges in relation to smaller aircraft had been compensated by introducing a new DATE landing card and by increasing the weight - limit for aircraft having to pay the local air flight charge . Furthermore , the lighter aircraft had experienced very little price increases DATE compared to the heavier aircraft .", "The ORG further reiterated that the Government had imposed a limit on the charge increase corresponding to the net price index calculated from DATE . The increase in charges previously made DATE had , however , been below this limit ; the ORG had in fact lowered prices by PERCENT during this period . The current increase was therefore well within the scope of possible increases accumulated over DATE .", "In a letter dated DATE , the first applicant submitted to the Government its comments on the ORG \u2019s position . It stated that the introduction of the DATE landing card for the lighter aircraft , whilst commendable , was of minor importance since CARDINAL aircraft in the country could benefit from it . It conceded that , in DATE , the ORG had charged less than the authorised price increases . However , it found it remarkable that the ORG relied on the cumulative effect of the price ceiling \u2019s shortfall over DATE to justify a steep increase in the charges now .", "On DATE the first applicant further submitted that the net price index had fallen heavily since DATE and had , during certain periods , almost reached the DATE level . The scope for increasing the charges had thus gradually been reduced . Furthermore , a large part of the increase concerned charges restricted by the ORG \u2019s letter of regulation , and the increase in those charges clearly exceeded the development of the net price index . The first applicant also stated that the real increase in charges was in fact greater than that mentioned by the ORG , since infrastructure costs should also be considered a traffic charge .", "The ORG submitted to the Government on DATE that it had not overstepped the price ceiling set by the Government and that the infrastructure charges were to be excluded from the calculation of the increases complying with the price ceiling .", "The first applicant responded , in submissions to the Government on DATE , that the ORG \u2019s letter of regulation did not provide for the possibility of accumulating the DATE increases , as the ORG had done , and that the increase in air traffic charges clearly exceeded the development of the net price index during the given period .", "On DATE the Government dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal for the following reasons :", "\u201c Under LAW of the LAW ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) with Instructions for the ORG , the decisions of the ORG in matters other than personnel issues are subject to appeal only if expressly stated . The instant appeal concerns a decision on the issue of regulations , as provided for in chapter CARDINAL of ORG [ Regeringsformen ] . There is no provision stating that an appeal lies against such a decision of the ORG . The appeal will not therefore be examined . \u201d", "The ORG is a public utility and part of the ORG administration . It does not own its assets but merely administers them for the ORG . As opposed to other public authorities , a utility is a self - financing unit conducting business , and is run on principles of corporate finance . Under section CARDINAL of the Ordinance with Instructions for the ORG ( F\u00f6rordningen med instruktion f\u00f6r PERSON , DATE , hereinafter \u201c the CAA Ordinance \u201d ) , applicable at the material time , the ORG is defined as a central public authority with the overall responsibility for civil aviation .", "The Government decide upon the conditions for the individual ORG authorities through ordinances and DATE letters of regulation . The letters of regulation set out , inter alia , the goals to be achieved by the authority , the funding at the authority \u2019s disposal and the way that funding should be distributed among its different activities .", "LAW , LAW ( ORG , ORG ) provides that the ORG , or an authority designated by the ORG , may issue regulations concerning charges for the use of public airports or other public facilities or services for air traffic . While the air traffic charges originally were set by the ORG , the competence to do so was , of DATE , delegated to the ORG through an amendment ( section CARDINAL ) to LAW , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . These CARDINAL provisions constituted the legal basis for the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE to adopt its regulation on new air traffic charges .", "As regards the right to appeal , section CARDINAL of the CAA Ordinance provided the following :", "\u201c The decisions of the ORG in personnel matters are subject to appeal to the Government , [ unless otherwise stated ] ...", "The decisions of the ORG concerning the enrolment for education in the air traffic control service are not subject to appeal . The decisions of the ORG in other matters are subject to appeal only if", "CARDINAL . NORP this follows from a provision other than section CARDINAL(a ) of LAW [ ORG , CARDINAL ] , or", "CARDINAL . a provision specifically refers to section CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW .", "If the matter concerns the exercise of public authority in respect of an individual and there are no specific provisions on appeal , the decision is nevertheless subject to appeal to the Government . \u201d", "The Public Administration Act applies to the handling of matters by the administrative public authorities and to the courts\u2019 handling of administrative matters ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Under LAW of the LAW , a decision may be appealed by the person whom the decision concerns , provided that it has affected him or her adversely and is subject to an appeal .", "Under LAW ( a ) , appeals lie to the administrative courts . However , this does not apply to decisions in administrative matters or in matters concerning the adoption of regulations ( normgivnings\u00e4renden ) , as provided for in chapter CARDINAL of ORG ( Regeringsformen ) . If there is a specific provision in another LAW providing for an appeal , that provision will have precedence .", "Section CARDINAL provides that an appeal shall be made , within DATE , to the authority which issued the impugned decision . According to section DATE , that authority shall examine whether the appeal has been submitted in time . If it has been submitted in time , the appeal and the case - file are forwarded to the authority empowered to examine the appeal .", "LAW contains provisions on laws and other regulations , stating the areas which may be regulated only by law and the areas which may also be regulated by other provisions , as well as the competence of ORG or the ORG to delegate the power to issue regulations to the authorities or the municipalities .", "The term \u201c exercise of public authority \u201d ( myndighetsut\u00f6vning ) is used in many laws and regulations , including ORG , LAW , LAW ORG ) and LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . According to the preparatory works of ORG ( prop . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) and LAW ( prop . CARDINAL , p.
