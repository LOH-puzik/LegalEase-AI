The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE in ORG and lives in PERSON , in the GPE of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . After originally training to be a hairdresser the applicant took up DATE work as a shop assistant . In DATE she was forced to stop work owing to back trouble .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG of the GPE of PERSON ( \u201c the Office \u201d ) for a disability benefit on account of her lower back and spinal pain .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she gave birth to twins . Her back pain had worsened further during the pregnancy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG carried out a household assessment ( GPE ) at the applicant \u2019s home , during which the applicant stated", "( i ) that she suffered from constant back pain which often extended down to her left foot ; that she had particular difficulty standing in the same place for any length of time and could not remain seated for TIME ; that she could walk for TIME , but not on a DATE basis ; and that the pain became worse when she was carrying the children ;", "( ii ) that she would have to work half - time for financial reasons since her husband \u2019s net salary was MONEY ( CHF ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "The report on the assessment concluded that the applicant \u2019s capacity to perform household tasks was reduced by PERCENT .", "In its report dated DATE the ORG found that the applicant should be classified", "( i ) as a person in full - time paid employment ( PERSON ) up to the end of DATE ;", "( ii ) as a housewife ( ORG ) DATE ;", "( iii ) as a person theoretically capable of PERCENT ( zu CARDINAL PERCENT hypothetisch PERSON ) as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON . GPE informed the ORG that the applicant was unable to work CARDINAL - time in a suitable occupation and that any increase in TIME appeared to be ruled out .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG found that the applicant should be granted a benefit for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , but did not qualify for any benefit from DATE .", "The ORG arrived at this result by the following means .", "With regard to the period from DATE until DATE , it assessed the applicant \u2019s degree of disability at PERCENT on the basis of a calculation of her income .", "As to the subsequent period , the ORG considered that the socalled combined method should be applied , taking the view that even if she had not had a disability the applicant would have reduced her working hours following the birth of her children . It based that finding , in particular , on the applicant \u2019s assertion that she felt able to work CARDINAL - time and wished to devote the remainder of her time to her household tasks and her children . Furthermore , on the basis of the household assessment referred to above , the ORG estimated the applicant \u2019s capacity to perform household tasks at PERCENT ( that is to say , her degree of disability at PERCENT ) . When the formula set out below was applied , the degree of disability obtained on the basis of these various factors was PERCENT , meaning that the applicant did not reach the minimum PERCENT degree of disability needed to trigger entitlement to a benefit :", "CARDINAL % ( paid employment ) : no loss of earnings CARDINAL x CARDINAL % = PERCENT", "CARDINAL % ( household tasks and childcare ) : CARDINAL x CARDINAL % = CARDINAL %", "Total = PERCENT", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint with the ORG , which was dismissed on DATE . Following a fresh calculation the ORG recognised the applicant as having a PERCENT disability , still below the minimum required in order to qualify for a benefit .", "This figure was obtained by applying the combined method , using the following parameters :", "CARDINAL % ( paid employment ) : PERSON x CARDINAL % = CARDINAL %", "PERCENT ( household tasks and childcare ) : CARDINAL x CARDINAL % = CARDINAL %", "Total = CARDINAL %", "In completing the first line of the formula , the ORG took as a basis a hypothetical income ( for full - time work ) of CHF MONEY ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , calculated on the basis of the statistical data for the socioprofessional category to which the applicant , as an auxiliary worker ( Hilfsarbeiterin ) , belonged . Working at a rate of PERCENT , the applicant would therefore have had a salary of CHF CARDINAL if she had been able to continue working without any difficulty ( Valideneinkommen ) . The ORG estimated that , given her disability , the salary which the applicant would actually be able to earn in a suitable occupation would be CHF CARDINAL ( Invalideneinkommen ) . It therefore assessed the applicant \u2019s degree of disability in respect of the \u201c paid employment \u201d component at PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision .", "Relying on LAW , read in conjunction with LAW , the applicant argued that", "( i ) the method applied discriminated against the less well - off , as those persons who could afford not to do paid work were classified simply as housewives and could therefore be recognised as having a higher degree of disability and thus qualify more easily for a benefit ;", "( ii ) the way in which the degree of disability was calculated did not take sufficient account of the interplay ( PERSON ) between the \u201c household \u201d and \u201c paid employment \u201d components ;", "( iii ) in reality , even if she only worked half - time , her degree of disability for the purposes of performing household tasks would increase well beyond PERCENT as a result .", "CARDINAL . In support of her appeal the applicant submitted a medical report issued by PERSON . GPE on DATE , in which the latter stated in substance that , in view of her state of health , the applicant could not engage in paid work on a CARDINAL - time basis in the same way as someone without a disability , and that if she had to take up paid employment , her capacity to take care of the household and of her children would drop to PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of the GPE of PERSON allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal in part .", "In a departure from the case - law of ORG ... , it considered that the usual application of the combined method should be disregarded in favour of an \u201c improved \u201d version . In the court \u2019s view , the basis for calculation should be the level of activity which the applicant might reasonably have resumed after the birth of her twins if she had not had health problems .", "ORG found that the \u201c household \u201d component of the combined method , as that method was applied in ORG caselaw , did not take sufficient account of the person \u2019s disability .", "According to the court , the ORG had not taken into consideration the fact that the applicant could only take care of the household on a CARDINAL - time basis , and had incorrectly calculated her incapacity for work on the basis of TIME working day .", "Instead of taking as a basis the household assessment \u2013 which , in ORG view , should be applicable only to individuals who were engaged full - time in caring for the household \u2013 the ORG should have examined the applicant \u2019s actual capacity to perform household tasks , which had been established by a doctor .", "The court also criticised the ORG for not examining whether , if she had been in good health , the applicant would have been able to engage in paid work after the birth of her children . In particular , it noted that the report drawn up following the household assessment gave scant information as to the work entailed for the applicant in caring for her children ( ORG ) and whether or not any possibilities existed for entrusting part of their care to other persons . As these factors had not been taken into consideration by the ORG , the applicant \u2019s degree of disability had been established on the basis of an incomplete set of facts . The court also considered it unlikely that the applicant would have worked only halftime if she had been in good health , given her husband \u2019s modest salary and what she could reasonably expect to earn as a hairdresser or auxiliary worker . The household assessment therefore appeared to be deficient in that respect also .", "Consequently , ORG remitted the case to the ORG for further investigation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG lodged an appeal against the ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( CARDINALC_CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG allowed the ORG \u2019s appeal , finding that the applicant was not eligible for a benefit .", "In its reasoning ORG began by describing the context in which it viewed the case , stating that", "( i ) the aim of disability insurance was to provide cover for insured persons against the risk of becoming unable , for medical reasons , to carry on a paid occupation or perform household tasks which they had actually been able to carry out before becoming disabled and would still be able to perform if the event triggering the disability had not occurred ;", "( ii ) the aim was not to provide compensation in respect of activities which the insured persons would never have carried out even if they had remained in good health ;", "( iii ) this approach was designed to prevent situations in which , for instance , individuals who were well - off and had never previously worked could be recognised as having a disability if they developed health problems , even though they would probably never have worked had they remained in good health .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG considered that the combined method was not discriminatory . It found as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... It is true that the combined method , as applied by the [ ORG in its settled case - law , may result in a loss of benefit where the insured person is DATE generally on account of the birth of a child \u2013 to cease paid employment , at least on a full - time basis . However , it is not the disability that [ then ] causes the loss of income ; many people in good health also suffer a loss of income when they reduce their TIME or stop working . The criticism of the combined method is directed at the fact that individuals ( mostly women ) suffer a drop in earnings when they reduce their working TIME after having children . Nevertheless , this sociological reality is not the result of factors linked to the person \u2019s health and should not therefore be covered by the disability insurance scheme . It does not give rise to any discrimination or other breach of LAW . \u201d", "Nevertheless , ORG conceded that the interplay between the \u201c household \u201d and \u201c paid employment \u201d aspects was not taken sufficiently into account in the combined method . With regard to the applicant , however , it found", "( i ) that the aggravation of her health problems as a result of her paid work should not be regarded as reducing her capacity to perform household tasks by PERCENT ;", "( ii ) that , accordingly , even taking the interplay in question into account , the applicant \u2019s degree of disability did not reach PERCENT minimum required in order to qualify for a benefit :", "CARDINAL % ( paid employment ) : PERSON x CARDINAL % = CARDINAL %", "PERCENT ( household tasks ) : CARDINAL x ( MONEY PERCENT ) = PERCENT", "Total = CARDINAL %", "The argument that her husband was unemployed , which was raised by the applicant for the first time before ORG , was rejected on the grounds that it had not been relied upon in the court below and was not substantiated .", "However , ORG granted the applicant legal aid in view of her lack of means .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
