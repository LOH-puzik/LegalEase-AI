The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed burglary and having handled stolen goods . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) ordered that he be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question while acting in an organised criminal group , the severity of the anticipated sentence and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . The latter ground was based on the risk that , once released , he might tamper with evidence . The applicant 's appeal against the decision was dismissed on DATE by ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention . It reiterated the grounds originally given for keeping him in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL coaccused were indicted before ORG . On DATE the trial court held the first hearing .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant 's detention was on several occasions prolonged . The relevant decisions were given on , inter alia , CARDINAL June , CARDINAL DATE and DATE and DATE , CARDINAL May and DATE . The court considered that the proper course of the proceedings could only be secured by keeping the applicant in detention given the fact that he had been charged with membership of an organised , armed criminal group . Furthermore , the trial court had actively been taking evidence from coaccused , witnesses and expert witnesses , the process of which could have been disturbed by the applicant 's release .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicant made repeated , but unsuccessful , applications for release . He also appealed , likewise unsuccessfully , against refusals to release him and decisions prolonging his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG informed the detention centre that it would not make an application to ORG to prolong further the applicant 's detention on the ground that it had found no exceptional circumstances under LAW to justify such a request . The applicant , however , was not released as he was still required to remain in pre - trial detention on the charge of armed robbery ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . This set of proceedings is apparently still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed armed robbery while acting in an organised criminal group .

ORG and ORG several times prolonged his detention pending the conclusion of the investigation . The relevant decisions were given on DATE and DATE and on DATE . The last of those decisions extended the applicant 's detention until DATE . The courts considered that , given that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed serious offences , voluminous expert evidence needed to be obtained . For that reason , he should be kept in detention in order to secure the proper conduct of the investigation . They also held that that measure was justified by the severity of the sentence that might be imposed and the complex nature of the charges .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant had been indicted on charges of armed robbery , arson and burglary . The bill of indictment comprised CARDINAL charges brought against CARDINAL accused . The CARDINAL main accused were charged with CARDINAL and CARDINAL offences respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG severed the charges against the accused , holding that they should be determined in CARDINAL separate trials . CARDINAL of the reasons given was that the court did not have at its disposal a court room to try CARDINAL accused at the same time . The charges concerning burglary and arson were examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made an application under LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego ) to ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) , asking that the applicant 's detention be prolonged beyond the statutory timelimit of DATE until DATE . ORG relied on the complexity of the case and the fact that , following the severance order , CARDINAL accused were to be tried simultaneously .", "CARDINAL . ORG granted that application on DATE , fully upholding the grounds given for it . It added that the applicant 's detention was particularly justified by the severity of the sentence that might be imposed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held the first hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for release .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant 's pre - trial detention was prolonged on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted by ORG in the proceedings concerning the charges of burglary and arson and was given a DATE prison sentence . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of armed robbery and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Afterwards the applicant 's detention was prolonged .

On DATE the applicant complained that a letter from the ORG , dated DATE , which included an application form , had been opened and controlled by ORG . That letter had been delivered to him at DATE . The front part of the envelope provided by the applicant bears a handwritten note : \u201c censored \u201d ( cenzurowano ) and an illegible signature .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , defines detention on remand as CARDINAL of the socalled \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( \u015brodki zapobiegawcze ) .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that the lawyer of a detained person should be informed of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision is to be taken concerning the prolongation of detention on remand .", "CARDINAL .
