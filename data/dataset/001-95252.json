She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and Mr GPE , lawyers practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , State Attorney - General .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , a teacher , was injured at work while accompanying a group of schoolchildren on a skiing excursion to the Pohorje mountain plateau .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she submitted a claim to the Z.M. insurance company ( \u201c the insurance company \u201d ) , with which her employer had taken out liability insurance , for payment of compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The insurance company refused the payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted compensation proceedings in ORG , ORG ( PERSON sodi\u0161\u010de v Mariboru , Enota na Ptuju ) , claiming a total amount of CARDINAL NORP tolars ( SIT \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) for the non - pecuniary damage sustained , and default interest with effect from the date of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Okro\u017eno sodi\u0161\u010de na Ptuju ) gained jurisdiction in the present case further to the reform of the NORP judicial system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held in the absence of the defendant , who had been properly summoned , and the applicant gave evidence . At the hearing the applicant reduced the amount of her claim to SIT CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ORG ) since the insurance did not provide for a higher cover .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court upheld the applicant \u2019s reduced claim in the amount of SIT CARDINAL . It also awarded the applicant default interest with the effect from the date of its judgment . The insurance company appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) upheld the appeal and remitted the case to the first - instance court for re - examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a hearing , at which the applicant modified her claim and requested the payment of default interest with effect from DATE the damage had occurred , more precisely from DATE , the date of the expiry of the deadline within which the applicant considered that the insurance company was required to fulfil its obligations under the insurance contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court allowed the claim in the amount of SIT CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage and default interest from DATE of the judgment , but rejected the part of the claim concerning the payment of default interest from DATE to DATE . Both parties appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second - instance court dismissed both appeals . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly allowed the appeal and awarded the applicant default interest also for the period from DATE until DATE , that is , with effect from the date on which the first - instance court had delivered its first judgment in the case . However , it rejected the claim for default interest from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "In this connection it referred to well - established jurisprudence , which in the case of compensation for non - pecuniary damage did not allow default interest to be calculated from the date on which the damage had occurred , but only from the date of the first - instance court judgment . The court also referred to the LAW , which was in force at the material time and which , in the opinion of the court , formed the current legal basis for this practice . Furthermore , ORG recapitulated the reasons for adopting such an approach . It argued that it had been adopted since DATE owing to the unstable economic situation in the country and the high inflation rate and monetary depreciation in particular . In order to preserve the real value of a pecuniary obligation , default interest had also included interest for adjustment of a debt . However , since in the case of claims for compensation for non - pecuniary damage the preservation of the real value of the debt had already been ensured by determining the amount of compensation only on the date of the judgment , the compensation due to the applicant would have been adjusted twice if she were also awarded default interest for this period of time , which in the opinion of the court was unacceptable . Finally , ORG concluded that the current economic circumstances did not yet warrant a change in the case - law in question ( see also \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG ( PERSON sodi\u0161\u010de ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal by the applicant inadmissible as being of a fourth - instance nature . It held that ORG had given a sound and detailed explanation of why the contested jurisprudence had been adopted and followed up to the present day , and that there was no appearance of arbitrariness whatsoever in ORG decision or in the decisions of the lower courts . Since it did not find any violation of human rights , it dismissed the constitutional appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decision was served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
