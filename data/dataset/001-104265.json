NORP The applicant company , a public broadcasting corporation serving ORG in GPE , produced a long - running DATE news and investigation programme called Au nom de la loi ( \u201c In the name of the law \u201d ) , focusing in particular on legal matters in the broad sense of the term . The programme was described as follows on the PERSON website :", "\u201c Right from the start , Au nom de la loi sought to operate on the basis of CARDINAL main principles : standing up for the underdog , so that ordinary citizens were always given a say , and looking for the hidden agenda , so that its journalists\u2019 investigative skills came to the fore . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON , a specialist neurosurgeon , ran a neurosurgery practice together with a colleague , including an on - call service at ORG . A number of NORP newspapers , both regional ( ORG in DATE and DATE ) and national ( ORG in DATE and La Derni\u00e8re Heure in CARDINAL articles DATE ) , reported on complaints by various patients who had been operated on by PERSON CARDINAL of the articles mentioned his name . According to information provided by the parties , none of the articles prompted any reaction on the doctor \u2019s part .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company subsequently decided to devote a segment of its programme Au nom de la loi to medical risks and , more generally , communication and information problems encountered by patients and the rights available to them , using as an example the complaints by PERSON patients as reported in the press .", "CARDINAL . While preparing the programme , journalists from the applicant company contacted a number of patients , medical specialists , representatives of ORG ) and PERSON himself . The doctor refused to give a televised interview but agreed to answer questions from the applicant company \u2019s journalists during a series of meetings lasting TIME , in the presence of his lawyers . The programme was scheduled to be broadcast on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a summons served on DATE , PERSON instituted proceedings against the applicant company before the President of ORG , as the judge responsible for hearing urgent applications . He sought an injunction preventing the broadcast of the programme in question , with a penalty of MONEY each time it was shown on a television channel . In the alternative , should the injunction not be granted immediately , he sought an order requiring a videotape of the programme to be made available for advance viewing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG granted an interim injunction preventing the programme in question from being broadcast , with a penalty of MONEY each time it was shown on a NORP television channel ; the injunction was to remain in place until a decision was given on the merits , provided that the claimant himself instituted proceedings on the merits within DATE of the injunction , failing which it would cease to have effect .", "CARDINAL . The injunction stated that there was no cause , on the face of it , to doubt the good faith and professionalism of the applicant company \u2019s journalists or the objective nature of their investigations , and that the claimant had a number of remedies by which to seek redress ex post facto for the damage sustained . It concluded that an application for prior restraint should not be granted unless it was established with certainty that the scheduled broadcast would damage the claimant \u2019s honour and reputation .", "CARDINAL . The injunction noted that it was not disputed that the complaints of the patients whom the applicant company intended to feature in the programme had yet to be considered by any court . As matters stood , no judicial proceedings had even been brought in respect of most of the complaints . Furthermore , professional confidentiality , which PERSON had cited as his reason for refusing an interview , meant that he would be unable to give adequate answers , and his silence would at the very least raise doubts among the public as to his professional ability .", "CARDINAL . The injunction further pointed out that neurosurgery and the post - operative complications to which it might lead were complex matters and that , as a result , regard should be had to the difficulty in conveying an understanding of the subject to a non - specialist audience in a feature lasting TIME .", "CARDINAL . The court did not view the programme before giving its ruling . Dr PERSON had requested that a videotape of the programme be made available for viewing by the court \u2019s President , but the applicant company , in both its written and oral submissions , refused to accede to the request .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON arranged for the injunction of DATE to be served DATE at TIME", "CARDINAL . In the event , the programme was not in fact cancelled , but the feature on the alleged medical errors by PERSON was replaced by a discussion between a journalist and the programme \u2019s producer . During the discussion and the preceding news broadcast , the applicant company commented at length on the injunction of DATE , describing it as judicial censorship of press freedom . PERSON name was mentioned several times . On DATE PERSON requested a right of reply , but the applicant company refused his request in a registered letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed to ORG against the injunction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON instituted proceedings on the merits against the applicant company in ORG , concerning the same subject matter as his urgent application . At the preliminary hearing the case was adjourned until further notice with a view to its preparation . By DATE on which the application was lodged with the ORG , the proceedings were still pending .", "CARDINAL . In an interlocutory judgment of DATE , ORG , ruling on the appeal against the injunction , held that LAW was not applicable in the case as it related only to the print media and not the audio - visual media , and that neither LAW nor LAW prohibited restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression , provided that they had a basis in law . It observed that LAW , which guaranteed the right to respect for private life , together with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code , constituted the law in this regard and empowered the urgent - applications judge to order restrictions on freedom of expression as a preventive measure in \u201c cases of flagrant violations of the rights of others \u201d . In the present case the press release announcing the programme had given reason to believe that the broadcast might damage PERSON honour and reputation and interfere with his private life .", "CARDINAL . ORG also ordered the resumption of the proceedings and directed the applicant company to produce the recording of the programme in issue .", "CARDINAL . It noted in that connection that \u201c since prior restraints on freedom of expression entail considerable dangers , intervention by the urgent - applications judge will have ... democratic legitimacy only if it is limited to cases of flagrant violations of the rights of others \u201d , and held that the way in which the applicant company had \u201c announced and described the programme in question indicated its intention to cause unnecessary harm to the honour , reputation and private life of [ the respondent ] through public disclosure of information that was inaccurate , unverified or lacking in objectivity \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A screening of the programme took place at a hearing on DATE . Besides the extracts from interviews with CARDINAL patients who considered that they had reason to complain about PERSON , the programme comprised : an interview with a medical specialist , who explained the medical problem encountered and the anomalies found in the ORG medical records ; PERSON replies to these comments ; extracts from interviews with specialists ( a doctor belonging to ORG , a lawyer specialising in medical law , and a ORG official ) ; and , lastly , footage of a neurosurgical operation , with comments by another doctor .", "CARDINAL . In a second judgment , delivered on DATE , ORG declared the applicant company \u2019s appeal unfounded . It held that broadcasting the scheduled programme would be likely to damage Dr PERSON \u2019s honour and reputation , thereby causing him serious non - pecuniary harm and , as a result , significant pecuniary loss . It concluded that the preventive measure of a ban had met a pressing social need , had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and had been based on relevant and sufficient grounds .", "CARDINAL . More specifically , ORG observed that the programme included footage of a series of interviews with patients on whom PERSON had performed surgery , involving a total of CARDINAL operations . The interviews were interspersed with explanatory comments : PERSON discussed the specific cases , the journalist who had spoken to PERSON conveyed the answers he had received from him , a ORG representative discussed patients\u2019 rights and the difficulties faced by doctors working at several different sites in remaining available to see them , a lawyer explained GPE legal rights , and a senior adviser to ORG outlined the legislative initiatives being taken to ensure better protection for patients .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the part of the programme concerning the CARDINAL operations and their consequences was significantly more important than the part informing the audience about patients\u2019 rights vis - \u00e0 - vis their doctor . It took the view that the clarification provided by the journalist during the programme , namely \u201c [ s]o , was there a medical error or not ? ... We can only ask the question ; we can not give the answer \u201d , was unlikely to draw the audience \u2019s attention to the fact that there was no conclusive proof of a medical error . It further noted that there had been no mention of the experience of satisfied patients , and that there was no evidence that the CARDINAL situations discussed were representative of the experiences of PERSON patients as a whole . It observed that the applicant company had not referred to any other \u201c serious \u201d complaint registered by ORG ) , and held that the CARDINAL experiences perceived as failures by the patients did not represent a sufficient number to justify targeting PERSON in a programme relating to patients\u2019 rights in the event of medical errors or negligence . This number appeared all the more insufficient as CARDINAL lawsuit had been brought against the doctor concerned . In addition , ORG noted that the operations referred to had been very different in nature , so that it was unreasonable to consider them all together , causing the audience to think that they revealed a common pattern of malpractice , which the average viewer , not being aware of the complexity of each individual case , might have tended to do .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG acknowledged that the programme in issue raised serious matters of public concern since it discussed the rights which patients could assert vis - \u00e0 - vis their doctor , and since there was nothing to suggest that the interviewees had not given an accurate account of their own experiences . However , it considered that the applicant company had lacked objectivity and had not taken into account the manner in which the average viewer was likely to perceive the information , and concluded that the applicant company could not rely on freedom of the press in arguing that the surgery performed by PERSON deserved to be brought to the public \u2019s attention for consumer - protection purposes by giving dissatisfied patients the opportunity to air their views in a programme concerning ORG rights . In particular , it stated the following :", "\u201c While it is clear that the programme in issue raises serious matters of public concern since it discusses the rights which patients may assert vis - \u00e0 - vis their doctor , complaints by patients concerning the quality of treatment provided by a particular surgeon can not be of interest to the community as a whole unless it can be established with sufficient certainty from the evidence available that the activities of the doctor in question entail serious health consequences .", "Quite apart from the fact that there do not , on the face of it , appear to be a significant number of complaints against [ Dr PERSON ] , it has not been established that they are legitimate .", "There is nothing in the material produced to date by ORG to support the conclusion that the interviewees have reasonable grounds to believe that they were not given the necessary or appropriate treatment , or that their accounts correspond to the objective truth ; this is not disputed by PERSON .", "The brief report by the medical adviser on the complaints submitted to ORG , which contains more questions than answers , can not serve as proof .", "No other investigative measures appear to have been taken or to have produced results .", "...", "Although there is nothing to suggest that the interviewees did not give an accurate account of their own experiences as perceived by them , the credibility that can be attached to the ORG or their relatives\u2019 accounts is not sufficient , in the absence of conclusive evidence of medical errors or negligence , to justify putting these complaints together to form the main theme of a programme that places [ PERSON ] in the spotlight and accuses him of professional incompetence and negligence in all respects of his practice ( pre - operative counselling , quality of the operation , post - operative follow - up ) .", "It should also be noted that the programme lacks objectivity in that the journalist \u2019s comments are systematically aimed at reinforcing or provoking criticism of [ Dr PERSON ] .", "...", "Public confidence in a doctor \u2019s ability can be destroyed by a television programme that conveys the experiences of a few of his patients or their relatives where , as in the present case , all the experiences reported on are perceived negatively , the opinions expressed during the programme by medical specialists suggest that the surgery performed was unnecessary or inappropriate , there is no coverage of the experiences of satisfied patients and no mention of whether the surgery was of a delicate or routine nature , the degree of risk each operation entailed and the number of operations carried out by the doctor during the relevant period , and no information is provided as to the average failure rates of the types of surgery concerned .", "The damage that could potentially be caused by broadcasting the programme would be exacerbated by the fact that the programme is broadcast during prime time , it ... enjoys a serious reputation and , as a result , the audience will naturally be inclined to believe not only that the interviewees have objective reasons to complain about [ Dr PERSON ] but also that they represent a significant sample of his patients . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed on points of law against the CARDINAL judgments of ORG . It alleged a violation of ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL of the Convention and Articles DATE , DATE and DATE of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its first ground of appeal it contended that the judgment appealed against , in finding that the first paragraph of LAW did not apply to television programmes , had breached the provision in question . It submitted that at a time when radio and television reached a much wider audience than the print media , excluding the former from the scope of LAW amounted to depriving that Article of its essential element , namely protection of the freedom to impart ideas as opposed to the instrument used for that purpose . It added that , while it was true that freedom to express opinions was not absolute , it could not be subject to prior restraints but only to punitive measures . There should at the very least have been an opportunity to express the opinion , as the actual wording of LAW indicated ( \u201c when this freedom is used \u201d ) . The applicant company inferred from this that LAW did not allow the authorities to subject the free expression of opinions on any subject to prior scrutiny , or to prohibit the broadcast of a television programme in advance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company submitted a second ground of appeal in the alternative , should it be found that LAW did not prohibit all prior restraints on the exercise of freedom of expression and that LAW paragraph , LAW paragraph , and ORG and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code , read in conjunction with LAW , constituted a \u201c law \u201d within the meaning of LAW . It argued that although LAW did not guarantee unrestricted freedom of expression , even with regard to media coverage of matters of serious public concern , and although the exercise of that freedom carried with it duties and responsibilities which were also applicable to the press and were liable to assume significance when there was a risk of undermining the reputation of private individuals or the rights of others , the mere interest \u2013 albeit undeniable \u2013 of the respondent in protecting his honour and professional reputation was not sufficient to prevail over the important public interest in preserving the freedom of the press to impart information on matters of legitimate public concern .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions , the Advocate - General recommended that ORG judgments be quashed . Following a thorough analysis of the case - law of ORG , the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG ( ORG ) , he submitted that LAW guaranteed freedom of expression in general , which could not be hindered by prior censorship . He nevertheless pointed out that such freedom was not absolute and could be limited by general restrictions prescribed by law , provided that the imperative requirements of LAW were satisfied . However , the wording of that Article made it impossible in his view to prohibit the dissemination of information on the basis of prior scrutiny , as such a measure would impair the very essence of freedom of expression . The Advocate - General observed that , in the particular context of freedom of expression , the courts\u2019 powers were limited by observance of LAW , which prohibited any preventive measure entailing prior restrictions on freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the Advocate - General added that since freedom of expression was not an absolute right , it could not prevail over or negate respect for the other rights and freedoms safeguarded by the LAW and international instruments . He noted in that connection that prior restrictions of a general nature could be framed in law , provided that they satisfied the requirements set forth in LAW . Lastly , he expressed the view that ORG and DATE of LAW and ORG DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code satisfied the accessibility and foreseeability requirements laid down by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , it upheld ORG judgment as regards the inapplicability of LAW , finding that television programmes were not forms of expression by means of printed matter . It held that the requirement for the applicant company to produce the recording of the programme in issue did not breach LAW since the urgent - applications judge had provisionally postponed the broadcast of the programme in order to ensure effective protection of the honour , reputation and private life of others . It further held that LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code , which it had interpreted consistently , allowed the restrictions provided for in LAW and were sufficiently precise to enable anyone , if need be with appropriate legal advice , to foresee the legal consequences of his or her acts .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c Under LAW , the judiciary is competent both to prevent and to redress unlawful infringements of civil rights .", "Similarly , the judge dealing with urgent applications , as in the present case , is empowered under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Judicial Code to take any provisional measures in respect of the person responsible for such an infringement that may be necessary to protect personal rights if there are prima facie legal grounds for doing so .", "In particular , where there is a serious threat of a violation of a right , the urgent - applications judge is authorised by LAW to order measures aimed at preventing such a violation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Secondly , ORG held as follows in relation to the objection that the applicant company \u2019s second ground of appeal was inadmissible in that it had failed to allege a violation of LAW :", "\u201c In upholding the respondent \u2019s claim , the impugned judgment of DATE finds that the respondent \u2018 has made out ... a sufficient prima facie case for obtaining an interim injunction prohibiting the broadcast of the programme in issue , which clearly and needlessly undermines his honour and reputation\u2019 .", "The urgent - applications judge may order interim measures if there are prima facie legal grounds for doing so .", "In merely examining the parties\u2019 prima facie rights without applying legal rules that could not form a reasonable basis for the interim measures ordered by him , the judge has not overstepped the limits of his powers .", "The appellant can not challenge ORG provisional assessment unless it alleges a violation of LAW , which it has not done . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Articles DATE , DATE , DATE ( former LAW ) and CARDINAL of the LAW are worded as follows :", "\u201c Freedom of worship , its public practice and freedom to manifest one \u2019s opinions on all matters are guaranteed , but offences committed when this freedom is used may be punished . \u201d", "\u201c Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , except in the cases and conditions provided for by law . ... \u201d", "\u201c The press is free ; censorship can never be introduced ; no payment of security can be demanded of authors , publishers or printers .", "Where the author is known and resident in GPE , neither the publisher , nor the printer nor the distributor may be prosecuted . \u201d", "\u201c Disputes about civil rights fall exclusively within the competence of the courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held :", "\u201c Neither television programmes nor cable broadcasts are forms of expression by means of printed matter ...

In a judgment of DATE , ORG ruled on the power of the ordinary courts to prevent , restrict or regulate the distribution of press publications .

In the case before it , the urgent - applications judge had issued an injunction DATE subsequently upheld both on an application by a third party to set it aside and on appeal \u2013 ordering the withdrawal from sale of all copies of the DATE magazine ORG which had published notes confiscated from a judge by the chairman of a parliamentary commission of inquiry on child disappearances ; ORG held that this did not amount to censorship because the publication had already been in circulation .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE , the President of ORG held that \u201c where individual freedoms are concerned , in particular freedom of expression , prohibition of all preventive measures is the rule .
