AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , an NORP national , was born in DATE and lived in GPE / PERSON . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant owned a plot of land in GPE / PERSON , on which a building from DATE is situated . The applicant lived in this building and ran a wine production and a distillery there . In DATE she obtained a permit under LAW ( ORG ) to construct a waste water disposal system on the property and to discharge waste water into a nearby stream .", "On DATE the GPE , without holding a hearing , ordered the applicant to connect her property to the newly constructed public sewerage system . It found that the conditions required by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( nieder\u00f6sterreichische GPE , \u201c the Building Act \u201d ) were met , namely , that the connecting canal between the border of the property and the public canal would be no longer than QUANTITY and that no pump appliance was necessary . It further noted that under section QUANTITY of the DATE LAW ( nieder\u00f6sterreichisches ORG property owners had the obligation to obtain the necessary building permit for the part of the canal situated on their property which they had to construct at their own cost . They were further obliged to carry out any necessary changes to the sewerage system of any building situated on the property at their own expense .", "The applicant , represented by counsel , appealed claiming that the municipality should have inspected her property and should have heard an expert on waste disposal . Further , she claimed that the obligation to connect her property to the public canal was at variance with the permit under LAW . Finally , she alleged that LAW would prohibit the discharge of waste water from her commercial enterprise to the public canal and that the costs of carrying out the necessary construction works , estimated at MONEY , would be excessive .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , sitting in camera , dismissed her appeal . It found that it followed from the existing files and maps that the requirements of section QUANTITY LAW were met and that the permit under LAW was not relevant for establishing the obligation to connect a property to the public sewerage system . As to the applicant \u2019s argument that she would have to bear excessive costs , it found that the above provision did not contain any general principle of proportionality .", "On DATE ORG ( nieder\u00f6sterreichische GPE ) , sitting in camera , dismissed the applicant \u2019s further appeal in which she had repeated her arguments . In particular , ORG found that the permit under LAW only gave the applicant a right to discharge waste water as long as this was not contrary to other legal obligations , such as the obligation to connect her property to the public canal . It further noted that the fulfilment of the legal requirements laid down in section LAW clearly followed from the existing files and maps , and found that the applicant had failed to show any need for the taking of further evidence .", "In her complaint to ORG ) the applicant again repeated her arguments and alleged in particular that the obligation to connect her property to the public canal violated her right to property . She maintained that LAW would prohibit the discharge of waste waters from her wine production and distillery to the public canal . She would therefore have to separate these waste waters which would entail excessive costs . The necessary changes would endanger DATE building .", "On DATE ORG refused to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint for lack of prospects of success and referred the case to ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint , rejecting at the same time her request for a hearing . As to the applicant \u2019s argument that the obligation to connect her property to the public canal was at variance with the permit under LAW , ORG , referring to ORG case - law , found that the discharge of waste water could be regulated under different aspects and that it was for the legislator to determine the cases in which a property owner was obliged to connect his property to the public canal . As to the applicant \u2019s argument that the authorities failed to inspect her property and to hear an expert on waste disposal , the applicant had , in her appeal , failed to challenge the first instance authority \u2019s finding of the facts according to which the conditions laid down in section CARDINAL LAW were met . Thus , the appellate authorities were not required to take further evidence . ORG held that it could abstain from an oral hearing pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW since the proceedings have been carried out accurately and the facts were undisputed .", "On DATE the applicant died . On DATE the applicant \u2019s husband , who inherited the estate , informed the ORG that he wished to pursue the application ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
