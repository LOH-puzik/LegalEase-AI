Extensive inquiries were therefore not necessary . No suggestions for more registered interpreters had been made prior to the applicant \u2019s application . Moreover , the keeping and updating of these lists required a considerable amount of administrative work which indicated that not all persons fulfilling the statutory conditions should be entered on the respective lists . The President also noted that a registered interpreter did not have any privileges compared to an unregistered interpreter , as any competent person could be called in concrete proceedings to act as an expert or interpreter . Any person speaking a foreign language could practise as an interpreter without registration , irrespective of whether he or she were appointed , on a case by case basis , by courts or administrative authorities , or were working as a free lance translator .

It observed that , in accordance with LAW , its jurisdiction was limited to applications alleging that a final administrative decision ( letztinstanzlicher PERSON ) had infringed the complainant \u2019s rights .
