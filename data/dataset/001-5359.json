{"ITEMID": "001-5359", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "BROOK v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant , who has run a company specialising in the research , design and manufacture of equipment for the broadcasting industry since DATE , wanted to set up a short wave radio station which would broadcast scientific , technological and media news . None of his proposed programmes had any political content , but were aimed at an audience interested in the technical side of radio . ORG has a short wave radio licence to broadcast in GPE and a few other independent stations are also licensed , for example , ORG .", "The applicant wrote to ORG on DATE ( having been told on the telephone that this was the relevant department ) to apply for a short wave radio licence . Over DATE , the applicant wrote CARDINAL letters in pursuit of his licence to ORG , ORG and other relevant entities . The ORG 's line of reply was to acknowledge the applicant 's interest without giving any definitive response to his request . On DATE , ORG wrote to the applicant saying :", "\" ... the ORG continues to consider the broadcasting policy issues which your proposal for the licensing of short wave frequencies has raised .", "I am sorry that there has been such a long interval since your original proposal was received and that you still await a decision . ...", "While I am sorry that the resolution of other domestic broadcasting policy issues have been given greater priority than your request to use short wave frequencies , I am not in a position to give you a firm decision on your proposal . ORG is , however , looking at your ideas and we are discussing them with ORG which has overall responsibility for the use of the radio spectrum .", "I shall write to you again when a decision has been taken . \"", "", "Following this letter , the applicant applied for judicial review of the failure by ORG to take a final decision . In his affidavit to ORG , the applicant explained that setting up a station would be a much more difficult prospect now and he would no longer wish to do so , but that this was only as a result of the ORG 's refusal to reach a clear decision at an early stage . Leave to apply was refused by ORG on DATE , there being no arguable basis for judicial review . Mr Justice PERSON , refusing leave , observed :", "\" Whilst I can understand your frustration at the failure of the authorities concerned to consider your proposals more favourably and speedily to the point where ( as I understand it ) it is now really too late to do anything , I am afraid I can see no arguable basis for judicial review . \"", "PERSON Relevant domestic law and practice", "ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) , has overall responsibility for the management of the civil electromagnetic spectrum in GPE , and an obligation to ensure that it is used efficiently . The ORG represents GPE at ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d \u2013 an agency of ORG ) , who order the way in which the radio spectrum can be shared effectively between nations , such that CARDINAL country \u2019s transmissions do not interfere with those of another . The ORG also has responsibility for deciding how the civil use of the radio spectrum in GPE is divided between different users , such as broadcasting , telecommunication , public safety services ( Police , Ambulance etc ) and hobby radio , etc .", "A quantity of the radio spectrum is allocated for radio broadcasting purposes . This is in turn divided by the Secretary of ORG ( under the provisions of ORG of DATE ) between the ORG ( the public service broadcaster ) and ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The ORG is a body established by statute ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) , and is responsible for licensing and regulating independent radio services within GPE . It has statutory duties to increase choice for different tastes and interests , to encourage range and diversity and to ensure fair and effective competition in the provision of sound broadcasting .", "All radio transmissions require either a licence or a licence exemption under LAW DATE ( as amended ) and , for commercial broadcasts , a licence under LAW of DATE . Licences are awarded by the ORG under open competition . In general terms national licences are considered on the basis of the highest cash bid , whereas the award of local licences takes into account the needs of the community to be served . The ORG seeks the agreement of the ORG and the ORG , so that neither GPE broadcasting services nor non - broadcasting users of the radio spectrum will be adversely affected . In addition the agreement of neighbouring countries is sought . After these negotiations , the ORG is able to issue a licence under LAW . This system of licensing does not extend to short wave frequencies .", "Under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , it is a criminal offence to provide an independent radio service without an appropriate licence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
