The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants owned a plot of land situated in GPE , near GPE . In DATE the applicants were informed by the local authorities that , pursuant to a local zoning plan , their land was to be expropriated as a construction of dwelling buildings was planned in its place .", "CARDINAL . The applicants requested ORG to be compensated by another plot of land . Their son also filed a request asking that a plot of land be allocated to him . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicants that their request could not be granted . On DATE the applicants ' son was informed that his request to be allocated a plot of land within the PERSON community was viewed favourably by ORG ( PERSON ) but could only be processed after the expropriation of his parents ' plot . In DATE the expropriation procedure commenced . In their letters the local authorities confirmed that after the expropriation of the applicants ' land an allocation of a plot of land within the PERSON community to the applicants ' son would become possible .", "CARDINAL . Eventually the applicants ' land was not expropriated but the applicants consented to a contract of sale . On DATE they transferred ownership of their land to ORG represented by ORG . They received the amount .", "CARDINAL . Following the sale they repeatedly inquired about the allocation of building land within the municipality but no steps were taken in order for the allocation to become effective and no decision as to the allocation was given .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants ' son was informed by ORG that the allocation of plots of land within the community had been conducted in violation of the law and in disregard of the principles of transparency . Therefore , the entire process was to be reviewed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants instituted proceedings against ORG represented by ORG . They requested ORG \u201c to oblige ORG to allot a plot of land to their son , as promised \u201d . ORG transferred the matter to ORG which rejected the claim finding that only the administrative authorities had jurisdiction in matters concerning expropriations and granting replacement plots . ORG upheld that decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a letter of complaint to ORG . On an unspecified date ORG transferred the letter to ORG . That court recognised that the applicants ' action should be interpreted as an action to revoke the contract of sale with ORG of DATE as they had consented to it on the mistaken belief that ORG would allocate a comparable plot of land to their son . On DATE ORG decided that , in view of fact that the value of the claim amounted to ORG ( old ) CARDINAL , a district court should examine the matter . The case was transferred to ORG . Subsequently , the applicants extended their claim and , on DATE , ORG transferred the case to ORG . On DATE the case was transferred back to ORG and that court examined the case . On DATE the first instance judgment was delivered . The court allowed the applicants ' claim finding that they had indeed acted on the assumption that the sale of their property had been the condition for the allocation of a new plot of land to their son and that that assumption had been prompted and maintained by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG , represented by ORG , filed an appeal . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the first - instance court for reconsideration . ORG - instance court and that although the applicants had indeed acted upon the promise that the applicants ' son would be allocated a plot of land , no time limit had been set for that . Therefore , the trial court was instructed , in particular , to examine whether the applicants ' son could still be allocated a plot of land .", "CARDINAL . Having reconsidered the case , on CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' action . It found that the transfer of the applicants ' plot of land to the ORG had been inevitable since it had been planned for expropriation . Thus , the applicants could not validly claim that they had relied on the promises that their son would be allocated another plot of land and that they had therefore been unduly induced to sign the contract .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants tried to obtain free legal aid in the proceedings . By a letter of DATE ORG informed the applicants that it was not competent to grant legal aid and that such a request should be addressed to a court .

On DATE , ORG appointed advocate G.P - R. to represent the applicants . On DATE G.P .- R. sent a letter to ORG requesting the Bar to discharge her of her duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants wrote a letter to the President of ORG in which they complained that despite the court 's decision granting them legal aid none of the attorneys appointed so far expressed any interest in their case . In response , the President of ORG instructed the applicants that they should address ORG directly . At the same time , the President also undertook to draw attention of ORG to the applicants ' problem . On DATE the applicants wrote to the President of ORG . They stated that their case was about to be examined by the secondinstance court for the second time and that they were at a significant disadvantage in comparison with the defendants , ORG , which was represented by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed advocate PERSON to represent the applicants . He met with the applicants in DATE and represented them at the hearing held before the appellate court on DATE .

In DATE ORG issued a resolution in reply to a legal question whether a legal aid lawyer could refuse to lodge a cassation appeal . It replied to the question in the positive .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that issues involved in the legal aid concerned not only proper administration of justice , but also touched on human rights , and a right of access to a court in particular . Nevertheless , there was no comprehensive and coherent regulation of legal aid available under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . The mere fact that it was necessary for a cassation appeal to be lodged by a qualified representative was not open to criticism . However , a certain conceptual confusion was to be noted in the provisions governing legal aid as a whole , mostly because the legislator had failed to harmonise the relevant provisions of civil and criminal procedure . In particular , the scope of legal aid lawyers ' obligations when legal representation was mandatory was not directly addressed by provisions of civil procedure . This was so partly because the essential body of law concerning civil procedure had been enacted in DATE , while the provisions on mandatory legal representation for the purposes of the cassation appeal had been introduced in DATE , when this new kind of appeal had been created .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the scope of legal aid lawyers ' obligations to provide a party to the proceedings with \u201c legal aid \u201d in civil proceedings was unclear . In particular , the provisions on the lawyers ' legal aid obligations in connection with cassation proceedings before ORG lacked clarity . The court noted that the judicial practice regarding the application of relevant provisions had given rise to serious difficulties of interpretation and discrepancies in the case - law of the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the issue of possible conflict between the opinion of a party granted legal aid and a lawyer assigned to represent him or her for the purpose of cassation proceedings had not been directly addressed by the applicable law . It further noted that the notion of legal assistance could not be identified with a simple obligation of a lawyer to act in accordance with the client 's wishes . The role of a legal aid lawyer had rather to be understood as obliging him or her to provide legal advice to the party , including as to the prospects of success offered by a cassation appeal against a given judgment .", "CARDINAL . The constitutional role of ORG , the highest judicial authority , was also an argument in favour of a conclusion that a legal aid lawyer was not compelled by the will of the party to have a cassation appeal lodged if such an appeal was bound to fail . In case of a disagreement between the party and the lawyer , it was open to the party to complain to the local Bar under LAW . The Bar could then appoint a new lawyer who could lodge a cassation appeal , requesting at the same time to be granted leave to appeal out of time under LAW . It was true that the practice of ORG was not coherent in that in some cases it had been rejecting such requests and in other it accepted them . However , it did not prevent the parties from having recourse to this course of action .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a party to the proceedings may ask for retrospective leave to perform a procedural measure outside the prescribed time - limit ; this measure shall be performed simultaneously with lodging the request .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure reads , insofar as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If a legal representative or a person authorised to receive court correspondence on behalf of a party has been appointed in a case , the court correspondence shall be served on these persons . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
