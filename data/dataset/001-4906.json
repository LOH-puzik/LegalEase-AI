He further advised to reject the second complaint on grounds that the rejection by ORG of this argument was based on its comprehensible assessment of the facts , which can not be further reviewed in cassation proceedings . As to the third complaint , the Procurator - General noted that this complaint had not been raised before the trial court and considered that this issue could not be raised for the first time in cassation proceedings as this would require an investigation of the conditions in which prison sentences imposed by courts in GPE are habitually executed .", "", "In its judgment of DATE , referring to LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) , ORG rejected the applicant 's complaints in cassation without stating any further reasons . It further did not find any grounds on the basis of which the judgment of DATE should be quashed ex officio .", "Article CARDINALa RO provides as follows :", "< Translation >", "\" If ORG considers that a complaint submitted can not lead to cassation and does not prompt a determination of legal issues in the interest of legal unity and legal development , it can limit itself to this finding when giving the reasons of its decision on that point . \""], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
