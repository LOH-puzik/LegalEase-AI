At the same time , the court decided to wait until the partial judgment became final before examining the applicant \u2019s claim for salary arrears . The relevant part of the partial judgment in question reads as follows :", "\u201c The decision of the defendant , LOC , ... of DATE on the termination of the plaintiff \u2019s [ the applicant \u2019s ] employment is hereby annulled ,", "... the defendant , LOC , is ordered to reinstate the plaintiff in his post ... and to acknowledge his employment - related rights ... , and to do so within DATE of this judgment becoming final ...", "On the remaining part of the claim and the [ claim for ] costs and expenses [ the court ] shall decide by a definitive [ i.e. later ] judgment . \u201d", "The judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE , and on the defendant on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defendant , represented by the GPE State Attorney \u2019s Office , appealed against the partial judgment . The applicant received a copy of that appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , after having submitted several written requests for reinstatement to LOC without success , on DATE the applicant wrote to the President of ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u Vukovaru ) seeking help in that regard . In particular , he submitted that on CARDINAL DATE and DATE he had requested ORG to certify that its partial judgment had become final ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) by adding a stamped endorsement to that effect ( klauzula pravomo\u0107nosti \u2013 \u201c certificate of finality \u201d ) . He alleged that his requests had been refused orally with the explanation that the defendant \u2019s appeal of DATE had prevented the judgment from becoming final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a response to the defendant \u2019s appeal , arguing , inter alia , that ORG should declare the appeal inadmissible as it had been lodged out of time .", "CARDINAL .

NORP However , following an appeal by the defendant , on DATE ORG reversed the first - instance judgment , dismissing the applicant \u2019s action in its entirety . That court noted , inter alia , that under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) an employee could apply for the enforcement of a judgment ordering his reinstatement within DATE of its becoming final . The partial judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had become final on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) but the applicant had never applied for its enforcement , and he should have done so by DATE . ORG therefore held that the applicant had not only lost the right to seek reinstatement but consequently also the right to receive salary arrears .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( revizija ) against the second - instance judgment . He argued that he could not possibly have applied for enforcement of the partial judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) by DATE because at that time the defendant \u2019s appeal of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) against the partial judgment had still been pending and he had consequently been unaware that the partial judgment had become final . That the partial judgment had actually become final on DATE had become apparent to him only on CARDINAL DATE , when it had been confirmed by the stamped endorsement of ORG . However , since he had retired on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , he had not been able to apply for enforcement of the partial judgment and seek reinstatement .", "CARDINAL .

Therefore , the defendant has to pay the plaintiff the salary arrears ... as if the unlawful decision on dismissal had never existed .", "...", "Since the lower courts erred in law , the factual background was not properly established . The appeal on points of law is therefore allowed [ in part ] and the impugned judgment quashed in the part whereby the plaintiff \u2019s claim for salary arrears for the period DATE and DATE was dismissed . In that part the case is remitted to the first - instance court .", "...", "As regards the [ part of the contested ] judgment whereby the plaintiff \u2019s claim for salary arrears for the period after DATE was dismissed , it is to be noted that the lower courts correctly applied the substantive law in dismissing the plaintiff \u2019s claim as unfounded . In particular , the plaintiff failed to institute enforcement proceedings for reinstatement within the strict DATE time - limit set forth in section CARDINAL of LAW ... It follows that the plaintiff did not work from DATE owing to his own omission . He is therefore not entitled to salary arrears for that period .", "For these reasons the appeal on points of law has to be dismissed ... in so far as it contests that part of the impugned judgment ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
