The applicant was a member of ( and a spokeswoman for ) a group of aliens without residence permits who in DATE decided to take collective action to draw attention to the difficulties they were having in obtaining a review of their immigration status in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Their campaign , which received widespread coverage in the press , culminated with the occupation of PERSON ORG in GPE on DATE by a group of CARDINAL illegal immigrants , most of whom were of NORP origin . CARDINAL men within the group decided to go on hunger strike . The applicant 's daughter joined her mother as CARDINAL of the occupiers of the church . The movement , known as the \u201c PERSON sans papiers \u201d movement , was supported by several human - rights organisations , some of whose activists decided to sleep on the LOC in a show of solidarity with their predicament .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE Commissioner of Police signed an order for the total evacuation of the LOC . It was made on the grounds that the occupation of the LOC was unrelated to religious worship , there had been a marked deterioration in the already unsatisfactory sanitary conditions , padlocks had been placed on the church exits and there were serious sanitary , health , peace , security and public - order risks .", "CARDINAL . More specifically , the order read as follows :", "\u201c The director of ORG ( ORG ) was given responsibility on DATE for ensuring day to day care of the hunger strikers and the parish priest has been reminded of the health hazards to which the occupants were exposed by the precarious living conditions as also of the need to allow unrestricted access to the emergency services .", "ORG ) organisation , which offers continuous medical assistance in the church , has made public alarming information on the very serious consequences of this hunger strike for the health of those concerned at the expiration of the medically critical period of DATE .", "On the basis of the provisions of LAW , the CARDINAL hunger strikers were evacuated on DATE , solely in order for the men to be given appropriate medical check - ups in hospitals in GPE .", "The men returned to the aforementioned church of their own accord and immediately declared their intention to pursue their action . Since DATE there has been a marked deterioration in the already unsatisfactory sanitary conditions , the available sanitary equipment being totally inadequate for the long - term use of the premises as a collective shelter .", "The number of people present on the LOC has grown considerably during DATE , and this has led to incidents in the immediate vicinity and notably on the public highway .", "Such incidents create a risk of behaviour that may result in public order disturbances .", "The various movements concerned have erected barriers on the public highway , across FAC at the junctions with FAC and FAC . The barriers obstruct the highway , hindering the passage of ordinary traffic and of emergency vehicles .", "The church doors and various exits are kept closed , and in some cases padlocked , to enable a filter system to be operated at the only remaining entrance that is permanently accessible , and a barricade formed of barriers chained together has even been placed between the enclosure railings and the north entrance to the church chancel . These installations constitute a major hazard should an emergency evacuation of the persons present inside the building become necessary .", "These activities and movements are totally unrelated to religious worship , which is the exclusive use to which this public building may be put under the law of DATE .", "It follows from the matters noted above that the current situation represents a serious sanitary , health , peace , public - security and public - order risk ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The following morning the police carried out the evacuation . The police officers arrived at the scene at TIME and set up a checkpoint at the church exit to verify , on the basis of LAW , subparagraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW CARDINAL , subparagraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of the Ordinance of DATE , whether the aliens evacuated from the church had documentation authorising them to stay and circulate in the territory . The police entered the church at TIME", "CARDINAL . All the occupants of the church were stopped and questioned . Whites were immediately released while the police assembled all the dark - skinned occupants , apart from those on hunger strike , and sent them by coach to an aliens ' detention centre at FAC . Orders were made for the detention and deportation of almost all of those concerned . CARDINAL were subsequently released by the courts on account of certain irregularities on the part of the police , which even extended to making false reports regarding the stopping and questioning procedure .", "CARDINAL . At TIME a police officer asked the applicant as she was leaving the church for documentary evidence that she had leave to stay in GPE , but she was unable to produce any . The applicant had attended the GPE Police Commissioner 's Office on DATE but on DATE had been refused leave to remain in GPE on the ground that she did not satisfy any of the conditions laid down by the Ordinance of DATE for the issue of a residence permit and that there were no personal or family reasons justifying her being granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds . She had been invited to leave NORP territory within DATE after receipt of notification of the Commissioner of ORG 's decision .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant was taken into custody and informed of her rights pursuant to ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The measure was deemed to have taken effect at TIME , when she was stopped . The applicant refused to speak throughout her period in custody . At TIME on DATE the Senior Deputy Public Prosecutor at ORG instructed the police officers to bring the applicant before him , with the case file as it stood .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant appeared before ORG under the \u201c immediate summary trial \u201d procedure . She was accused of having \u201c entered and stayed in GPE without being in possession of the documents or visas required by the rules \u201d and was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , suspended . ORG held :", "\u201c The occupation of a place of worship ... over a period of DATE , ... in order to contest their immigration status and create a movement in their favour , in itself constitutes an emergency justifying the administrative authority 's decision to expel them .", "The presence in GPE ORG of CARDINAL people for a period of DATE claiming , through public statements made by individuals or through spokespersons representing them , status as , in their own words , aliens without residence permits or papers , constituted grounds for suspecting that those concerned had committed offences under the immigration rules such that the verification of their identity pursuant to LAW was justified .", "However , since a large number of people were stopped at the same time and refused to disclose their identities , the police were not able to carry out an immediate identity check . The fact that the identity check was not carried out when they were first stopped , but within what , given the practical contingencies inherent in an operation of that size , was a reasonable period thereafter , does not render the proceedings defective .", "Regard being had to the large number of persons stopped and the circumstances in which the operation was conducted , the defendant was notified of her rights within a reasonable time ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on appeal by the applicant , upheld the sentence and added an order excluding her from NORP territory for DATE . In addition , it held in its judgment :", "\u201c The occupation of a place of worship by CARDINAL individuals over DATE , in order to create a movement in their favour and to contest their immigration status , constitutes an emergency that justified the administrative authority making an expulsion order without making a prior application to the courts .", "The occupiers of the LOC continued their hunger strike for DATE and the living conditions of those concerned continued to deteriorate .", "The scale of the demonstrations over DATE , with barriers being used to obstruct the highway and hinder the passage of vehicles , constituted a risk for security , sanitation , the health of the hunger strikers and public order that justified urgent measures being taken to put an end to the disturbances . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law on the following grounds :", "\u201c In the proceedings before the courts below , in which ORG , a NORP national , was accused of illegally entering and staying in GPE , the accused duly challenged the lawfulness of the order issued by the commissioner of police , without a prior court order , for the evacuation of the church occupied by the accused and several other persons , which evacuation was followed by police identity checks that revealed that the demonstrators were illegal immigrants .", "In these circumstances , the reasons which the courts below relied on DATE unnecessarily \u2013 in dismissing her objection can not serve as a basis for complaint by the appellant , since , even if she had proved that the administrative act referred to above was unlawful , it would have had no bearing on the outcome of the criminal proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
