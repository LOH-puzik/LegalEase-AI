The notice recited that there appeared to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to be a breach of planning control in that a CARDINAL - storey building had been erected to the rear of CARDINAL and CARDINAL FAC , GPE , and of CARDINAL and FAC , GPE , without the necessary planning permission . The notice required the applicant to remove all parts of the building which were QUANTITY above the original ground level , within DATE of DATE .

Section CARDINAL lists CARDINAL grounds upon which appeals may be brought . The applicant appealed on CARDINAL grounds :", "\u201c ( a ) that planning permission ought to be granted for the development to which the notice relates ....", "( b ) that the matters alleged in the notice do not constitute a breach of planning control ;", "( c ) that the breach of planning control alleged in the notice has not taken place ;", "( g ) that the steps required by the notice to be taken exceed what is necessary to ... achieve a purpose specified in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ... \u201d", "In accordance with the TCPA DATE , an inspector was appointed to determine the appeal against the enforcement notice . Neither the applicant nor the ORG requested a formal public hearing or public inquiry . The inspector made her decision after inspecting the building and considering written representations from both parties . In her decision letter dated DATE , the inspector rejected the appeal under all CARDINAL grounds .", "The applicant did not appeal against the decision of the inspector , and on DATE , the enforcement notice came into effect . The applicant remained the owner of the LOC , and did not reduce the structure to a height of QUANTITY as required by the notice .", "On DATE , a summons was issued alleging that the applicant had committed a criminal offence under LAW , by failing to remove parts of the building QUANTITY . The applicant was granted legal aid for his representation in criminal proceedings by solicitors and counsel .", "The applicant \u2019s legal advisers sought and obtained disclosure of documents from the ORG . On the basis of these documents , the legal advisers wished to argue that there had been bad faith , including bias and improper motives , on the part of a Councillor in connection with the decision to issue the enforcement notice . The applicant \u2019s counsel advised him that an application for leave to move for judicial review , and thereby directly challenge in separate proceedings the decision to issue the enforcement notice , would have no reasonable prospect of success , being DATE out of time .", "The criminal trial took place on CARDINAL and DATE at ORG , before His Honour Judge PERSON and a jury . The judge ruled that the applicant was not entitled to contend , as a defence in the criminal proceedings , that the decision to issue the enforcement notice had been influenced by bias and bad faith , as a challenge to the enforcement notice could only be brought by way of proceedings for judicial review . Consequently , the applicant changed his plea from \u201c not guilty \u201d to \u201c guilty \u201d .", "The applicant appealed against the conviction on the basis that the ruling of His Honour Judge PERSON had been wrong .

On DATE , ORG granted leave to appeal .", "A hearing took place before ORG on CARDINAL and DATE and , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal ( [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL ) . ORG held that \u201c enforcement notice \u201d in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the TCPA DATE meant a notice issued by a planning authority which , on its face , complied with the requirements of the LAW and had not been quashed on appeal or by judicial review . The effect of this was that , to constitute a defence in the criminal proceedings , the validity of an enforcement notice would have to be challenged within the time limits for a statutory appeal under the TCPA DATE or for an application for judicial review . It noted that the statutory grounds of appeal against an enforcement notice were wide enough to include every aspect of the merits of the decision to serve an enforcement notice . An application for judicial review would in practice be needed only for the rare case in which enforcement was objectively justifiable but the decision that service of the notice was \u201c expedient \u201d ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) ) was vitiated by some impropriety ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
