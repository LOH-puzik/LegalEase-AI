On DATE the applicant entered the GPE , where on DATE he applied for asylum . He stated , inter alia , that he had left his passport and identity card behind in GPE and that he had travelled as a stowaway on a ship to the GPE . His parents and CARDINAL siblings as well as CARDINAL - siblings were all living in GPE . He stated that , on account of his ORG origin , he had been discriminated against in GPE where , moreover , his father , his oldest brother and one of his sisters had encountered problems from the side of the NORP authorities . He had also left GPE because of problems encountered on CARDINAL occasions from the side of relatives of his fianc\u00e9e . They objected to the applicant \u2019s intended marriage .", "CARDINAL . Noting that the applicant did not hold any travel documents and had not immediately applied for asylum upon his arrival in the GPE , and finding that no credence could be attached to his asylum account , the Deputy Minister of ORG ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request on DATE . The applicant did not avail himself of the possibility to appeal against this decision , which thus became final . Although under a formal obligation to leave the country , the applicant continued to reside illegally in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE and detained on remand on suspicion of , inter alia , participation in a criminal organisation pursuing the aim of prejudicing GPE by providing assistance to enemy forces who are conducting a holy war against \u2013 amongst others \u2013 the GPE ; and which organisation is further involved in drug - trafficking , forgery of documents , providing third persons with forged documents , and/or ordering or inciting others to commit criminal offences . These suspicions were based on the content of various intelligence reports drawn up by the GPE national security agency ( ORG ; \u201c ORG \u201d , succeeded on DATE , pursuant to the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act ( FAC inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten ) , by ORG ( Algemene Inlichtingen- en ORG ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and a number of co - accused were subsequently formally charged and summoned to appear before ORG ( rechtbank ) in order to stand trial . In its judgment of DATE , ORG acquitted the applicant of all charges , finding that these had not been legally and convincingly proven , and ordered the applicant \u2019s release from pre - trial detention . The hearing of DATE during which ORG judgment was delivered was attended by an official of the NORP mission in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution initially lodged an appeal against this judgment but withdrew it on DATE , before the trial proceedings on appeal had commenced .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed a second application for asylum in the GPE . He stated , inter alia DATE contrary to what he had previously asserted DATE , that he had taken his passport , personal identity card and declaration of nationality with him to the GPE in DATE and that , for the purposes of possibly obtaining a NORP residence title , he had later sent his passport to GPE where CARDINAL of his brothers was living . He had not submitted these identity documents in the proceedings on his first asylum request in order to prevent his immediate removal from the GPE . On this passport , issued in DATE shortly before his departure , he had travelled by plane from GPE to GPE from where DATE following brief stays in GPE and GPE DATE he had eventually travelled by train to the GPE where he had applied for asylum .", "CARDINAL . His new asylum request was based , inter alia , on the criminal proceedings that had been taken against him in the GPE . The applicant claimed that these proceedings had attracted the attention of the NORP authorities as illustrated by the presence of an official of the NORP mission during the GPE trial . Despite the fact that he had been acquitted , his relatives in GPE continued to be questioned about him . Further emphasising the general situation in GPE , the applicant submitted that he feared treatment in breach of LAW as he was a person marked for life as a terrorist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , immediately after his release from pretrial detention following his acquittal , the applicant was placed in GPE detention for expulsion purposes ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE sent to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , ORG ( GPE Branch ) stated that it was likely that the applicant had attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities on account of the nature of the suspicions that had arisen against him in the GPE . As the NORP authorities had been engaged since DATE in a campaign of oppression directed against all persons suspected of having links with religious groups considered \u201c extremist \u201d and as ORG received regular reports of torture of persons detained in GPE , it feared that the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE could expose him to a risk of treatment proscribed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie ; \u201c the Minister \u201d ) rejected the applicant \u2019s second asylum application , but withdrew this decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an individual official report ( ambtsbericht ) on the applicant was drawn up by the ORG .

On DATE ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE concluded that the applicant should have been released from GPE detention on DATE . The applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE against the Minister \u2019s failure to determine his second asylum application . On DATE , ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal and ordered the Minister to determine the applicant \u2019s asylum request within DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a fresh decision taken on DATE , the Minister again rejected the repeat asylum request , finding that it had not been established that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would be exposed to a risk of treatment proscribed by LAW . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG of GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the Minister to take a fresh decision within DATE . ORG rejected the Minister \u2019s request to take into account the effects of the military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in GPE of DATE in which the regime of President PERSON had been overthrown , including reports in the press that after this coup many opposition members had returned to GPE and that many detainees , including NORP extremists , had been released . Although ORG accepted that the regime change could , as such , be seen as a new fact or circumstance which could be taken into account in accordance with article CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , it also found that the Minister had failed to indicate in a targeted and concrete manner what consequences this should entail in respect of the appeal at hand . Furthermore , it did not find that the effects of the regime change had become fully crystallised yet . Consequently , the requirement of article CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE LAW that new facts and circumstances can only be taken into account if relevant to the decision at issue was not met in the instant case . ORG therefore decided to ignore what had happened on or after DATE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG further agreed with the parties that the appeal concerned a repeat request within the meaning of article CARDINAL:CARDINAL of LAW which should be based on relevant newly emerged facts or altered circumstances . It held that the applicant \u2019s arrest and prosecution on charges of participation in a terrorist organisation in the GPE , his acquittal by ORG and the public attention these proceedings had attracted were new facts unknown on DATE when the applicant had filed his first asylum request . The question which remained was whether these new facts warranted a revision of the negative decision on that first asylum request . On the basis of the contents of ORG letter of DATE and other materials concerning the suppressive attitude of the regime of the NORP President PERSON as regards NORP extremists , ORG found that there were sufficient concrete indications that the NORP authorities , in particular since DATE , pursued an increasingly repressive policy towards perceived NORP fundamentalists . It could therefore not be considered excluded that the applicant would risk persecution within the meaning of the DATE LAW . ORG further accepted as sufficiently plausible that the NORP authorities had become aware of the suspicions that had arisen against the applicant in the GPE . Also noting that the most recent official report ( ambtsbericht ) on PERSON had been drawn up by the Minister of Foreign Affairs as long ago as DATE , ORG concluded that the Minister \u2019s conclusion in the impugned decision lacked adequate reasoning on specific points . Having reached this conclusion , ORG did not find it necessary to examine and determine the parties\u2019 arguments on the ORG individual official report on the applicant of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister filed an appeal with ORG of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG accepted the Minister \u2019s appeal , quashed ORG judgment of DATE and rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the Minister \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . Referring to the general principles under LAW as defined by ORG in its judgments in the cases of PERSON and Others v. GPE , ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and ORG v. the GPE , ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG held :", "\u201c The [ asylum ] application , rejected in the above - cited decision of DATE , was based on the claim that [ the applicant ] must now fear that , in view of the criminal trial proceedings taken against him , the NORP authorities have become aware of the suspicions having arisen against him in the GPE as to his involvement in a terrorist organisation and that this is not altered by the fact that he has been acquitted .", "[ ORG considers that ] , even if such awareness has to be assumed to exist , the Minister did not have to find \u2013 on the basis of the [ applicant \u2019s ] mere reference to the suspicions having arisen against him , the subsequent prosecution which ended in his acquittal and speculation about the possible consequences of this upon his return to his country of origin \u2013 that it had been established by the [ applicant ] that he , if expelled , would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment within the meaning of LAW . The general information submitted by the [ applicant ] concerning the attitude of the NORP authorities towards terrorism offers no basis for the conclusion that the Minister was incorrect in finding no reasons for considering that the criminal proceedings will lead to asylum - related problems . It was not for the Minister to demonstrate that this alleged risk did not in fact exist . The appeal succeeds . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister informed the applicant of the intention ( voornemen ) to declare him an undesirable alien entailing the imposition of an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) , as the applicant was considered to pose a threat to national security , which conclusion was based on an individual official report drawn up on the applicant by the ORG on DATE , according to which the applicant was involved in a network of extremist NORP involved in the material , financial and logistic support of international jihad , and in the propagation of , planning of and incitement to use violence for the purposes of such jihad . According to a subsequent official ORG report of DATE , this information remained pertinent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed written comments on the intention with the Minister , arguing inter alia that such an exclusion order would be in violation of his rights under LAW and that the intended decision to impose an exclusion order lacked adequate reasoning . The applicant relied , inter alia , on a letter dated DATE from ORG ) , stating that the applicant , given his past , was at risk of being arrested and tortured if returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE , the validity of this passport had been prolonged in PERSON by DATE . The applicant had applied for that prolongation by correspondence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived unaccompanied in GPE . He passed the passport and customs control with the help of a related customs officer who had been informed of the arrival by the applicant \u2019s family . This customs officer shepherded him through the checkpoints as the border guards were allegedly on alert for the applicant and would have arrested and questioned him . Since his return to GPE , the applicant has been living in hiding in order to avoid persecution by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL of LAW provides that an applicant must adduce newly emerged facts or altered circumstances ( nieuw gebleken feiten of veranderde omstandigheden ) if a repeat request is filed following a decision in which the original request is , either totally or partially , rejected . When no such facts or altered circumstances have been adduced , the administrative authority may reject the new request with reference to the decision on the original request . Article CARDINAL thus embodies the res iudicata principle in administrative law . Nevertheless , an exception has been made in this particular area of the law , in that an alien may adduce exceptional facts and circumstances relating to him or her personally , on the basis of which the new request may be assessed outside the framework of article CARDINAL .
