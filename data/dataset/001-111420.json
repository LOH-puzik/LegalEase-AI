The applicants are landowners and lessors who concluded ground lease contracts regarding their plots of lands for permanent homes or holiday homes prior to DATE . On DATE , upon the entry into force of LAW DATE ( GPE ) , for the first time under NORP law , the rental or leasing of plots of land for permanent homes and holiday homes became the subject of special statutory regulation .", "CARDINAL . Prior to CARDINAL DATE such agreements were governed by the general rules ( statutory and other ) on contracts . Ordinarily such contracts were concluded for DATE and often contained clauses giving the lessee a right to extension of the contract upon expiry . According to legal doctrine , where such clauses had not expressly been set out in the contract , there was a custom or implicit assumption that the lessee had a right to extension of the contract unless the lessor had an objective ground for refusing renewal . Some lease contracts contained clauses which gave the lessor a right to increase the rent at intervals , in order to compensate for inflation . However , pursuant to CARDINAL ORG judgments of DATE , such a right was granted even in the absence of any explicit contract clause to that effect .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a new LAW was enacted with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under both LAW and LAW the lessee was entitled to have the ground lease contract extended but the lessor had the right to introduce new conditions into the contract .", "CARDINAL . With effect from DATE LAW was amended anew ; inter alia , from that date its section CARDINAL granted all lessees of plots for permanent homes and holiday homes the right to claim extension of their lease on the same conditions as previously and without limitation in time , when the agreed term of lease between the parties expired . The reason was a strongly felt concern across ORG ( ORG ) , with CARDINAL exception \u2013 ORG ( PERSON ) , that lessees who were not able to afford the price of redemption would need the legislator \u2019s protection in order to be able to extend the lease . The introduction of the disputed provision of section CARDINAL of LAW was essentially motivated by social policy considerations ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order better to understand the rationale behind this amendment , it is important to bear in mind the underlying socio - economic factors in GPE . In the post - war area , limited resources for the purchase of real estate was CARDINAL factor that made ground lease arrangements attractive for people who wanted to own a permanent home or a holiday home . For property owners , it was an expedient way of obtaining a steady income from their land without making any investments and an attractive alternative to selling the land , in a country with a small population on a vast territory and with moderate price levels . This might explain why such arrangements became so popular . There exist CARDINAL ground lease contracts ( PERCENT for permanent homes and PERCENT for holiday homes ) in a population of CARDINAL people , the majority of contracts being for private homes ( Proposal No . CARDINAL to the PERSON ( DATE ) , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE until DATE the price level of the real - estate market developed more or less at a similar pace to general price inflation . However , this began to change around DATE , when real - estate prices started soaring . This was especially the case from DATE for property around the larger cities and in popular areas for recreation , but prices have continued to rise , in all parts of the country . A number of lessors then used the opportunity under the law to demand redemption , which resulted in many lessees being put in a difficult financial position ( paragraph CARDINAL of ORG judgment of DATE in the leading case referred to at paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Because of the dramatic increase in pressure on real - estate prices the legislator thought it necessary to intervene to protect the GPE interests . This was done in DATE by regulating the level of possible rent increases so that they could only reflect general inflation , not the rising cost of land .", "CARDINAL . In consequence thereof a lessor , who is not one of the applicants , lodged civil proceedings before ORG ( tingrett ) against CARDINAL lessees who had leased plots of land for permanent homes , claiming that the amended section CARDINAL of LAW contravened Articles CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the LAW , concerning respectively the prohibition of retroactive laws and the right to full compensation in case of expropriation , or LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG passed judgment in favour of the lessor , finding that section CARDINAL of LAW contravened both LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , the case was brought directly before ORG ( PERSON ) , which by judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( HR CARDINAL-P , case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) found against the lessor . It considered that section QUANTITY of LAW should be examined exclusively in the light of LAW of the LAW , with which it was compatible , and that there was no infringement of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . In his reasoning , approved in the main by the other six Justices sitting in the case , the first voting judge , PERSON Justice Matningsdal , stated in so far as relevant :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The lessee \u2019s submission that the right to extension of the lease \u2018 on the same terms as ORG represents a restriction can in my opinion not succeed . Ever since the judgment in the LAW case in ORG law reports ( PERSON R.t . \u201d ) DATE I p. CARDINAL , ORG has taken as its point of departure that if , as stated by Assessor Siewers in GPE . DATE p. CARDINAL , there is \u2018 a ceding on the part of the owner and an acquisition on the part of the ORG which wholly or in part transfers the owner \u2019s disposal of the property to the ORG or others for further enjoyment for the same or other purposes\u2019 , it will follow from Article CARDINAL that full compensation must be paid . Conversely , there will be a restriction on the use of property if \u2018 there is no ceding and acquisition but rather provisions that for the promotion of public interest considerations and in the interest of society aim to regulate the owner \u2019s disposal of the property , without any transfer to third parties\u2019 .", "( CARDINAL ) The right to extension provided for in section CARDINAL must clearly be distinguished from a regulation of the owner \u2019s disposal of the property . Section CARDINAL grants the lessee a right to lease the plot for a longer period than provided for in the agreement . In other words , there is a transfer of rights in the property beyond the agreed period of time - which viewed in isolation could indicate that the situation is directly regulated by Article CARDINAL . In this context , I should note that the requirement as to \u2018 full compensation\u2019 in Article CARDINAL also applies in the case of expropriation of limited rights ...", "( CARDINAL ) Although section CARDINAL of LAW entails a transfer of the owner \u2019s disposal of the property , I nevertheless have no doubt that the constitutionality of the right to an extension on unchanged conditions must be assessed in relation to LAW , rather than LAW . This was also the view of the legislators , see Proposal No . CARDINAL to the PERSON ( DATE ) , p. CARDINAL , quoted above , which assumes that the question of constitutionality must be decided by reference to LAW . A central point in this context is that the rules on extension intervene with a regulatory effect in a situation created by the parties themselves through the contract of ground lease . The agreement makes it necessary for the lessees to be permitted to maintain their buildings on the plot for a very long period of time after the agreed term of lease has expired . The statutory provision represents a regulation \u2013 with retroactive effect \u2013 related directly to the agreement , or , more precisely , to the restrictions contained in the agreement . In our legal tradition a subsequent regulation of this nature relating to a contractual relationship between the parties is assessed in relation to LAW , not in relation to LAW . This is the case even where a regulation has resulted in a transfer of rights and obligations between the parties . This view must also be applicable in a case such as ours , even though the intervention in the agreement entails a transfer of disposal.\u2019", "...", "( CARDINAL ) The concrete assessment in relation to LAW", "( CARDINAL ) ... An assessment must be made in full of the consequences of the act . In this assessment , on the CARDINAL side weight must be accorded to the considerations of the lessees . The latter must be balanced against the act \u2019s consequences for the lessors , and how protection - worthy their interests are .", "( CARDINAL ) When it comes to a ground lease it is fundamental that one is confronted with a conflict of interests between CARDINAL parties . The landowner owns the land , while the lessee owns the building or buildings which have been erected on the land . When balancing , it is of central importance that almost without exception the lessee \u2019s economic interest is greater . Even if the example is not representative for buildings constructed for individual habitation or for holiday purposes , I note nevertheless that in the sales project regarding the CARDINAL apartments in the present case , the prices were set at between ORG CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL depending on size and position . The price for CARDINAL of the most expensive apartments was thus higher than the price paid DATE previously for the whole plot of land . But also as regards buildings constructed for individual habitation and for holiday purposes , normally the lessee has paid the more significant financial contribution .", "( CARDINAL ) In respect of a lease for permanent homes , the lessee \u2019s essential right to housing for himself and his family must be protected DATE which was the principal reason behind the amendment of the act . In addition , for the majority of lessees it concerns their single largest investment . They have a well - founded expectation that the legislators will protect their factual situation . Moreover , this is illustrated by the fact that besides the area of ground leasing , we have several examples where the legislators have found it justified to protect rights of this kind , even when such interference may mean a certain form of transfer of rights :", "( CARDINAL ) Firstly LAW of DATE no . CARDINAL ...", "( ORG ) Secondly I note LAW of DATE concerning rent ...", "( CARDINAL ) The regulation of rent is a third example , which illustrates the legislation \u2019s endeavour to protect the right to housing ...", "( CARDINAL ) The right to continue the lease contract on \u2018 the same terms as before\u2019 has first and foremost significance for the lessor \u2019s possibility to increase the rent . The examination above [ CARDINAL - CARDINAL ] shows that for a long time considerable legislative efforts have been made to protect the right to housing . This area of law has been strongly legislated , and the market mechanisms have to a large extent not been the deciding factor . Already , therefore , lessors must have been prepared for the law makers to follow developments closely and if necessary intervene in the ongoing lease relations in order to safeguard the lessee \u2019s need to protect his home and his investments .", "( CARDINAL ) Furthermore , as regards long - term agreements , like ground lease contracts , the parties must be prepared for developments to take a direction which increases the legislator \u2019s need to intervene with legislation to secure a proper balance between the parties . This has not only benefited the lessees : the enactment of section CARDINAL of LAW in DATE gave lessors the possibility to adjust the lease upwards in contracts which did not contain a regulation clause , and where the rent had become unreasonably low because of a significant decrease in the value of money ...", "...", "( CARDINAL ) [ The lessors ] have emphasised that as the contracts were entered into during a period of index linkage , they anticipated that price regulation would be lifted [ at the expiry of the contract ] and that , when extending the contract , they would be able to charge a rent which reflected the real value of the land . I note in this connection that it is questionable how strong this anticipation could have been . ... I refer to [ a ORG judgment , ORG . DATE p.CARDINAL , in which the court stated among other things about the parties\u2019 expectations ] ... \u2018 [ the lessors ] have attached great weight to the fact that a clause was inserted in the contract stipulating that disputes as to the regulation of ground rent were to be decided in the light of an expert opinion . They maintain that the insertion of such a clause would have been unnecessary had they anticipated that price regulation would follow index linkage . In my view , however , much weight can not be attached thereto . In DATE it was difficult to predict that the prices of plots of land for holiday houses would increase considerably more than general inflation would indicate . It is most likely that when entering into the contract , the parties did not have any clear conception of what the material basis for regulating the ground rent should CARDINAL", "( CARDINAL ) In addition to the quotation above , I note that in so far as the lessors had anticipated that price regulation would be lifted , they could not have had any legitimate anticipation that the legislator would accept an increase in ground rent which deviated significantly from the general price trend . Had the legislator not intervened , the price increase in DATE would almost have amounted to an \u2018 accidental profit\u2019 \u2013 see PERSON ( DATE ) p. CARDINAL , second column . Accordingly , it was not realistic to anticipate that the legislators would not intervene in the price increases we have had in DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) Moreover , I observe that the present case concerns long - term contracts under which the landowner has received contractual ground rent for DATE . This also has its importance under LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) The lessors have maintained that it is unreasonable that at the expiry of the contracts they will be in a [ worse ] position than lessors who enter new leasing contracts . In these situations , it follows that under LAW of LAW the freedom of agreement is significant in that the agreed ground rent is valid as long as it is not \u2018 unreasonably high in relation to what is customarily paid in the locality on new leases on similar plots on similar contractual terms\u2019 . In my view , however , there is a crucial difference between the CARDINAL situations : I refer to the elements already emphasised . In this connection , I especially note that concerning ground leases , such as those in question , where the life span of the building clearly exceeds the duration of the ground lease contract , the lessor has all along been aware that the extension of the contract would become an issue . When negotiating the terms of the extension of the contract , a lot would be at stake financially for the lessee . Despite the authority to expropriate in LAW , there was a risk , as also indicated in Ot.prpr . no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) , p. CARDINAL , second column , that the lessor would impose some quite oppressive conditions on the lessee . In such cases the lessors could not expect the legislator to refrain from price regulation when renewing ground lease contracts . I recall that when the ground lease contracts at issue were entered into , the establishment of ground lease contracts was price - regulated , and an increase in the ground rent required approval from ORG [ prisnemnda ] .", "( CARDINAL ) Taking the [ above circumstances into consideration , ] there is a strong case for concluding that the provision which gives lessees the right to continue the ground lease on the same terms as before is not affected by the prohibition of retroactive laws set out in LAW . It is true that the provision means that the entire increase in the value of the land \u2013 to the extent that it exceeds increases in the consumer price index \u2013 can be said to accrue to the lessees after the extension of the lease . In other words , there is no apportioning of the increase in value that led to the legislative amendment . Nevertheless , I find that , given the situation which existed , it must lie within the freedom granted to the legislator under LAW to regulate matters in this way .", "( CARDINAL ) When assessing [ compliance with the constitution ] the question arises whether the retroactive provision safeguards objective considerations of equality . [ ... ]", "( CARDINAL ) It is section CARDINAL on the adjustment of the ground lease rent which in particular raises the question of whether considerations of equality have been sufficiently preserved . As a result of this provision the former provision on adjustment of the ground lease rent was repealed . LAW ( CARDINAL ) provides :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) With regard to the CARDINAL - off adjustment upon the entry into force of the LAW , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) LAW of LAW thus provided for a possibility to factor into the calculation of the ground lease rent an increase in the value of the plot beyond the general inflation rate . But the possibility is limited to instances where such adjustments have \u2018 ORG been agreed to , and the requirement that the agreement be clear is particularly strict \u2013 see PERSON \u2018 R.t.\u2019 DATE , at p. DATE . In view of this requirement as to clarity , and of the information available about adjustment clauses in ground lease contracts in general , a minority of contracts is covered by this provision . There are in addition important limitations also on the situations which are covered by the right under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) to include in the calculation an increase in values as mentioned . There is only provision for a CARDINAL - off adjustment and there are limitations as to the amount .", "( CARDINAL ) In my view , even though LAW hardly requires the exception provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , there is arguably an objective ground for giving these ground lease agreements a special status with regard to the possibility to adjust the ground lease rent . The basis for so doing is precisely that adjustment in accordance with the ground value here has been directly expressed and has therefore created a safer and closer expectation about adjustment on that ground . In the light of that I can not see that the provision in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) infringes the condition of equality and thus provides a ground for setting the section CARDINAL right aside as being incompatible with LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) I add that the fact that the redemption rules can offer a better financial result for the lessor than those on extension of the lease on unaltered conditions is not a ground for holding that section CARDINAL is incompatible with LAW Redemption is left to the lessee \u2019s choice . The legislator should be free to decide that if the lessee wishes to avail himself or herself of this right , he or she will have to pay compensation beyond the constitutional minimum .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) Hereafter my conclusion is that LAW of LAW does not contravene LAW . The provision is justified by weighty housing / social considerations . There was a clear need to protect a number of lessees and the lessors had no justified expectation to profit from the quite extraordinary increase of the value of plots of land for leasing .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) Finally , it is necessary to assess whether section CARDINAL leads to results that contravene LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention ...", "( CARDINAL ) The question is whether the fact that in the event of an extension the lessor does not have the right to regulate the ground lease upwards to an amount that reflects the actual land value means that the arrangement contravenes this LAW provision .", "( CARDINAL ) The central decision in this context is the judgment by ORG in Plenary Session of DATE in PERSON and Others v. the GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL . The case was occasioned by the enactment by ORG of a statute \u2018 LAW CARDINAL\u2019 which granted residents the right to redeem contracts for \u2018 building ORG and \u2018 premium ORG . The former types of agreement had major similarities with NORP ground leases , the difference being that under these contracts , the house too belonged to the landowner . However , the residents had defrayed the cost of erection and paid a charge for the plot to the landowner . The new act provided that in the event of redemption , the residents should pay only for the value of the land . The plot would not be valued as a plot where a right of title to the house and land were grouped , but rather on the basis of what the landowner could be expected to sell it for with the encumbrance of a leasehold of DATE duration , should anyone else purchase the plot . This amount was far lower than the market value of a released plot , and the plaintiffs claimed that they suffered a loss in the region of ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL on individual conveyances . ORG did not find for the applicants .", "( CARDINAL ) The applicants contended firstly that the \u2018 public interest\u2019 test was satisfied only if the property had been taken \u2018 for a public purpose of benefit to the community generally\u2019 ( see PERSON and Others , cited above , paragraph DATE ) . This argument did not succeed ( ibidem , paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u2018 For these reasons , the ORG comes to the same conclusion as the ORG : a taking of property effected in pursuance of legitimate social , economic or other policies may be \u2018 in the public interest\u2019 , even if the community at large has no direct use or enjoyment of the property taken . The leasehold reform legislation is not therefore ipso facto an infringement of LAW ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) on this ground . Accordingly , it is necessary to inquire whether in other respects the legislation satisfied the \u2018 public interest\u2019 test and the remaining requirements laid down in the second sentence of LAW ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL).\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) In paragraph CARDINAL the ORG further underlines that the national courts \u2018 are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is \u2018 in the public interest\u2019 . The national authorities accordingly enjoy \u2018 a certain margin of appreciation\u2019 .", "( CARDINAL ) The ORG then discussed whether the aims sought to be pursued by ORG were legitimate . In this regard , the ORG held , inter alia ( ibidem , paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u2018 Eliminating what are judged to be social injustices is an example of the functions of a democratic legislature . More especially , modern societies consider housing of the population to be a prime social need , the regulation of which can not entirely be left to the play of market forces . The margin of appreciation is wide enough to cover legislation aimed at securing greater social justice in the sphere of people \u2019s homes , even where such legislation interferes with existing contractual relations between private parties and confers no direct benefit on the ORG or the community at large . In principle , therefore , the aim pursued by the leasehold reform legislation is a legitimate one.\u2019", "( CARDINAL ) Thereafter , the ORG emphasised that it would not be sufficient that the legislation pursue a \u2018 legitimate aim\u2019 but \u2018 there must also be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised\u2019 ( ibidem , paragraph CARDINAL ) . On the proportionality assessment in the concrete case , the ORG stated ( paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u2018 According to the applicants , the security of tenure that tenants already had under the law in force ... provided an adequate response and the draconian nature of the means devised to give effect to the alleged moral entitlement , namely deprivation of property , went too far . This was said to be confirmed by the absence of any true equivalent to LAW in the municipal legislation of the other GPE and , indeed , generally in democratic societies . It is , so the applicants argued , only if there was no other less drastic remedy for the perceived injustice that the extreme remedy of expropriation could satisfy the requirements of LAW PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "This amounts to reading a test of strict necessity into the LAW , an interpretation which the ORG does not find warranted . The availability of alternative solutions does not in itself render the leasehold reform legislation unjustified ; it constitutes CARDINAL factor , along with others , relevant for determining whether the means chosen could be regarded as reasonable and suited to achieving the legitimate aim being pursued , having regard to the need to strike a \u2018 fair GPE . Provided the legislature remained within these bounds , it is not for ORG to say whether the legislation represented the best solution for dealing with the problem or whether the legislative discretion should have been exercised in another way ... .", "The occupying leaseholder was considered by ORG to have a \u2018 moral entitlement\u2019 to ownership of the house , of which inadequate account was taken under the existing law ... . The concern of the legislature was not simply to regulate more fairly the relationship of landlord and tenant but to right a perceived injustice that went to the very issue of ownership . Allowing a mechanism for the compulsory transfer of the freehold interest in the house and the land to the tenant , with financial compensation to the landlord , can not in itself be qualified in the circumstances as an inappropriate or disproportionate method for readjusting the law so as to meet that ORG", "( CARDINAL ) As to whether it is permissible to adopt legislation which does not guarantee full compensation , the ORG held in paragraph CARDINAL :", "\u2018 The ORG further accepts the ORG \u2019s conclusion as to the standard of compensation : the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value would normally constitute a disproportionate interference which could not be considered justifiable under LAW ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . LAW PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) does not , however , guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances . Legitimate objectives of \u2018 public interest\u2019 , such as pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice , may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value . Furthermore , the ORG \u2019s power of review is limited to ascertaining whether the choice of compensation terms falls outside the ORG \u2019s wide margin of appreciation in this domain ... .\u2019", "section CARDINAL of LAW does not contravene GPE \u2019s obligations under international law . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It must accordingly be assumed that the legislators intended that extensions of leases should be treated equally , irrespective of which of these purposes the plots were used for . This must carry considerable weight in our assessment here . Reference is made to the first voting judge \u2019s comments [ the leading judgment above ] on the weighing of the political considerations by ORG . I would nevertheless add that , although it is probably the case that social considerations would be of particular importance to permanent homes , having a holiday home also has considerable benefits in terms of well - being and welfare .

This has particular impact on the rules of redemption , as the conditions for redemption are linked to the time when the contract was entered into .", "CARDINAL LOC impressions from the assessment", "CARDINAL households in GPE lease ground for permanent or holiday home purposes . MONEY of permanent home leases are found in cities or other densely populated areas . These leases , and the holiday home leases in popular coastal areas , are increasingly marred by conflicts between lessees and landowners . A lot of the contracts are old and were entered into at a time when ground lease was a viable alternative for those individuals who were unable to finance the purchase of property , and prior to social development that forced real - estate prices in densely populated areas to unforeseen levels . DATE leased plots must be considered as permanently restructured due to the GPE work on the land and their considerable investment in housing on the plot . Lessors comprise traditional lessors , for instance in agriculture , but ground is also leased by professional real - estate investors , who own a number of leased plots .", "The Ministry is of the opinion that the assessment has shown , importantly , a clear need for making the rules of redemption simpler . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Former section CARDINAL , which entered into force on DATE , contained a main rule enabling upward rent adjustment in accordance with changes in the consumer price index and an exception where it had unequivocally been agreed that there should be no adjustment of the rent , or where rent was to be adjusted by other means than by reference to the consumer price index . In such cases adjustment was to be done on the basis of the terms of the agreement in question . This applied in full for contracts entered into after CARDINAL DATE . For contracts entered into prior to CARDINAL DATE the new rule was subject to the modification that a rent \u201c ceiling \u201d of ORG CARDINAL per dekar was introduced for upward adjustment based on other parameters than correspondence with the consumer price index .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the revision of section CARDINAL , ORG considered CARDINAL alternative options , including whether to re - introduce a mandatory consumer - price - index - regulated adjustment system for ground lease contracts for permanent and holiday home purposes . There were several arguments in favour of this . After the former rent control system was repealed on DATE , many lessees had been faced with dramatic unexpected rent increases . Although the contracts had initially been entered into on the basis of possible upward adjustment of the ground lease rent to reflect increases in the value of the property , the long period with a system for public rent control in force had led to a situation where lessees were used to a gradual increase in rent in accordance with the consumer price index . The increasing discrepancy between ground lease rents subject to rent control and those indexed to the increase in property prices made dramatic inroads into the household budgets of numerous families and single people , subject to the regime introduced on DATE . This price trend was also seen in the rental market , but in the rental market the increase was more gradual , and there was at any rate a difference between the ordinary rental market and the ground lease market in that the lessee had built his or her own house upon the ground in question for his or her own use .", "CARDINAL . It was further observed that a minority of the contracts provided for adjustment by reference to factors other than the consumer price index and were concerned by this problem . For most of the contracts covered by the survey the rent level could be said to be high . Then the report went on to consider the arguments for and against introducing mandatory all - round rent control based on the consumer price index ( PERSON . nr . CARDINAL ( DATE ) pp . CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c What first and foremost militates against a compulsory scheme for rent adjustment in correspondence with the consumer price index is the principle of the freedom of contract . Limitations to the freedom of contract principle will be more noticeable in those older contracts containing ground value clauses . In most such contracts , which have been the subject of public regulation since the entry into force of the new LAW DATE , the aforementioned proposed amendment to the act will entail downward adjustment of payable ground rent , bringing the rent back to its level at the time of the rent control scheme prior to DATE . A downward adjustment would undoubtedly be noticeable for lessors who have already adjusted the rent upwards to reflect the increase in property prices and also made arrangements accordingly . It should also be part of the overall consideration that section CARDINAL of LAW has enabled more lessors to make profit on property that for DATE has accrued very low income in terms of ground lease rent because of the previous rent control scheme . ORG would also like to add that the survey undertaken in DATE shows that the average level of rent charged , including rent subject to adjustment after DATE , corresponds to what was foreseen when section CARDINAL was amended in DATE . ORG will therefore not support the introduction of a mandatory adjustment scheme linked to the consumer price index for older contracts on the basis of the rent charged at the time the contract was entered into .", "At the same time the assessment of LAW demonstrates that clauses linking rent adjustment to the increase in property prices are often conducive to disputes , and they may have ramifications unforeseen by the parties when the contract was entered into . Since LAW entered into force a number of disputes have arisen regarding the interpretation of adjustment provisions in ground lease contracts . Part of the problem seems to be that many contracts were entered into without any party having envisaged the possibility of the dramatic increase in property prices that has been seen in DATE , and its consequences for rent levels . In older contracts entered into by non - professional parties in particular , the wording of the contracts appears often to be haphazard and imprecise and thus of little use in determining questions that were not anticipated at the time . Such cases can naturally be left to the decision of the judiciary , but from the perspective of social economics it seems unfortunate to allocate such substantial resources to the settlement of such disputes , in terms of free legal aid and the workload on the courts . As the cases concern a significant social asset , namely the permanent or holiday homes of the lessees , considerable uncertainty may also be a source of unnecessary personal strain .", "In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the third option mentioned in the letter carrying the proposal submitted for public review ( consumer price index regulation only in cases after the last adjustment has been made ) covers aspects related to foreseeability and the avoidance of legal disputes . [ ... ] Such random effects can be avoided by introducing a provision that entitles the lessor to adjust the rent upwards once in accordance with the original contract and subject to limitations already in force under LAW , before the consumer price index adjustment scheme comes into effect . In this way the rent charged in the transition period is brought , by way of a CARDINAL - off operation , to a level higher than that established under the prior rent control scheme repealed when LAW entered into force DATE . For more recently agreed ground lease contracts it will still be possible to agree upon a rent that reflects the value and appreciation of the land , but rent adjustment will subsequently be linked to changes in the consumer price index . Such a provision for older contracts will respect what has been agreed upon , while at the same time helping to achieve a uniform system of rent adjustment based on the consumer price index over time . This , it must be assumed , will result in fewer legal disputes and not give rise to unforeseen radical upward adjustments of ground rent .", "The ORG proposes , then , this solution for ground lease contracts for permanent and holiday home purposes . The main rule of the proposal is a system of rent control linked to changes in prices . For the older contracts mentioned above , however , the ORG proposes introducing a CARDINAL - off operation in which what has been agreed upon between the parties will represent CARDINAL factor . Any subsequent adjustment after this CARDINAL - off operation should reflect price trends .", "This solution does not , however , address the fact that ground lease rent has risen and will continue to rise in some ground lease contracts containing ground value clauses . This must be seen in context . ORG proposes the expansion and simplification of the rules of redemption . It is suggested that the price to be paid for redemption should be calculated having regard to the ground lease rent . A balancing of the interests of the lessors and the lessees suggests in the ORG \u2019s opinion that there should be no intervention in rent adjustment clauses in existing contracts more than what will follow from this proposal . \u201d [ Emphasis added . ]", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , on the \u201c Calculation of the compensation for redemption \u201d , included the following observations ( PERSON . nr . CARDINAL ( DATE ) p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ORG considers that the provision on calculating compensation upon redemption must be seen in the light of the provisions on rent adjustment , the general conditions for redemption and the right to extend the lease . ORG assumes at the outset that these provisions , seen as a whole , must not substantially alter the present balance of interests in ground lease contracts . Several instances that have taken part in the public review process have also stressed this . In section CARDINAL the ORG proposes a considerable simplification of the conditions for redemption . At the same time , the ORG favors the introduction of a CARDINAL - off upward adjustment operation for contracts with ground value clauses , followed by the introduction of an adjustment scheme linked the consumer price index ( see section CARDINAL ) . This gives due regard to what has been agreed between the parties . With this point of departure in mind , the Ministry considers that it is possible to introduce a balanced provision for the calculation of compensation for redemption . \u201d [ Emphasis added . ]", "CARDINAL . The proposal for the existing section CARDINAL concerning the right for the lessee to claim an extension on the same conditions as previously without limitations in time was presented by ORG and ORG ( PERSON Justis- og DATE hereinafter referred to as ORG ) in DATE ( Ot.prpr . nr . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) - proposal no . CARDINAL to the PERSON , which is the larger division of ORG ) , stating inter alia ( at p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The ORG draws attention to the fact that the main aim of the proposal is to make it easier for more people to acquire ownership of the leased plots . In certain cases redemption would be such a heavy financial burden that the lessee should have other alternatives than terminating the lease agreement . Lessees who are not able to redeem the plot should , in the ORG \u2019s view , be secured a lasting right to dispose of the plot . This issue has not been of great interest until now , but this can be expected to change in DATE to come as more lease contracts expire . In the absence of absolute rules , the lessors will be faced with the choice between redemption , termination or continuation [ of the ground lease contract ] . As ORG sees it , this is an untenable legal situation and it is therefore proposed that the lessee should have a right to prolong the ground lease agreement . ORG has considered whether the landowner should have a right to set new conditions in the agreement , but has found that the lessee should be able to continue the lease agreement on the same terms . According to the ORG \u2019s assessment , social policy considerations on the side of the lessee should be decisive . If the lessor were to have the possibility to adjust the ground lease rent up to the market level , the lessees would in principle find themselves in the same financial straits as in the event of redemption where the costs of a loan exceed the DATE ground lease rent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the issue of constitutionality of the provision in section CARDINAL , the Bill to ORG stated ( p. DATE ) :", "\u201c The PERSON entails some retroactive effect particularly for landowners who concluded ground leases before DATE , when no such right to extension existed . ORG has reasoned that the social considerations on the lessee \u2019s side weigh heavier than those on the landowner \u2019s side , and concludes that the proposal is consistent with LAW . The proposal is not considered to be more intrusive than the proposed rules on redemption , and on this point reference is made to LAW and the discussion of the relationship to the LAW in para . CARDINAL . ORG also stresses , inter alia , the social considerations that will apply , and that these are rules that relate to a long - term contractual relationship between the parties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The PERSON proposed that payment upon redemption should be set at CARDINAL times the ground rent at the time of redemption , although the lessor should be able to claim a minimum of ORG CARDINAL , equal to ORG CARDINAL , for the plot ( section CARDINAL ) , which was to apply to all ground lease contracts irrespective of the value of the plot , of when the contract had been concluded , and of whether the contract was limited or unlimited in time . In this connection ORG stated ( p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c As noted above , the fundamental purpose of the rules on redemption is already to ensure that lessees of plots for permanent homes and holiday homes are secured a lasting right to use the plot . It is probably the case that many lessees will not be in a position to redeem the plot if the costs of borrowing are significantly higher than the DATE ground rent . As noted above , the PERSON will entail some increase in the expenses of the lessee , depending on the prevailing level of interest rates , but it is estimated that it nevertheless lies within what most lessees with limited economic means should be able to afford . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The proposal concerning the minimum compensation of ORG CARDINAL was later amended by ORG to CARDINAL per cent of the sales value of the undeveloped plot at the time of redemption .", "CARDINAL .

In assessing these matters , the majority has attached considerable weight to considerations of social policy in housing [ boligsosiale hensyn ] .
