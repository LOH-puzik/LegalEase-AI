THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON van GPE , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and , at the time of the introduction of the application , was detained in a remand centre in LOC . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant was arrested and placed in police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) for a maximum of DATE on suspicion of involvement in the exportation of synthetic drugs . At the time of his arrest , MONEY was found on him . The search of the premises where he was arrested resulted in the finding of , inter alia , a plastic bag with CARDINAL pills with a horse - like logo , a pill with a euro logo , an order for dried flowers , a GPE passport in the applicant 's name , a NORP passport in the name of a Mr X. containing an identity photograph of the applicant , CARDINAL papers with telephone numbers and CARDINAL address books . When heard on DATE in connection with his placement in police custody , the applicant stated that he knew that he did not have to answer any questions , that he understood that he had been arrested in connection with trafficking in and/or exporting hard drugs , and that he wished to be represented by a lawyer .", "When heard by the police on DATE , the applicant stated , inter alia , that he had been convicted and sentenced to DATE imprisonment in the past for drug offences , that he knew nothing about drugs , that he had obtained the NORP passport from a man from GPE and that the particulars therein had been made up , and that the pills found , which looked like XTC pills , might have been left behind by CARDINAL of his acquaintances who had visited him . He further stated that he did not know anything about the transport of CARDINAL XTC pills which had been seized in GPE on DATE . After he had been confronted with photographs taken under surveillance , the applicant stated that he only recognised someone whom he knew as PERSON , an acquaintance who visited him sometimes . He did not know the other persons in the photographs shown to him .", "On DATE , the applicant was heard by the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) on the public prosecutor 's request to place the applicant in detention on remand ( inbewaringstelling ) on suspicion of his involvement in the exportation of an estimated quantity of CARDINAL XTC pills , membership in a criminal organisation involved in drugs offences , and the possession of a NORP passport he knew to be forged .", "The public prosecutor 's request was accompanied by the written record of the provisional findings in the criminal investigation ( voorgeleidingsproces - verbaal ) . This written record ran to CARDINAL pages and consisted of a full account of the criminal investigation ( relaas van onderzoek ) and the relevant appendices , including the written records of the arrest of the applicant and CARDINAL co - suspects , their subsequent questioning by the police , CARDINAL searches , the notifications of seizures , the finding DATE on DATE on a drugs courier \u2013 of CARDINAL bags containing QUANTITY . pills tested positive for ORG , a report dated DATE from the NORP authorities stating that the substance found in seized cardboard boxes had tested positive for ORG , the summaries of CARDINAL conversations intercepted on tapped telephones used by co - suspects , a written record on a surveillance operation conducted on DATE and on the authenticity verification of the CARDINAL passports found in the search when the applicant was arrested . These written records were made available to the applicant .", "According to the written record of the investigation , in DATE the GPE - Amstelland ORG ( PERSON ) had received information about several persons involved in ORG trafficking . On this basis , as of DATE , an investigation was made into a group of persons involved in the commission of drug offences under the direction of CARDINAL of these persons , PERSON E. This investigation disclosed , inter alia , that the applicant was apparently involved in exporting ORG . In the course of the investigation , the authorities had intercepted telephone conversations , conducted surveillance operations and intercepted various ORG shipments . CARDINAL drug couriers had been arrested on DATE in the GPE upon their arrival on a flight from GPE ; one drug courier had been arrested on DATE in the GPE and , on DATE , a shipment of CARDINAL XTC pills \u2013 packed in cardboard boxes hidden between boxes of dried flowers and transported in a truck driven by a GPE driver , Mr DATE had been intercepted by the NORP authorities when the driver was unloading the XTC in PERSON ( GPE ) . The truck driver had apparently transported these boxes on the instructions of the applicant , who in turn had acted under instructions from PERSON who would have bought the ORG from the applicant . In the course of surveillance carried out , the applicant had often been seen in the company of PERSON", "When heard by the investigating judge on DATE , the applicant submitted that the suspicions against him were based on unsubstantiated conclusions drawn by the investigating authorities and therefore could not be taken into account in assessing the question whether there were serious suspicions ( ernstige bezwaren ) against him . He contended that the written record of the provisional findings in the criminal investigation had not been accompanied by documents containing the facts and/or circumstances from which these conclusions had been drawn by the investigating authorities ( e.g. the surveillance records , or the record of the intercepted communications and/or statements taken in the course of the investigation ) .", "On DATE , the investigating judge ordered the applicant 's detention on remand for DATE . Noting the applicant 's suspected involvement in the exportation of an estimated quantity of CARDINAL XTC pills , his membership in a criminal organisation and his possession of a forged NORP passport , the investigating judge considered that there were grave suspicions against the applicant . The judge found that there was a serious risk of the applicant absconding and that there were important reasons of public safety ( gewichtige redenen van maatschappelijke veiligheid ) which required his immediate detention : the offence of which he was suspected could attract a CARDINAL-year prison sentence ; the legal order had been seriously shaken by that offence ; there was a serious risk that the applicant would commit a further offence whereby the health of persons might be endangered , and the applicant , in view of statements made and/or drugs found , was apparently involved in extensive drug trafficking .", "By letter of DATE , the applicant 's lawyer informed the public prosecutor that it appeared from the copies of the written records ( processenverbaal ) with which he had been provided that , in the course of the investigation , several so - called special investigative powers ( bijzondere opsporingsbevoegdheden ) had been deployed . He requested the public prosecutor to provide him with all the written records and orders relating to the exercise of these powers .", "On DATE , the applicant was heard by ORG on the public prosecutor 's request for his further detention on remand ( gevangenhouding ) . At this hearing , the applicant requested ORG to lift his pre - trial detention , arguing that the investigating judge had unjustly assessed the seriousness of the suspicions against him on the basis of conclusions drawn by the police , whereas the facts and/or circumstances ( e.g. the surveillance records or the intercepted communications and/or statements taken in the course of the investigation ) , on which these police conclusions were based , were not included in the case file . On DATE , ORG ordered the applicant 's further detention on remand for DATE . It considered , after having heard the prosecutor and the applicant , that the suspicion and grounds which had led to the applicant 's detention on remand were still pertinent .", "By letter of DATE , the GPE public prosecutor dealing with the applicant 's case informed the latter 's lawyer that he would shortly transmit copies of all written records and orders issued in the applicant 's case . However , owing to the prosecution 's workload , this could not be done immediately . The public prosecutor added that no documents would be withheld , as the interests of the investigation did not require that .", "On DATE , acting on a request by the public prosecutor , ORG prolonged the applicant 's further detention on remand by DATE . After having heard the prosecutor and the applicant , it considered that the suspicion and grounds which had led to the applicant 's further detention on remand were still pertinent .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against the decision of DATE with ORG ( gerechtshof ) .", "On DATE , the public prosecutor transmitted to the applicant 's lawyer copies of the requests , authorisations and orders in respect of the investigative powers that had been used in the applicant 's case . These documents were accompanied by various written records containing the findings of the investigation authorities in support of their requests for authorisation to use special investigative powers .", "On DATE , acting on a request by the public prosecutor and having noted that the applicant had indicated in writing that he did not wish to be heard on that request , ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention on remand for a further period of DATE , considering that the suspicion and grounds which had led to the applicant 's further detention on remand were still pertinent .", "On DATE , having noted the impugned decision of DATE and the documents relating to the applicant 's pre - trial detention , and after having heard the parties , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal and upheld the decision of DATE . As regards the applicant 's request \u2013 made orally at the hearing DATE to lift his pre - trial detention on the same grounds as those he had raised before ORG on DATE , ORG considered that the serious reasons of public safety referred to in the order for the applicant 's further detention on remand , and which continued to require his detention , outweighed the applicant 's interests in being released and , consequently , rejected the request .", "On an unspecified date at DATE and after having received copies of the written records containing the results of the special investigative powers that had been used in the criminal investigation , the applicant 's lawyer requested that several witnesses be heard . At the time of the introduction of the application , first - instance trial proceedings against the applicant had started . No further information about these trial proceedings has been submitted .", "Pursuant to LAW the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , officials with powers of investigation into offences must record as soon as possible in writing ( procesverbaal ) the investigated punishable fact or what they have done or found in the investigation .", "LAW ORG defines pre - trial detention ( voorlopige hechtenis ) as a deprivation of liberty pursuant to an order for detention on remand ( inbewaringstelling ) , a warrant for the taking into pre - trial detention ( gevangenneming ) , or an order for further detention on remand ( gevangenhouding ) . The statutory rules governing pre - trial detention are set out in ORG CARDINAL of the ORG .", "An order for pre - trial detention can only be issued against persons suspected of an offence attracting a punishment of DATE or more , or of a number of other specified criminal acts ( LAW ORG ) . Pursuant to LAW ORG , pre - trial detention can only be applied when it appears from the facts or circumstances that there are serious suspicions against the suspect ( \u201c wanneer uit feiten of omstandigheden blijkt van ernstige bezwaren tegen de verdachte \u201d ) . Orders for pre - trial detention are immediately enforceable ( LAW ORG ) .", "A ( deputy ) public prosecutor is competent to order the arrest of a person suspected of having committed a criminal offence , in respect of which detention on remand may be ordered ( LAW ORG ) . A ( deputy ) public prosecutor can further order a person 's subsequent detention in police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) , after having seen and heard that person ( LAW ORG ) . An order for detention in police custody can only be issued in respect of offences for which detention on remand may be ordered . A custody order is valid for a maximum of DATE and may only be prolonged for a further maximum period of DATE ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) .

On that occasion the suspect may request the investigating judge to order his or her release ( Article QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ) . Where the investigating judge finds the police custody order unlawful , the suspect 's immediate release must be ordered ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ) . In order to prolong the detention of a suspect , the public prosecutor can request the investigating judge to issue an order for detention on remand under LAW ORG .

In that case , the suspect will be informed in writing that the documents available to him or her are incomplete . If documents are withheld from a suspect , the latter can file an objection ( bezwaar ) , within DATE after the notification of the decision , to the court to which the public prosecutor or investigating judge is attached , which court must determine the matter as soon as possible ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "Pursuant to LAW ORG , a suspect must be given access to all documents in the case file as soon as the decision to close the preliminary judicial investigation has become final or , where there has been no preliminary judicial investigation , as soon as the decision to pursue the prosecution or the indictment has been served on the suspect ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
