After receiving no news from her son for DATE , the applicant made an official complaint at the Uludere prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE , and asked for her son to be found .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Uludere prosecutor decided that he lacked jurisdiction to investigate the disappearance because , according to CARDINAL eyewitnesses heard by him , the applicant \u2019s son had disappeared in PERSON , which was outside his jurisdiction . The prosecutor therefore forwarded the file to his opposite number in PERSON .

Thus , it was impossible to establish whether a helicopter flight had been made to Uludere on DATE in question .", "CARDINAL . It also appears from the prosecutor \u2019s decision that the applicant had informed the investigating authorities that ORG Commander had visited a caf\u00e9 in Uludere and told those present in the caf\u00e9 , which had included civilians and village guards , that PERSON was in PERSON and would soon be released . When questioned by the PERSON prosecutor , however , the village guards present during the commander \u2019s visit had stated that the commander had not said anything about PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Upon receiving the \u015e\u0131rnak prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE on DATE , the applicant \u2019s legal representatives filed an objection against it . They argued that the investigation by the PERSON prosecutor had been inadequate . They submitted that important leads had not been followed up , not all eyewitnesses had been heard , and the prosecutor had been content to accept the written replies received from the military , rather than questioning them in person .", "CARDINAL . The objection was rejected by ORG on CARDINAL DATE on the grounds that the CARDINAL legal representatives \u201c had not been representing the applicant at the time of the adoption of the prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE and the objection was thus filed outside the statutory timelimit \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was communicated to the applicant \u2019s lawyers on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .
