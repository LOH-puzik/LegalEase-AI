NORP The community of nations decided to respond to the war in GPE with an arms embargo , with humanitarian aid and with the deployment of a peacekeeping force . It must be clearly stated that these measures were poor substitutes for more decisive and forceful action to prevent the unfolding horror . The arms embargo did little more than freeze in place the military balance within the former GPE . It left the NORP in a position of overwhelming military dominance and effectively deprived GPE of its right , under LAW , to self - defence . It was not necessarily a mistake to impose an arms embargo , which after all had been done when GPE was not yet a ORG Member of ORG . Once that was done , however , there must surely have been some attendant duty to protect GPE , after it became a Member ORG , from the tragedy that then befell it . Even as the NORP attacks on and strangulation of the \u2018 safe ORG continued in DATE and DATE , all widely covered by the media and , presumably , by diplomatic and intelligence reports to their respective ORG , the approach of the members of ORG remained largely constant .

Clearly the primary and most direct responsibility lies however with the architects and implementers of the attempted genocide in GPE . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It continues with the declarations of independence by GPE , GPE and GPE , the international political events following the outbreak of hostilities , and the political decision - making that led to the participation of the GPE in PERSON and the decision to deploy Dutchbat in the NORP enclave . Events in the LOC area itself following the arrival of Dutchbat , including hostile action by the ORG and the ORG , are described in detail .", "CARDINAL . In an epilogue , the report notes that the denial of effective close air support to Dutchbat owed much to NORP response to an air attack carried out in DATE on ORG ammunition dumps in Pale , then the NORP capital ; this had involved taking UNPROFOR personnel hostage and the destruction of an NORP fighter aircraft by ORG air defences in DATE . There had also been a failure on the part of governments in possession of intelligence to share it with others . This went a long way towards explaining the turn events had taken . The Dutchbat leadership had been concerned to ensure the well - being of the civilians entrusted to their care ; for this they had been dependent on the ORG , and therefore vulnerable to NORP manipulation . Finally , the widespread public perception of the Dutchbat operation as a national failure had turned the fall of GPE and its aftermath into a political issue .", "CARDINAL . These findings induced the incumbent Government to take political responsibility . On DATE it announced its resignation .", "CARDINAL . As GPE had been a major troop contributor to UNPROFOR as well as being a permanent member of ORG of ORG , ORG ( ORG nationale ) decided to conduct a parliamentary inquiry .

The report charts the political and military developments leading to the creation of the \u201c safe areas \u201d in LOC and the ORG attack on GPE .", "CARDINAL . The massacre is described , but the report stops short of imputing personal responsibility to individuals , preferring to leave that to the criminal tribunals .", "CARDINAL .

It runs to CARDINAL pages , mostly taken up by summaries and excerpts of evidence taken from participants in the various decision - making processes , both domestic and foreign .", "CARDINAL . The report found that the decision to participate in the international intervention in the former GPE had been inspired partly by humanitarian motives and partly by the desire , felt by both the ORG and ORG , for the GPE to play an active role in promoting international peace and security . However , the decision to deploy a lightlyarmed air - mobile infantry battalion to an embattled \u201c safe area \u201d had been inspired by wishful thinking rather than by considerations of feasibility .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over time self - defence had taken on a greater importance than the fulfilment of PERSON \u2019s mandate and PERSON \u2019s power to deter by its presence had been eroded . ORG was primarily to blame for this .", "CARDINAL . According to the report , NORP side alone was to blame for the crimes committed . However , although fault was found with the Dutchbat leadership and the GPE government , the report concluded that it was ultimately unlikely that Dutchbat could have prevented the massacre .", "CARDINAL .

Major General PERSON appealed against his conviction and sentence . He did not challenge ORG description of events , focusing instead on the nature and extent of his criminal responsibility . Ultimately ORG found that , absent proof of genocidal intent , ORG had not been a principal perpetrator of the crimes committed . It did , however , find him guilty of aiding and abetting genocide and crimes against humanity and reduced his sentence to DATE ( judgment of DATE , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-A ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG for GPE was a domestic human rights court set up under LAW set out in GPE CARDINAL to ORG . It had CARDINAL judges , called \u201c Members \u201d , CARDINAL of whom were nationals of GPE ( CARDINAL Bosniacs , CARDINAL NORP , CARDINAL NORP ) , the remaining CARDINAL being nationals neither of GPE nor of any neighbouring ORG . It existed until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision on CARDINAL applications ( the LOC and Others decision ) . These applications were taken from among CARDINAL similar applications brought before ORG , all related to the GPE events .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that it lacked jurisdiction ratione temporis to consider the events occurring before the entry into force of LAW on DATE . It did , however , find violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG both taken alone and in conjunction with LAW failure to provide information to the applicants about their missing relatives and to conduct any meaningful investigation . It added that \u201c [ i]n the context of the NORP cases , these violations [ were ] particularly egregious since this event [ had ] resulted in the largest and most horrific mass execution of civilians in LOC in DATE . ... \u201d . It ordered ORG to disclose all relevant information in its possession , to release any missing captives still alive , and to conduct a \u201c full , meaningful , thorough , and detailed investigation \u201d . In addition , it ordered PERSON to pay a total of CARDINAL GPE convertible marks ( BAM ) to ORG and GPE .", "DATE . On DATE the then GPE initiated proceedings in ORG ( ICJ ) against the then GPE alleging , in so far as relevant to the case before the ORG , violations of ORG . After the entry into force of ORG , GPE was succeeded as applicant party by GPE . GPE , after its dissolution , was replaced as respondent party first by GPE and GPE and finally by GPE , albeit that any responsibility for past events determined by the ICJ involved at the relevant time ORG and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ICJ gave judgment on CARDINAL DATE ( Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of ORG ( GPE and GPE ) , Judgment , PERSON DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . As regards the GPE massacre , it based its findings of fact on those of the ORG in the above - mentioned judgment of ORG in the ORG case , on the ORG \u2019s judgment in the PERSON case ( IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-T , ORG , DATE ) , and on the report of the Secretary - General of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ICJ held , inter alia , that acts of genocide had been committed by members of the ORG in and around GPE from DATE ( loc . cit . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . However , the decision to commit these acts had been made by individual members of the leadership of the ORG ; there was nothing to prove that they had been planned , or committed , by persons for whom the respondent was responsible , or with the knowing complicity of the respondent . The massacre could therefore not be imputed to GPE and GPE ( loc . cit . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL and \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ICJ held , nonetheless , that an obligation to prevent genocide existed , albeit a qualified one . The obligation in question was CARDINAL of conduct and not CARDINAL of result , in the sense that a ORG could not be under an obligation to succeed , whatever the circumstances , in preventing the commission of genocide : the obligation of GPE parties was rather to employ all means reasonably available to them so as to prevent genocide so far as possible . A ORG did not incur responsibility simply because the desired result was not achieved ; responsibility was however incurred if the ORG manifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its power and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide .", "CARDINAL . The ICJ went on to find that the authorities of the ORG , and above all its President , Mr PERSON , had been aware of the tensions reigning in the GPE area between the various ethnic groups and thus of the danger that genocide might occur . Although undeniably possessing influence over the ORG by dint of \u201c political , military and financial links \u201d with it ( loc . cit . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , they had not brought their influence to bear on the ORG to prevent the genocide from occurring . The international responsibility of GPE was thereby engaged ( loc . cit . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants summoned ORG and ORG before ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE . The summons was a CARDINAL document in which the applicants stated that the State of the GPE ( responsible for Dutchbat ) and ORG ( which bore overall responsibility for PERSON ) , despite DATE promises and despite their awareness of the imminence of an attack by the ORG , had failed to act appropriately and effectively to defend the LOC \u201c safe area \u201d and , after the enclave had fallen to the ORG , to protect the noncombatants present . They therefore bore responsibility for the maltreatment of members of the civilian population , the rape and ( in some cases ) murder of women , the mass murder of men , and genocide . The applicants based their position both on GPE civil law and on international law .", "CARDINAL . ORG The argument under civil law was , firstly , that ORG and ORG had entered into an agreement with the inhabitants of the NORP enclave ( including the applicants ) to protect them inside the LOC \u201c safe area \u201d in exchange for the disarmament of the ORG forces present , which agreement ORG and ORG had failed to honour ; and secondly , that GPE , with the connivance of ORG , had committed a tort ( onrechtmatige daad ) against them by sending insufficiently armed , poorly trained and ill - prepared troops to GPE and failing to provide them with the necessary air support .", "CARDINAL . The argument under international law , in so far as relevant to the case now before the ORG , was based on ORG on ORG and Draft Articles on ORG , the applicants taking the position that the actions of Dutchbat were attributable to both ORG the GPE and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Although recognising that individuals were not subjects of classical international law , the applicants argued that the right of victims to redress under international law had been recognised directly by ORG Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a LAW and LAW , which had direct effect in the GPE by virtue of LAW for GPE .", "CARDINAL . Anticipating the likelihood that ORG would invoke its immunity based on LAW , the applicants argued that any immunity which that organisation enjoyed could go no further than was necessary for it to carry out its tasks , and moreover that access to a court was guaranteed by , in particular , LAW .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the Minister of ORG did not make use of the possibility provided by section CARDINALa of LAW DATE ( Gerechtsdeurwaarderswet CARDINAL , see below ) to declare to the bailiff that service of the summons would be contrary to the obligations of the ORG under international law .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not appear before ORG , having previously indicated to ORG in GPE that it would not .", "CARDINAL . GPE , already a defendant in its own right , also asked to intervene on behalf of ORG , or in the alternative to join the proceedings against ORG as a defendant . It submitted that in the light of LAW taken together with LAW , LAW , the GPE courts lacked competence in so far as the proceedings were directed against ORG ; it was for the GPE courts to recognise the immunity of the ORG ex officio unless it was explicitly waived . The ORG had an international legal interest of its own in invoking this immunity , as was reflected particularly in section CARDINAL of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants argued that the immunity of ORG was overridden by , in particular , LAW and the prohibition of genocide , the latter being a rule of ius cogens that had found its way into treaty law ( in the form of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The main proceedings were adjourned pending a final decision in the incident of procedure .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE ( FAC ( National Jurisprudence Number , \u201c LJN \u201d ) ORG , LANGUAGE translation PERSON ) . In so far as relevant to the case before the ORG , it found that the failure by the Minister of ORG to make a declaration as provided for by section CARDINALa of LAW DATE did not imply recognition of the jurisdiction of the GPE courts by GPE .", "CARDINAL . Conversely , the ORG had an interest of its own in defending the ORG Nations\u2019 immunity from jurisdiction in view of its obligations under LAW . ORG then noted that ORG had indicated its desire to see its immunity respected , as it invariably did , and found that the immunity of ORG was in fact recognised in international legal practice .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , neither ORG nor any other rule of international law , whether defined by treaty , by customary law or by ORG practice , obliged the GPE to enforce the prohibition of genocide through its civil law ; LAW provided only that GPE should ensure that genocide was punished .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the case - law of this Court ( PERSON v. the GPE [ ORG ] , no . ORG , ORG CARDINAL-XI ) , ORG found that in principle the sovereign immunity of a ORG was not overridden by the prohibition of torture laid down in LAW . The prohibition of torture being as much a rule of ius cogens as the prohibition of genocide , it could be concluded that , in the current state of international law , immunity from civil suit in a domestic court DATE whether enjoyed by a sovereign ORG or by an international organisation DATE was not overridden by ius cogens .", "DATE . It followed that the ORG Nations\u2019 immunity was not functional , to be weighed in the balance by the domestic courts , but absolute .", "CARDINAL . As to LAW , ORG pointed to the decision of ORG in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE and ORG v. GPE , GPE and GPE ( ( dec . ) [ ORG ] , ORG . MONEY and GPE , DATE ) . It had been held in that decision that troop - contributing nations could not be held to account for the actions of forces placed at the disposal of ORG for international peacekeeping operations . From this it followed that DATE could not be invoked in support of an exception to the immunity from suit of ORG itself .", "CARDINAL . ORG was aware that the ORG had , in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-I ) , and Beer and PERSON GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) , made statements suggesting that the immunity of an international organisation was compatible with LAW only if the organisation itself offered a reasonable alternative for the protection of Convention rights . However , the creation of ORG predated the entry into force of the Convention . Moreover , ORG was an organisation whose membership was well - nigh universal ; this distinguished it from organisations such as ORG , the organisation in issue in GPE and PERSON and PERSON and PERSON , which had been created only in DATE and whose membership was limited to GPE . Moreover , the ORG itself had recognised the special position of ORG in GPE and PERSON v. GPE and GPE v. GPE , GPE and GPE . At all events , if any State were to exercise jurisdiction over ORG , that ORG should be the one within whose territory the organisation had its seat or the acts complained of had taken place ; in the present case , that excluded the GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG thus declined jurisdiction with regard to ORG without finding it necessary to rule on the request by ORG for permission to intervene or join the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE . Their principal arguments may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In so far as relevant to the case before the ORG , they argued that the ORG \u2019s reliance on the absolute immunity of ORG went hand in hand with its argument that ORG alone bore responsibility for the failure to prevent the act of genocide constituted by the GPE massacre . To accept that argument would be to deny access to a court to the surviving kin of the victims of the massacre , which was legally , humanly and morally wrong . ORG had overlooked the nature of the ORG \u2019s argument , which was based not so much on its need to meet its obligations under international law as on its own self - interest , clearly understood ( welbegrepen eigenbelang ) . It was not the purpose of the international legal obligation to allow the ORG to evade its own responsibility .", "CARDINAL . ORG had been required by LAW , section CARDINAL of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of ORG to institute some form of settlement mechanism for disputes of a private nature to which it was a party , but in DATE of its existence it had failed to do so . There was therefore an urgent need for the GPE domestic courts to assume jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON judgment of this Court was not appropriate precedent , since the immunity of an international organisation was different from the immunity of a sovereign State . Moreover , in PERSON the Court had been deeply divided . The majority position in PERSON had been criticised in that it had allowed sovereign immunity to trump a rule of ius cogens , namely the prohibition of torture . It was still more inappropriate to allow the functional immunity of an international organisation to override an even more fundamental rule of ius cogens , namely the prohibition of genocide .", "DATE . In the ORG and ORG cases , both ORG to ORG of ORG and ORG itself had demonstrated a willingness to step in and provide access to a court where ORG itself had failed to do so ( the applicants referred to Joined Cases C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL P and C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL P , PERSON and ORG Council of ORG of ORG , judgment of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal gave judgment on DATE ( LJN BLCARDINAL ) . It allowed the ORG to join the proceedings against ORG as a defendant and went on to uphold the judgment of ORG for the remainder .", "CARDINAL . It did not accept that the ORG was trying to evade its own liability in civil law by invoking the immunity of ORG . This being an incident of procedure concerning the competence of the GPE domestic courts in relation to ORG , ORG could not anticipate the defence which ORG would put forward as a defendant in its own right in future proceedings on the merits .", "CARDINAL . Referring to Article II , section CARDINAL of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of ORG , which was to be interpreted \u201c in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose \u201d ( DATE of LAW of the Law of Treaties ) , and also in the light of LAW , ORG found that no other construction could be placed on that provision than that \u201c the most far - reaching immunity [ had ] been granted to ORG , in the sense that ORG [ could ] not be summoned before any domestic court of the countries that [ were ] party to that LAW . It did not follow from the wording of LAW that the immunity of ORG was merely functional , it being obvious from the ORG of the Charter preceding Article CARDINAL that ORG ( including LAW , section QUANTITY thereof ) was intended to specify the \u201c privileges and immunities ... necessary for the fulfilment of [ the ORG Nations\u2019 ] purposes \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Unlike ORG , ORG was not convinced that the ORG had deviated from PERSON and PERSON and PERSON and PERSON in its decision in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE and GPE v. GPE , GPE and GPE . The latter case had concerned neither ORG as a prospective party nor access to the domestic courts within the meaning of LAW . Nor could it make any difference that ORG had been set up before the ORG entered into force ; such a finding would be incompatible with the fundamental nature of Convention rights . Likewise , it could not be assumed that LAW had been intended simply to set aside customary international law or international treaties , still less to impair the protection of international human rights standards , it being precisely one of the purposes of ORG to promote respect for human rights and fundamental rights . This meant that the criteria by which the immunity from jurisdiction enjoyed by ORG was to be judged were those set out by the ORG in \u00a7 CARDINAL of Beer and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment continued as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . As regards the question whether the immunity from jurisdiction enjoyed by ORG is in this case proportionate to the aim pursued , ORG would observe the following . ORG has a special position among international organisations . ORG may , after all , pursuant to LAW , take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security . No other international organisation has such far - reaching competences . In connection with these far - reaching competences , by which ORG and the troops placed at the disposal of ORG may get involved in situations of conflict which will frequently involve conflicting interests of a plurality of parties , there is a real risk that if ORG enjoyed only partial immunity from jurisdiction , or none at all , it might be exposed to claims from parties involved in the conflict and be summoned before the domestic courts of the country where the conflict concerned is being acted out . Precisely in view of the sensitive nature of the conflicts in which ORG may become involved , one should also consider situations in which ORG might be summoned solely in order to frustrate action by ORG in whole or in part . One could also imagine that ORG might be summoned in countries in which the judiciary does not meet the standards of LAW . The immunity from jurisdiction granted to ORG is therefore directly connected with the general interest pertaining to the maintenance of peace and security in the world . For that reason it is of great importance that ORG should dispose of as great a degree of immunity as possible , which should be subject to as little discussion as possible . Against this background , ORG is of the opinion that only cogent reasons can lead to the finding that the ORG Nations\u2019 immunity is disproportionate to the aim thereby pursued .", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG notes in the first place that it is sensitive to the dreadful events ( vreselijke gebeurtenissen ) to which ORG and their relatives fell victim and to the suffering caused them thereby . The ORG has not contested that genocide was committed at GPE ; indeed , this is common knowledge . It is entirely understandable that the Mothers of Srebrenica should seek satisfaction in law for this . That , however , is not the end of the matter . As noted above , there is also a considerable general interest in ensuring that ORG should not be compelled to appear before a domestic court . In this area of tension there is a need for a balancing act CARDINAL legal principles , each of them extremely important , but CARDINAL of which can be decisive .", "CARDINAL . ORG finds in the first place that [ the applicants ] recognise that ORG did not itself commit genocide . ... Nor can it be deduced from the facts as stated by [ the applicants ] that ORG knowingly cooperated in the genocide . [ The applicants ] essentially allege that ORG was negligent ( nalatig ) in failing to prevent the genocide . ORG is of the opinion that although the allegation thus made against ORG is serious , it is not grave ( pregnant ) to the point of overriding the organisation \u2019s immunity for that reason alone , or to the point that it is for that reason alone unacceptable for ORG to invoke its immunity . In this connection , ORG finds it significant that , as already mentioned , ORG peace operations generally take place in parts of the world where a live conflict ( brandhaard ) has broken out , and that it will generally be possible without great difficulty to blame ORG , not for having itself committed crimes against humanity , but for having failed to take adequate measures against [ such crimes ] , [ a situation which ] may well give rise to abuse . The allegation that ORG did not prevent the genocide in GPE and was negligent in that connection is therefore insufficient in principle to affect its immunity from jurisdiction . Nor is it decisive that it is not stated in the present case that there is no abuse in the sense referred to above . If ORG could successfully invoke its immunity only if in the particular case abuse could be proved , its immunity would be unacceptably diminished ( aangetast ) .", "CARDINAL . The next fact relied on by [ the applicants ] is the absence of a procedural remedy attended by adequate safeguards ( een met voldoende waarborgen omklede rechtsgang ) . They have pointed out that ORG has not , as prescribed by LAW , section CARDINAL , opening sentence and ( a ) of FAC , made provision for appropriate modes of settlement of disputes arising out of contracts or other disputes of a private - law character to which ORG is a party . All [ the applicants ] agree that ORG has not done so . The ORG has also failed adequately to dispute [ the applicants\u2019 ] reasoned arguments that the \u2018 Agreement on the Status of UNPROFOR\u2019 effectively offers [ the applicants ] no realistic possibility to sue ORG . ORG is however of the opinion that it can not be established that [ the applicants ] have no access to a court at all in relation to what happened in GPE . In the first place , it has not been made clear from the facts as stated by [ the applicants ] why it would not be possible for them to bring the perpetrators of the genocide , and possibly also those who might be considered responsible for those perpetrators , before a court meeting the standards of LAW . In so far as [ the applicants ] have failed to do so because the persons liable can not be found , or offer insufficient prospects of recovery of damages , ORG observes that LAW does not guarantee that persons wishing to bring a civil action will always be able to find a ( solvent ) debtor .", "CARDINAL . In the second place , it is open to [ the applicants ] to summon the ORG , which they hold responsible in terms comparable to those applied to ORG , before the GPE courts . [ The applicants ] have in fact made use of this possibility . The ORG can not invoke any immunity from jurisdiction , which means that the GPE courts will have to express themselves on the merits of the claim against the ORG in any case . That does not change if in those proceedings , as [ the applicants ] claim to expect \u2013 with some justification ... \u2013 the ORG puts up a defence to the effect that its actions in GPE should be attributed ( exclusively ) to ORG . Even if that defence ... is made , the courts will in any case have to consider the merits of [ the applicants\u2019 ] claims and to that extent [ the applicants ] have access to an independent court .", "CARDINAL . It follows from the above that it can not be said that for [ the applicants ] the very essence of their right of access to a court would impaired if the ORG Nations\u2019 immunity from jurisdiction were recognised . ORG refers in this connection to [ PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINALB ] , from which it is apparent that ORG is prepared to accept even quite far - reaching limitations on access to a court . There is no such far - reaching limitation in the present case , given that [ the applicants ] can sue CARDINAL categories of parties for the damage suffered by ORG , to wit , the perpetrators of the genocide and the ORG . Against this background , ORG does not consider the fact that ORG has not , in accordance with its obligations pursuant to LAW , section CARDINAL , opening sentence and ( a ) of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of ORG , created an alternative remedy for claims such as the present \u2013 regrettable though that may be \u2013 as being of sufficiently decisive importance to affect its immunity from jurisdiction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) with ORG ( PERSON ) . In the course of the proceedings they submitted a summons ( dagvaarding ) and an explanatory memorandum ( schriftelijke toelichting ) . Their arguments , in so far as relevant to the case before the ORG , may be summarised as follows :", "CARDINAL . In the applicants\u2019 view , the distinction which ORG had made between proceedings against ORG and against ORG lacked justification , in view of the interrelation between the CARDINAL cases . To hold that ORG enjoyed immunity in the present case would enable GPE to argue that its conduct was imputable to , or legitimised by , ORG and thus to evade its responsibility .", "CARDINAL . The immunity of ORG under international law was not as extensive as had been held by ORG . In the absence of any alternative procedure accessible to the applicants , ORG had thus placed ORG above the law . The unacceptable nature of such a finding followed from , inter alia , this ORG \u2019s judgments in PERSON and PERSON and PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG had based its findings on the supposition that the applicants were seeking only monetary compensation , which could be paid by any party which had the necessary funds . In fact their claims were not limited to money : they sought recognition of the responsibility of ORG for failing to prevent the genocide of which their relatives had become victims . A judicial declaration to that effect could be made only with ORG as defendant , not against the GPE or for that matter the NORP perpetrators .", "CARDINAL . The immunity of ORG was grounded in a political interest . A court of law , however , should apply the law ; it was the law which formulated the right of access to a court , which therefore overrode a political interest . This applied all the more since the prohibition of genocide was a rule of ius cogens . The applicants further pointed to the size of the majority in LOC ORG ( DATE , the smallest possible ) as evidence of a trend towards recognising that ius cogens \u2013 in that case the prohibition of torture \u2013 could override immunities hitherto recognised in international law .", "CARDINAL . In holding that ORG had not itself perpetrated genocide , ORG had missed the point , which was that ORG had failed in its duty to prevent the genocide . Moreover , Dutchbat had connived in the genocide by cooperating with the ORG in deporting the civilian population from the GPE safe area and in helping to separate the men from the women and children despite indications that their lives were in jeopardy .", "CARDINAL . It made no difference for the purposes of the right of access to court , as guaranteed by LAW , whether or not there was a solvent debtor or whether or not ORG could claim immunity from civil suit in its own courts .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG had failed to go into the question whether ORG ought to have waived its immunity .", "CARDINAL . The applicants supplemented the summons with an explanatory memorandum ( schriftelijke toelichting ) , in which they argued at length that the immunity of ORG was always intended to be functional , not diplomatic . This was reflected by the wording of LAW . Although LAW , section QUANTITY of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the ORG suggested otherwise , it was subordinate to the LAW by virtue of LAW . Moreover , it remained possible \u2013 and was sometimes a moral , if not a legal obligation \u2013 to waive immunity , as in cases of serious human rights violations . This was all the more so since ORG had failed itself to provide for the settlement of disputes to which it might be a party , as it was required to by LAW , section CARDINAL of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of ORG .", "CARDINAL . An advisory opinion ( conclusie ) was submitted by the Procurator General ( procureur - generaal ) at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Procurator General distinguished between the immunity of GPE , which was based on their sovereign equality in international law , and the immunity of international organisations , which was intended to enable them to function . Citing PERSON and PERSON , he recognised that an international organisation \u2019s immunity from domestic jurisdiction might need to be set aside if no internal dispute resolution mechanism was available . In the present case , however , there was an internal alternative , provided by paragraph CARDINAL of the Agreement on the status of ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . For the remainder , the Procurator General expressed the view that ORG had based its judgment on a correct assessment of the competing interests involved . To the extent that the applicants argued otherwise , they had based their argument on misconstructions of ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE ( LJN BWCARDINAL ) . Its reasoning included the following passages :", "\u201c Basis and scope of the immunity of ORG", "CARDINAL NORP The immunity of ORG , which should be distinguished from the immunity of its functionaries and of experts performing missions for it , is based on LAW and LAW , section QUANTITY , of the Convention [ on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations ] . The latter provision , which elaborates on LAW [ of LAW ] , has rightly been construed by ORG \u2013 applying LAW on GPE \u2013 as granting ORG the most far - reaching immunity from jurisdiction , in the sense that it can not be summoned before any domestic court of the countries that are party to the Convention [ on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations ] .", "The basis and scope of this immunity , which is intended to ensure the functioning of ORG in complete independence and which for that reason alone serves a legitimate purpose , are thus different from the immunity from jurisdiction afforded to foreign GPE . As expressed in section CARDINALa of the LAW containing General Provisions on the Legislation of GPE ) , the latter immunity derives from general international law ( par in parem non habet imperium ) , and concerns only actions of a foreign ORG performed by the latter in the exercise of its governmental duty ( acta iure imperii ) .", "Immunity of ORG and access to a court", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ORG has ... , applying the criteria formulated by ORG and PERSON v.

It is observed that \u00a7 CARDINAL mentions \u2018 international organisations\u2019 without further explanation , but that DATE even leaving aside any consideration relating to the interrelation between LAW and CARDINAL of the Charter of ORG \u2013 there is no reason to assume that in referring to \u2018 international ORG the ORG wished to refer also to ORG , at least not as regards action taken by that organisation within the framework of LAW of LAW with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression ) .", "CARDINAL NORP The ( Security Council of the ) ORG has a special place within the international legal community , as has also been expressed in PERSON and PERSON v.

More generally , it is further recalled , as noted at paragraph CARDINAL above , that the LAW has to be interpreted in the light of any relevant rules and principles of international law applicable in relations between its Contracting Parties . The ORG has therefore had regard to CARDINAL complementary provisions of the LAW , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL , as interpreted by the ICJ ( see paragraph CARDINAL [ of the decision ] ) .", "CARDINAL . Of even greater significance is the imperative nature of the principal aim of the ORG [ ORG ] and , consequently , of the powers accorded to the ORG [ ORG ] under LAW to fulfil that aim . ...

In the present case , Chapter VII allowed the UNSC to adopt coercive measures in reaction to an identified conflict considered to threaten peace , namely UNSC Resolution CARDINAL establishing UNMIK and ORG .", "Since operations established by ORG under LAW UN Charter are fundamental to the mission of the ORG to secure international peace and security and since they rely for their effectiveness on support from member states , the LAW can not be interpreted in a manner which would subject the acts and omissions of Contracting Parties which are covered by ORG and occur prior to or in the course of such missions to the scrutiny of ORG . To do so would be to interfere with the fulfilment of the ORG \u2019s key mission in this field including , as argued by certain parties , with the effective conduct of its operations .

The acceptance therefore of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture entails that a ORG allegedly violating it can not invoke hierarchically lower rules ( in this case , those on ORG immunity ) to avoid the consequences of the illegality of its actions .

Due to the interplay of the jus cogens rule on prohibition of torture and the rules on State immunity , the procedural bar of State immunity is automatically lifted , because those rules , as they conflict with a hierarchically higher rule , do not produce any legal effect .
