The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the DATE - CARDINAL war in GPE , the applicant lived in GPE in a socially owned flat over which he had an occupancy right ( the concept of \u201c socially owned flats \u201d is described below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent administrative authority confirmed the applicant \u2019s occupancy right over the flat in PERSON , but stated , however , that the building in which the flat was located had been destroyed during the war .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the local authority to allocate him a replacement flat . However , he did not receive any reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the local authority before the ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , seeking to be allocated a replacement flat . On DATE ORG invited the local authority to submit a response to the applicant \u2019s claim . As they failed to do so , ORG adopted a judgment on DATE without a hearing , in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It held that the applicant was entitled to a replacement flat because his occupancy right over a destroyed flat had been confirmed by the competent administrative authority . Therefore , it ordered the local authority to allocate him a suitable replacement flat in GPE , in lieu of the one in respect of which he had had an occupancy right and which had been destroyed during the war . Pursuant to the aforementioned provision of LAW DATE , that judgment became final on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the local authority \u2019s request for restitutio in integrum . It would appear that they did not appeal to a higher court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant initiated enforcement proceedings . On DATE ORG refused to issue a writ of execution , stating that the judgment of DATE was not enforceable because it did not contain any indication of the location and the surface area of the replacement flat . That decision was upheld by ORG ( \" ORG \" ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG the LAW \u201d ) of the non - enforcement of the judgment of DATE . On DATE ORG upheld the rulings of the lower courts and instructed the applicant to start new civil proceedings against the local authority in order to establish the latter \u2019s precise obligation regarding the flat to be allocated to him . That decision was delivered to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the judgment of DATE remains unenforced . It would also appear that the applicant did not start new civil proceedings against the local authority .", "CARDINAL . In the former ORG practically all flats were built under the regime of \u201c social ownership \u201d . They were generally built by socially owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees , who became \u201c occupancy right holders \u201d . The rights of both the allocation right holders ( public bodies which nominally controlled the flats ) and the occupancy right holders were regulated by law ( LAW DATE , which is still in force in GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with this LAW , an occupancy right , once allocated , entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent , lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee . When occupancy right holders died , their rights transferred , as a matter of right , to their surviving spouses or registered members of their family who were also using the flat ( sections DATE and CARDINAL of this Act ) . The concept of \u201c social ownership \u201d was abandoned during the DATE - CARDINAL war . As a result , socially owned flats were effectively nationalised ( for more information about socially owned flats see PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE prescribed the procedure for repossession of pre - war flats and the rights of occupancy right holders . LAW provides that claims for repossession should be submitted to the competent administrative authority .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW of the Restitution of Flats Act DATE provides that the competent administrative authority shall decide on claims for repossession of flats which were damaged or destroyed during the war . A decision accepting such a claim should contain confirmation of the claimant \u2019s occupancy right over the destroyed / damaged flat , as well as an instruction that the occupancy right holder is entitled to its repossession in the event that the flat is reconstructed ( section CARDINAL of the Instruction ) .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , if a defendant who has been duly served with a plaintiff \u2019s claim fails to submit a written response to it within the set time - limit , the court shall accept the claim , if it has been so requested , unless it is manifestly ill - founded . A claim is manifestly ill - founded if it evidently contravenes the facts on which it is based or if the facts from the claim contravene the evidence proposed by the plaintiff or well - known facts ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of this Act ) . If a decision is taken in accordance with the aforementioned provision an appeal is not allowed ( section CARDINAL ) of this Act ) .", "CARDINAL .
