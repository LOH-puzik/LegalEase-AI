GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in DATE .", "The applicant and PERSON are a married couple . Their property is subject to the statutory matrimonial property regime of the community of increased assets ( PERSON ; see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "PERSON was the manager of CARDINAL limited liability companies in which he had invested MONEY ( DEM ) . The companies had taken out several loans for which GPE , as well as his son and wife , had provided security .", "On DATE and on CARDINAL DATE GPE pledged CARDINAL bonds ( of a total value of ORG CARDINAL ) to ORG as security for all present and future claims of the bank against him . Thereupon , the bank furnished a guarantee of ORG CARDINAL for a loan which ORG had received from a different bank and granted him CARDINAL loans .", "On DATE ORG gave GPE notice of termination of the loans and claimed their repayment . However , PERSON was unable to settle his debts .", "In DATE the claims arising from the CARDINAL bonds pledged by ORG became due . ORG arranged for the sum of money which had fallen due to be paid into PERSON \u2019s account with the bank , where it was charged with ORG debts .", "The applicant and PERSON have made their living since then from a small pension , financial aid granted by others and CARDINAL low - paid part - time jobs .", "On DATE the applicant , who was from then on represented by counsel throughout the proceedings , brought an action against ORG for restitution of the CARDINAL bonds or alternatively for payment of ORG CARDINAL . She claimed that the pledging of the bonds by her husband was void pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) . She argued that the companies managed by her husband had already been heavily indebted since DATE . Her husband \u2019s interests in his CARDINAL companies therefore no longer had any value . The defendant bank had been aware that the bonds constituted her husband \u2019s last property and she had not consented to his pledging the bonds as prescribed by section CARDINAL of LAW in such circumstances . As her husband did not want to claim restitution of the bonds himself , she had a right to restitution under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) .", "ORG pleaded that , already in DATE , it had set off ( see Relevant domestic law below ) its claim for repayment of ORG loan against the claim for restitution of the bonds .", "On DATE ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s action .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "Contrary to a previous undertaking allegedly given orally by the judge rapporteur in the hearing , ORG subsequently dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid for the proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant received a copy of the defendant \u2019s observations .", "On DATE ORG , having held a hearing on DATE , rejected the applicant \u2019s request under section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( see Relevant domestic law below ) to grant her an additional opportunity to reply in writing to the defendant \u2019s observations ( running to CARDINAL pages ) of DATE , which the applicant had received DATE before the hearing , and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "ORG noted that section CARDINAL of the Civil Code protected a spouse \u2019s interest in preserving the family \u2019s assets . However , this interest did not outweigh the interests of the other spouse \u2019s creditors under all circumstances . In particular , the Debtors ( Voidable Dispositions ) Act ( see Relevant domestic law below ) offered protection for the creditors of a spouse who had transferred his / her assets to the other spouse in order to exempt these assets from his / her LOC attachment . This did not mean , however , that section CARDINAL of LAW did not fully apply to heavily indebted spouses .", "ORG found that the applicant could not claim under section CARDINAL of the Civil Code the amount of money the defendant had received when the claims arising from the CARDINAL bonds had become due . It left open whether the bonds had constituted GPE \u2019s entire or almost entire property and whether the defendant had known this as required by section CARDINAL . This being assumed , the pledge of the bonds had been void and PERSON had initially had a claim against the defendant for payment of the amount of money the bank had obtained when the bonds were redeemed . However , the defendant bank had validly set off its own claim against GPE for repayment of the loans against ORG said claim by having the money obtained from the bonds paid into ORG account with the bank and by charging it with ORG debts .", "ORG , agreeing with the defendant , which had argued in its observations that it had set off its claim for repayment of the loans against the claim under section CARDINAL of LAW , considered the set - off to be valid . Section CARDINAL of LAW only allowed the applicant to enforce GPE \u2019s claim in her own name . Likewise , the protective purpose of sections CARDINAL and DATE of the Civil Code had not been impaired by the set - off . The said provisions did not shield a spouse from all reductions of the family \u2019s assets caused by the other spouse , in particular , by incurring liabilities which endangered the preservation of those assets . Creditors who had a claim for payment as a result of these liabilities could enforce their claim against the indebted spouse by execution against the debtor \u2019s property . Just as section CARDINAL of LAW did not give the other spouse a right to prevent compulsory execution , it did not protect that spouse from a set - off if the creditor had a claim against the spouse who had disposed of his / her property contrary to section CARDINAL . Instead of attaching the disposing spouse \u2019s claim for payment against the bank , the latter could set off its own claim for repayment of the loan against ORG claim .", "The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG . She argued that the NORP courts had interpreted sections CARDINAL and DATE of the Civil Code in a manner which disregarded her right to respect for her family life as protected by LAW . ORG had also refused to allow her an opportunity to reply in writing to the defendant \u2019s observations , which she had received only DATE before the hearing . Furthermore , her trial had been unfair , in particular , in that the undertaking of the judge rapporteur of ORG that she would be granted legal aid had not been fulfilled .", "On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "Sections CARDINAL of the Civil Code lay down rules concerning the matrimonial property of married couples .", "The property of spouses is subject to the statutory matrimonial property regime of the community of increased assets ( Zugewinngemeinschaft ) if they have not stipulated in a marriage contract that different rules shall apply ( section LOC \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . The property of the husband and wife does not become joint property . However , any increase in the assets of either spouse during the marriage is equalized on termination of the community of increased assets ( for example , by death or divorce , see section LOC \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "There are certain limitations on a spouse \u2019s right to dispose of his or her assets . In particular , according to section QUANTITY , a spouse may only ( agree to ) dispose of the entirety of his or her assets with the other spouse \u2019s prior or subsequent consent . The approval of guardianship courts may be substituted for the other spouse \u2019s consent to the transaction under certain conditions : if the transaction is in line with a proper administration of the assets and if the other spouse has refused his or her consent without good cause ( section QUANTITY of LAW ) .", "Section CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that if a spouse has disposed of his or her assets without the other spouse \u2019s necessary consent , the other spouse is also entitled to enforce in court the claims emanating from the invalidity of the transaction .", "The Debtors ( Voidable Dispositions ) Act ( Anfechtungsgesetz ) of CARDINAL DATE lays down rules for the contestation by creditors of a debtor \u2019s transactions which have put the creditors at a disadvantage .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of that LAW provides that a creditor may contest a transaction which has been entered into by the debtor , with the intention of putting his creditors at a disadvantage , within DATE if the other party to the transaction was aware of the debtor \u2019s intent at the time of the transaction . According to section QUANTITY , the creditors may , under certain circumstances , also contest a contract involving remuneration between the debtor and a person having a close relationship with him or her , if the creditors are directly put at a disadvantage by the contract .", "If CARDINAL persons have obligations of a similar nature against each other ( in particular , the obligation to pay off a debt ) , each party may declare the set - off of his / her own claim against the claim of the other party under certain circumstances , in particular under the condition that the claim of the party effecting the set - off is already due ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "The set - off is effected by way of a declaration to the other party ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) and results in both claims becoming extinct ( with retroactive effect ) as from the time when both claims had first become subject to setting - off ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "Section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( which is applicable to proceedings before ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) lays down rules on additional written pleadings after the hearing . If CARDINAL party to the proceedings is unable to reply to the submissions of the other in the course of the hearing because that party had not been informed in due time of those submissions before the hearing , the court may , on the party \u2019s request , grant that party leave to give explanations in writing after the hearing within a period fixed by the court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
