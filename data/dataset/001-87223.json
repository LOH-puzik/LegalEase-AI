LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient", "JUDGES": "Antonella Mularoni;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Nona Tsotsoria", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and , at the time of lodging his application , he had been serving a custodial sentence at FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant - together with an accomplice - of attempted drug dealing in large quantities ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of LAW as then in force ) . The court established that the offence had been disclosed using a \u201c Criminal Conduct Simulation Model \u201d ( \u201c the model \u201d ) , which had been authorised by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court found that on DATE V , a policeman acting as an undercover agent under the model , had met the applicant and , during their conversation on various topics , asked where he could get psychotropic drugs . The applicant had said that he could procure and sell samples to the policeman straight away , and more thereafter if the samples were good . The samples would cost CARDINAL LTL per QUANTITY , depending on the quantities required . He refused to lower the price for the first transaction , but suggested that it might be cheaper thereafter if V needed a regular supply . However , the officer replied that he could not wait and they agreed to telephone each other on the matter . V had to undergo a hospital intervention . Thereafter it was the applicant who contacted V , suggesting a meeting so that he could provide V with drug samples . On DATE , the applicant sold V some drugs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V had telephoned the applicant , requesting more drugs for a total sum of CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant provided V with QUANTITY of amphetamines . He said that he had around QUANTITY of drugs ( amphetamines ) and that the price would be lower next time . The applicant and his accomplice were arrested immediately . The applicant pleaded guilty to the attempted drug offence .", "CARDINAL . The court questioned V as an anonymous witness , outside the courtroom via an audio relay . His identity was not disclosed in order to protect him and the proper functioning of the police drug squad . At that stage the defence did not put any questions to ORG After his testimony had been read out by the trial judge , the defence formulated some supplementary questions which were put to him by the judge and answered . The other evidence examined by the court included the transcripts of the conversations between V and the applicant , the testimony of another police officer who acted as V \u2019s back up during the operation , their supervising officer , the testimony of the applicant and his co - accused and an expert \u2019s conclusions .", "CARDINAL . The documents relating to the authorisation of the model were classified as secret and were not disclosed to the defence because they would have disclosed the identity of the police officers involved and the operational methods of the drug squad . The Government contended that the applicant was not , however , denied access to information about the execution of the model . In their submissions to the ORG , the Government provided further information about it . The police had information about the applicant \u2019s continued large scale drug dealings in GPE and abroad under the nickname of \u201c PERSON \u201d . CARDINAL police officers were authorised to contact the applicant and his associates and , should their suspicions prove to be founded , they were authorised to procure drugs from him . The steps to be taken and the equipment to be used to obtain proof were set out in the model , which was authorised for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Defence counsel , in his final submissions to the trial court , contended that the applicant had been incited to commit the offence by the undercover police officer , who had acted unlawfully . Consequently , the latter \u2019s evidence could not be relied on . Counsel requested that the applicant \u2019s acts be qualified as an attempted offence , for which a milder sentence would be appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The trial court concluded that the use of the model in the case had been lawful . It observed inter alia as follows :", "\u201c [ T]he ORG is used to collect evidence about the criminal activities of a particular person . That is what happened in the present case . Having obtained information that the defendant ... was selling psychotropic substances , the police officer - whose identity was concealed - expressed his wish to get some drugs . The subsequent activities of [ the applicant ] , i.e. , the selling of a large quantity of drugs , were in part determined by the conduct of the police officer . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court acknowledged that the applicant \u2019s conduct had been influenced by Officer V from the outset , and commented at the sentencing stage that it had not been established the applicant had sold or tried to sell drugs to anyone other than this officer . The applicant was convicted of the attempted offence and sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , as well as to the confiscation of CARDINAL NORP Litai ( \u201c LTL \u201d ; MONEY [ \u201c ORG \u201d ] ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining inter alia that V had overstepped the legitimate limits of investigation by influencing and inciting him to sell a large quantity of drugs . In his view , this warranted a lesser penalty . The Government contended that he did not dispute the finding of the first instance court that the authorisation of the model had been lawful and , consequently , that he had been involved in drug dealing previously . The parties did not request that the evidence be re - heard de novo .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the conviction , considering that the applicant was guilty of a completed offence , not a mere attempt . The court thus re - classified the conviction under LAW of LAW and increased the sentence to DATE imprisonment . With respect to the applicant \u2019s entrapment allegations , the court noted :", "\u201c [ I]n establishing the persons involved in drug - dealing , [ the officers ] did not overstep the limits of ORG . ... [ T]he police have only uncovered the ring of persons committing crimes and have discontinued their criminal activities . The officers joined in the crime that was already taking place ... Having established the group of accomplices , the officers discontinued their criminal activities , but did not influence or incite them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal . He alleged that the actions of V had been unlawful . He could have discontinued the crime on DATE , when the applicant had handed over the drug samples . However , V had offered to buy more drugs for a price significantly higher than their market value . The applicant alleged that V had thus provoked him into selling drugs in large quantities . According to the Government , the aim of this appeal was thus to receive a reduction in sentence .", "CARDINAL . ORG partially dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal on DATE . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c In the present case , ORG ... was applied in order to protect society and the ORG from the challenges posed by the consumption and illegal circulation of drugs and psychotropic substances . The model was sanctioned by ORG , in view of the possession of information about [ the applicant ] selling narcotic substances . Such data ... is a lawful ground for the use of the model .", "By entering into contact with the applicant and offering to buy psychotropic substances from him ... , V only joined in the criminal activity of [ the applicant ] and uncovered his accomplice . Such actions can not be considered to be entrapment ( nusikaltimo provokavimas ) : it appears from the case file that [ the applicant ] was not subject to any pressure ... [ The applicant \u2019s ] allegation that the police undercover agent induced ( paskatino ) a person who had never offended before to commit a serious crime is unsubstantiated . On the contrary , the use of [ the model ] helped stop the criminal activity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s conviction was again re - classified as an attempt to sell drugs in large quantities ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the new Criminal Code ) , but the sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment was retained .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice , as well as the relevant international law , concerning police undercover activities and criminal conduct simulation models , have been summarised in the judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON GPE ( [ ORG ] no .
