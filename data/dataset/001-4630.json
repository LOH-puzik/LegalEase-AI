POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , a NORP citizen born in DATE , is retired and resides in GPE .", "The facts of the case as submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows :", "In DATE the Veterans and ORG ( GPE do PERSON i PERSON ) informed the applicant that the ORG had instituted ex officio proceedings pursuant to the DATE Act on NORP and ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) during the post - war period in order to verify whether under this legislation the applicant was entitled to retain his veteran status . The applicant was requested to furnish information relating to the grounds on which he had acquired this status in accordance with the provisions of the DATE LAW ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "By a letter of DATE the applicant informed the ORG that during the Second World War he had participated in the activities of the NORP underground ORG PERSON ) , that during his service in ORG ( NORP GPE ) in GPE in DATE he had been carrying out normal police duties such as maintaining public order , and that he had participated in combating the Werwolf , the post - war NORP underground paramilitary organisation .", "", "By a decision of DATE the Director of the NORP and ORG divested the applicant of his veteran status . It was established that the applicant had served from DATE to DATE in the former ORG . In his application for admission to ORG , which the applicant had submitted in DATE , he had stated that during his service he had actively participated in the armed struggle by the reactionary underground resistance . In his curriculum vitae which had been attached to this application , the applicant had stated that \u201c immediately after the liberation of GPE ... I had started my service in LAW of ORG in GPE from where I had been sent to participate in the armed struggle with bands and with the reactionary underground resistance ( \u201c natychmiast po wyzwoleniu Sosnowca ... rozpocz\u0105\u0142em prac\u0119 w III PERSON w GPE , sk\u0105d by\u0142em w\u0142\u0105czony do walk z bandami i reakcyjnym podziemiem \u201d ) . The applicant had subsequently acquired his veteran status by virtue of a decision of ORG DATE , made on the basis of a certificate issued by ORG of ORG . This certificate had confirmed that he had been serving therein from DATE and that throughout this period he had participated in the armed struggle by the reactionary underground resistance forces . The Director considered that the applicant fell within the scope of LAW read together with LAW of the DATE Act which provided , inter alia , that persons who had served in the former internal security services were to be divested of their veteran status . As the applicant belonged to the category of persons who , under the applicable legal provisions , were to be deprived of veteran status , the decision was justified and in accordance with the law .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision . He argued that the decision was unlawful . He emphasised that he had been serving in ORG for DATE and that his participation in fighting armed NORP groups during the war could not be regarded as a struggle to consolidate people \u2019s power .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision under appeal . The ORG considered that the administrative authority had failed to establish all facts relevant for the legal assessment of the applicant \u2019s case in that it had entirely disregarded the contents of the applicant \u2019s letter of DATE in which he had stated that he had been involved in the clandestine fight of ORG against the NORP troops occupying GPE and that his service in ORG had consisted of fighting the NORP and of ordinary police functions such as maintaining public order . The ORG observed that , under LAW , combating the Werwolf was to be regarded as giving rise to veteran status . Thus , the administrative authority had to establish what armed forces had been active near GPE during the applicant \u2019s service and what had been the armed formations in which the applicant had fought .", "On DATE the Director of the Veterans and ORG divested the applicant of his veteran status .", "The administrative authority took into consideration a reply of ORG to its request of DATE for detailed information concerning the applicant \u2019s service in ORG . It had been stated in this reply of CARDINAL DATE that it had not transpired from the applicant \u2019s personal file that during his service he had participated in the armed combat of any organisation \u2019s fight for the independence of GPE . Therefore , as the applicant \u2019s veteran status had been awarded to him on the basis of his participation in the struggle to consolidate people \u2019s power ( \u201c utrwalanie w\u0142adzy ludowej \u201d ) , he had to be divested of this status pursuant to LAW .", "On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , the Director of ORG refused to grant the applicant veteran status on the basis of his service in ORG ( PERSON ) during the Second World War , considering that the documents submitted in support of his claim were wholly inadequate to establish the relevant facts and , consequently , to grant such status ( \u201c nie daj\u0105 absolutnie podstaw do przyznania uprawnie\u0144 kombatanckich \u201d ) .", "The applicant again appealed to ORG against both decisions . He submitted that both decisions were unlawful . He argued that he could not reasonably be expected to submit any new evidence relating to his service in ORG , and in particular any testimony of living witnesses , given the lapse of time since the relevant events .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the withdrawal of his veteran status on the basis of his service in ORG .", "ORG had regard to the fact that the administrative authority , following the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE , had held an enquiry as to the nature of the applicant \u2019s activities during his service in the ORG in DATE . In the light of the letter of ORG of CARDINAL DATE , it could not be established that the applicant had in fact participated in \u201c consolidating the people \u2019s power \u201d . Therefore , the original decision of DATE bestowing veteran status on the applicant had lacked any sound factual basis . Consequently , the ORG concluded that the contested decision divesting the applicant of this status was in conformity with the law .", "ORG further set aside the decision concerning the refusal to grant veteran status to the applicant in respect of his service in ORG and remitted the case for reconsideration by the first - instance authority . The ORG considered that the administrative authority , when considering that the evidence submitted by the applicant was \u201c wholly inadequate \u201d for a finding that he had in fact served therein , had significantly overstepped the margin of appreciation applicable in the assessment of evidence , as set out in the relevant provisions of LAW . These proceedings are apparently still pending .", "Relevant domestic law", "CARDINAL . Veteran status", "The Law of DATE on NORP and Other Victims of War and Post - War Repression repealed the PERSON of CARDINAL DATE on the Special Status of Veterans . Under LAW , participation in the armed struggle against the reactionary underground resistance ( \u201c walka o utrwalenie w\u0142adzy ludowej \u201d ) gave rise to the entitlement to veteran status .", "The CARDINAL Act enacted new criteria on which veteran status can be granted . Pursuant to LAW , the following persons , inter alia , are entitled to acquire veteran status :", "a ) those having served in ORG ( ORG ) and in the NORP military formations organised during the Second World War within the ORG armies ;", "b ) those having served in the NORP underground resistance organisations , including military formations organised in the framework of these organisations DATE ;", "c ) those having served in the ORG armies and in the underground resistance organisations operating in the territories of the Allies in DATE , with the exception of the GPE and other special organisations acting to the detriment of the NORP nation ;", "d ) those having served in the NORP underground military formations and organisations fighting for the independence of GPE within the borders of GPE DATE and within the NORP post - war borders , in the period from the arrival of ORG ( GPE ) on NORP territory until DATE ;", "e ) those having served in the armed struggle against the formations of ORG ( ORG ) and against the Werwolf .", "The DATE Act took away the entitlement to veteran status accorded by virtue of LAW from certain categories of persons who had served in DATE in various organisations and ORG organs whose purpose was to combat the political opponents of the", "communist regime . In particular , LAW provides , inter alia , that a person who had served in ORG ( \" aparat bezpiecze\u0144stwa publicznego \" ) was not entitled to acquire veteran status , and those persons who had acquired it , were to be divested of it .", "ORG is defined as being the State organs , partly comprising special armed forces and political police , modelled on the ORG and the ORG , established on DATE with a view to combating , suppressing and eliminating groups of political opposition , including the post - war underground resistance against Communism . These organs were also competent to conduct criminal investigations under the rules of criminal procedure .

The periods of veteran service are taken into account in calculating the periods giving rise to seniority . The same periods are multiplied by CARDINAL in calculating periods giving rise to a retirement pension . Veterans who remain in employment are entitled to DATE additional paid leave per year . They are entitled to retire earlier than other employees : women at DATE , and men at DATE , if they have satisfied another requirement for the acquisition of a retirement pension , i.e. if they have worked for periods set out in LAW . The retired veterans are further entitled to the special veterans ' benefit , paid together with their retirement pension as a certain fixed sum .", "DATE CARDINAL LAW provides that persons who have lost their veteran status which was granted to them on the basis of LAW , retain the social insurance benefits to which they are entitled pursuant to the generally applicable social insurance laws , in particular the laws governing retirement pensions .
