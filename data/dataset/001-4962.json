He was later recaptured and in DATE was convicted of DATE offences in connection with his escape . He received sentences ranging from DATE imprisonment , which the court ordered should run consecutively with the determinate sentences but concurrently with the life sentence .", "On DATE the applicant was released on licence pursuant to the powers granted to the Secretary of ORG under section PERSON ) of the Prison ( GPE ) Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The applicant signed a document of release which contained the following note :", "\u201c A person serving a sentence of life imprisonment who is released on licence is liable under the provisions of LAW ( GPE ) Act DATE to be recalled to prison at any time by order of the Secretary of ORG . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant was arrested at his home .

[ The Secretary of ORG ] has decided on grounds of risk and public interest that it would be inappropriate for you to retain your status as a life licensee . \u201d", "The applicant was also informed that he could make representations to the Secretary of ORG by way of petition . As was regular practice at the time , the applicant was not afforded the opportunity to make such representations before the licence was revoked ; nor was he provided with any documents about the matters considered by the Secretary of ORG when deciding to make the order .", "By petition dated DATE addressed to the Secretary of ORG the applicant stated that he had not been found guilty of any offence and had not been given an opportunity to refute any allegation made against him .

Although an acknowledgement was sent , it does not appear that a detailed reply was furnished before the applicant commenced judicial review proceedings on DATE .", "On DATE the prosecution dropped the charges against the applicant . The matter of the revocation of the applicant \u2019s licence was then referred back to the Secretary of ORG for reconsideration . In a letter dated DATE ORG informed the applicant that the charges against him had been withdrawn and that the Secretary of ORG would again consider his case \u201c in the light of all information available . \u201d The applicant was invited to make any written representations which he might wish the Secretary of ORG to consider before deciding on his suitability for release on life licence .", "In a letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the Secretary of ORG in the following terms :", "\u201c Our client instructs us to request copies of all material upon which the Secretary of ORG will rely , in order to make effective representations in respect of his release . Our client instructs us that he will submit a petition as to why he should be released , however , we are instructed that any representations he can make at this stage will inevitably be limited in the absence of any knowledge of the concerns the Secretary of ORG may have in relation to our client \u2019s release . \u201d", "The applicant submitted a petition dated DATE to the Secretary of ORG , complaining of the procedure which had been adopted in the revocation of his licence and asking that the licence be reinstated as soon as possible .

Following his release on licence on DATE , the applicant amended his statement of claim in order to limit the relief sought to a declaration that the revocation was unlawful . He argued , inter alia , that he should have been given an opportunity to make representations before the licence was revoked and been provided with the reasons for its revocation .", "On DATE the Lord Chief Justice , Lord PERSON , gave judgment on the application . Having reviewed domestic case - law he concluded :", "\u201c It is now clear from the authorities that fairness requires as a general rule that ( a ) a prisoner whose licence is revoked must receive at some stage an opportunity to make representations about the revocation and ( b ) in order to do so effectively he must be made aware of the reasons for the revocation if he does not already know them \u2026 We do not consider , however , that it is possible to lay down general rules about the stage at which the opportunity to make representations must be afforded or about the extent of any exception to the obligation to give reasons based upon the protection of sources of information who might be put in danger . In our view these are matters in respect of which much may turn upon the circumstances of the individual case and it would not be useful to prescribe procedures in any greater degree of detail .", "Nor can we say with sufficient precision on the facts before us whether the applicant was prejudiced in the present case by the procedure adopted to an extent sufficient to make that procedure unlawful . He had the opportunity immediately after his licence was revoked to make representations by petition , but did not avail himself of this until DATE had passed , and then only to complain that he had not been told why his licence had been revoked . Nor did he at any time make any representations about the substance of the case , the validity of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision to revoke the licence and the grounds for doing so \u2026 \u201d", "The Lord Chief Justice stated with regard to the above that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances to make a declaration about the lawfulness of the revocation of the applicant \u2019s licence .", "According to the applicant , he did not apply for leave to appeal against the decision since it represented a correct statement of domestic law and any appeal would have had no reasonable prospects of success ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
