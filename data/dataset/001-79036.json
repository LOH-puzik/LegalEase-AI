POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Administrative proceedings;Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing;Impartial tribunal)", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , the owner of real property which she had been renting , filed a civil action for damages against the tenant . On DATE her action was dismissed by a judgment of the ORG . The applicant appealed against the judgment . On DATE her appeal was dismissed by a judgment of ORG . Judge PERSON was the judge rapporteur in the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment through a panel of ORG . On DATE her cassation appeal was rejected by a decision of that panel . In its written grounds for the decision , the panel stated that the cassation appeal did not comply with a procedural requirement set out in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW in that it did not include \u201c arguments showing that its examination [ by ORG ] would be justified \u201d within the meaning of this provision ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The mere fact that the cassation appeal contained arguments to show the grounds on which it had been lodged was insufficient for the appeal to be declared admissible . The panel further stated that this shortcoming was serious and as such could not be remedied .", "Judge PERSON presided over the panel which gave this decision and also acted as the judge rapporteur on the admissibility issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against the decision of DATE , challenging inter alia the composition of the court . She submitted that the fact that the same judge had sat on a panel giving a second - instance judgment on the merits and subsequently on a panel rejecting a cassation appeal against that judgment rendered the proceedings unfair .", "CARDINAL . On DATE her appeal was dismissed by a decision of ORG . The court first noted the case - law of ORG on the interpretation of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW . It referred to its numerous judgments to the effect that a shortcoming in a cassation appeal which took the form of a failure to enumerate the circumstances justifying its examination was of a serious and irreparable character , which could not be remedied by requesting the appellant to rectify it . It further noted that this requirement was closely linked to the examination of the grounds on which ORG could refuse to entertain a cassation appeal , as listed in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely if it considered that no significant legal issue arose in the case or where there were no legal issues involved which would give rise to serious doubts or to discrepancies in the case - law .", "CARDINAL . It referred to the applicant \u2019s objection in CARDINAL sentence only :", "\u201c The fact that the judge , who took part in the judgment against which the cassation appeal was subsequently lodged , participated in a decision by which this appeal was found inadmissible is of no significance \u201d .", "CARDINAL . DATE LAW , insofar as relevant , reads :", "\u201c Everyone shall have the right to a fair and public hearing of his case , without undue delay , before a competent , impartial and independent court . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL reads in its relevant part :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL . A judge is ex lege excluded from dealing with the case : ( ... )", "CARDINAL ) in cases where he participated in a contested decision of a lower instance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Supreme Court decision of CARDINAL DATE ( II CZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) reads in its relevant part :", "\u201c A judge who participated in a judgment is not excluded from giving subsequent decisions in the course of so - called \u201c inter - instance proceedings \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Supreme Court decision of DATE ( V ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) states , inter alia , that LAW sets out formal requirements which a cassation appeal has to satisfy . It is for the second - instance court to examine whether these requirements have been met .", "The provisions of the Code determine when a judge is ex lege excluded from dealing with the case . It does not follow from these provisions that a judge who has given a second - instance judgment is to be excluded from participation in a subsequent examination of whether a cassation appeal complies with the formal requirements provided for by the LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG reached the same conclusion in its decision of DATE ( IPZ CARDINAL ) . It considered that the examination of the admissibility of the cassation appeal could not be said to have anything in common with the examination of the merits of the case , because the former has a purely formal character .", "CARDINAL . A party to civil proceedings could , at the material time , lodge a cassation appeal with ORG against a final judicial decision of a second - instance court which has terminated the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code as applicable at the material time listed the grounds on which a cassation appeal could be lodged . It read as follows :", "\u201c The cassation appeal may be based on the following grounds :", "CARDINAL ) a breach of substantive law as a result of its erroneous interpretation or wrongful application ;", "CARDINAL ) a breach of procedural provisions , if that defect could significantly affect the outcome of the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL , as applicable at the material time , specified the requirements of a cassation appeal . It read in its relevant part :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL . A cassation appeal should include :", "CARDINAL ) an indication of the decision under appeal together with information as to whether the appeal is lodged against this decision in its entirety or in part only ;", "CARDINAL ) an indication of the grounds for the cassation appeal ;", "CARDINAL ) arguments showing that its examination would be justified ;", "CARDINAL ) a motion to have the decision under appeal quashed or amended , specifying also the scope of the motion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL , as applicable at the material time , read as follows :", "\u201c A second - instance court rejects in a hearing held in camera a cassation appeal lodged after a prescribed time - limit or which is inadmissible on other grounds ( ... ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The reasons justifying the examination of a cassation appeal by ORG can be inferred a contrario from Article CARDINAL of LAW of Procedure which , as applicable at that time , read , in its relevant part :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG may refuse to entertain the cassation appeal , if :", "i ) there is no appearance of any significant legal issue in the case ;", "ii ) there is no need for the interpretation of provisions raising serious doubts or giving rise to discrepancies in the courts\u2019 case - law ;", "iii ) the appeal is manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL shall not apply if the judicial decision challenged manifestly breached the law or where the proceedings are invalid in law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , an appeal to ORG was available against a decision of the appellate court rejecting a cassation appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the provisions of LAW DATE a cassation appeal is available against judgments of ORG to ORG . As an appeal on points of law , it has the same character as a cassation appeal in civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in reply to a legal question put to it by its .President , adopted an explanatory resolution . It observed that serious difficulties had arisen in the judicial practice of the administrative courts as to whether a judge who had given a second - instance judgment had to be excluded from participation in a subsequent examination of the compliance of a cassation appeal with the formal requirements provided for by LAW .", "The court referred to the fair hearing standard established by LAW . It noted that the case - law of ORG emphasised the importance of judicial impartiality . However , the examination of whether a given court satisfied this requirement should always be carried out with reference to the facts of an individual case and the modalities of a given type of judicial procedure .", "The court observed that under the applicable laws an appeal on points of law to ORG was available against a judgment of a regional administrative court . Hence , it was obvious that the parties had a right to have their administrative case heard by CARDINAL impartial judicial instances . The need to secure such impartiality served as a ratio legis for the exclusion of a judge from the examination of the same case in CARDINAL judicial instances . However , the court stressed that the requirement of impartiality was complied with if the same judge was prevented from examining twice the merits of the same case .", "The court further observed that the examination of the admissibility of a cassation appeal in administrative proceedings could be identified neither with the examination of the merits of such an appeal , nor with the examination of whether the impugned first - instance judgment was well - founded . A distinction had to be made between the examination of the admissibility and the latter CARDINAL types of examination which essentially related to the substance of the first - instance judgment . It held that there were no grounds on which to consider that a judge involved in the examination of the merits of the case should not be allowed to sit on a panel examining the admissibility of the cassation appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
