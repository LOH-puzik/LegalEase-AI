ORG ( hereafter PERSON ) has had a long history as an actual refugee camp . In DATE it was a safe haven for ethnic NORP fleeing GPE ; in DATE , a shelter for refugees from GPE ; and in DATE , a place of refuge for NORP . It can no longer be described , truthfully , as a refugee camp , however .

They appeared to be allowed to go outside the barracks during the afternoons . The facility is surrounded by a chain - link fence topped with barbed wire . Signs of its history as a former refugee camp are abundant in the form of old unused shelters with faded ORG logos and an overgrown soccer field that have not been used in DATE , despite a rather comical attempt by the ORG administrator to give Human Rights a guided tour intended to show that old classrooms and recreational facilities are still being used by the detainees .", "The women and child were housed in a separate building that the women told ORG they had recently been asked to clean prior to a visit by another delegation . The administrator showed ORG a large - screen television set in CARDINAL of the women 's private rooms , but failed to note that the TV was not plugged in and did n't work at all .

The guards say , ' If you do n't like the food , go to the market and buy your own . ' \"", "The main complaint , however , is that the detainees are not informed how long they will remain in detention . ORG spoke privately with a man who appeared to be an informal leader of the \" NORP \" at GPE . He said that the NORP numbered CARDINAL of the CARDINAL detainees in the camp and that most , including him , had already been held there for DATE and had no idea how much longer they would stay there . \" Just tell us what to do , \" he said . \" Give us a sentence . If they let us leave , we will work and feed our families . Let us leave or kill us . \u201d", "Even though the conditions at GPE did not appear to be nearly as bad as at PERSON , tensions between detainees and guards were very high . The camp administrator told ORG , \" Despite the good conditions here , there is an enmity towards us . \"", "On TIME after ORG visit there was a riot at GPE . The causes of the riot and the response of the security forces were under investigation when ORG left the country .
