{"ITEMID": "001-57564", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 1986, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF REES v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 12", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG The applicant , a NORP citizen born in DATE , lives at GPE Wells in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG At birth the applicant possessed all the physical and biological characteristics of a child of the female sex , and was consequently recorded in the register of births as a female , under the name PERSON . However , already from a tender age the child started to exhibit masculine behaviour and was ambiguous in appearance . In DATE , after learning that the transsexual state was a medically recognised condition , she sought treatment . She was prescribed methyl testosterone ( a hormonal treatment ) and started to develop secondary male characteristics .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , the applicant - who will henceforth be referred to in the masculine - changed his name to PERSON and subsequently , in DATE , to PERSON . He has been living as a male ever since . After the change of name , the applicant requested and received a new passport containing his new names . The prefix \" Mr. \" was , however , at that time denied to him .", "CARDINAL . Surgical treatment for physical sexual conversion began in DATE with a bilateral masectomy and led to the removal of feminine external characteristics . The costs of the medical treatment , including the surgical procedures , were borne by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant made several unsuccessful efforts from DATE onwards to persuade Members of ORG to introduce a Private Member \u2019s PERSON to resolve the problems of transsexuals . Representations were also made by him , and by a number of Members of ORG on his behalf , to ORG to secure the alteration of his birth certificate to show his sex as male , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE his solicitor wrote to the Registrar General making a formal request under ORG ) of ORG , on the ground that there had been \" a mistake in completing the Register \" . In support of his request , the applicant submitted a medical report by Dr. PERSON . The report stated that , in Dr. PERSON \u2019s opinion , of the CARDINAL criteria of sex - namely chromosomal sex , gonadal sex , apparent sex ( external genitalia and body form ) and psychological sex , the last was the most important as it determined the individual \u2019s social activities and role in adult life , and it was also , in his view , pre - determined at birth , though not evident until later in life . Dr. PERSON considered that as the applicant \u2019s psychological sex was male , he should be assigned male .", "On DATE the Registrar General refused the application to alter the ORG . He stated that the report on the applicant \u2019s psychological sex was not decisive and that , \" in the absence of any medical report on the other agreed criteria ( chromosomal sex , gonadal sex and apparent sex ) \" , he was \" unable to consider whether an error ( had been ) made at birth registration in that the child was not of the sex recorded \" . No further evidence in support of the applicant \u2019s request was subsequently submitted .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant considers himself a man and is socially accepted as such . Except for the birth certificate , all official documents DATE refer to him by his new name and the prefix \" Mr. \" , where such prefix is used . The prefix was added to his name in his passport in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the GPE sexual reassignment operations are permitted without legal formalities . The operations and treatment may , as in the case of Mr. PERSON , be carried out under ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LANGUAGE law a person is entitled to adopt such first names or surname as he or she wishes and to use these new names without any restrictions or formalities , except in connection with the practice of some professions where the use of the new names may be subject to certain formalities ( see , inter alia , GPE \u2019s ORG , CARDINALth ed . , vol . CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) . For the purposes of record and to obviate the doubt and confusion which a change of name is likely to involve , the person concerned very frequently makes , as did Mr. PERSON , a declaration in the form of a \" deed poll \" which may be enrolled with ORG .", "The new names are valid for purposes of legal identification ( see GPE \u2019s ORG , loc . cit . , para . CARDINAL ) and may be used in documents such as passports , driving licences , car registration books , national insurance cards , medical cards , tax codings and social security papers . The new names are also entered on the electoral roll .", "CARDINAL . Civil status certificates or equivalent current identity documents are not in use or required in GPE . Where some form of identification is needed , this is normally met by the production of a driving licence or a passport . These and other identity documents may , according to the prevailing practice , be issued in the adopted names of the person in question with a minimum of formality . In the case of transsexuals , the documents are also issued so as to be in all respects consistent with the new identity . Thus , the practice is to allow the transsexual to have a current photograph in his or her passport and the prefix \" Mr. \" , \" Mrs. \" , \" Ms. \" or \" Miss \" , as appropriate , before his or her adopted names .", "CARDINAL . ORG The system of civil registration of births , deaths and marriages was established by statute in GPE and GPE in DATE . Registration of births is at present governed by ORG \" the CARDINAL LAW \" ) . The entry into force of this LAW entailed no material change to the law in force in DATE , the date of the applicant \u2019s birth . The DATE Act requires that the birth of every child be registered by ORG for the area in which the child is born . The particulars to be entered are prescribed in regulations made under LAW .", "A birth certificate takes the form either of an authenticated copy of the entry in the register of births or of an extract from the register . A certificate of the latter kind , known as a \" short certificate of birth \" , is in a form prescribed and contains such particulars as are prescribed by regulations made under LAW . The particulars so prescribed are the name and surname , sex , date of birth and place of birth of the individual .", "An entry in a birth register and the certificate derived therefrom are records of facts at the time of the birth . Thus , in GPE and GPE the birth certificate constitutes a document revealing not current identity , but historical facts . The system is intended to provide accurate and authenticated evidence of the events themselves and also to enable the establishment of the connections of families for purposes related to succession , legitimate descent and distribution of property . The registration records also form the basis for a comprehensive range of vital statistics and constitute an integral and essential part of the statistical study of population and its growth , medical and fertility research and the like .", "CARDINAL . ORG The DATE LAW provides for the correction of clerical errors , such as the incorrect statement or omission of DATE of the birth , and for the correction of factual errors ; however , in the latter case , an amendment can be made only if the error occurred when the birth was registered . The birth register may also , within DATE from the date of registration , be altered to give or change the name of a child and re - registration of a birth is permitted where the child has been legitimated . In addition , under LAW , where a child is adopted , the register of births is to be marked with the word \" adopted \" ; the adoption is also registered in LAW and a short certificate of birth may be obtained which contains no reference to parentage or adoption .", "CARDINAL . ORG The criteria for determining the sex of the person to be registered are not laid down in the DATE Act nor in any of the regulations made under it . However , the practice of ORG is to use exclusively the biological criteria : chromosomal , gonadal and genital sex . The fact that it becomes evident later in life that the person \u2019s \" psychological sex \" is at variance with these biological criteria is not considered to imply that the initial entry was a factual error and , accordingly , any request to have the initial entry changed on this ground will be refused . Only in cases of a clerical error , or where the apparent and genital sex of the child was wrongly identified or in case of biological intersex , i.e. cases in which the biological criteria are not congruent , will a change of the initial entry be contemplated and it is necessary to adduce medical evidence that the initial entry was incorrect . However , no error is accepted to exist in the birth entry of a person who undergoes medical and surgical treatment to enable that person to assume the role of the opposite sex .", "CARDINAL . ORG The birth registers and the indexes of all the entries are public . However , the registers themselves are not readily accessible to the general public as identification of the index reference would require prior knowledge not only of the name under which the person concerned was registered , but also of the approximate date and place of birth and LOC .", "CARDINAL . ORG The law does not require that the birth certificate be produced for any particular purpose , although it may in practice be requested by certain institutions and employers .", "In particular , a birth certificate has in general to accompany a first application for a passport , although not for its renewal or replacement . A birth certificate is also generally ( though not invariably ) required by insurance companies when issuing pension or annuity policies , but not for the issue of motor or household policies nor , as a rule , for the issue of a life insurance policy . It may also be required when enrolling at a university and when applying for employment , inter alia , with the Government .", "CARDINAL . ORG In LANGUAGE law , marriage is defined as a voluntary union for life of CARDINAL man and CARDINAL woman to the exclusion of all others ( per Lord GPE in PERSON ( DATE ) Law Reports CARDINAL Probate and Divorce CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) . LAW DATE gives statutory effect to the common - law provision that a marriage is void ab initio if the parties are not respectively male and female .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the decision of ORG in PERSON v. PERSON ( DATE ) Probate Reports CARDINAL , sex , for the purpose of contracting a valid marriage , is to be determined by the chromosomal , gonadal and genital tests where these are congruent . The relevance of a birth certificate to the question whether a marriage is void only arises as a matter of evidence which goes to the proof of the identity and sex of the person whose birth it certifies . The entry in the birth register is prima facie evidence of the person \u2019s sex . It may , however , be rebutted if evidence of sufficient weight to the contrary is adduced .", "CARDINAL . ORG If , for the purpose of procuring a marriage or a certificate or licence for marriage , any person knowingly and wilfully makes a false oath or makes or signs a false declaration , notice or certificate required under LAW relating to marriage , he is guilty of an offence under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . However , a person contracting a marriage abroad is not liable to prosecution under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG The biological definition of sex laid down in PERSON v. PERSON has been followed by LANGUAGE courts and tribunals on a number of occasions and for purposes other than marriage .", "The applicant has drawn the ORG \u2019s attention to the following cases . In CARDINAL case concerning prostitution , a male to female transsexual , who had undergone both hormone and surgical treatment , was nevertheless treated as a male by ORG for the purposes of LAW DATE and LAW ( GPE v. PERSON and Others DATE , [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . In CARDINAL cases concerning social security legislation , male to female transsexuals were considered by ORG Commissioner as males for the purposes of retirement age ; in the first case the person in question had only received hormone therapy , in the second he had involuntarily begun to develop female secondary characteristics at DATE , which developments were followed by surgery and adoption of a female social role DATE ( cases R ( P ) CARDINAL and R ( P ) CARDINAL in the DATE Volume of ORG ) . Lastly , in a case before an ORG a female to male transsexual , who had not undergone any sex change treatment , was treated as a female by the ORG for the purposes of LAW DATE ; the person in question had sought and received employment in a position reserved for men under LAW , but was dismissed after discovery of her biological sex ( NORP v.
