ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1;Just satisfaction reserved;Preliminary objection dismissed (victim)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Baka", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants and the fourth applicant 's late mother owned agricultural land in GPE . In DATE ORG began the building of a school on adjoining land . While the works were under way , it became apparent that an additional plot of land would be needed to complete the construction .", "CARDINAL . By a decree issued on CARDINAL DATE , ORG authorised ORG to take possession , under an expedited procedure , of QUANTITY m. of land belonging to the applicants for a maximum period of DATE with a view to expropriating it in the public interest . The land was recorded on the cadastral register as \u201c partita \u201d no . DATE , folio no . CARDINAL , parcel no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took physical possession of the land and started the building works .", "CARDINAL . The case file shows that the school was not completed until DATE , by which time the authorised period of possession had expired .", "CARDINAL . The applicants say that they waited in vain for DATE for their land to be formally expropriated and for compensation .", "CARDINAL . By a writ served on CARDINAL DATE the applicants brought an action in damages against ORG before ORG . They submitted , inter alia , that the authorities were in possession of their land illegally as the authorised period had expired without any formal expropriation or the payment of compensation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The respondent council argued , in particular , that the action in damages was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the objection raised by the council that the action in damages was time - barred , finding that the council had not stated when the works had been completed . Referring to ORG case - law on constructive expropriation ( occupazione acquisitiva ) , ORG said that the applicants ' right of property had been extinguished on completion of the public works . However , since the transfer of property had been linked to the unlawful taking of possession of the land , the applicants were entitled to damages calculated on the basis of the market value of the land , namely CARDINAL NORP lire ( MONEY per sq . m. ) , which , with index - linking to the date the judgment was delivered , came to MONEY , plus interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appealed against that judgment . It submitted in particular that the applicants ' right to damages was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG allowed ORG appeal and declared that the applicants ' right to damages was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the works had been completed on DATE . As that was after the expiry of the DATE period stipulated by the Prefecture in its expedited possession order , it followed that the possession of the land was by then unlawful . However , under the constructive - expropriation rule , as established by the courts , ORG had acquired ownership of the land from the date the building works were completed . Since the council had acquired the property unlawfully , the applicants were entitled to seek damages ; however , in the instant case , the applicants ' right to damages was time - barred because the DATE limitation period had started to run from the date of completion of the works .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG . They argued that the retrospective application of the constructive - expropriation rule established by ORG in DATE , coupled with the retrospective application of a limitation period , infringed both their right of property and the non - discrimination principle , as guaranteed by LAW . Up to DATE , landowners had retained ownership throughout the period of unlawful occupation of their land . Accordingly , although a DATE limitation period applied to actions in damages , the fact that the effects of the unlawful occupation were permanent meant that the landowner was entitled to seek damages at any time , as the occupation of the land remained unlawful . However , after DATE , owners deprived of their land by the authorities lost ownership from the date the works were completed and the limitation period started to run from that point . The applicants also contested the applicability of the DATE limitation period , arguing that ORG decisions on the issue were conflicting .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , lodged at the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicants ' appeal . As regards which limitation period was applicable , it observed that on DATE the full court of ORG had resolved that issue finally , holding that the DATE period must apply . In the instant case , the applicant 's right to damages was therefore time - barred . As to the complaint that the retrospective application of the constructive - expropriation rule and the DATE limitation period was unconstitutional , since it infringed the applicants ' right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions and the non - discrimination principle , ORG held that it was manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . This statute governs the expedited expropriation procedure , which permits authorities to start building before expropriation . Once a scheme has been declared to be in the public interest and the plans adopted , the authorities may make an expedited possession order , for a limited period not exceeding DATE , in respect of the land to be expropriated . The order will lapse if physical possession of the land is not taken within DATE after its issue . After the land has been possessed , a formal expropriation order must be made and compensation paid .", "CARDINAL . During DATE , a number of local authorities took possession of land using the expedited procedure but failed subsequently to issue an expropriation order . The NORP courts were confronted with cases in which the landowner had de facto lost use of the land as it had been possessed and building works in the public interest had been undertaken . The question arose whether the mere fact that works had been carried out meant that the owner had also lost title to the land .", "CARDINAL . There was a substantial divergence in the decisions of ORG over the effects of carrying out building works in the public interest on land where possession had been taken unlawfully . Unlawful possession means possession that is unlawful from the start , in other words obtained without authority , or that is initially authorised but subsequently became unlawful , either because the authority is quashed or because possession continues beyond the authorised period without an expropriation order being made .", "CARDINAL . Under CARDINAL line of case - law , the owner of land that had been possessed by the authorities did not lose ownership after completion of the works in the public interest . However , he could not request reinstatement of the land ; his only remedy was to bring an action in damages for wrongful possession . No limitation period applied to such actions as the unlawful nature of the possession was continuing . The authorities could at any time issue a formal expropriation order . If they did so , the action in damages was transformed into a dispute over the compensation for expropriation , with damages for the loss of enjoyment of the land being due only for the period prior to the making of the expropriation order ( see , among other authorities , the judgments of ORG nos . CARDINAL of DATE ; CARDINAL of DATE ; and DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Under a second line , the landowner did not lose property in the land and could request its reinstatement if the authorities had acted other than in the public interest ( see , for example , ORG judgments nos . DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under a third line , an owner dispossessed by the authorities automatically lost title to the land as soon as it had been altered irreversibly , that is to say on completion of the works in the public interest . He was entitled to claim damages ( the sole authority is ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , resolved the conflict between the case - law authorities and adopted the third solution . In so doing , it established the constructive - expropriation rule ( accessione invertita or occupazione acquisitiva ) . Under the rule , the public authorities acquire title to the land from the outset before formal expropriation if , after taking possession of the land and irrespective of whether such possession is lawful , the works in the public interest are performed . If , initially , the land is possessed without authority , the transfer of property takes place when the works in the public interest are completed . If the taking of possession was authorised from the outset , property is transferred on the expiry of the authorised period of possession . In the same judgment , ORG stated that , on a constructive expropriation , the owner is entitled to compensation in full as the acquisition of the land has taken place without title ( sine titulo ) . However , compensation is not paid automatically : the owner must lodge a claim for damages . In addition , the right to compensation is subject to a DATE limitation period that applies to actions in tort ; the starting - point is the date the land is irreversibly altered .", "CARDINAL . Initially , it was held that no limitation period applied , since possession of the land without title was a continuing unlawful act ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In its judgment no . DATE , ORG stated that the right to compensation was subject to a DATE limitation period ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Subsequently , ORG said that a DATE limitation period should apply ( judgments nos . DATE ) . On CARDINAL DATE the full court of ORG decided the issue finally , holding that the limitation period is DATE and starts to run from the date the land is irreversibly altered .", "CARDINAL . Recent developments in the case - law show that the mechanism whereby carrying out building works in the public interest operates to transfer property in the land to the authorities is subject to exceptions .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , the PERSON stated that there was no constructive expropriation where resolutions of the authorities and an expedited possession order had been quashed by the administrative courts , as otherwise the judicial decision would be devoid of purpose .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , said that the authorities did not acquire ownership of the land if their resolutions and the declaration that expropriation was in the public interest were deemed to have been null and void from the outset . In such cases , the owner retained title to the land and could claim restitutio in integrum . In the alternative , he could seek damages . The unlawful nature of the possession in such cases was continuing and no limitation period applied .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , said that there was no transfer of property where the declaration that expropriation was in the public interest had been annulled by the administrative courts . In such cases , therefore , the constructive - expropriation rule did not apply . The owner , who retained ownership of the land , was entitled to claim restitutio in integrum . If he brought an action in damages , that entailed a waiver of his right to restitutio in integrum . The DATE prescription period started to run from DATE when the decision of the administrative court became final .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG followed the decision of the full court and held that there was no transfer of property by constructive expropriation where the declaration that the building works were in the public interest was deemed to have been invalid from the outset .", "CARDINAL . In this judgment , ORG was called upon to decide firstly whether the constructive - expropriation rule was compatible with LAW . The court declared that question inadmissible on the ground that it had jurisdiction to examine statutory provisions only , not rules established by the courts . Secondly , it held that the application to an action for compensation of the DATE limitation period laid down by DATE of LAW for claims in tort was compatible with LAW . The fact that the authorities had become owners of the land by taking advantage of their own unlawful conduct did not pose any difficulty under LAW , since the public interest in the preservation of works for the public good outweighed the individual 's interest in the right of property .", "CARDINAL . Under ORG case - law on constructive expropriations , compensation in full , that is to say damages for the deprivation of the land , is due to the owner in consideration for the loss of ownership caused by the unlawful taking of possession .", "CARDINAL . The Finance Law of DATE ( LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ) superseded that case - law by providing that the compensation payable on constructive expropriations could not exceed the amount due on formal expropriations . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG declared that provision unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . Under Finance Law no . DATE , which amended the provision that had been declared unconstitutional , compensation in full can not be awarded for dispossessions effected before DATE . In such cases , compensation can not exceed such amount , plus PERCENT , but without applying the PERCENT reduction , as would have been payable on a formal expropriation ( CARDINAL of the sum of the market value plus the income from the land , PERCENT ) . In a judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG held that that provision was compatible with LAW . However , in the same decision , it said that compensation in full , up to the market value of the land , could be claimed where the dispossession and deprivation of the land were not in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . The Government maintained that the applicants no longer had an interest in pursuing the application and asked the ORG to dismiss it .", "CARDINAL . The Government said that CARDINAL parcels of land had been expropriated from the applicants by the PERSON authorities . The land forming the subject matter of the application covered QUANTITY m. and was entered on the cadastral register as parcel no . CARDINAL ; the land concerned by the other expropriation had a surface area of QUANTITY m. On DATE the applicants reached a settlement agreement with ORG at the end of the proceedings concerning that other parcel of land . The ORG maintained that the sum paid by the authorities pursuant to that agreement also included compensation for the loss of the CARDINAL sq . m. of land forming the subject matter of the application .", "CARDINAL . In support of their case , the Government referred to the recitals of the settlement agreement , in which it was stated that at the origin of the agreement was the taking of possession DATE with a view to building a covered market \u2013 of CARDINAL sq . m. of the PERSON and GPE estate , registered on the cadastral plan as folio no . CARDINAL , parcels nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicants contested the ORG 's submission , arguing that the settlement agreement related only to the QUANTITY m. of land expropriated for the building of a market . They said that , along with other parcels , parcel no . CARDINAL had been included in the DATE order authorising possession of the QUANTITY m. of land by mistake , as the entire plot had already been used for the building of the school . That error had ORG consequently also appeared in the recitals to the settlement agreement . The applicants invited the ORG to examine side by side the settlement agreement and the report lodged on DATE by the expert appointed by ORG in connection with the dispute over the land intended for the building of a market . They said that that would enable the ORG to see that the settlement agreement did not relate to the CARDINAL sq . m. of land forming the subject matter of the application .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has examined the settlement agreement and the expert 's report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE report , the expert stated that the land originally belonging to the applicants could be divided into CARDINAL sections in the light of the changes that had been made :", "( i ) a first section that had not been expropriated ;", "( ii ) a second section of QUANTITY m. corresponding to parcel no . CARDINAL which had been used for a school ;", "( iii ) a third section of QUANTITY m. corresponding to other parcels of land forming the subject matter of the litigation for which the expert had been appointed . Possession of that section had been taken on DATE , a market and a road had been built on it and gardens planted .", "CARDINAL . Although parcel no . CARDINAL is indeed referred to in the recitals to the settlement agreement , that same agreement also states that the compensation paid by the authorities relates to other parcels of land \u2013 all recorded on folio no . CARDINAL of the cadastral register \u2013 with a total surface - area of QUANTITY m.", "CARDINAL . Having perused those documents , the ORG considers that the Government have not shown that the amount paid to the applicants pursuant to the settlement agreement related to the land forming the subject matter of the application .", "CARDINAL . ORG Consequently , the ORG 's preliminary objection must be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicants complained that they had been deprived of their land in circumstances that were incompatible with the requirements of LAW No . CARDINAL , which provides :", "\u201c Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions . No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law .", "The preceding provisions shall not , however , in any way impair the right of a ORG to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants asked the ORG to declare that the application of the constructive - expropriation rule in the instant case did not comply with the requirement of lawfulness .", "CARDINAL . They referred to the notion of a legal norm and observed that the constructive - expropriation rule was an anomaly in the NORP legal system . It was considered by the domestic courts as being an expression of the \u201c living law \u201d , yet did not have the same effects as statutory provisions as , firstly , it was not binding on the courts and , secondly , its constitutionality could not be reviewed . Even if they were to accept the idea that the rule constituted a legal norm , the applicants , referring to the ORG v. GPE case ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) , observed that it had to be accessible , its effects had to be foreseeable and it had to be compatible with the principle of the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . In that regard , the applicants maintained that the uncertainties and changes in the case - law to which the constructive - expropriation rule had given rise , combined with the way in which it had been applied in their case , amounted to a violation of the principle of the rule of law . In their submission , it had been impossible for them to foresee that their right of property would be considered by the courts to have been extinguished . Furthermore , by the time ORG established in DATE that the DATE limitation period had to apply , the applicant 's case had been pending for DATE . Moreover , ORG judgment of DATE , which finally resolved the issue of which limitation period should apply , was delivered when the applicants ' appeal on points of law was pending .", "CARDINAL . The applicants went on to observe that constructive expropriations were effected not after proceedings in due form but following the physical taking of possession by the authorities . The latter became owners of the land and thus extinguished the landowners ' right of property despite the unlawful nature of their conduct . The applicants pointed out that the onus was on the landowner if he wished to obtain compensation , as he was required to make a claim for damages . Moreover , a ceiling had been placed on the measure of damages by the finance laws , such that landowners could no longer obtain reparation in full for the loss sustained .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the ORG 's report , the applicants also argued that the deprivation of their land contravened the principle that a fair balance should be struck .", "CARDINAL . The applicants concluded by requesting the ORG to find that there had been a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The Government reiterated their observations before the Commission in which , referring to ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL , they had maintained that the situation complained of by the applicants was compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In their memorials lodged with ORG , the Government observed that constructive expropriation was provided for \u201c by law \u201d , even though not set out in any statutory provision . As a principle established by the case- law , the constructive - expropriation rule formed part of NORP positive law but , unlike statutory provisions , there was no need for it to come into force formally as it was formulated over the course of time and the courts were not bound to apply it . The Government contested the ORG 's view that the constructive - expropriation rule was not in existence at the time possession of the land was taken , that is to say before ORG judgment no . DATE . The Government maintained that the rule had , at the material time , already been established by the courts .", "CARDINAL . The ORG maintained that CARDINAL conditions had to be satisfied for a transfer of property by constructive expropriation to be lawful : the works had genuinely to be in the public interest ; the landowner had to have access to the courts for review of the public - interest issue ; and compensation had to be paid for the deprivation of the property .", "CARDINAL . The Government noted that the applicants had not suggested that either of the first CARDINAL conditions had not been satisfied . As to the third , the ORG maintained that the applicants had received compensation as part of the settlement agreement concerning the expropriation of another parcel of land ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . The Government consequently considered that the applicants were seeking to obtain unjust enrichment through the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government concluded by asking the ORG to declare the application unfounded .", "CARDINAL . In its report , the ORG expressed the view that the applicants had been deprived of their land through the retrospective application of the constructive - expropriation rule and that their right to compensation had been declared time - barred as a result of the retrospective application of the relevant limitation period . Having found that no compensation had been paid to the applicants , it considered that that finding sufficed for it to conclude that there had been a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that LAW No . CARDINAL contains CARDINAL distinct rules : \u201c the first rule , set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph , is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property ; the second rule , contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph , covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions ; the third rule , stated in the second paragraph , recognises that GPE are entitled , amongst other things , to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest ... The CARDINAL rules are not , however , ' distinct ' in the sense of being unconnected . The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule \u201d ( see , among other authorities , the PERSON and Others v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , partly following the terms of the ORG 's analysis in the PERSON and PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; see also the GPE v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINAL-II ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that it is common ground that there has been a deprivation of possessions .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of possessions within the meaning of the second rule , the ORG must not confine itself to examining whether there has been dispossession or formal expropriation , it must look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of . Since the ORG is intended to guarantee rights that are \u201c practical and effective \u201d , it has to be ascertained whether that situation amounted to a de facto expropriation ( see the GPE and PERSON judgment cited above , pp . DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that in the present case ORG held , in a decision that was final and in which it applied the constructive - expropriation rule , that there had been a transfer of property in favour of ORG ; as a consequence of that decision the applicants were deprived of the possibility of obtaining damages . In those circumstances , the ORG finds that the effect of the judgment of ORG was to deprive the applicants of their possessions within the meaning of the second sentence of the first paragraph of LAW No . CARDINAL ( see ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-VII ) .", "CARDINAL . In order to be compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL , such an interference must be \u201c in the public interest \u201d , \u201c subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law \u201d and must strike a \u201c fair balance \u201d between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual 's fundamental rights ( see the PERSON and PERSON judgment cited above , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck \u201c becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary \u201d ( see PERSON cited above , \u00a7 DATE , and ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-I ) . Accordingly , the ORG does not consider it appropriate to base its decision solely on the finding that the applicants received no compensation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that the first and most important requirement of LAW No . CARDINAL is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful . The rule of law , CARDINAL of the fundamental principles of a democratic society , is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention ( see PERSON cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) and entails a duty on the part of the ORG or other public authority to comply with judicial orders or decisions against it .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not consider it necessary to decide in the abstract whether the role in the continental - law system of a rule , such as the constructive - expropriation rule , established by the courts is comparable to that of statutory provisions . However , it reiterates that the requirement of lawfulness means that rules of domestic law must be sufficiently accessible , precise and foreseeable ( see the PERSON v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and the PERSON and Others v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In that connection , the ORG observes that the case - law on constructive expropriations has evolved in a way that has led to the rule being applied inconsistently ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , a factor which could result in unforeseeable or arbitrary outcomes and deprive litigants of effective protection of their rights and which , as a consequence , is inconsistent with the requirement of lawfulness .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also notes that , under the rule established by ORG in its judgment no . DATE , every constructive expropriation follows the unlawful taking of possession of the land . The unlawfulness may exist at the outset , if the taking of possession is unauthorised , or arise subsequently , if the authorities remain in possession beyond the authorised period . The ORG has reservations as to the compatibility with the requirement of lawfulness of a mechanism which , generally , enables the authorities to benefit from an unlawful situation in which the landowner is presented with a fait accompli .", "CARDINAL . It notes , finally , that compensation for deprivation of property is not paid automatically by the authorities , but must be claimed by the landowner within DATE . That may prove to be inadequate protection .", "DATE . In any event , the ORG is required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the instant case , the ORG notes that , pursuant to the constructive - expropriation rule , ORG held that the applicants had been deprived of their land from DATE . That transfer of property to the authorities therefore occurred during the period of possession without title ( sine titulo ) , automatically , following completion of the public works . ORG considers that that situation could not be regarded as \u201c foreseeable \u201d as it was only in the final decision , the judgment of ORG , that the constructive - expropriation rule could be regarded as being effectively applied . On that point , the ORG refers to the evolution of the case - law ( see paragraphs DATE above ) and to the fact that a case - law rule does not bind the courts as regards its application ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG consequently finds that the applicants did not become certain that they had been deprived of their land until DATE , when ORG judgment was lodged with the registry .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the ORG observes that the situation in issue enabled the authorities to derive a benefit from taking possession of land which they had held without title since DATE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the ORG notes that ORG applied the DATE limitation period from the date of completion of the works ( DATE ) . As a result , the applicants were denied the possibility that had , in principle , been available to them of obtaining damages .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that such interference can only be described as arbitrary and consequently is not compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , there has been a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants claimed MONEY ( ITL ) for pecuniary damage \u2013 the value of the land as assessed in an expert 's report of DATE plus interest and index - linking from DATE . In the alternative , they sought ORG DATE the value of the land as assessed in an expert 's report of DATE plus interest and index - linking from DATE . The applicants stated that they would be willing to accept the conclusions of a further expert valuation if the ORG were minded to seek CARDINAL .", "DATE . As regards non - pecuniary damage , the applicants claimed ORG CARDINAL each .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought reimbursement of ORG CARDINAL for the costs incurred before the national courts and of ORG CARDINAL for the costs incurred in the proceedings before the ORG and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government made no observations on that point .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that the issue of the application of Article CARDINAL is not ready for decision and should be reserved having regard to the possibility of an agreement between the respondent ORG and the applicants ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Rules of Court ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
