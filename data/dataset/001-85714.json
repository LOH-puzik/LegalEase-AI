GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Snejana Botoucharova", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant is chief executive officer of the ORG corporation and member of the board of directors and major shareholder of the ORG corporation , GPE .", "On DATE , ORG issued a warrant for the arrest of the applicant on the ground that he was strongly suspected of fraud and offences under LAW on two occasions and in complicity with CARDINAL other accused . ORG also found that the applicant was likely to abscond given his wealth , which would allow him to live abroad . His family bonds were not sufficient to prevent his absconding . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s arrest was not disproportionate in view of the damage he had allegedly caused and given the sentence which he risked incurring if found guilty as charged .", "On DATE , ORG amended the arrest warrant in view of the strong suspicion that the applicant had also committed fraud on CARDINAL occasions . It also found that there existed the danger of absconding and prejudicing proceedings under LAW .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the arrest warrant as amended on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE . It found that the arrest warrant was not unlawful in view of the alleged denial of access to the confiscated data . The court took the view that the present case was not comparable to cases in which ORG , ORG or ORG had regarded arrest warrants as unlawful , because the defence counsel had been denied access to the part of files which were necessary to respond effectively to the allegations which formed part of the arrest warrant . It found that the domestic courts had sufficiently observed the requirement to make available to the detained all materials which were important for the arrest . The applicant \u2019s defence counsel had had unrestrained access to all documents , protocols of the interrogation and any other evidence on which the domestic courts had based their decisions concerning the arrest warrant . It could not be inferred from the available case - law that there existed an extended principle that the defence counsel should be given access to all other data which were seized by the investigation authorities or otherwise the arrest warrant had to be suspended .", "Regardless of the above , the applicant \u2019s defence counsel had been given access to all other documents that had been seized . The defence counsel \u2019s motion of DATE to have access to all data seized , which had been stored on some CARDINAL CD - ROMs , had been granted by ORG on DATE by offering access to the data in the premises of ORG ( this offer had not been taken up by the applicant \u2019s counsel ) . The defence counsel \u2019s request to have access , in particular , to the data on the hard drive confiscated in the applicant \u2019s flat was granted by handing over a copy version of the data on DATE . Prior to that , the defence counsel had been given a hard drive with these data in DATE and DATE which had however been defective . A further request by the defence counsel of DATE to have access to data from the server of the applicant \u2019s premises was granted by producing a copy of the data which was handed over to the defence counsel on DATE . ORG reasoned that , even though it had not been possible to deliver the copy of the data from the entire server earlier , the arrest warrant could not be suspended as a consequence . The defence had not been deprived of any material which had been necessary to comment effectively on the allegations made in the arrest warrant . As far as there had been data on the server which had been relevant for the decisions regarding the arrest warrant , the defence counsel had already received a printed version . No other data had been used to decide on the arrest warrant .", "On DATE , ORG ordered the continuation of the arrest warrant of DATE . ORG found that there had not been a violation of the right to a fair trial by refusing access to the confiscated data for the reasons set out in the decision of DATE . The voluminous material presented by the applicant \u2019s counsel did not call into question the suspicion against the applicant .", "On DATE , ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the decision of ORG of DATE .", "Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure concern the arrest and detention of a person on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence . According to Article CARDINAL , a person may be detained on remand if there is a strong suspicion that he or she has committed a criminal offence and if there is a reason for arrest , such as the risk of absconding or the risk of collusion . Article CARDINAL regulates the suspension of the execution of an arrest warrant .", "Under LAW , remand prisoners can ask at any time for judicial review of the arrest warrant . An oral hearing will be held at the request of the remand prisoner , or if the court so decides , of its own motion ( LAW ) . If the arrest warrant is held to be valid following the hearing , the remand prisoner is entitled to a new oral hearing only if the detention has lasted for DATE altogether and if DATE have elapsed since the last oral hearing ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Article CARDINAL provides that an arrest warrant has to be quashed if reasons justifying the detention on remand no longer persist or if the continued detention appears disproportionate . Any prolongation of detention on remand beyond DATE is to be decided by ORG ( ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
