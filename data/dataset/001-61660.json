The applicants are a married NORP couple , born in DATE and DATE respectively and resident in GPE . In DATE they bought a real property from the owner of a neighbouring property , PERSON , who had undertaken to tear down a lean - to which the latter had constructed partly on the land purchased by the applicants before splitting it up into a separate property . The applicants and PERSON allegedly reached a further agreement to the effect that the latter consented to the applicants\u2019 construction of a car shelter which would be connected to a new sauna building which ORG agreed to construct on his own property so as to replace the sauna in his lean - to .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( rakennus - valvontavirasto , byggnadsinspektionen ) granted permission to demolish the lean - to . Following that demolition , ORG ( rakennuslautakunta , byggnadsn\u00e4mnden ) , on DATE , granted the applicants permission to construct a dwelling - house and a car shelter on their property . L. did not appeal but refused to demolish the whole of his lean - to and to construct the new sauna building to be connected to the applicants\u2019 dwelling .", "CARDINAL . In DATE L. was prohibited from using his existing sauna as its chimney top was found to be partly under the roof level of the applicants\u2019 car shelter . The ORG offer to have the chimney top extended was refused by L.", "CARDINAL . On DATE representatives of ORG inspected the applicants\u2019 car shelter and found that it complied with the building permit . L. lodged an objection with ORG against this finding .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE L. brought a civil action against the applicants , demanding , inter alia , that they be ordered to tear down the car shelter which they had allegedly built in violation of the fire regulations . ORG ( raastuvanoikeus , r\u00e5dstuvur\u00e4tten ) held its first hearing in DATE but adjourned the case at ORG request in anticipation of ORG forthcoming decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed ORG \u2019s objection against the outcome of the inspection on DATE and confirmed that the applicants had constructed their buildings in accordance with the permit delivered in DATE . ORG found that PERSON had contributed to the fact that he had been prohibited from using his sauna , having refused to carry out his own construction works as agreed with the applicants . Had he fulfilled his part of their joint agreement in accordance with the building permission granted to that effect , the roof of his and the applicants\u2019 respective buildings would have been at the same height . ORG considered that the dispute between the parties was to be resolved by the civil courts .", "CARDINAL . L. appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON , arguing that while he had consented to the applicants\u2019 constructing up to the boundary line , he had not agreed to any construction on their part preventing him from using his existing sauna and requiring him to take construction measures of his own . Although he had informed the applicants that his consent did not cover those aspects , they had not informed ORG accordingly . As a result the building permit and the approval of the applicants\u2019 construction works had been based on false premises .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants filed a counter claim against PERSON , demanding that he be ordered to carry out his part of their alleged agreement . The CARDINAL suits were joined at the ORG request . ORG second hearing was held on DATE but the case was again adjourned at ORG \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . L. appealed further to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) and also requested the annulment of ORG decision of DATE , whereby it had granted the applicants a building permit .", "CARDINAL . ORG third hearing was held on DATE . The case was again adjourned at PERSON \u2019s request , as he had not yet received ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( maaoikeus , jorddomstolen ) of ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s appeal against a refusal to move a marker indicating his and the applicants\u2019 joint boundary line .", "CARDINAL . The civil case was again heard on DATE but was now adjourned at the request of both parties in anticipation of ORG decision in respect of PERSON \u2019s annulment request .", "CARDINAL . ORG fifth hearing was held on DATE but the case was again adjourned at PERSON \u2019s request . Following a sixth hearing on DATE ORG adjourned the case for the summoning of witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s request for annulment of ORG decision of DATE . The court held that an error had indeed been committed during ORG examination of the applicants\u2019 request for a building permit . The court noted however the nature of PERSON \u2019s written undertakings towards the applicants which had led to the error , the manner in which their car shelter had been built as well as the fact that it would be easy to arrange for the smoke from ORG \u2019s sauna to be evacuated in a manner acceptable from the point of view of fire safety . The court therefore considered that ORG decision of DATE did not violate PERSON \u2019s rights , nor was it necessary in the general interest to annul that decision . The court furthermore dismissed PERSON \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE L. extended his civil action against the applicants by bringing further claims partly based on different legislation . At ORG seventh hearing on CARDINAL DATE it took evidence from the applicants\u2019 witnesses PERSON and P. The case was again adjourned at ORG request .", "CARDINAL . At the eighth hearing on DATE witnesses A. and ORG were heard at PERSON \u2019s request and witness PERSON was heard at the request of the applicants . A. furthermore handed in reports of his inspections in situ dated CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE . According to the applicants , ORG had by then already refused their request that the court conduct its own inspection . The case was adjourned at both parties\u2019 request so as to enable them to lodge further submissions in writing .", "CARDINAL . At ORG ninth hearing on DATE CARDINAL further witness was heard at the applicants\u2019 request and another witness at L. \u2019s request . The parties requested permission to make their final pleadings in writing and the case was adjourned for judgment at DATE .", "CARDINAL . Each of the CARDINAL hearings was presided over by a different judge .", "CARDINAL . Due to a national reorganisation of the courts of first instance the case was transferred to ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ; formerly ORG ) . In its judgment of DATE it found that ORG decision of DATE had not given rise to res judicata . ORG , moreover , accepted PERSON \u2019s extended action for consideration . It considered that whereas PERSON was the only witness who could have testified regarding the true character of the alleged agreement between the applicants and PERSON , P. \u2019s testimony had not been so detailed and certain that it could be regarded as decisive evidence that PERSON had agreed to tear down the whole of his lean - to . The court therefore found it established that the applicants had understood all along that PERSON had not intended to tear down the whole of his lean - to . By constructing the car shelter in the manner established they had effectively prevented PERSON from using his sauna . The applicants were therefore ordered to demolish their shelter and to restore PERSON \u2019s lean - to into its original state . It followed that the applicants\u2019 counter suit had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were ordered to pay L. FIM CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL ) in compensation for the damage which the construction of their shelter had caused to his lean - to . They were ordered to pay a further FIM CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( some EUR CARDINAL ) a year ( as from DATE ) in compensation for the impossibility for L. to use his sauna . They also had to reimburse PERSON \u2019s costs in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the extent of the damages suffered by PERSON , the ORG based itself exclusively on A. \u2019s testimony . After ORG judgment the applicants filed a criminal complaint against him , suspecting that he had committed perjury .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against ORG judgment and later supplemented their appeal with a copy of the record of the pre - trial investigation into the suspected perjury which in their view showed that PERSON \u2019s testimony had not been truthful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) dismissed the ORG appeal and upheld ORG judgment , including its reasons . ORG refused to take into account the pre - trial investigation record concerning PERSON , as it had been submitted out of time and no special reasons militated in favour of accepting it as evidence . The applicants were ordered to pay PERSON \u2019s costs in the amount of ORG ( about EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In order to tear down their car shelter and restore PERSON \u2019s lean - to the applicants were to obtain permission from FAC . In an opinion to ORG dated CARDINAL DATE ORG nevertheless considered that ORG demolition order was \u201c not an equitable solution \u201d , since the only change needed from the point of view of fire safety would be to extend PERSON \u2019s chimney top to QUANTITY above the applicants\u2019 car shelter . FAC would therefore not permit the car shelter to be torn down and such demolition would be contrary to the general interest by spoiling the appearance of the neighbourhood and violate both local planning regulations and general regulations on fire safety . ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted A. of perjury and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 conditional imprisonment . It found it established that he had deliberately omitted various relevant information from his testimony in PERSON \u2019s civil case against the applicants . In the light of this judgment the applicants requested ORG to reopen the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . L. died in DATE , having sold his property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicants\u2019 request for a reopening of the proceedings in so far as they had been ordered to compensate PERSON for the damage which the construction of their car shelter had caused to his lean - to as well as to pay him the costs incurred in the proceedings before the lower courts . ORG referred to A. \u2019s conviction of perjury .", "CARDINAL . Referring to its decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG declined to examine anew the applicant \u2019s request for a re - opening of the case in respect of the order requiring them to demolish the car shelter , to restore PERSON \u2019s lean - to into its state prior to the construction of the shelter as well as to pay NORP DATE compensation for the fact that he had been prevented from using his sauna .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE the current owners of ORG house had not requested , and the authorities had not enforced , the aforementioned CARDINAL orders .", "CARDINAL . In re - opening part of the case ORG instructed the applicants to file , within DATE , a new action against PERSON before FAC . They initiated such proceedings against PERSON \u2019s successors on CARDINAL DATE and supplemented their statement of claim on DATE in light of the defendants\u2019 written observations . The court \u2019s preparatory hearing was held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parties reached a settlement whereby PERSON \u2019s successors undertook to reimburse the applicants the amount of ORG CARDINAL ( i.e. the compensation which the applicants had paid to L. ) as well as a further sum of EUR CARDINAL . PERSON \u2019s insurance company undertook to reimburse EUR CARDINAL of the costs paid by the applicants . The sums were to be divided between the applicants and their insurance company as later agreed . The applicants and PERSON \u2019s successors declared that they had no further claims against one another whether in relation to the proceedings initiated in DATE or to any previous court proceedings or related events .", "CARDINAL .
