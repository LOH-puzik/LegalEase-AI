CARDINAL vehicles ( a Peugeot CARDINAL - mainly for the taxi traffic ; and a QUANTITY ORG - mainly for the interurban traffic ) were used in the business , which occupied the applicant , his father and a third driver on a part - time basis .

ORG The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( transportr\u00e5det ) , in which he alleged , inter alia , the following . ORG application for a licence for the routes covered by his licence had been motivated not by any public interest in improving the transport service , but by an arrangement between the ORG and Mr. PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) . Only very serious reasons , such as misconduct of the licence - holder , could justify revocation . When revoking his licence , ORG had failed to take due account of his interests . Finally , the transport service on the routes concerned was not likely to be improved simply by being carried out by Mr. PERSON and others instead of by himself .", "ORG rejected the appeal on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

ORG Under LAW ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) , there are CARDINAL kinds of passenger transport licences , which can briefly be described as follows :", "- transport on request , where the vehicle , with a driver , is put at the customer \u2019s disposal and the price is determined according to the customer \u2019s use of it ( best\u00e4llningstrafik ) ;", "- tourist transport , which comprises commissioned tours for sightseeing , etc .

In examining applications , such factors as professional skill and personal and economic circumstances are considered , with a view to ensuring that the transport is effected under safe conditions by economically stable undertakings ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) . A further condition is that the intended service is deemed necessary and appropriate ( LAW , LAW ) . The reason for this is the overall objective of establishing an adequate transport network and preventing any harmful surplus service .
