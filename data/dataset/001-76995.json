Substantial parts related to his activities , and were based on information acquired by him as an ORG officer .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he signed a contract with a Publisher to publish the Book in GPE . He was paid at that stage an advance on royalties ( CARDINAL , MONEY ( ORG ) net ) and a further advance royalty payment ( GBP CARDINAL ) was due to him on publication . In DATE the Publisher announced the impending publication of the Book and it was published on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE to the Publisher , the Treasury Solicitor stated that it would hold the Publisher liable for the applicant 's breach of his duty of confidentiality . The Publisher denied the claims but confirmed that it would not make payments without notice to the ORG . ORG letter to the Publisher of DATE considered the applicant liable for a breach of a fiduciary duty to the ORG : the Publisher rejected these claims .", "CARDINAL . The Attorney General ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) issued a writ in ORG on DATE seeking from the applicant any financial benefit from publication ( royalties already due from the Publisher and any future royalties ) arguing that in writing and authorising the publication of ORG , he had acted in breach of the duty of confidence he owed to the ORG as a former member of the ORG . There was no reliance on LAW , LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) or on the undertaking signed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a statement of claim was submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an extension of time was given for lodging the defence and this was filed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE to the applicant , ORG refused legal aid and he appealed within DATE time - limit . By letter of DATE that ORG indicated that his appeal had been adjourned pending receipt from him of further information in relation to royalty payments already made to him and it was noted that he had not requested the ORG Solicitor to release the monies held by the Publisher to fund his defence of the proceedings .

On DATE his solicitors informed ORG how the royalty payments to date had been spent and about the refusal of the Treasury Solicitor and the Publisher to release the monies to him . By letter dated DATE from ORG the applicant was informed that ORG had rejected his appeal . It appeared to ORG unreasonable that he should be granted representation : since the litigation was known to him , not later than DATE , he had voluntarily divested himself of substantial funds under his control and direction . The applicant claimed that he had given approximately GBP QUANTITY to his children before DATE and that CARDINAL had been spent thereafter ( most of which he had given to his son ) . The balance remaining ( GBP CARDINAL ) was insufficient to fund his litigation .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed the Treasury Solicitor that he would apply to ORG for an order that the ORG consent to the release of the relevant monies to fund his defence .

The Publisher did not oppose the release of funds and the applicant renewed his request for release of the funds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected his re - application for the release of the monies : the ORG 's claim was prima facie a strong one . Many litigants presented their cases themselves and the court was able to ensure that there was a fair trial . Since he was a fugitive from justice and would not appear in person , the lack of legal representation would not deny him a fair trial . It was also noted that , by this time , he had received in the region of $ MONEY for a NORP television documentary which could contribute to his legal costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE his solicitors applied and were granted leave to cease to act for the applicant .

ORG refused legal aid for the appeal by letter dated DATE stating that the applicant had not shown reasonable grounds for taking , defending or being a party to proceedings . In particular , he had not made any comment on the ORG 's grounds of appeal and it was not therefore possible to determine his likely prospects of success . He appealed this refusal , submitting detailed and reasoned argument . ORG , by letter dated DATE , confirmed the rejection of his appeal noting that the ORG considered that it would be unreasonable to grant legal aid to enable him to continue to pursue a claim so long as he remained \u201c a fugitive from justice already meted out to you \u201d .", "CARDINAL . His solicitors again applied for the release of the monies to fund his litigation which application was rejected by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG hearing took place on DATE . The applicant was neither represented nor present and the Publisher took no part in the proceedings . The ORG was represented by ORG , ORG and CARDINAL junior counsel , with a Queen 's Counsel and CARDINAL junior counsel appearing as amici curiae . ORG later noted that the amici curiae had deployed before it all the arguments which the applicant might have wished to present if he had been present .", "CARDINAL . Counsel acting as amici curiae suggested a possible public law remedy and the court also considered that the ORG might have a private law restitutionary remedy against the applicant . The proceedings were therefore adjourned ( until DATE ) to allow submissions on those CARDINAL issues as defined by the court . The ORG was also granted leave to amend his statement of claim . Arrangements were made for the applicant to be sent the amended statement of claim . He did not respond because , he submitted , he was not legally represented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Lord PERSON delivered the court 's judgment dismissing the CARDINAL private law grounds of appeal ( breach of a life - long fiduciary duty arising from S.I.S. employment ; breach of contract given the undertaking signed in DATE ; and a claim for restitutionary damages for profits from a breach of contract where the defendant obtained profit by doing the very thing which he contracted not to do ) . The ORG 's public law claim ( the ORG 's inherent power to bring proceedings to ensure the enforcement of the criminal law ) was allowed . Accordingly , Lord PERSON granted an injunction restraining the applicant from receiving any payment or other benefit in connection with the exploitation of the Book", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's solicitors sought leave to be reinstated and , acting on a pro bono basis , lodged skeleton arguments before ORG seeking leave to appeal to ORG .

On DATE the applicant again applied for the release of the monies held by the Publisher , which was refused by the ORG Solicitor on DATE . His request to ORG for the release of monies was made on DATE and was rejected in DATE , ORG advising him to apply for a waiver of the appeal fees . The applicant submitted that DATE and DATE he corresponded with ORG concerning funding for the appeal to ORG . On DATE the applicant returned the completed waiver request form and on DATE the applicant 's solicitors applied for the waiver of appeal fees . On DATE ORG requested further information of the applicant as regards the waiver application . DATE the applicant and the ORG Solicitor agreed on a statement of facts for the purposes of the appeal .", "In or DATE ORG agreed to waive the appeal fees and security for costs .

CARDINAL ORG and CARDINAL junior counsel represented the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The appeal hearing was fixed for DATE . Although he accepted that the restitutionary damages ' ( private law ) issue raised points of general interest , the ORG confined the appeal to the public law injunction . However , by letter dated DATE to the parties , ORG indicated that it wished to hear argument at the hearing on the matter of restitutionary damages for breach of contract . Both parties prepared written submissions on the point and a hearing took place DATE .", "CARDINAL . The main judgment was delivered on DATE by Lord PERSON , with whom Lords PERSON and ORG concurred . Lord PERSON delivered a separate judgment and Lord PERSON dissented . Lord PERSON concluded that there was no reason in principle to rule out an account of profits as a remedy for breach of contract in exceptional situations notably where other remedies were inadequate and where the plaintiff had a legitimate interest in preventing the defendant 's profit - making activity and , hence , in depriving him of his profit .", "The final basis for making an order for an account of profits was the applicant 's breach of contract and , in particular , the undertaking of confidentiality signed in DATE . However , that did not confer on the ORG any proprietary interest in the debt due to the applicant from the Publisher . The Crown was entitled , on the taking of the account , to a money judgment which could then be enforced by attachment of the debt in the usual way . Given that the Publisher who held the monies wished to deduct its legal expenses in defending the third party proceedings , the appropriate form of order was a declaration that the ORG was entitled to be paid a sum equal to whatever amount was due and owing to the applicant under the publishing agreement of CARDINAL DATE . The injunction would remain in force until the Publisher made payment to the ORG .", "CARDINAL .
