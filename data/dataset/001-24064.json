Moreover , ORG upheld ORG judgment in so far as concerns the order that the applicant pay compensation .", "In reaching the above conclusions ORG was divided . All the professional judges and CARDINAL of the lay judges voted for the applicant \u2019s conviction on the charge of false declaration of theft , the other CARDINAL lay judges voted against .", "As regards the charges related to arson , the majority ( composed of CARDINAL professional judges and CARDINAL lay judges ) voted for the applicant \u2019s conviction , finding it established beyond reasonable doubt that she had with intent started the fire and this with the intention to obtain insurance compensation .", "The minority ( composed of CARDINAL professional judge and CARDINAL lay judges ) voted for the applicant \u2019s acquittal , finding it not proven beyond reasonable doubt that the house had been set fire to and that it could not be excluded that the fire had its origin in the house \u2019s electric installations . Under LAW , requiring a minimum of CARDINAL votes for conviction , the votes of the minority , was decisive and the applicant was accordingly acquitted of these charges .", "As to the issue whether the applicant in the specific circumstances should be held liable to pay civil compensation , the judgment contained the following reasons :", "\u201c ORG majority refers to its above - mentioned observations with regard to the fire .", "\u201c Justice PERSON finds that on the balance of probabilities there is a clear probability that the defendant is guilty of setting the fire as described in the indictment even though in his opinion the evidence in the case does not suffice to establish criminal guilt as regards these charges for the reason that he is unable to exclude that the fire could have been caused by an electrical fault . \u201d", "...", "In the [ new ] majority \u2019s view there is no doubt that the conditions for making an award for compensation are fulfilled , even though there is internal disagreement as to the extent to which the evidence satisfies the criminal burden of proof ....

Consequently , the civil claim of a victim may be decided either in connection with a criminal case or in separate proceedings . Article CARDINAL reads :", "\u201c Any legal claim that the aggrieved person or any other injured person has against the person charged may , in accordance with the provisions of LAW , be pursued in connection with such cases as are mentioned in LAW , provided that the said claim arises from the same act that the case is concerned with . On the said conditions the following claims may also be pursued :", "( CARDINAL ) recourse claims which an insurance company or any other person that has paid out compensation , insurance or a pension on account of the damage has against the person charged .", "The claims specified in the first and second paragraphs are deemed to be civil claims and shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of chapter CARDINAL ... \u201d .", "Other provisions concerning civil compensation claims may be found in LAW of LAW , notably the following :", "\u201c In a public prosecution the prosecuting authority may on application pursue such civil legal claims as are specified in LAW . ... \u201d", "\u201c Any person who has any such civil claim as is specified in LAW may himself pursue it in connection with a public prosecution if a trial hearing is held . ... \u201d", "\u201c A separate appeal against a decision on civil claims shall be brought in accordance with the provisions of LAW . The same shall apply to a reopening of the case . \u201d", "A claim for compensation for damage submitted by a victim under the general principles on the law of torts is subject to his or her showing that the alleged perpetrator , with intent or gross negligence , committed the wrongful act . The test is normally the balance of probabilities and the burden of proof lies with the claimant . This burden may be heavier where liability may have serious consequences for the respondent \u2019s reputation , though it will be less than for criminal liability . The competent court has to determine liability in the light of all the evidence available at the time of the adjudication of the case .", "The objective constitutive elements of acts which may give rise to both criminal liability and civil liability to pay compensation are not always the same . The subjective constitutive elements in principle differ : normally criminal liability requires intent whereas liability to pay compensation requires gross or simple negligence . There may be exonerating circumstances \u2013 such as self - defence , necessity , provocation or ignorance \u2013 which exclude criminal liability but which do not exclude liability to pay compensation . A person of unsound mind may be exempted from criminal liability but not necessarily from civil liability to pay compensation ( see PERSON GPE ( NORP Official Reports ) CARDINAL , \u201c Erstatning til ofrene hvor tiltalte frifinnes for straff \u201d ( \u201c Compensation to victims in cases where the accused has been acquitted on the criminal charge \u201d ) , a study by PERSON , Professor of PERSON , LAW , section ORG ) .", "The purposes of the criminal law and the law on compensation are not identical . While deterrence and restoration are important considerations in both areas of law , the former places emphasis on retribution and the latter on the allocation of financial loss . The CARDINAL systems also supplement one another in important respects . While criminal - law sanctions are particularly designed to deter actual and potential offenders from committing offences , those of the law of compensation are particularly designed to meet the aggrieved person \u2019s need for economic redress ( ibid . , LAW , section CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
