AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The first applicant ORG . H. , is the owner and publisher of the DATE newspaper \u201c ORG \u201d with its seat in GPE . The second applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a journalist working for the first applicant .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "DATE a series of letter bombs which severely injured some of the addresses was sent to politicians and other persons of public interest in GPE .", "The bombs were accompanied by confessing letters signed \u201c ORG \u201d ( NORP [ NORP tribe tracing back to the CARDINALth and DATE ] ORG ) .", "After the first assaults , an expert on criminal psychology drew up a psychological profile of the author(s ) of these acts and concluded that they were committed by a single person . According to another hypothesis the series of bombs had to be attributed to a group of right wing extremists .", "From DATE until DATE Mr GPE was Federal Minister for the ORG ( ORG ) .", "The author of the assaults , PERSON , a person with no particular connection to any political grouping , was arrested in DATE .", "In DATE sporadic critics in the press and by some politicians reproached Mr PERSON with having neglected the theory of a single author . A politician of the ORG ( ORG ) accused Mr PERSON of having suppressed the single author profile because it did not correspond with what he imagined the author of the offences would be .", "In DATE the television film \u201c The Letter Bomber \u201d ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) , an NORP and NORP co - production , which was to be shown on NORP and NORP television , was presented to the press . The film , a fiction , based its story - line on the above cited series of letter bombs . It dramatised in substance the criminal investigations from the point of view of the expert on criminal psychology , the responsible of the investigation team and the committer himself .", "In the film the character of the Minister for the ORG , Mr M , favoured for political reasons the theory attributing the bombs to a group of right wing extremists and therefore suppressed the single author theory . This becomes particularly evident in CARDINAL scene , where Mr M forbade the film character personating the expert on criminal psychology to publish the psychological profile of the author of the offences and shortly afterwards forbade him to speak to the press .", "CARDINAL . The article at issue", "On DATE the second applicant published a CARDINAL - page article under the heading \u201c Bomber \u2013 Film with explosive message \u201d in the \u201c PERSON GPE \u201d .", "The subtitles read as follows : \u201c Already seen for readers of the \u201c Krone \u201d : the television thriller about the hunting down of PERSON . Suspenseful and close to the truth . Particularly close to the political [ truth ] \u201d .", "In its first paragraph the article again stated that the film at issue was a \u201c thriller with an explosive political message- against the former Federal Minister for the Interior PERSON \u201d", "The article went on to describe the film as the result of meticioulous investigation and possessing a documentary quality . It then explained that the film concentrated on CARDINAL important aspects . On the one hand the fierce and long lasting battle of the criminal psychologist defending the single author theory against his colleagues . And , on the other hand , his battle", "\u201c against a Minister for the ORG who refuses for political reasons to communicate the psychological profile of the author of the offences - which later turned out to be astonishing correct - to the public . And this because in view of forthcoming elections the Minister - everybody in GPE knows , that PERSON is meant - prefers to have the search continued much too long in the right wing circles . [ This matter is ] still political explosive DATE . Bad rumour has it that this is possibly the reason why the broadcast [ of the film ] by ORG - originally planned for DATE before the elections in GPE - has been postponed to DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Defamation proceedings and compensation under LAW", "Mr PERSON filed a private prosecution for defamation ( \u00fcble GPE ) against the second applicant and a compensation claim against the first applicant company under LAW ( Mediengesetz ) with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE ORG ordered the first applicant to publish a notice on the introduction of the proceedings .", "On DATE and on DATE ORG held hearings and heard inter alia the second applicant , Mr GPE , the criminal psychologist , the Director General for public security ( ORG f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliche ORG ) and the responsible police officer for the criminal investigations at the time of the letter bomb series .", "On DATE ORG convicted the second applicant of defamation under LAW ) and sentenced him to a fine CARDINAL DATE rates ( PERSON ) of ORG CARDINAL each ( i.e a total of ORG DATE , CARDINAL [ approximately \u20ac CARDINAL,CARDINAL ] ) or DATE imprisonment in default .", "It further ordered the applicant company to pay ORG CARDINAL ( MONEY ) as compensation to Mr GPE , pursuant to LAW .", "Finally , the court ordered confiscation of the remaining stocks of the relevant issue of \u201c ORG \u201d and the publication of extracts from its judgment .", "The court noted that the second applicant had not merely repeated the story - line of the television film but had rather given the reader the impression that he identified with its message . He had conveyed to the reader that Mr GPE , in abuse of his authority , had disregarded his duty to resolve properly and efficiently the letter bomb case . He had thereby accused Mr PERSON of behaviour contrary to honour or morality ( unehrenhaftes PERSON ) , namely of politically motivated breach of his professional duty .", "This accusation was a statement of fact . The applicant had , however , failed to supply any evidence to prove this reproach .", "The court noted in this regard that Mr PERSON had mobilised a special investigation team for the investigation concerning the letter bomb series . Mr PERSON had not given any instruction as to the orientation of the investigations nor had he prevented the experts from investigating all avenues .", "The court found it established that in DATE a book about the psychological profile of a single author of all acts was presented to the public . The idea behind the book , which had been written in cooperation with the Director General for public security and the expert on criminal psychology , was to get by this way in contact with the still unknown author of the attacks and to prompt a reaction from him . It subsequently came to a debate between the chief executive officer for public security and Mr GPE as the latter had not been informed about the publication of the book . The expert on criminal psychology had been instructed not to give any statements on that subject to the public . However , there had never been a discussion between Mr PERSON and the expert on criminal psychology during which the latter had requested permission from Mr PERSON to publish the single committer profile which Mr PERSON had refused . Nor was there any further indication that Mr PERSON had in fact influenced , had given instructions or had hindered the investigations .", "The court further noted that the second applicant had not complied with the standards of journalistic diligence . The second applicant had in particular never confronted Mr PERSON with the reproaches he was raising against him .", "The applicants appealed against this judgment and argued inter alia that the court had wrongly classified the article at issue as a statement of fact instead of a value judgment , which , at all events , was based on true facts . They referred in this regard to the statements of the witnesses in the proceedings before the Regional court according to which Mr PERSON had been of the opinion that the bombs had to be attributed to several committers .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) dismissed the applicants ' appeal . It noted that the article could not be seen as neutral reporting . It was true that the second applicant in his article correctly reproduced the story of the film . He had , however , added formulations and wordings which showed that he identified with the film 's message , found its reproaches justified and repeated them .", "It further noted that at the time of the criminal investigations the experts ' opinions had been divided on the question whether the bombs had to be attributed to a single person or to a group of right wing extremists . At this time nobody could have taken it for established that the single committer theory finally turned out to be correct . The mere preference of CARDINAL of the hypothesis could therefore not justify the reproach that the other hypothesis had been suppressed on purpose . Nor did the statements of the witnesses in the proceedings at issue give any indication that Mr PERSON had abused his function .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation ; the victim can thus claim damages from him / her . In this context \u201c defamation \u201d has been defined in LAW ) , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document , by broadcasting or otherwise , in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public , shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine ...", "CARDINAL . The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true . As regards the offence defined in paragraph CARDINAL , he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
