The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , born in DATE and resident in GPE , GPE .

The applicant was arrested by the police on DATE and detained for interrogation for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME he was brought before a magistrate of ORG . The charge was read out by a police inspector . It was alleged in the charge that the applicant had defiled his girlfriend in a public place ( an offence involving sexual acts ) and threatened her family . The applicant pleaded not guilty .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims \u2013 without this having been commented on by the Government \u2013 that his counsel requested his unconditional release invoking his youth and the absence of any reasons for detaining him . The magistrate requested the applicant \u2019s counsel to lodge an application for bail . The applicant \u2019s counsel lodged a bail application in which it was stated that the applicant denied all the accusations against him and , in view of his youth and other relevant circumstances , requested to be granted provisional release .", "On DATE the acting registrar of ORG communicated the application to the Attorney - General who was given DATE in which to reply .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant was found guilty of defilement in a public place . The magistrate , having regard to the absence of violence , the applicant \u2019s youth , his previous good conduct , the fact that he was engaged to the girl and that most of the sexual acts took place while he was under CARDINAL , discharged the applicant on probation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a constitutional application to ORG arguing that there had been a violation of LAW in that the magistrate before whom he had appeared DATE before did not have the power to order his release at that stage . Since he was facing charges attracting a maximum sentence of DATE imprisonment , the application for bail had to be communicated to the Attorney - General before a decision could be taken on it . Moreover , the acting registrar had not communicated the application to the Attorney - General on DATE , as the law prescribed , but on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It was decided that the applicant \u2019s constitutional application would be heard on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the First Hall of ORG , having noted that the applicant had not been notified of the hearing , decided to adjourn the examination of his constitutional application until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

It briefly reviewed the proceedings in the applicant \u2019s case , noting that on DATE the applicant had lodged a bail application which was communicated to the Attorney - General on DATE ; that the Attorney - General had opposed it within CARDINAL hours ; that on DATE ORG had deferred judgment ; and that on DATE it had decided to release the applicant after the victim had given evidence . On the substance of the application FAC held that the provisions of LAW , which required written notification of the Attorney - General , were inconsistent with the provisions of LAW in failing to provide for the prompt consideration of the application for bail . It also found a breach of LAW in the time taken by the acting registrar to notify the Attorney - General . The court awarded the applicant MONEY by way of compensation .", "CARDINAL . The respondents in the action \u2013 the Commissioner of Police , the acting registrar , the Attorney - General and the Prime Minister \u2013 appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reversed the decision of FAC . It found that what had actually occurred did not violate the fundamental human rights of the applicant as guaranteed by LAW . It also awarded costs against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides as follows :", "\u201c Any magistrate who , in a matter within his powers , fails or refuses to attend to a lawful complaint touching an unlawful detention , and any officer of ORG , who , on a similar complaint made to him , fails to prove that he reported the same to his superior authorities within TIME shall , on conviction , be liable to imprisonment for a term from DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE in PERSON v. Attorney - General ORG rejected the appellant \u2019s argument that LAW of LAW only provided for a penalty and not for a remedy . According to ORG , if the way in which LAW had been applied were to be examined , the conclusion would be the same as that reached by Chief Justice PERSON . The latter in his academic writings asserted that although habeas corpus is not essentially a part of the ordinary law of GPE , there are in LAW two provisions , namely Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL which , taken together , may be regarded as providing an equally effective safeguard of personal freedom .", "CARDINAL . The parties before ORG referred to the following examples of cases in which Article CARDINAL had been invoked .", "On DATE the ORG ordered PERSON to be detained for TIME for contempt of court . The detainee appealed under LAW . The Attorney - General , with reference to ORG having invoked LAW , requested ORG to order the acting registrar of the court and the Commissioner of Police to bring ORG before the court and order either of them to set him free at once . ORG \u2019s appeal had suspensive effect on the execution of the judgment and , as a result , his continued detention was illegal . ORG acceded to the Attorney - General \u2019s request .", "PERSON , later christened PERSON , invoked Article CARDINAL of LAW to challenge his prolonged and indefinite detention further to a removal order . He claimed that his detention , which had started in DATE , had been rendered illegal because of its length and indefinite duration . On DATE ORG ordered that the Attorney - General be notified and , having heard his views , still on DATE , decided to reject the application .", "On DATE PERSON relied on LAW to challenge the lawfulness of his prolonged detention pending an investigation into his assets , which had been sequestrated by court order . He claimed that the detention had been unduly prolonged . Moreover , he asserted that he had very little property . On DATE ORG transmitted the case file to the Attorney - General and abstained from further consideration of the application .", "On DATE ORG rejected an application for release by PERSON . It observed :", "\u201c As results from the records several applications have been filed , before this ORG and before ORG , so that the person charged may be released , which applications have always been dealt with expeditiously , which fact makes it manifest in the most glaring manner how superfluous and incomprehensible the first paragraph of the present application is , where it refers to LAW . \u201d ( unofficial translation from LANGUAGE )", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the Government claimed that if it appeared to the magistrate that the arrest was unlawful the magistrate was obliged to order the arrested person \u2019s release . The magistrate had this obligation by virtue of the provisions of LAW . Every person in GPE was assured that an arrest could not last beyond TIME and the appearance before the magistrate ensured that if the arrested person had any submissions to make , he or she could do so in the presence of a totally independent person and not before a representative of the prosecuting authority . In connection with habeas corpus decisions , under LAW the magistrate did not need to hear the Attorney - General . However , since this was an adversarial procedure where the prosecution was led by the police , the magistrate was expected to hear the police as parties to the case in observance of the principle audi alteram partem and the principle of equality of arms . This was a power quite separate and distinct from the power to grant bail . If the arrest was found by the magistrate to be unlawful , then the magistrate had to order the release of the person arrested and the question of bail did not therefore arise . Only if there was nothing to show that the arrest was unlawful did the question of bail arise .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , read together with LAW , is considered by the Government to provide an effective safeguard of personal freedom equivalent to habeas corpus ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

( CARDINAL ) Every officer of ORG below the rank of inspector shall , on securing the person arrested , forthwith report the arrest to an officer not below the rank of inspector who , if he finds sufficient grounds for the arrest , shall order the person arrested to be brought before ORG ; otherwise he shall release him .", "( CARDINAL ) Where an order is given for the person arrested to be brought before ORG , such order shall be carried into effect without any undue delay and shall in no case be deferred beyond TIME . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The powers of ORG in respect of arrested persons who are brought before it under LAW were discussed in extenso in the PERSON case .", "On DATE PERSON , who had been arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence punishable with more than CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , was brought before ORG . He claimed that the prosecution at that stage was obliged to convince the magistrate that the arrest was lawful .", "This request was dealt with by ORG on DATE in the following manner :", "\u201c The procedure which should be followed by ORG as a ORG is set out in ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW . ORG - article ( CARDINAL ) of Article CARDINAL provides how proceedings should start before this ORG : it \u2018 shall hear the report of the police officer on oath , shall examine , without oath , the party accused , and shall hear the evidence in support of the ORG . The time - limit for the conclusion of this inquiry is DATE as indicated in Article CARDINAL . In no way is the ORG bound to hear any evidence in support of the report . Moreover , the fact that the prosecuting officers confirm the report on oath is meant to satisfy the ORG that there is a reasonable suspicion for the person charged to be presented under arrest in view of the charges brought against him .", "ORG does not find anything to censure in the fact that the report confirmed on oath consists of a confirmation on oath of the charges ; after all , in this context , the word \u2018 PERSON means \u2018 ORG .
