The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a surveillance and undercover operation , he was arrested in a van in the company of an undercover police officer known only as \u201c PERSON \u201d . In the van was a briefcase containing QUANTITY of PERCENT pure heroin . On DATE the applicant was convicted in ORG of possessing a Class A drug with intent to supply and was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s defence was that at the time of his arrest he believed he was taking part in a transaction to sell stolen jewellery . He alleged that his participation had been organised by a man named PERSON GPE , whom he had met DATE while both were detained on remand in FAC . According to the applicant , DATE before his arrest PERSON had introduced him to a man called PERSON and a man introduced to him only as \u201c PERSON \u201d . DATE before the arrest , the applicant was contacted by GPE and asked if he would be interested in going to GPE in connection with a jewellery deal in which GPE was acting as intermediary to PERSON . He would be given a cut of the purchase price . The applicant agreed that ORG would pick him up from his home DATE .", "CARDINAL . The following morning he was told that the plans had changed , as PERSON was now coming to GPE . The first applicant agreed to accompany ORG to a public house where , at TIME , a red ORG and a white van drew up . The driver of the ORG was introduced to the applicant as \u201c PERSON ; he was accompanied by a man and a woman , subsequently addressed as \u201c PERSON and \u201c PERSON . The driver of the van was introduced as \u201c PERSON \u201d . PERSON gave PERSON a briefcase containing MONEY ( GBP ) . They all then left in convoy for FAC , FAC , where they were to meet PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At the hotel , ORG decided to stay with the money in the car and asked the applicant to see if PERSON had arrived . The applicant therefore went into the hotel where he met PERSON , who told him that the arrangements had changed again as PERSON was now in GPE . GPE and PERSON asked the applicant to take a taxi to FAC and ask PERSON to return with him to ORG . The applicant followed these instructions and found PERSON , who told him he had to leave immediately for another meeting . PERSON , having spoken to PERSON or PERSON on a mobile phone , gave the applicant the key to a room in the nearby FAC , and explained that the \u201c goods \u201d were in a briefcase in the room .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , PERSON came from LOC in his van and met the applicant outside FAC . PERSON then suggested that the applicant should accompany him up to the room and offered to give him a lift back to ORG afterwards . In the hotel room , PERSON forced the lock on the case while the applicant was in the bathroom , and when he came out PERSON was ready to go . They returned to the van , where the briefcase was opened , and within moments the applicant was arrested .", "CARDINAL . Of all the participants in the above transaction , only the applicant was arrested and charged . The applicant suspects that the other participants were undercover police officers or informers acting on police instructions , but their identities and status have never been revealed to him . In this regard , he considers it relevant that , at the time of the alleged dealings , GPE was on bail to ORG in respect of a large - scale conspiracy to supply cannabis . One of the conspirators was a former ORG detective . It was known to the applicant that PERSON had acted as a participating police informer in that case and it was further known that the police officers involved in the applicant \u2019s case had also investigated the conspiracy for which FAC was on bail . The applicant believes that sentencing in GPE \u2019s trial was deliberately postponed until DATE , DATE after the conclusion of the applicant \u2019s own trial , as a disincentive for GPE to come forward and give evidence concerning the true nature of the transaction .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the commencement of the applicant \u2019s trial , the prosecution gave notice to the defence that an application to withhold material evidence had been made ex parte in advance of the trial under the procedure approved in NORP v. PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Judge PERSON , who considered the material in the absence of the defence , concluded that it would not assist the defence and that there were genuine public interest grounds for withholding it . This ruling was subsequently reconsidered by the trial judge , who had the benefit of a document prepared by the defence outlining the issues in the case , as well as of the oral submissions of defence counsel . In the course of the proceedings before ORG , the Government revealed for the first time that the material placed before the trial judge had included information indicating that the applicant had been involved in the supply of heroin before the start of the undercover operation . The subject matter of the public interest immunity evidence was not disclosed to the applicant during the domestic proceedings , either at first instance or on appeal . The trial judge , who directed himself in accordance with the approach set out by ORG in NORP v. PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , decided that the evidence in question would not assist the defence and found genuine public interest grounds in favour of non - disclosure .", "CARDINAL . Following the ruling on disclosure , the defence made an application to the trial judge under section CARDINAL of ORG PACE \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to exclude the evidence of PERSON , on the basis that the applicant had been entrapped into committing the offence . These submissions were rejected . The judge held that in the course of the ex parte application he had heard nothing and seen no material which would have assisted the defence in their argument that evidence should be excluded under section CARDINAL on grounds of entrapment . He continued that , if he had seen or heard any such material , he would have ordered disclosure .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the applicant , PERSON was the only participant in the offence to give evidence at the trial . He testified that the applicant had made a number of incriminating statements to him when they were alone together in the van and hotel room . Although PERSON claimed to have made a full note of the alleged conversations , these notes were never shown to the applicant and the applicant was not questioned in connection with their content by the investigating police officers . According to the applicant , it was , however , difficult for the defence to undermine PERSON \u2019s credibility because his full name and other identifying details were not disclosed .", "CARDINAL . Following his conviction , the applicant appealed to ORG on the ground , inter alia , that the judge had been wrong to refuse to order disclosure . Dismissing the appeal on DATE , ORG , having itself examined the undisclosed evidence , observed that \u201c each one of us reached the clearest possible view that nothing in the documents withheld could possibly have assisted the defence at trial ; indeed quite the reverse \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . Prior to the events in question , he had been of good character and employed as accounts director in a firm which had gone into liquidation DATE . At the time of his arrest in DATE , he was unemployed and in considerable debt .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s version of events , which he maintained from the time of his first interview with the police , was that he had been introduced to a man named \u201c PERSON \u201d by an acquaintance , PERSON , since PERSON appeared interested in purchasing from the applicant some bankrupt stock . At a meeting in DATE , PERSON had started talking about counterfeit currency and had pressed the applicant to obtain some as part of the transaction . Although the applicant had never hitherto been involved with counterfeit currency , he did have a contact , \u201c PERSON , who was able to supply forged banknotes .", "CARDINAL . PERSON went on to introduce the applicant to CARDINAL men called \u201c NORP \u201d and \u201c Jazz \u201d . At a third meeting on DATE , PERSON turned up with \u201c PERSON \u201d , who was subsequently revealed to be an undercover police officer , and an order for a large amount of currency was placed . It appears from the transcript of covert tape recordings made during this meeting that , while the applicant was not unwilling to become involved , he was actively encouraged to do so by PERSON and PERSON , who put a certain amount of pressure on him to supply more notes of a higher denomination than had at first been agreed . On DATE the applicant met PERSON and another undercover officer , \u201c PERSON , in a public house car park . He showed them some counterfeit notes , and was immediately arrested by uniformed officers . More counterfeit notes were found when his house was searched .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that he had been entrapped by undercover police officers and/or participating informers into committing the offences . On DATE he applied to ORG judge for an order that the indictment should be stayed on the grounds that , as a result of the covert activities of undercover police officers and/or participating informers , ( a ) it was not possible for him to have a fair trial and ( b ) the moral integrity of the criminal proceedings had been impaired . He also requested the judge to order the prosecution to provide more information and documents , including information relating to the question whether PERSON , PERSON or \u201c GPE , GPE or PERSON were participating informers or undercover police officers .", "CARDINAL . Prior to making his ruling on the defence application , the judge heard , ex parte , an application by the prosecution to withhold certain material evidence on grounds of public interest immunity . The judge refused to grant a stay or to order further disclosure , indicating that most of the information sought was subject to public interest immunity . He also ruled that , while it was clear that PERSON had been coaxing the applicant , there was no evidence of pressure having been applied .", "CARDINAL . A second submission was then made on the applicant \u2019s behalf to exclude the evidence of undercover police officers under section CARDINAL of PACE . However , before evidence was called from the officers in question \u2013 PERSON and PERSON \u2013defence counsel sought guidance from the judge as to the areas of cross - examination which would or would not be allowed , given that certain issues relating to the investigation were covered by public interest immunity . It became apparent that most of the areas of cross - examination necessary to develop the submission were not to be allowed . Accordingly , the submission was withdrawn and the applicant entered guilty pleas to the indictment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was sentenced to a total of DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel advised that the applicant had no prospects of success in appealing against conviction , since he would have to demonstrate that the convictions were unsafe before an appeal could succeed . This would be impossible given that , on his own account , he had been motivated by money to enter into the deal to sell counterfeit currency . Counsel also expressed the view that :", "\u201c Had there been anything within the [ public interest immunity ] material which could have assisted the Defendant in developing his case to exclude the evidence under s.CARDINAL PACE I am confident the Judge would have released it . In those circumstances , I advise that there are no grounds of appeal against conviction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The fact that a defendant would not have committed an offence were it not for the activity of an undercover police officer or an informer acting on police instructions does not provide a defence under LANGUAGE law . The judge does , however , have a discretion to order a stay of a prosecution where it appears that entrapment has occurred , as ORG affirmed in PERSON ; Attorney - General \u2019s Reference ( no . CARDINAL of DATE ) ( [ DATE ] ORG DATE ) , a judgment which followed and approved earlier case - law , including case - law which applied at the time of the applicants\u2019 trials ( for example , the judgment of ORG in NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports ORG ) .", "In GPE , Lord PERSON of GPE explained ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c My ORG , every court has an inherent power and duty to prevent abuse of its process . This is a fundamental principle of the rule of law . By recourse to this principle courts ensure that executive agents of the ORG do not misuse the coercive , law - enforcement functions of the courts and thereby oppress citizens of the ORG . Entrapment ... is an instance where such misuse may occur . It is simply not acceptable that the ORG through its agents should lure its citizens into committing acts forbidden by the law and then seek to prosecute them for doing so . That would be entrapment . That would be a misuse of ORG power , and an abuse of the process of the courts . The unattractive consequences , frightening and sinister in extreme cases , which ORG conduct of this nature could have are obvious . The role of the courts is to stand between the ORG and its citizens and make sure this does not happen . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , the court has a discretion , under section CARDINAL of ORG , to exclude evidence obtained by an undercover police officer where , inter alia , the defendant would not have committed the offence without police incitement ( see NORP v. PERSON ; NORP v. PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL , judgment of ORG ; and PERSON , cited above ) . Of the CARDINAL remedies , the grant of a stay , rather than the exclusion of evidence , is the more appropriate remedy because a prosecution founded on entrapment is an abuse of the court \u2019s process and should not have been brought in the first place .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , ORG agreed that it was not possible to set out a comprehensive definition of unacceptable police conduct or \u201c ORG - created crime \u201d . In each case it was for the judge , having regard to all the circumstances , to decide whether the conduct of the police or other law - enforcement agency was so seriously improper as to bring the administration of justice into question . Factors to be taken into account included the nature of the offence , the reason for the particular police operation , the possibility of using other methods of detection and the nature and extent of police participation in the crime ; the greater the inducement offered by the police , and the more forceful and persistent the police overtures , the more readily a court might conclude that the police had overstepped the boundary , since their conduct might well have brought about the commission of a crime by a person who would normally avoid crime of that kind . The police should act in good faith to uncover evidence of criminal acts which they reasonably suspected the accused was about to commit or was already engaged in committing , and the police operation should be properly supervised . The defendant \u2019s criminal record was unlikely to be relevant unless it could be linked to other factors grounding reasonable suspicion that he or she had been engaged in the criminal activity in question prior to the involvement of the police ( per Lord PERSON , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ; Lord PERSON , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . At common law , the prosecution has a duty to disclose any material which has or might have some bearing on the offence charged . This duty extends to any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial and statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Attorney - General issued guidelines , which did not have force of law , concerning exceptions to the common - law duty to disclose to the defence evidence of potential assistance to it ( ( DATE ) CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports DATE \u201c the Guidelines \u201d ) ) . According to the Guidelines , the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within CARDINAL of the categories set out in paragraph CARDINAL . CARDINAL of these categories ( CARDINAL ) ) was \u201c sensitive \u201d material which , because of its sensitivity , it would not be in the public interest to disclose . \u201c Sensitive material \u201d was defined as follows :", "\u201c ... ( a ) it deals with matters of national security ; or it is by , or discloses the identity of , a member of ORG who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known ; ( b ) it is by , or discloses the identity of , an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger ; ( c ) it is by , or discloses the identity of , a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known ; ( d ) it contains details which , if they became known , might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect ; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime ; ( e ) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed , at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier \u2013 e.g. a bank official ; ( f ) it relates to other offences by , or serious allegations against , someone who is not an accused , or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him ; ( g ) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. Ward ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to decide whether or not relevant evidence should be retained on grounds of public interest immunity . It explained that \u201c ... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against , on the other hand , the interests of justice . Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life , the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity , and outlined CARDINAL different procedures to be adopted . The first procedure , which had generally to be followed , was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held . The defence would then have the opportunity to make representations to the court . Secondly , however , where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed , the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made , but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte . The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question . In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that although ex parte applications limited the rights of the defence , in some cases the only alternative would be to require the prosecution to choose between following an inter partes procedure or declining to prosecute , and in rare but serious cases the abandonment of a prosecution in order to protect sensitive evidence would be contrary to the public interest . It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that , even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing , the defence had \u201c as much protection as can be given without pre - empting the issue \u201d . Finally , it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed . Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure \u201c in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant \u201d . For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial .", "CARDINAL . The leading case on disclosure at the time of the applicants\u2019 trials was the judgment of ORG in NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) . The Lord Chief Justice , giving the judgment of the court , held that the prosecution should put before the judge only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold on grounds of public interest immunity . \u201c Material \u201d evidence was defined as evidence which could be seen , \u201c on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution : ( CARDINAL ) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case ; ( CARDINAL ) to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose existence is not apparent from the evidence which the prosecution proposes to use ; ( CARDINAL ) to hold out a real ( as opposed to fanciful ) prospect of providing a lead on evidence which goes to ( CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Once the judge was seized of the material , he or she had to perform the balancing exercise between the public interest in non - disclosure and the importance of the documents to the issues of interest , or likely to be of interest , to the accused . If the disputed material might prove the defendant \u2019s innocence or avoid a miscarriage of justice , the balance came down firmly in favour of disclosing it . Where , on the other hand , the material in question would not be of assistance to the accused , but would in fact assist the prosecution , the balance was likely to be in favour of non - disclosure .", "CARDINAL . In the case of NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL ) , ORG returned to the balancing exercise , stating , inter alia :", "\u201c Since NORP v. Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants\u2019 names and roles , alleging that those details are essential to the defence . Defences that the accused has been set up , and allegations of duress , which used at one time to be rare , have multiplied . We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care . They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details , because they are essential to the running of the defence , are justified . If they are not so justified , then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure . Clearly , there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will . Again , there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more ; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting , surrounding , or following the crime . Even when the informant has participated , the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence , present or potential , as to make disclosure necessary ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The requirements of disclosure have since been set out in a statutory scheme . Under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act DATE ( ORG ) , which came into force in GPE and GPE immediately upon gaining FAC on DATE , the prosecution must make \u201c primary disclosure \u201d of all previously undisclosed evidence which , in the prosecutor \u2019s view , might undermine the case for the prosecution . The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court , setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution . The prosecution must then make a \u201c secondary disclosure \u201d of all previously undisclosed material \u201c which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused \u2019s defence as disclosed by the defence statement \u201d . Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court .", "CARDINAL . Following the judgments of ORG in PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) and ORG and Others and PERSON and Others v. GPE ( DATE , Reports CARDINAL ) , the GPE introduced legislation making provision for the appointment of a \u201c special counsel \u201d in certain cases involving national security . The provisions are contained in ORG Act DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) and LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Under this legislation , where it is necessary on national security grounds for the relevant tribunal to sit in camera , in the absence of the affected individual and his or her legal representatives , the Attorney - General may appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings . The legislation provides that the special counsel is not however \u201c responsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent \u201d , thus ensuring that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which can not be disclosed . The relevant rules giving effect to the DATE and CARDINAL Acts are set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the government commissioned a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system , under the chairmanship of a senior ORG judge , Sir PERSON . The report , published in DATE after extensive consultation and entitled \u201c The Review of the Criminal Courts in England and GPE \u201d ( \u201c the Auld Report \u201d ) , recommended , inter alia , the introduction of a \u201c special counsel \u201d scheme in cases where the prosecution wished to seek , ex parte , non - disclosure on grounds of public interest immunity . The recommendation was explained in ORG as follows ( footnotes omitted ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The scheme [ developed by the common law since NORP v. Ward and reflected in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act DATE : see above ] is an improvement on what went before and has been generally welcomed on that account . But there is widespread concern in the legal professions about lack of representation of the defendant \u2019s interest in the [ ex parte ] forms of application , and anecdotal and reported instances of resultant unfairness to the defence . ... A suggestion , argued on behalf of applicants in GPE and widely supported in the ORG , is that the exclusion of the defendant from the procedure should be counterbalanced by the introduction of a \u2018 special independent ORG . He would represent the interest of the defendant at first instance and , where necessary , on appeal on a number of issues : first , as to the relevance of the undisclosed material if and to the extent that it has not already been resolved in favour of disclosure but for a public interest immunity claim ; second , on the strength of the claim to public interest immunity ; third , on how helpful the material might be to the defence ; and fourth , generally to safeguard against the risk of judicial error or bias .", "CARDINAL . In my view , there is much to be said for such a proposal , regardless of the vulnerability or otherwise of the present procedures to LAW . PERSON , in a paper prepared for the ORG , has argued powerfully in favour of it . It would restore some adversarial testing of the issues presently absent in the determination of these often critical and finely balanced applications . It should not be generally necessary for special counsel to be present throughout the trial . Mostly the matter should be capable of resolution by the court before trial and , if any question about it arises during trial , he could be asked to return . If , because of the great number of public interest immunity issues now being taken in the courts , the instruction of special counsel for each would be costly , it simply indicates , as PERSON has commented , the scale of the problem and is not an argument against securing a fair solution .", "CARDINAL . NORP The role would be similar to that of an amicus curiae brought in to give independent assistance to a court , albeit mostly on appeal . In rape cases , where an unrepresented defendant seeks to cross - examine a complainant , the court must inform him that he may not do so , and should he refuse to instruct counsel , the court will appoint and instruct one . After the decisions of ORG in PERSON and PERSON , the government introduced such a procedure in immigration cases involving national security . Although such cases are extremely rare , it is sufficient that the principle of a \u2018 ORG or \u2018 special\u2019 counsel being instructed on behalf of a defendant has been conceded in a number of areas .", "CARDINAL . The introduction of a system of special independent counsel could , as PERSON has also noted , in part fill a lacuna in the law as to public interest immunity hearings in the absence of a defendant appellant in ORG , to which LAW and supporting Rules do not apply . Where there has been a breach of LAW because a trial judge did not conduct a public interest immunity hearing due to the emergence of the material only after conviction , ORG has held that the breach can not be cured by a hearing before ORG in the absence of the appellant . The ORG \u2019s reasons for so holding were that the appeals court is confined to examining the effect of non - disclosure on the trial ex post facto and could possibly be unconsciously influenced by the jury \u2019s verdict into underestimating the significance of the undisclosed material .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , even the introduction of special counsel to such hearings would not solve the root problem to which I have referred of police failure , whether out of incompetence or dishonesty , to indicate to the prosecutor the existence of critical information . Unless , as I have recommended , the police significantly improve their performance in that basic exercise , there will be no solid foundation for whatever following safeguards are introduced into the system .", "I recommend the introduction of a scheme for instruction by the court of special independent counsel to represent the interests of the defendant in those cases at first instance and on appeal where the court now considers prosecution applications in the absence of the defence in respect of the non - disclosure of sensitive material . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. H. ; PERSON ] ORG DATE , decided on DATE after the ORG judgment in the present case , ORG of ORG held , inter alia :", "\u201c DATE since the decision in PERSON see paragraph CARDINAL above ] and the enactment of the ORG [ see paragraph CARDINAL above ] have witnessed the introduction in some areas of the law of a novel procedure designed to protect the interests of a party against whom an adverse order may be made and who can not ( either personally or through his legal representative ) , for security reasons , be fully informed of all the material relied on against him . The procedure is to appoint a person , usually called a \u2018 special advocate\u2019 , who may not disclose to the subject of the proceedings the secret material disclosed to him , and is not in the ordinary sense professionally responsible to that party but who , subject to those constraints , is charged to represent that party \u2019s interests . ...", "There is as yet little express sanction in domestic legislation or domestic legal authority for the appointment of a special advocate or special counsel to represent , as an advocate in ORG [ public interest immunity from disclosure ] matters , a defendant in an ordinary criminal trial ... But novelty is not of itself an objection , and cases will arise in which the appointment of an approved advocate as special counsel is necessary , in the interests of justice , to secure protection of a criminal defendant \u2019s right to a fair trial . Such an appointment does however raise ethical problems , since a lawyer who can not take full instructions from his client , nor report to his client , who is not responsible to his client and whose relationship with the client lacks the quality of confidence inherent in any ordinary lawyer - client relationship , is acting in a way hitherto unknown to the legal profession . While not insuperable , these problems should not be ignored , since neither the defendant nor the public will be fully aware of what is being done . The appointment is also likely to cause practical problems : of delay , while the special counsel familiarises himself with the detail of what is likely to be a complex case ; of expense , since the introduction of an additional , high - quality advocate must add significantly to the cost of the case ; and of continuing review , since it will not be easy for a special counsel to assist the court in its continuing duty to review disclosure , unless the special counsel is present throughout or is instructed from time to time when need arises . Defendants facing serious charges frequently have little inclination to cooperate in a process likely to culminate in their conviction , and any new procedure can offer opportunities capable of exploitation to obstruct and delay . None of these problems should deter the court from appointing special counsel where the interests of justice are shown to require it . But the need must be shown . Such an appointment will always be exceptional , never automatic ; a course of last and never first resort . It should not be ordered unless and until the trial judge is satisfied that no other course will adequately meet the overriding requirement of fairness to the defendant . ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
