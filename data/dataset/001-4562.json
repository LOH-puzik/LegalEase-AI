He is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE , ORG ( ORG ) of GPE informed the GPE customs authorities that the ship named PERSON had left the harbour of GPE ( GPE ) for GPE , where it would arrive on DATE . According to this information , this ship was transporting QUANTITY of cocaine which had been bought by CARDINAL ORG , who had also recruited the ship \u2019s crew . The CARDINAL Dutchmen , possibly dressed as maintenance engineers , would take the cocaine from the ship in GPE . The information , which the ORG classified PERCENT certain , further contained a physical description of the CARDINAL Dutchmen concerned .", "On the basis of this information , the NORP customs authorities , in consultation with ORG ( ORG en Opsporingsdienst - \u201c ORG ) , decided that ORG ) , on the basis of its general powers of control under ORG ( PERSON inzake Douane en Accijnzen ) , would on DATE place the ship ORG under observation and would carry out an intensified control of the people leaving the ship and their possible vehicles .", "On DATE , the ship ORG was moored in the GPE harbour area . Observation of that area revealed that TIME a Peugeot personal car with CARDINAL passengers arrived . These QUANTITY persons , who were not carrying any luggage , shortly visited the ship and , still without luggage , left the ship and drove away in the ORG , which was then followed by customs officers in CARDINAL cars .", "When , at some point , a stop signal was given from CARDINAL of the CARDINAL cars which were following the Peugeot , the latter sped away . Shortly after , the CARDINAL passengers of the Peugeot car abandoned the vehicle and were pursued on foot by CARDINAL customs officers . CARDINAL of the QUANTITY persons got away and the other one , the applicant , was involved in a shoot - out with the customs officers . In the course of the shooting , one the customs officers , PERSON , was fatally injured . The applicant was slightly injured . On his arrest , the applicant was found to be wearing CARDINAL jackets , containing in total QUANTITY of cocaine . The person who had escaped had left behind CARDINAL jackets , which contained a similar quantity of cocaine .", "By summons of DATE , the applicant was ordered to appear on DATE before ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE on drug and manslaughter charges .", "On DATE , ORG rejected a request by the defence for a reconstruction of the shooting and granted their request an adjournment , as a certain forensic report had only recently been made available to the defence .", "On DATE , ORG ordered that evidence be taken by the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) from the experts mentioned in a letter dated DATE from the defence . It adjourned its further examination for a maximum period of DATE and referred the case to the investigating judge .", "On DATE , ORG heard the applicant and considered a request by the defence for another adjournment in order to obtain further relevant forensic and other information . Having deliberated , the court partially granted the request by the defence and , consequently , adjourned its examination for a further DATE period and referred the case to the investigating judge . It requested the latter to have the bullet tips RCARDINAL and RCARDINAL examined for deformations , to take evidence from the CARDINAL persons who had seen the bullet tips fall from the clothes of PERSON , and to do whatever he considered useful and necessary in the interest of the examination of the applicant \u2019s case .", "On DATE , ORG resumed its examination and , following a request by the prosecution , adjourned its examination until DATE , when it heard the applicant and the parties\u2019 final pleas .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of manslaughter and narcotics offences and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . As regards the charge of manslaughter , ORG did not find it established that the applicant had acted in self - defence . The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "On DATE , ORG took oral evidence from the applicant , the customs officers PERSON , F.d . B. and ORG . NORP involved in the pursuit and shooting of DATE , the experts PERSON and PERSON of ORG concerning the forensic examination of the clothes of ORG and the weapons and ammunition used in the shooting , and from the officers NORP , GPE and GPE of the forensic police ( technische recherche ) involved in the initial technical investigation .", "After the hearing of these persons , the defence requested a further forensic examination in GPE , the necessary technical equipment only being available there , in order to examine whether the lead - free ammunition used had been in contact with a human body and the clothes , and a further examination of the traces of the ammunition . ORG rejected this request , holding :", "< Translation >", "\u201c \u2026 the necessity < of the defence request > has not been established . In this respect the court has taken into consideration that ORG at ORG has extensively examined the clothes and other items , as appears from the report of DATE , in which it is stated , inter alia , that all micro - chemical test reactions for lead and copper at the bullet entry perforations have been positive . It further appears from the statement of the expert PERSON that such an examination can no longer be regarded as useful . The ORG further finds not a single ( factual ) point of departure in the present case - file or in the trial proceedings so far conducted which might support the accused \u2019s contentions that , firstly , the victim H. would have been hit by a lead - free bullet from a weapon of CARDINAL of his colleagues and , secondly , that a lead - content bullet has ended up in an improper way between the victim \u2019s clothes where it was < subsequently > found by staff of ORG . \u201d", "On DATE , the prosecution informed ORG that the co - accused C. had been extradited from GPE to the GPE on DATE . The defence did not wish to react to this information . After having heard the parties\u2019 final pleadings , ORG closed its examination .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of manslaughter and of having acted contrary to the prohibition under LAW ( PERSON ) , and sentenced him to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment .", "ORG rejected the argument by the defence that the principle of proper intentions ( beginsel van zuiver oogmerk ) had been violated by the customs officers and that , on this basis , the prosecution should be declared inadmissible . The defence argued that the customs officers had used their powers for another purpose than that for which they are intended by following the ORG car , whereas the CARDINAL passengers of this car had a different modus operandi from that predicted by the ORG . According to the defence , there had thus not been a reasonable suspicion of guilt within the meaning of LAW ) . The pursuit at issue was only carried out in order to see whether or not the applicant and the other person had taken the cocaine from the ship .", "After having considered the evidence before it , ORG concluded that the customs officers involved in the events at issue had acted in accordance with , and had not exceeded , their powers under the relevant statutes , i.e. ORG and LAW .", "The defence had further argued that the applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial within the meaning of LAW had been breached in that ORG had failed to respect the principle of equality of arms when it refused", "A. to order a counter - expertise in GPE in order to verify whether only lead - content bullets had been fired at H. ;", "B. to take evidence from the persons who , in the ORG hospital , had handled the clothes of H. ;", "C. to take further oral evidence from the customs officers PERSON , F.d . B. and ORG . PERSON after their testimony of CARDINAL DATE ; and", "D. to order a reconstruction of the events at issue .", "On these points , ORG held , inter alia :", "< Translation >", "\u201c In the course of the judicial investigation the accused has alleged that the police has committed fraud in its investigation and/or has manipulated the investigation by putting , after the shooting , CARDINAL or more bullets shot by the accused , and which , in contrast to the bullets shot by the custom officers , contained lead , between the victim \u2019s clothes and/or in the body bag in which his body was placed and transported to ORG and/or by smearing lead on the victim \u2019s clothes on those places where that clothing was perforated by CARDINAL or more bullet entries . The above contention has been repeated by the accused in his pleadings of DATE .", "Taking this into account , the accused \u2019s requests , as set out under A - D , appear to be based on obtaining a further investigation into the correctness of this contention .", "In his pleadings counsel has taken the position that it can not be considered excluded that - what he calls - the fatal shot at the victim H. has been fired by CARDINAL of his colleagues .", "Taking this into account , the request by counsel appears to be based on obtaining a further investigation into the correctness of that contention \u2026", "The court considers the above requests as follows :", "The expert PERSON of ORG has carried out a so - called shot - remains investigation of the coat and jeans of H. , the results being given in the report of DATE , and a further investigation into soiling , spotted on the front side of the left sleeve of the coat , the results of which are stated in the additional report of CARDINAL DATE ( file II ) .", "An expert - witness heard during the trial on appeal , the aforementioned PERSON , has stated \u2026 that the shot - remains investigation \u2026 standard is aimed at searching for ( traces of ) lead - containing ammunition , that the clothes ( coat and jeans ) have not been tested for lead - free ammunition , that such tests can still be carried out , but that it has appeared during the tests already carried out that around the places in the clothes , where it concerned a bullet entry ( by which the court understands the damage caused by shots at the clothing , in respect of which the conclusion in the report is probable bullet entry damage ) , so many traces of lead , characteristic for lead - containing ammunition , were present that these traces , if there would be traces of lead - free ammunition , would mask the latter traces , and further that when one rubs a lead object against another object , thus leaving behind lead traces , these would be friction traces ( veegsporen ) , but the traces of lead found on the clothes of H. were not friction traces .", "Further taking into consideration that the aforementioned PERSON has stated to the investigating judge \u2026 that the lead - free ammunition of the type Action III used by customs officials \u201c does not really leave that many traces \u201d , the court is of the opinion that in all reasonability it is not to be expected that by a ( yet to be ordered ) investigation of < the > coat and/or jeans of H. for possible traces of lead - free ammunition , also if this investigation is to be entrusted to ORG ( ORG ) in GPE > , no facts or circumstances will appear , which ( could ) entail an indication that shots with CARDINAL or more lead - free projectiles have been fired at the victim H.", "Consequently , the court finds that the necessity of the investigation to be carried out by the < NORP > ORG , requested by the suspect , has not been established ; so that it will reject this request , in which < decision > the court further considers on the above grounds that such an investigation would not serve a useful purpose ; so that it can not be said that by rejecting this request the suspect \u2019s right to counter - expertise is violated . \u2026 . \u201d", "The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) , complaining inter alia that ORG had rejected his argument that the customs officers involved in the events of DATE had exceeded their powers of investigation and that ORG had failed to order a further examination of the clothes of the victim in GPE in order to verify whether or not lead - free bullets had been fired at him .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal in cassation .", "Insofar as the applicant argued that the customs officers had exceeded their powers under LAW for the purpose of investigating acts contrary to LAW , ORG held that the existence of \u201c a reasonable suspicion \u201d that acts contrary to LAW are committed does not constitute a bar to the exercise by customs officers of their powers of control under LAW provided that the exercise of the latter powers respects the guarantees to which an accused is entitled . ORG concluded that ORG had correctly rejected this argument .", "As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that ORG had rejected a request for a further examination of the victim \u2019s clothes , ORG held that this complaint could not lead to cassation and that this finding , in view of LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) , required no further reasons as the complaint did not prompt a determination of legal issues in the interests of legal unity and legal development ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
