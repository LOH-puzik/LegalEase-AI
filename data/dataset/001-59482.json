The facts of the case , particularly concerning events during DATE when security forces conducted an operation in the LOC in south - east GPE , were disputed by the parties . ORG , pursuant to former LAW ( a ) of the LAW , conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties .", "CARDINAL . The Commission Delegates ( PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON ) heard witnesses in GPE from DATE to DATE and on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE . These included the CARDINAL applicants ; PERSON , mother of the disappeared PERSON ; PERSON , brother of the disappeared PERSON ; PERSON , brother of the disappeared PERSON ; PERSON , a villager who witnessed events ; PERSON , NORP gendarme station commander ; PERSON , GPE district gendarme commander ; PERSON , ORG public prosecutor ; PERSON , chief public prosecutor at ORG ; PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , villagers called by the Government ; General PERSON , commander of the Bolu forces during the operation ; PERSON , wife of the disappeared PERSON and PERSON , the mother and sister - in - law of the disappeared PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s findings of fact are set out in its report of CARDINAL October DATE and summarised below ( Section A ) . The applicants accept the ORG \u2019s findings of fact . The Government \u2019s submissions concerning the facts are summarised below ( Section B ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are close relatives of QUANTITY persons who went missing in DATE .", "PERSON is the brother of PERSON and the uncle of PERSON .", "PERSON is the son of PERSON .", "PERSON is the father of PERSON and the brother of PERSON .", "ORG is the brother of PERSON .", "PERSON is the brother of PERSON .", "PERSON is the brother of PERSON .", "PERSON is the brother of PERSON .", "PERSON is the brother of PERSON .", "PERSON is the father of PERSON .", "The CARDINAL men disappeared at the time the security forces were carrying out a massive operation around the LOC in the region between ORG .", "CARDINAL . Alaca village may be described as an area of dispersed hamlets and houses spread over mountainous terrain , which for administrative purposes was regarded as being in the GPE district . Its hamlets included PERSON ( where PERSON , PERSON and PERSON lived ) , PERSON ( where PERSON , his brother PERSON and son PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were said to live ) , PERSON ( where PERSON lived ) , GPE and ORG . Nearby but in the LOC was GPE , including GPE hamlet ( where PERSON and ORG stated that they lived with their brother PERSON ; PERSON also said he lived there with his father PERSON ; PERSON lived there ) .", "CARDINAL . Alaca village was not far from LOC ( NORP ) , where some people led a nomadic style of life and where there were fruit and walnut trees ( PERSON stated that he lived there and PERSON was stated to have pastures there , living a nomadic life with other members of his family ) . The nearest gendarme station was at PERSON , which was on the ORG . Many of the applicants and members of their families were also living in either ORG , the CARDINAL nearest large towns . Some distance to the south of Alaca was GPE of which PERSON was the muhtar .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , terrorist activity was a major concern in this area . There were several ORG bases in the vicinity of Alaca . PERSON , the commander of NORP station , stated that his station had been attacked several times . The GPE district gendarme commander Captain PERSON stated that there was intensive terrorist activity in the GPE area . General PERSON of the Bolu brigade described the area as being the backbone of the NORP activities , and explained that his forces were involved in many operations there . An undated final operation report ( Commission report , paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) described the LOC as the largest training area for the ORG . According to this report , it had fortified defences and enjoyed the support of PERCENT of the hamlets and villages in the region , the villagers from which supplied the ORG with shelter and food . Villagers also used to go into the towns to buy food for the terrorists .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , many people from in and around LOC had left or were about to leave either due to the difficulty of life in the remote mountainous area or due to the security situation . The Commission rejected the evidence of the gendarme witnesses that the area had already been abandoned . The weight of the evidence showed that a significant number of families were still living there , while other villagers from this area continued to move to and from the mountains to the town seasonally . Some , like PERSON and PERSON , were nomadic herders .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , the Bolu brigade assisted by gendarmerie forces conducted a massive military operation . On the evidence of the commanding officer , General PERSON , this involved CARDINAL soldiers and helicopters . Its purpose was to converge soldiers from bases in the GPE and GPE districts on the NORP area to apprehend terrorists and locate their bases , stores and weapons dumps . The operation lasted until DATE . The Government and the applicants were at variance however as to the events which occurred concerning the villagers during the operation .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that the conflict lay between the ORG \u2019s assertion , supported by the security force witnesses , that the missing persons had been kidnapped by the ORG dressed as soldiers and that the families in introducing the applications were acting as the pawns of the ORG , motivated by fear or a desire to obtain financial gain ; and the assertion of the applicants and their families that their relatives had been detained by soldiers during the operation and last seen being taken away by helicopter . The credibility and reliability of the witnesses was the crucial issue .", "CARDINAL . The Commission , relying on its Delegates , found the applicants and the members of their family and the villager PERSON were honest and convincing in the way they gave their evidence . Some were confused about details , in particular about dates , which was not unexpected due to the lapse of time . Some of the women witnesses and PERSON were simple , unsophisticated individuals who were answering sincerely to the best of their ability . The Commission commented that all the applicants showed deep and abiding distress at the uncertainty which they had suffered after the disappearance of their relatives , several making appeals that they might at last be told the fate of their family members . Their evidence was strongly consistent with supporting documentary material , including petitions made by the families shortly after the events and the reliability of this considerable weight of evidence was confirmed as more witnesses were heard . In significant aspects , it was also substantiated by the villager witnesses brought forward by the Government .", "CARDINAL . Conversely , ORG received a negative impression from the gendarme witnesses , PERSON and PERSON . Their evidence , which included the denials that there was any operation in the area at the time , was shown to be unreliable when the General PERSON informed the Delegates that there was such an operation and indicated that both would have been aware . While ORG impressed as a forceful and competent witness , his evidence was given under circumstances which diminished its weight , as the ORG refused to allow the applicant \u2019s representatives to be present when he gave evidence to the Delegates . He showed reluctance to address the factual concerns of the ORG , avoiding precise answers . It found doubts arose as to the reliability of his evidence on the treatment of the villagers , the use of helicopters and the claim that no soldiers went into the villages or hamlets in the Alaca area . It examined the alleged points of inconsistency in the ORG versions of events put forward by the Government . It found that some differences in detail were explicable by the lapse of time and that they were not of such a nature as to undermine the applicants or the witnesses\u2019 credibility . Their accounts were essentially consistent , credible and reliable .", "CARDINAL . On that basis , the ORG found as follows .", "CARDINAL . Soon after the operation started , the soldiers began collecting villagers together , for use as guides to show them the location of settlements and ORG shelters and stores , for questioning about involvement with the ORG and for possible transfer to detention elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . Villagers were first taken into custody on or near LOC on DATE , the soldiers arriving at ORG on CARDINAL October . Some villagers were looked for by name . Others were gathered generally for an identity check . The soldiers set up a camp at GPE , a hill close to the hamlet of PERSON , where helicopters landed , inter alia , to bring in supplies . There were other camps set up , CARDINAL or CARDINAL near GPE and GPE and another near the GPE district boundary , where villagers were held for DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the commencement of the operation , villagers who were living up on LOC witnessed planes carrying out bombardment . PERSON was taken by soldiers , apparently to act as guide . About a day or DATE , PERSON was being held by soldiers at the camp which had been set up at GPE .", "CARDINAL . On or about DATE , PERSON was apprehended by the soldiers . It was unclear exactly where this occurred between PERSON and PERSON . However , he was seen by a number of persons being held shortly afterwards under guard in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On or about DATE , soldiers arrived at the hamlet of GPE , TIME from PERSON . PERSON saw them take her brother - in - law PERSON out of his house . On DATE , PERSON was also picked up by the soldiers at PERSON , who had been asking for him by name . The soldiers told his family that PERSON would show them around and make a statement . PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were also picked up at PERSON .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was apprehended at the beginning of the operation at GPE being taken to ORG , TIME away , where he was joined by PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . DATE , on or DATE , PERSON accompanied the soldiers who took PERSON , ORG and ORG from their homes at GPE , GPE and brought them back to ORG . DATE PERSON and PERSON were brought by soldiers to NORP , where a group of CARDINAL people were being held . They were kept TIME at a place variously described as being at the cemetery , or near ORG or ORG hamlet . They were questioned and tied up during TIME . TIME , on DATE , a helicopter landed and a person arrived with his face covered . Some of the villagers thought to have recognised this man when the wind blew his scarf aside . His identity was not established however . A selection process was carried out , with identity cards being handed in and inspected . All the villagers but CARDINAL were allowed to go . PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , the CARDINAL PERSON brothers , PERSON and a young man , a stranger to the village said to be called PERSON , were placed on a helicopter and flown to GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON and PERSON were apprehended by the soldiers in PERSON on their way to their village GPE from GPE , shortly after the operation started . PERSON and PERSON were with them , having come back from Mu\u015f on the same minibus . The date when they were detained was unclear . However , on an assessment of the varying accounts , the ORG found that the group of PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were brought to GPE before the group from the cemetery at ORG , on or before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Shortly after the operation began , PERSON was detained with others near their village of GPE . These villagers were held on a plateau area near the village for DATE . During that time , checks were made on the radio as to whether any of them were wanted . During this time , they were tied up . On DATE , he and a relative were taken by helicopter to Mu\u015f where he was held in a basement with CARDINAL other people , including PERSON , who were villagers from GPE and other places in GPE . He was released after DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a time unspecified after the operation began , PERSON and several of his male relatives were at their home in GPE when the soldiers took them . They were held by soldiers for DATE in a wood near GPE before being released .", "CARDINAL . On or CARDINAL or DATE , PERSON was detained by soldiers in or near ORG . He was taken DATE to GPE by helicopter where he was detained for DATE . PERSON was also apprehended with several others when he arrived in PERSON on DATE . They were taken up to GPE and their ID cards collected . A man with his face covered seemed to inspect them . By DATE , the CARDINAL men who were later to go missing , were being held at GPE .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , who was DATE , was not from the Alaca village . He is known to have been detained by the police when he arrived in GPE on or DATE . His brother PERSON arrived in GPE , paying visits to him . According to the official documents provided , in particular a release statement of DATE apparently bearing PERSON thumbprint , he ceased to be in police custody at that date . According to the evidence of his father , the applicant PERSON , PERSON arrived to visit him but was told by the police that he had been released . When PERSON did not arrive home however , PERSON and then the applicant went back to GPE to discover what had happened to him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleges that in making enquiries he was told that his son had been handed over to the forces from Bolu who were on an operation . He also heard from nomads that his son had been seen tied up outside the NORP station and that from there he had been taken to PERSON . When he visited PERSON , people there told him that they had seen his son with the other detainees held at GPE .", "CARDINAL . The evidence before the Delegates concerning PERSON showed that he was not known by any of the applicants and witnesses . Several witnesses referred to seeing a person , not from the village , being detained with the other CARDINAL . Others only knew of the name PERSON when his father came looking for him after events . PERSON gave eye - witness evidence that he saw PERSON , detained with them TIME at ORG and taken with them to GPE . However , he did not talk to the young man himself . He stated that PERSON and PERSON who were with the young man , told him that his name was PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Commission observed that there were difficulties in the evidence concerning the identification of PERSON , in particular the differing ages estimated by the persons who saw him . However this could be accounted for , inter alia , by the fact that ill - treatment or living rough over a period of time could change a person \u2019s appearance dramatically . In light of the firm identification of PERSON , supported by the evidence of ORG who had heard from his brother PERSON that PERSON was in the group of TIME and the written statement of DATE by PERSON naming PERSON as a young boy caught in GPE who had been held with him , the Commission was satisfied that these elements were sufficiently coherent and consistent to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he was the eleventh detainee .", "CARDINAL . At GPE , the villagers were held in different groups , to which different restrictions applied . CARDINAL of them ( the persons who later disappeared ) were kept in CARDINAL group . They were tied up , though they were untied for visits , or when they ate or relieved themselves . CARDINAL witnesses ( PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON ) however stated that PERSON , though of this group , was not tied up . Other detainees \u2013 PERSON , PERSON DATE were held in a group of CARDINAL villagers , who were not tied up . They were kept in the camp during DATE and sent to houses in PERSON to spend the night . PERSON and PERSON , who were tied up , were held with or near the group of TIME .", "CARDINAL . As concerning the way in which the QUANTITY men were treated at GPE , the ORG found that :", "\u2013 the QUANTITY persons , save PERSON , were tied up ( PERSON described that her relatives\u2019 toes were swollen as a result ) ;", "\u2013 they were kept outside during DATE and at TIME ( PERSON was seen to be flushed , shaking , his lips chapped and to be affected by the cold ) ;", "\u2013 they were questioned by the soldiers ;", "\u2013 they were in a state of some distress and apprehension ( PERSON was described as hungry , thirsty and miserable ; PERSON told others that he was in a terrible state and feared that they were going to be killed ; PERSON evidence referred to the detainees being in a miserable state , having gone hungry and been tied up for DATE ) ;", "\u2013 PERSON and PERSON were taken from the group by helicopter apparently to act as guides or show locations ;", "\u2013 PERSON was taken away from the group for DATE or CARDINAL and on his return was seen to be limping and needing the support of soldiers to walk ;", "\u2013 PERSON was also taken away to \u015een pastures to act as a guide ;", "\u2013 money ( CARDINAL GPE ) was taken from PERSON by the soldiers ;", "CARDINAL . There was insufficient evidence to establish that the CARDINAL men were subject to torture under interrogation . There was some evidence of beating of the detainees ( PERSON witnessed his brother PERSON being beaten ) , but the nature and extent of the beating was not apparent .", "CARDINAL . By a date about DATE , all the detainees at GPE , save CARDINAL , had been released . Descriptions were given of a selection process where names were called out and those persons released . Some of the remaining detainees were seen being placed in helicopters . The Commission observed that the timing of this event is problematic , the evidence of the principal witnesses being vague or confused on this point . The weight of the evidence placed the last sighting of the remaining CARDINAL detainees at CARDINAL October but this can only be regarded as approximate .", "CARDINAL . The eye - witness evidence as to whom was seen being taken away was also not clear . PERSON referred to seeing ORG and his friends being put on the helicopter but that it was too far to see . PERSON referred to QUANTITY persons . She did not know PERSON and if he was there she was not in a position to identify him . She stated specifically that she could see PERSON and PERSON being put on the helicopter . The Commission noted that the applicants and the other witnesses appeared to associate the placing of detainees on the helicopter with their missing relatives largely because some were identified by the women and also on the basis that these QUANTITY persons were the only detainees remaining at GPE after the others such as ORG and PERSON were released . They had also been held together as a distinct group and were no longer there after the operation ended . While this provided strong circumstantial evidence , the Commission was not satisfied that it could be established , to the necessary standard of proof , that the CARDINAL missing persons were all placed on the helicopters , in particular PERSON , though it was satisfied that at least some of the QUANTITY detainees were . There was no evidence that any of these persons were seen after the operation ended on or about DATE . The Commission found that when they were last seen they were detained under guard by security forces .", "CARDINAL . The applicants approached numerous authorities in the region , sometimes alone or in small and varying groups , seeking to find out what had happened to the CARDINAL missing men from GPE .", "i.
