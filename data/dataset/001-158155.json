The applicant was born in DATE . He is a lawyer who lives and practises in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , in the course of criminal proceedings against ORG and another individual on charges of aggravated theft , punishable by imprisonment of DATE , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) decided that in the interests of justice CARDINAL lawyers should be appointed defence counsel for the CARDINAL accused , who could not afford to pay for a lawyer but wished to be legally represented .", "CARDINAL . ORG sent a request to ORG asking them to nominate CARDINAL lawyers as defence counsel to represent the accused . The letter stated , inter alia , that the counsel \u2019s remuneration would be determined in accordance with the Ordinance of ORG on ORG Minimum Remuneration DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , sent to the applicant and ORG , ORG nominated the applicant to represent PERSON The letter contained the following text :", "\u201c In accordance with section DATE of GPE , you must act as defence counsel ... and appear at the hearing in the court proceedings . Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action under LAW and civil liability vis - \u00e0 - vis the parties [ to the criminal proceedings ] .", "In its decision to appoint [ you as ] defence counsel , the [ criminal ] court ... must set [ your ] remuneration in an amount not lower than the minimum provided for in the Remuneration Ordinance . Otherwise you must refuse to provide legal representation because you are at risk of a disciplinary [ sanction ] for breach of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and the instructions of ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing in the criminal case against PERSON on DATE . At the beginning of the hearing , at TIME , the court appointed the applicant as ORG \u2019s counsel and invited him to state his position in respect of whether there was an obstacle to proceeding with the hearing or not .", "CARDINAL . The applicant replied that he would represent ORG if the court undertook to comply with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which in turn referred to LAW , and thereby determined his remuneration at or above the minimum CARDINAL NORP levs ( ORG ; the equivalent of CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) provided for in law .", "CARDINAL . The presiding judge refused to determine the minimum remuneration at that point in time . He warned the applicant that he would fine him if he refused to act as counsel for the defendant .", "CARDINAL . Following this exchange , the applicant refused to represent the defendant and left the courtroom .", "CARDINAL . The court fined the applicant ORG CARDINAL ( approximately FAC ) . The decision imposing the fine referred to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and stated as follows :", "\u201c In the court \u2019s view , the lawyers already appointed to serve as defence counsel should not have asked about their remuneration [ at this stage of the proceedings ] . The court would be in a position to estimate that amount only after the collection of all evidence and following the final oral pleadings . By raising the question of setting their remuneration at a minimum of ORG CARDINAL before the examination of the case started , the [ CARDINAL lawyers ] showed manifest disrespect for the court and were in breach of the Code of Criminal Procedure . Despite a warning , they did not comment , they refused to act as legal representatives nominated by the Plovdiv Bar upon this court \u2019s request ... and left the courtroom . Seeing that in the present case the defendants must be legally represented ... the hearing will have to be adjourned owing to the unjustified absence of their defence counsel .", "Therefore , [ the applicant and the other lawyer ] shall be fined ORG CARDINAL each . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Then the prosecutor requested a TIME break so that new counsel could be found for the accused . He submitted that , in view of the principle of speediness of criminal proceedings and the fact that all witnesses and experts were there in the courtroom , the hearing should not be adjourned to a later date . The court granted the request and decided to proceed with the case at TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The hearing was resumed as scheduled . The prosecutor asked the court to appoint another lawyer who was present in the courtroom as counsel for the accused and to give him time to get acquainted with the case file . The court granted the request .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the new lawyer stated that he had acquainted himself with the case and agreed to be appointed defence counsel . The court did so and proceeded with the case . The proceedings ended with a plea bargain agreement between the prosecutor and the defendants . The court set the replacement defence counsel \u2019s remuneration at ORG MONEY ( about EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the fine imposed on him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He claimed that he had not been appointed by ORG in accordance with the law . In particular , the court had been bound by law , specifically LAW , to determine his remuneration in the actual decision to appoint him counsel ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; the court had also had to determine the amount according to LAW . By refusing to comply with those legal requirements , the court had breached the law . Therefore , the applicant \u2019s refusal to act as counsel had been justified ; he should not have been held responsible for the adjournment of the hearing and he had not acted disrespectfully . Consequently , he submitted , the fine had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the fine in a final decision . It acknowledged that pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW the remuneration to be paid to a court - appointed defence counsel had to be indicated in the order for his or her appointment and that it ought not be lower than the minimum provided for in LAW . However , the court found that it was only possible to determine the exact amount of remuneration to be paid at the end of the proceedings . The reason for this was that LAW provided for a lower amount in case of termination of the criminal proceedings by way of a plea bargain ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court could not predict the outcome of the proceedings at their outset . Therefore , the applicant \u2019s insistence on a prior determination of his fee was contrary to section CARDINAL of GPE . The applicant had thus caused an unjustified adjournment and had rightly been fined under LAW . The court finally held that the amount of the fine was proportionate to the gravity of the offence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1", "P1-1-2"]}
