Mr PERSON , who is an NORP national , was born in DATE and lives in GPE , where he practises as a doctor .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his girlfriend , GPE , had a daughter in DATE . Relations between the mother and father had rapidly deteriorated after their daughter was born and the relevant ORG had already had to intervene in the past .", "CARDINAL . Custody of the applicant \u2019s daughter was initially awarded to the mother , from whom the applicant had separated in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for custody of his daughter to be formally awarded to him , since his ex - girlfriend had already given him custody de facto . She had signed a statement on DATE acknowledging the applicant \u2019s right to custody of the child .", "CARDINAL . NORP ORG , presided over by Judge A.M.B. , ordered an investigation and on DATE decided to place the child in a children \u2019s home . The court applied , inter alia , LAW . At the same time it limited the mother \u2019s access to once DATE and the father \u2019s to once DATE .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE social workers collected the child from school , having informed her teachers , and took her to a home .", "CARDINAL . NORP Immediately afterwards the applicant asked for his daughter to be examined by a neuropsychiatrist , but his request was refused for reasons which are unknown . According to the applicant , his daughter had been ill - treated in the children \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed of its own motion CARDINAL experts , CARDINAL , PERSON , a psychologist and the other , ORG , a child neuropsychiatrist , whose names had already appeared in the decision of CARDINAL DATE . It appears from a certificate issued by ORG that PERSON had also been a street trader in second - hand clothes and other items since DATE . Both experts were instructed to establish the state of relations between , firstly , the parents themselves and , secondly , the parents and their daughter , with a view to determining , among other things , which parent should be awarded custody of the child . To that end the court gave the experts the following directions , inter alia :", "\u201c The experts are instructed to ascertain , once they have carried out all necessary investigations , examined the documents in the proceedings , met the parents , the maternal grandmother and the child \u2026 , the GPE personality type and the relationship between them , including how the situation is likely to develop in the future ; \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL experts agreed to each meet CARDINAL of the parents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant first appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE on DATE , but his appeal was dismissed by ORG ) on DATE . ORG upheld ORG decision on the ground that the child needed to be placed in a calmer environment so that the psychological difficulties she was experiencing as a result of the conflict between her parents could be studied . ORG also stated that CARDINAL privately appointed experts should be allowed to observe the court - appointed experts\u2019 work .", "CARDINAL . The experts commissioned by the applicant were never consulted in the proceedings conducted by the court \u2019s experts and were unable to be present at the interview with the child . CARDINAL of them did , however , take part in a meeting with the court \u2019s experts to assess the material they had gathered during their assignment .", "CARDINAL . The court - appointed experts\u2019 report was filed on DATE . It concluded , among other things , that neither parent seemed fit to give the child adequate emotional support or to have a balanced relationship with her . The experts also highlighted the fact that it had been impossible to assess the applicant \u2019s personality fully since he had failed to take part in all the diagnostic psychological tests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE one of the privately commissioned experts filed his report with ORG registry . The report criticised the conclusions of the court - appointed experts\u2019 report , particularly the finding that the applicant cared little for the welfare of his daughter or her mother . A second privately commissioned expert report expressed the same view .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the court complaining that CARDINAL of its experts had never met him but had nonetheless signed the report containing assessments relating directly to his personality , and that the privately commissioned experts had not been invited to attend the interview with the child by the court - appointed experts . He submitted that the best solution would be for custody of the child to be awarded to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , presided over by PERSON , confirmed the decision to place the child in a children \u2019s home and ordered the social services to arrange a series of meetings between the child and her mother with a view to returning custody to the mother . The applicant , on the other hand , was authorised to visit his daughter only once a month for TIME and only inside the home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter was injured in a road accident . The applicant was informed of this on DATE and went to visit his daughter DATE . Noting that she had some fairly serious injuries and being of the view that the local hospital was not equipped to carry out the necessary tests , he applied to the local magistrate ( pretore ) on DATE to authorise him to take his daughter himself to ORG , which was better equipped . The magistrate considered the situation to be urgent and authorised the applicant to take his daughter to ORG accompanied by a member of staff from the home . However , on DATE the President of ORG decided that the father had no authority to intervene . He instructed the children \u2019s home to submit the child to such tests as the home judged appropriate , in consultation with the mother . The President of the court reiterated that he had made a decision authorising the applicant to see his daughter for TIME a month and that the magistrate was clearly unaware of that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . He submitted , inter alia , that CARDINAL of the court experts had met him despite the court \u2019s instruction to them to prepare the expert report jointly . Furthermore , the privately commissioned expert had not been informed by the court - appointed experts of the date of their interview with the child , nor had he taken part in the court \u2019s deliberations on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime the applicant had requested the court to award custody of the child to her mother and to review its ruling on access rights . His application was dismissed on DATE . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision , referring once again to the shortcomings of the court - appointed experts\u2019 report and reiterating his request for custody of the child to be returned to the mother .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL separate decisions of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the first appeal inadmissible on the ground that it had been lodged out of time and dismissed the second one .", "CARDINAL . In the second decision ORG noted that the proceedings were still pending , including the application made by the mother in the meantime for the father \u2019s parental rights to be forfeited . In particular , as the lower court had observed , certain factors at the root of the case subsisted , such as the mother \u2019s opposition to taking her daughter back to live with her and the serious psychological problems affecting the girl \u2019s relationship with the applicant . Having regard , therefore , to the temporary nature of the child \u2019s placement in a children \u2019s home , ORG considered premature any decision altering the current position . The court did not rule on the applicant \u2019s allegations regarding the conduct of the experts\u2019 investigations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a series of reports by the social services , ORG authorised the girl \u2019s mother to stay with her daughter on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG again , requesting that in view of his daughter \u2019s increasing anxiety in the home , she be removed as a matter of urgency and entrusted either to his care or to her paternal grandmother \u2019s .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed that application . It found , among other things , that the paternal grandmother had in the past refused to take the child into her care and that the applicant had not shown that her attitude had changed . It also noted that since being placed in the home , the child no longer suffered from the fits of hysteria which she had had when living with her mother , was seeing the applicant more often and had made no further request to leave the home . ORG also pointed out that according to the social services\u2019 report of CARDINAL DATE , the girl had , moreover , refused to spend DATE by the sea with the applicant . Lastly , the court held that if the child were to go to her paternal grandmother , that would distance her from her mother , whereas she should be encouraged to resume a relationship with her mother despite the latter \u2019s limitations and her inability to demonstrate real affection for her daughter . Indeed , the child had clearly expressed a desire to go back to her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG revoked its decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered custody of the child to be returned to the mother . It also limited the applicant \u2019s access to once DATE in a neutral place to be agreed with the social services .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to the court on DATE , expressing his satisfaction with the decision to remove his daughter from the home , but complaining of the decision to maintain restrictions on his access rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed his application in part and ordered that the applicant \u2019s access should be increased from once to twice DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG authorised the child to stay with her paternal aunt for the holiday , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court granted the applicant the right to see his daughter one afternoon a week . The court stressed , however , that relations between the social services and the applicant were extremely problematical , because the latter kept sending them written requests but showed no real willingness to enter into a dialogue .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , seeking increased contact with his daughter , but his appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . Its decision was based on a psychiatrist \u2019s report of DATE , according to which the child \u2019s mental condition had greatly deteriorated and there was a risk that she would have a mental breakdown . The fact that the girl described her parents as mentally deranged and wanted to return to the home showed how precarious her mental stability was . ORG concluded that the child was above all in need of psychological care and certainly not of more frequent contact with her father .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had in the meantime filed complaints against the court - appointed experts with ORG at ORG and ORG at ORG . He submitted that the court experts had performed their task negligently , that they had failed to contact the privately commissioned experts and were consequently guilty of a failure to discharge one of their obligations ( omissione d\u2019atti d\u2019ufficio ) under LAW . The second complaint was struck out on DATE on the ground that , in the absence of malicious intent , it concerned problems regarding the experts\u2019 method of conducting their investigations , which it fell to the judge ordering the expert report to assess after hearing submissions from the parties and their experts . ORG also pointed out that it had been for the privately commissioned expert to take action and contact the court - appointed experts . No action was taken on the first complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP DATE ORG published an article containing statements by the President of ORG , PERSON , about the court \u2019s child - custody work . In that article PERSON used the following expressions , among others :", "\u201c We are not child - snatchers . \u201d", "\u201c Our role is to release children from their suffering . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same daily published a letter signed by the applicant which was also a reply to the first statements made by PERSON The applicant related the episode in which his daughter had been placed in a children \u2019s home and made the following comments , among others :", "\u201c The act in itself is CARDINAL of sequestration or , at the very least , violence towards children . Whether that act should not be considered as violence or sequestration on the ground that a court is involved is quite another question . \u201d", "\u201c This little girl suffered shock and emotional stress to a cruel degree . \u201d", "\u201c Clearly the cruelty of the exercise can not fail to have tarnished the ORG \u2019s image and lessened confidence in an institution which should guarantee the greatest respect for human beings . \u201d", "\u201c Among other things , the inappropriateness of the method used derives from the fact that an urgent decision was not implemented until DATE after it had been taken . \u201d", "\u201c In such a case I doubt whether the President , Judge PERSON , ... can say \u2018 we have released a child from its suffering\u2019 or \u2018 we are not child - snatchers\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter published in GPE on DATE the President of the court replied . Among other things , PERSON stated :", "CARDINAL . In a letter published in GPE on DATE the applicant responded to ORG \u2019s letter , complaining that the judge had not only called him a liar , but had also revealed confidential information about his case , which in a small provincial town such as PERSON had made it easy to identify the persons involved and had left people feeling puzzled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG also published a letter from a group of the applicant \u2019s colleagues expressing their solidarity with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked for PERSON to be replaced by a different judge in the custody proceedings in respect of his daughter . He alleged that PERSON was biased on account of the heated exchange of views they had had in the press .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge for being out of time . The court held that , quite apart from the fact that the ground relied on by the applicant did not appear among those formally provided for in LAW , the application had in any event been made out of time since it should have been filed before the date set for the decision ( taken on DATE - see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Besides , the applicant could have foreseen that PERSON might preside over the court , since in the event that more than the required number of judges was available , the most senior member would act as President and the applicant had known that PERSON was a member of the division which would be trying his case . At all events , as the decision had already been taken , the applicant had a remedy in ordinary proceedings , namely lodging an appeal , for submitting that complaint .", "CARDINAL . Following the statements made by ORG in his letter published on DATE , the applicant had also lodged a complaint with ORG at ORG . Proceedings on that complaint were officially discontinued on DATE as the preliminary investigating judge at ORG found that PERSON had confined himself to replying to the applicant \u2019s first letter , correcting the inaccuracies in the applicant \u2019s allegations and stressing that the conduct of all those involved in the case had been right and proper . The only offensive comments , in the judge \u2019s view , were those the applicant had directed at ORG , whom he had called a \u201c child - snatcher \u201d . PERSON \u2019s reply had been appropriate and moderate and had not disclosed any confidential information acquired in the course of his duties as it would not in any event have been possible to identify the persons involved in the case . It was rather the applicant who had disclosed the circumstances in which the child had been removed from her mother \u2019s custody . There had thus been no injury to the reputation or honour of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also applied DATE unsuccessfully DATE to ORG ( Consiglio superiore della magistratura ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ,", "\u201c Parents have a duty to maintain , educate and bring up their children , including children born out of wedlock .", "Where the parents are incapable of performing those duties , the legislature shall make appropriate provision .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ,", "\u201c If the conduct of CARDINAL or both parents is not such as to justify forfeiting parental authority ... , but is harmful to the child , the court may , if appropriate , take any necessary measure and may also order the child to be removed from the family home . Such measures may be rescinded at any time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON applied to the Commission on DATE . He alleged , among other things , an infringement of his right to respect for his family life on account of his daughter \u2019s having been placed in a children \u2019s home , bias on the part of the President of ORG and injury to his reputation and to his family life as a result of the statements made by him to the press ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention ) .", "CARDINAL . The Commission declared the application ( no . CARDINAL ) admissible on DATE . In its report of CARDINAL DATE ( former LAW ) , it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of LAW of the manner in which the experts had conducted their investigations and of LAW on account of the President of ORG statements to the press .", "CARDINAL . The applicant said that the measures taken by ORG had contributed to the almost irretrievable breakdown of his relationship with his daughter . He alleged in particular that the court had based its decision on an expert report which was unfounded and procedurally flawed . He submitted that there had been a violation of LAW , which provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence .", "CARDINAL . There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a NORP society in the interests of national security , public safety or the economic well - being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government disputed that submission . The ORG found that although the restrictive measures taken by the NORP authorities against the parents , including the applicant , had been based on relevant and sufficient grounds , there had been a violation of LAW of the manner in which the expert report ordered by the court had been prepared .", "CARDINAL . The ORG points out that the enjoyment by parent and child of each other \u2019s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life and that domestic measures hindering such enjoyment amount to an interference with the right protected by LAW see the Bronda v. GPE judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-IV , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . In the instant case the restrictive measures taken by the NORP authorities against the applicant amounted to an interference with his right to respect for his family life . Such interference will constitute a violation of LAW unless it is \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d , pursues an aim or aims that are legitimate under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL and can be regarded as \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is of the view that the interference was in accordance with the law , in particular with LAW , and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others . The question remains as to whether that interference was also \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d .", "CARDINALReports CARDINAL-VII , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) and did not exceed the margin of appreciation afforded to them under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , there has not been a violation of LAW arising from the measures taken to remove the child from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not agree with the applicant \u2019s submission , which was accepted by the Commission , that he has been the victim of a violation of LAW of the court - appointed experts\u2019 conduct of their investigations .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . In that connection the ORG submitted that , while it was true that in custody proceedings the parties had more limited powers of intervention than in ordinary proceedings ( owing to the non - contentious nature of the proceedings , which were pursued exclusively with the aim of protecting children \u2019s interests ) , it should not be overlooked that the applicant had always been given a hearing , that he had always been informed of all matters concerning the case and had been able to comment on them . As regards , in particular , the allegation that one of the court - appointed experts also carried on business as a street trader , the Government disputed the veracity of that allegation and pointed out that an assessment of the professional competence of an expert could only be based on work done in that capacity . The ORG submitted , moreover , that a violation could not be found merely on the basis of the manner in which the experts had conducted their investigations when , as the ORG had found in its report , the interference with the applicant \u2019s family life was in itself justified .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers as the Government did , that the foregoing principles regarding the GPE role in the decision - making process ( see paragraph DATE ) were not breached in the instant case . The applicant can not be said to have played no role in the decision - making process . On the contrary , he took an active part in it ; he was always able to submit his arguments in the national courts and to study all the documents . Furthermore , CARDINAL of the privately commissioned experts had been able to discuss with the court - appointed experts the results of the tests conducted in the course of their investigations . The decision - making process as a whole does not appear to have been unfair , and excessive weight should not be attached to the fact that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL experts was also a street trader ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In that connection the ORG notes that the applicant did not expressly question that expert \u2019s professional competence as a psychologist . The ORG considers that the fact that the expert was also a street trader does not detract from his expertise as a psychologist .", "CARDINAL . As regards the complaint that CARDINAL of the court - appointed experts did not interview the applicant , the ORG considers that the court decision setting out the purpose of the expert opinion was worded in terms sufficiently general to allow the experts some discretion as to the precise manner in which their report would be prepared . In any event , the results of the experts\u2019 work were examined by both experts jointly . In this context account should also be taken of the fact that the applicant failed to participate in all the diagnostic psychological tests ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , it might perhaps have been desirable for the privately commissioned experts to be more fully involved in the various stages of the court - appointed experts\u2019 assignment and not only at the meeting to assess the results , although there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the privately commissioned experts actually asked to be involved further . Nevertheless , the circumstances of which the applicant complains do not suffice in themselves to have adversely affected the fairness of the proceedings , which were based not only on the expert report in question but also on a series of social - services reports ( see , inter alia , paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the manner in which the expert report was prepared did not breach LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained of bias on the part of the President of ORG , PERSON , and submitted that his case should not have been heard by a court presided over by a person with whom he had had an argument in the press . He alleged that this had given rise to a violation of LAW , which provides :", "\u201c In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... , everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government considered that there could be no doubt as to the President of the court \u2019s impartiality . The decisions adopted by the court presided over by ORG had not subsequently been varied and the proceedings on the complaints which the applicant had filed against the President had been discontinued . Furthermore , it was the applicant who had started the controversy with his letter in ORG portraying the court \u2019s work in an unfavourable light and he had been supported in that action by the journalist responsible for the column . The President of the court had therefore simply considered it his duty to clarify matters , having regard in particular to the risk of misinformation on account of the relative importance given by the daily in question to the applicant \u2019s story .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disputed that argument .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stresses , above all , that the judicial authorities are required to exercise maximum discretion with regard to the cases with which they deal in order to preserve their image as impartial judges . That discretion should dissuade them from making use of the press , even when provoked . It is the higher demands of justice and the elevated nature of judicial office which impose that duty .", "DATE . The ORG considers , as the ORG did , that the fact that the President of the court publicly used expressions which implied that he had already formed an unfavourable view of the applicant \u2019s case before presiding over the court that had to decide it clearly appears incompatible with the impartiality required of any court , as laid down in LAW . The statements made by the President of the court were such as to objectively justify the applicant \u2019s fears as to his impartiality ( see , mutatis mutandis , the PERSON and PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Reports CARDINAL-III , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . There has accordingly been a breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained of a violation of LAW arising from ORG \u2019s statements published by ORG and alleged that injury had been caused to his reputation and his family life .", "CARDINAL . The Government disputed that submission .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that no injury to the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his private and family life can be established under this head , having regard to the fact that in his letter of DATE the applicant had himself disclosed his identity .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , there has not been a violation of LAW in this regard .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought , firstly , MONEY ( ITL ) in compensation for pecuniary damage , relying in particular on the damage done to his professional image as a surgeon . He also claimed ORG CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "DATE . The Government did not make any submissions on the issue .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that it has no evidence on which to find that the applicant sustained pecuniary damage . As to non - pecuniary damage , it considers that the finding of a violation of LAW constitutes sufficient compensation . In that connection , it takes account , inter alia , of the fact that the applicant significantly contributed to fuelling the controversy concerning him in the press .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought primarily reimbursement of the expenses incurred in the proceedings in the domestic courts in the sum of ITL CARDINAL ( the applicant produced fee notes for the custody proceedings and a breakdown of the amounts paid for the privately commissioned expert reports ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the documents supplied by the applicant relate only to the expenses incurred in connection with the placement of his daughter \u2013 the applicant did not claim reimbursement of any amounts incurred to prevent or have redressed a violation of LAW and considers , in the light of its conclusions regarding LAW , that it is not necessary to award the applicant reimbursement under this head .", "CARDINAL . As regards the expenses incurred before the Convention institutions , the ORG , making its assessment on an equitable basis as required by LAW and having regard to the fact that the applicant presented his own case , awards him ITL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL for costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL .
