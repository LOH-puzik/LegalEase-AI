The cell he was placed in was small and there were neither sanitary facilities nor running water . There was no heating and the cell walls were damp and mouldy . The cell was dirty and the bed sheets were not changed for very long periods of time . In order to urinate at TIME and at other times when he was confined to his cell , the applicant had to use a QUANTITY plastic container in the shape of a bottle , because the guards refused to unlock his cell and let him use the toilet . Toiletries and other personal hygiene products were provided CARDINAL to five months . The food served to the inmates was of insufficient quantity and poor quality ; the inmates were served only carbohydrates , without any vegetables and hardly any meat .

NORP ... the CARDINAL unrenovated wings , B and E , accommodating mainly unemployed prisoners , offered very poor conditions of detention . Prisoners in these wings were being held under cramped conditions , typically CARDINAL persons in cells measuring between CARDINAL to QUANTITY . The ORG must emphasise that cells of such size are only suitable for individual occupancy . Further , the cells were dirty and in a poor state of repair , and a number of them had poor access to natural light and/or dim or artificial lighting . In addition , they were not equipped with integral sanitation ; as a result , at TIME inmates had to comply with the needs of nature using a plastic container in their cell . As for the communal sanitary facilities , they were in a generally woeful state of repair ( some of them with hazardous flooded floors ) . It is also noteworthy that several prisoners in these CARDINAL wings complained that they were not able to obtain necessary toiletries .", "The director informed the delegation that the renovation of the whole establishment was planned , but that difficulties were being encountered in obtaining the necessary resources . The ORG must stress that the prevailing material conditions in B and E wings are quite unacceptable . Consequently , the ORG recommends that the renovation of these wings , including installation of in - cell sanitation following the model of D wing , be treated as a matter of high priority .", "Moreover , the ORG recommends that steps be taken immediately to ensure that all prisoners at FAC are able to obtain personal hygiene products ( toilet paper , soap , toothpaste , etc . ) as well as the necessary means to maintain their cells and communal sanitary facilities in a clean and hygienic state .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL prisoners were on a waiting list for work . Further , CARDINAL prisoners had been categorised as permanent non - workers , either through choice or disability , though many such prisoners interviewed by the delegation advanced that they did in fact wish to work .", "The situation of the non - workers was rendered all the more unsatisfactory by the scarcity of other regime activities at the prison . Although the establishment was equipped with good educational facilities , CARDINAL prisoners \u2013 including some who already worked \u2013 were attending classes . Further , there was little evidence of therapeutic ( i.e. offence - focused ) programmes and no organised sport activities . To sum up , CARDINAL of the prisoners accommodated in the closed unit were subject to an impoverished regime ; the typical DATE programme for a non - working prisoner was found to consist of little else besides watching television in an association area and outdoor exercise .", "CARDINAL . ... For the majority of prisoners in the establishment 's closed unit , there was no positive regime in place which might encourage them to address their offending behaviour .", "The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities take the necessary steps to ensure that all prisoners at FAC have access to an appropriate range of work , educational , sports and recreational activities . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
