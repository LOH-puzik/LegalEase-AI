On DATE the applicant boarded a bus in GPE , GPE , with a view to visiting GPE in order , as he stated , \u201c to take a short vacation and some time off from a stressful home environment \u201d . At TIME , he arrived at the NORP / NORP border crossing at GPE . A suspicion arose as to the validity of his recently issued NORP passport . A border official checked his passport and asked him about the purpose of his trip and the length and location of his intended stay . A NORP entry stamp dated DATE was affixed to his passport . On that occasion , his personal belongings were searched and he was questioned about possible ties with several NORP organisations and groups . The interrogation ended at TIME Accompanied by men in civilian clothes who were armed , he was driven to a hotel , which later research indicated was ORG in GPE ( \u201c the hotel \u201d ) . Upon his return to GPE , the applicant recognised , through photographs available on the hotel \u2019s website , the hotel building , the room where allegedly he had been held and CARDINAL of the waiters who had served him food during his detention in the hotel .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was taken to a room on the top floor of the hotel . During his detention at the hotel , he was watched by a team of CARDINAL men , who changed shift TIME . CARDINAL of them were with him at all times , even when he was sleeping . He was interrogated repeatedly throughout the course of his detention . He was questioned in LANGUAGE despite his limited proficiency in that language . His requests to contact the NORP embassy were refused . On CARDINAL occasion , when he stated that he intended to leave , a gun was pointed at his head and he was threatened with being shot . After DATE of confinement , another official arrived and offered him a deal , namely that he would be sent back to GPE in return for a confession that he was a member of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE of his confinement , the applicant commenced a hunger strike to protest against his continued unlawful detention . He did not eat for DATE of his detention in the former GPE . DATE after he had commenced his hunger strike , he was told that he would soon be transferred by air back to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME , the applicant was filmed by a video camera and instructed to say that he had been treated well , that he had not been harmed in any way and that he would shortly be flown back to GPE . Handcuffed and blindfolded , he was put in a car and taken to FAC .", "CARDINAL . Upon arrival , still handcuffed and blindfolded , he was initially placed in a chair , where he sat for TIME . He was told that he would be taken into a room for a medical examination before being transferred to GPE . Then , CARDINAL people violently pulled his arms back . On that occasion he was beaten severely from all sides . His clothes were sliced from his body with scissors or a knife . His underwear was forcibly removed . He was thrown to the floor , his hands were pulled back and a boot was placed on his back . He then felt a firm object being forced into his anus . As stated by the applicant \u2019s lawyers at the public hearing of CARDINAL DATE , of all the acts perpetrated against the applicant that had been the most degrading and shameful . According to the applicant , a suppository was forcibly administered on that occasion . He was then pulled from the floor and dragged to a corner of the room , where his feet were tied together . His blindfold was removed . A flash went off and temporarily blinded him . When he recovered his sight , he saw CARDINAL or CARDINAL men dressed in black and wearing black ski masks . CARDINAL of the men placed him in an adult nappy . He was then dressed in a dark blue short - sleeved tracksuit . A bag was placed over his head and a belt was put on him with chains attached to his wrists and ankles . The men put earmuffs and eye pads on him and blindfolded and hooded him . They bent him over , forcing his head down , and quickly marched him to a waiting aircraft , with the shackles cutting into his ankles . The aircraft was surrounded by armed NORP security guards . He had difficulty breathing because of the bag that covered his head . Once inside the aircraft , he was thrown to the floor face down and his legs and arms were spread - eagled and secured to the sides of the aircraft . During the flight he received CARDINAL injections . An anaesthetic was also administered over his nose . He was mostly unconscious during the flight .

According to the applicant , his pre - flight treatment at FAC , \u201c most likely at the hands of the special ORG rendition team \u201d , was remarkably consistent with a recently disclosed ORG document describing the protocol for the so - called \u201c capture shock \u201d treatment ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Upon landing , the applicant disembarked . It was warmer outside than it had been in the former GPE , which was sufficient for him to conclude that he had not been returned to GPE . He deduced later that he was in GPE and that he had been flown via GPE .", "CARDINAL . After landing in GPE , the applicant was driven for TIME , then dragged from the vehicle , slammed into the walls of a room , thrown to the floor , kicked and beaten . His head and neck were specifically targeted and stepped upon . He was left in a small , dirty , dark concrete cell . When he adjusted his eyes to the light , he saw that the walls were covered in LANGUAGE , GPE and LANGUAGE handwriting . The cell did not contain a bed . Although it was cold , he had been provided with only one dirty , military - style blanket and some old , torn clothes bundled into a thin pillow . Through a window at the top of the cell , he saw the red , setting sun . Later he understood that he had been transferred to a ORG - run facility which media reports have identified as the \u201c GPE \u201d , a brick factory north of the GPE business district that was used by the ORG for detention and interrogation of some high - level terror suspects .", "CARDINAL . During his confinement , he was interrogated on CARDINAL occasions , each time by the same man , who spoke LANGUAGE with a south NORP accent , and each time at night . His interrogations were accompanied by threats , insults , pushing and shouting . His repeated requests to meet with a representative of the NORP government were ignored .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , together with several other inmates with whom he communicated through cell walls , commenced a hunger strike to protest about their continued confinement without charge . As a consequence of the conditions of his confinement and his hunger strike , the applicant \u2019s health deteriorated on a DATE basis . He received no medical treatment during this time , although he had requested it on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE of his hunger strike , hooded men entered his cell , pulled him from his bed and bound his hands and feet . They dragged him into the interrogation room , sat him on a chair and tied him to it . A feeding tube was then forced through his nose to his stomach and a liquid was poured through it . After this procedure , the applicant was given some canned food , as well as some books to read .", "CARDINAL . Following his force - feeding , the applicant became extremely ill and suffered very severe pain . A doctor visited his cell in the middle of the night and administered medication , but he remained bedridden for DATE . Around that time , the applicant felt what he believed to be a minor earthquake . In this connection , the applicant submitted the \u201c List of significant earthquakes of the world in DATE \u201d , issued by ORG on DATE . According to this document , there was CARDINAL earthquake on DATE in the LOC region , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was visited by a NORP speaker who identified himself only as \u201c PERSON . The latter visited the applicant CARDINAL more times prior to his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant began his second hunger strike .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , blindfolded and handcuffed , was led out of his cell and locked in what seemed to be a shipping container until he heard the sound of an aircraft arriving . On that occasion , he was handed the suitcase that had been taken from him in GPE . He was told to change back into the clothes he had worn upon his arrival in the former GPE and was given CARDINAL new T - shirts , CARDINAL of which he put on . He was then taken to the waiting aircraft , wearing a blindfold and earmuffs , and was chained to his seat there . \u201c PERSON accompanied him on the aircraft . He said that the plane would land in a NORP country other than GPE , but that the applicant would eventually continue on to GPE .", "CARDINAL . When the aircraft landed , the applicant , still blindfolded , was placed in the back seat of a vehicle . He was not told where he was . He was driven in the vehicle up and down mountains , on paved and unpaved roads . The applicant was aware of men getting out of the car and then of men getting in . All of the men had NORP - sounding accents , but said very little . Eventually , the vehicle was brought to a halt . He was taken from the car and his blindfold was removed . His captors gave him his belongings and passport , removed his handcuffs and directed him to walk down the path without turning back . It was dark and the road was deserted . He believed he would be shot in the back and left to die . He rounded a corner and came across CARDINAL armed men . They immediately asked for his passport . They saw that his NORP passport had no visa in it and asked him why he was in GPE without legal permission . He replied that he had no idea where he was . He was told that he was near the NORP borders with the former GPE . The men led him to a small building with an NORP flag and he was presented to a superior officer . The officer observed the applicant \u2019s long hair and long beard and told him that he looked like a terrorist . He was then driven to Mother Teresa Airport in GPE . He was guided through customs and immigration control without inspection and put on a plane to GPE , GPE . An NORP exit stamp was affixed to the applicant \u2019s passport .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicant arrived at FAC . He was QUANTITY lighter than when he had left GPE , his hair was long and unkempt , and he had not shaved since his arrival in the former GPE . Immediately after arrival in GPE , the applicant met PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In his written submissions , the applicant stated that he had not undergone any medical examination apart from the isotope analysis of his hair follicles ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . At the public hearing , the applicant \u2019s lawyers specified that the results of some medical examinations carried out upon his return to GPE had been submitted by the NORP public prosecutor to ORG Fava Inquiry ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . However , those results had not been submitted to the ORG since they had not been conclusive as to the presence of any physical injury , given the long time that had elapsed since the incident at FAC . Furthermore , the applicant stated that he had been subjected to sophisticated interrogation techniques and methods , which had been specifically designed not to leave any evidence of physical ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The DATE PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) noted that the applicant had asked for treatment at the treatment centre for torture victims in GPE shortly after his return to GPE in DATE . However , it took until DATE for PERSON to obtain the required health - insurance funding agreement to start a course of limited treatment ( TIME ) at the centre , which had been considered insufficient both by PERSON and by the therapist herself ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also submitted a written statement of CARDINAL DATE by PERSON , a senior psychologist at ORG , in which she had confirmed that the applicant had suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder and depression \u201c most likely caused by his experience of capture and extensive maltreatment and abuse \u201d . PERSON opinion was based on several telephone calls and CARDINAL follow - up discussions with the applicant . She also advised him to visit a clinician in his community with the requisite expertise to help him . The applicant did not comply with that instruction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG of ORG asked ORG Human Rights to investigate allegations of \u201c extraordinary renditions \u201d in LOC . Senator PERSON of GPE was appointed as Special Rapporteur . On DATE the ORG published the DATE PERSON . It set out , on the basis of meetings that took place DATE , the position of the NORP authorities regarding the applicant \u2019s case . It stated , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . NORP The position of the authorities", "CARDINAL . The \u2018 official ORG of ORG was first contained in a letter from the Minister of Interior ... to the Ambassador of ORG ... dated DATE . In its simplest form , it essentially contains CARDINAL items of information \u2018 according to police records\u2019 : first , Mr PERSON arrived by bus at the NORP border crossing of PERSON at TIME on DATE ; second , he was interviewed by \u2018 authorised police officials\u2019 who suspected \u2018 possession of a falsified travel ORG ; third , TIME , Mr ORG \u2018 was allowed entrance\u2019 into GPE , apparently freely ; and fourth , on DATE , he left GPE over the border crossing of GPE into GPE .", "...", "CARDINAL . NORP The President of the Republic ... set out a firm stance in the very first meeting with ORG delegation , providing a strong disincentive to any official who may have wished to break ranks by expressing an independent viewpoint : \u2018 Up to this moment , I would like to assure you that I have not come across any reason not to believe the official position of our ORG . I have no additional comments or facts , from any side , to convince me that what has been established in the official report of our ORG is not the truth.\u2019", "CARDINAL . On DATE the official position was presented in far greater detail during a meeting with ... [ the ] Head of the ORG , GPE \u2019s main intelligence service , at the time of the ORG case . [ He ] stated that the ORG \u2019s ORG had undertaken an investigation into the case and traced official records of all Mr ORG contact with the NORP authorities . The further details as presented by [ the Head of the ORG ] are summarized as follows :", "Mr PERSON arrived on the NORP border on DATE , New Year \u2019s Eve . ORG had intensified security for the festive period and was operating a higher state of alert around the possible criminal activity . In line with these more intense activities , bus passengers were being subjected to a thorough security check , including an examination of their identity documents .", "Upon examining Mr ORG passport , the NORP border police developed certain suspicions and decided to \u2018 detain him\u2019 . In order not to make the other passengers wait at the border , the bus was at this point allowed to continue its journey .", "The objective of holding Mr PERSON was to conduct an interview with him , which ( according to [ the Head of the ORG ] ) was carried out in accordance with all applicable NORP standards . Members of the ORG , the security and counter - intelligence service , are present at all border points in GPE as part of what is described as \u2018 ORG and NORP . ORG officials participated in the interview of Mr ORG .", "The officials enquired into Mr ORG reasons for travelling into the country , where he intended to stay and whether he was carrying sufficient amounts of money . [ The Head of the ORG ] explained : \u2018 I think these were all standard questions that are asked in the context of such a routine procedure \u2013 I do n\u2019t think I need to go into further details.\u2019", "At the same time , NORP officials undertook a preliminary visual examination of PERSON travel documents . They suspected that the passport might be faked or forged \u2013 noting in particular that Mr PERSON was born in GPE , yet claimed to possess NORP citizenship .", "A further passport check was carried out against an ORG database . The border point at GPE is not linked to ORG \u2019s network , so the information had to be transmitted to GPE , from where an electronic request was made to the central ORG database in Lyon[s ] . A ORG official in ORG apparently made this request using an electronic code , so the NORP authorities can produce no record of it . Mr PERSON was made to wait on the border point while the ORG search was carried out .", "When it was established that there existed no ORG warrant against Mr PERSON and no further grounds on which to hold him , he was released . He then left the border point at GPE , although NORP officials were not able to describe how . Asked directly about this point in a separate meeting , the Minister of Interior ... said : \u2018 we \u2019re not able to tell you exactly what happened to him after he was released because it is not in our interest ; after the person leaves the border crossing , we \u2019re not in a position to know how he traveled further.\u2019", "ORG subsequently established ... that PERSON had stayed at a hotel in GPE called the \u2018 PERSON Merak\u2019 . Mr PERSON is said to have checked in on TIME of DATE and registered in the guest book . He stayed for DATE , including DATE breakfast , and checked out on DATE .", "The Ministry then conducted a further check on all border crossings and discovered that on DATE , DATE , in the evening , Mr PERSON left the territory of GPE over the border crossing at GPE , into the territory of GPE . When asked whether Mr ORG had received a stamp to indicate his departure by this means , [ the Head of the ORG ] answered : \u2018 Normally there should be a stamp on the passport as you cross the border out of GPE , but I ca n\u2019t be sure . UNMIK [ ORG in GPE ] is also present on the GPE border and is in charge of the protocol on that side ...

NORP What is not said in the official version is the fact that the NORP ORG routinely consults with the ORG on such matters ( which , on a certain level , is quite comprehensible and logical ) . According to confidential information we received ( of which we know the source ) , a full description of PERSON was transmitted to the ORG via its ORG Chief in GPE for an analysis ... did the person in question have contact with terrorist movements , in particular with [ ORG ] ? Based on the intelligence material about PERSON in its possession \u2013 the content of which is not known to us \u2013 the ORG answered in the affirmative .
