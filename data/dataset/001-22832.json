He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "On DATE , CARDINAL bags containing parts of a human body were found in a river near GPE ( GPE ) . Around QUANTITY DATE , it was found very likely that these remains , in any events the hands found , were those of Mr PERSON . According to the findings of an examination of the remains , the victim had died DATE prior to the finding of the remains .", "On DATE , PERSON filed a criminal complaint with the police against the applicant for extortion and unlawful deprivation of liberty of her friend Mr PERSON . She claimed that she had given a considerable amount of money to the applicant in exchange for the release of Mr Roo .", "On DATE , a preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) against the applicant was opened . On DATE , the applicant was arrested in his father \u2019s home in GPE , where further a suitcase containing an amount of ORG . CARDINAL were found . The applicant was taken into custody and interrogated a number of times , during which he remained silent . Following consultations between the police , the public prosecutor and the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) , it was decided to transfer the applicant to detention facilities in FAC in order to interrogate him there with use of the so - called \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d ; a specific interrogation technique .", "During the applicant \u2019s interrogations in ORG DATE , the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d was used . On DATE , at TIME , the applicant communicated with his lawyer . On DATE , at TIME , the applicant gave a confessing statement . He was subsequently charged and summoned to appear before ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE .", "By judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG acquitted the applicant of the charges relating to the killing of PERSON , convicted him of extortion and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . Both the prosecution and the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "Hearings before ORG were held on DATE , DATE and DATE .", "During its hearing held on DATE , ORG watched videotapes containing a summary of the applicant \u2019s interrogations by the police . This summary , or a total duration of TIME , concerned nearly exclusively parts of the applicant \u2019s interrogations of CARDINAL and DATE . The summary had been made in consultation with the parties .", "", "In the course of the hearing held on DATE , ORG took evidence from the witness PERSON , a warder in the detention centre where the applicant had been held and to whom - prior to the applicant \u2019s interrogation in PERSON - the applicant had told that he had had a conflict with a man who had owed him money for drug transports , that he had unintentionally shot this man dead and that he had had problems in disposing of the body . PERSON had not asked the applicant for the name of the victim . Mr PERSON stated that the applicant had been in GPE for DATE and that , after his return from PERSON , the applicant had appeared to be different in that he had become more relaxed .", "On DATE , ORG took evidence from PERSON , also a warder in the detention centre where the applicant had been held and to whom the applicant had said that he was detained for a big case and that he risked a considerable sentence . The applicant had further told him that it had been \u201c him or me \u201d , \u201c it was a stout man , QUANTITY , QUANTITY tall \u201d and \u201c I was covered with blood \u201d . PERSON did not recall whether the applicant had told him this before or after his stay in PERSON .", "Further hearings before ORG were held on DATE and DATE .", "By judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of homicide and extortion and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "As to the applicant \u2019s argument that the prosecution should be declared inadmissible in that he had been subjected to the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d , which - in his opinion - was in violation of LAW , the principle of nemo tenetur ( right of an accused not to be compelled to provide incriminating evidence and thus to contribute to his own conviction ) and the prohibition of exerting pressure on suspects as referred to in LAW ( Wetboek van Strafvordering ) , ORG considered , with reference to a finding to this effect in the advice of ORG ( PERSON ) , that the use of the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d was not per definition contrary to LAW .", "ORG examined the facts found established as to the manner in which the applicant had been interrogated . It noted , inter alia , that he had been interrogated for lengthy periods by sometimes CARDINAL persons , that nobody had shouted at the applicant , that he had been addressed in a soft voice and that only at some moments voices had been raised . It further found that photographs had been placed in the applicant \u2019s field of vision , showing places , persons and objects linked in some way to the facts of which the applicant was suspected ( a farmhouse , the victim , PERSON , their daughters , parts ( legs ) of the victim \u2019s remains , a wrapped trunk ( of what later appeared to be a previously killed prostitute ) , the applicant \u2019s spouse and his daughter , inside and outside views of the applicant \u2019s home ( including bedrooms ) and that telephone threats received by the applicant \u2019s wife had been discussed whereas he was repeatedly told that the police would only be able to protect his family if he would give a statement so that the police would know against whom they needed to be protected . As to the applicant \u2019s physical condition during the interrogations of CARDINAL and DATE , ORG noted that the applicant had apparently eaten nothing or little before and during his stay in PERSON , but that he had regularly been offered a meal and has been allowed to drink coffee and smoke cigarettes . He had further requested and obtained aspirins . At no point in time had the applicant indicated to be physically incapable to proceed with the interrogations . It therefore concluded that it was not established that the applicant was physically incapable to be subjected to interrogation .", "", "As to the admissibility of the prosecution , ORG considered that it did concern a both physically and mentally very burdensome and intrusive interrogation , but that it could not be regarded as treatment contrary to LAW in consequently rejected the argument that , on this basis , the prosecution should be declared inadmissible .", "ORG further found no violation of the principle of nemo tenetur , as it had not been established that , as a result of the police actions during the interrogations in PERSON , such a serious violation of the principles of a fair trial had occurred that the prosecution should be declared inadmissible .", "The defence had also argued that , at least on CARDINAL occasion , the applicant \u2019s interrogators in PERSON had not allowed him to speak to his lawyer as they wished to finish the interrogation . The observation made on this point by the public prosecutor that the applicant had agreed with this course of action , was refuted by the defence stating that , on that moment , the interrogators were in the process of easing him away from his lawyer by stating that the applicant should not care so much about what others were saying . ORG rejected the complaint of the alleged refusal to grant the applicant access to his lawyer as not having been established . It also found that it had not been established that the investigating authorities , by deciding to use the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d and the manner in which it had been conducted , had acted intentionally or with gross negligence contrary to the applicant \u2019s interests in his right to a fair hearing .", "As to the argument under LAW , ORG considered that , as a result of the at least particularly strong and misleading suggestion that the applicant \u2019s spouse had received threats by telephone in combination with the ORG intrusive and lengthy harping - using photographs - on the situation in which the applicant\u2019 spouse and in particular his daughter could end up , the acceptable border of the , in itself not unacceptable presentation to an accused of possible consequence of his silence , had been surpassed . It was of the opinion that , therefore and in conjunction with the character and duration of the interrogations of CARDINAL and DATE , the pressure exerted on the applicant had been increased to such a level that \u201c pressure prohibition \u201d had been violated .", "ORG did not use the results of the applicant \u2019s interrogations of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE in evidence . It based the applicant \u2019s conviction on other evidence , i.e. inter alia police reports on the finding and examination of the victim \u2019s remains and the subsequent criminal investigation , statements made by the witnesses PERSON and PERSON to the police and ORG , statements taken by the police from other witnesses who had had contacts with the applicant either during the period in the course of which the victim was likely to have been killed or at a later point in time , a statement taken by the police from the applicant on DATE , and statements taken by the police from PERSON , and statements of CARDINAL other persons to the police in relation to the concealment of amounts of ORG . CARDINAL and ORG . CARDINAL respectively . The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG , after having corrected an apparent textual error in the judgment of ORG pointed out by the applicant , rejected the applicant \u2019s complaints in cassation .", "This judgment , insofar as relevant , reads :", "< Translation >", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL .

In difference to the first cassation ground \u2019s aim , this finding does not disclose an incorrect conception of the law and is not incomprehensible .", "The findings of ORG > further mean that - noting that what ORG > has found established as to the basis of the defence plea - there has been no violation of the principles of a fair trial of such serious nature that this should lead to the inadmissibility of the prosecution as it has not been established that there have been infringements of those principles as a result of which intentionally or with gross negligence the suspect \u2019s interests in a fair hearing of his case have been disrespected .", "CARDINAL . Understood as such , the findings of ORG > do not disclose an incorrect conception of the law and , in the light of the trial proceedings , not incomprehensible .

Before the hearing the suspect is informed that he is not obliged to answer .", "... \u201d", "On DATE , following the national broadcast of a television programme in which the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d was discussed , a Member of ORG put questions about this interrogation technique to the Minister of ORG , who decided to seek the views of ORG ( PERSON ; hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) as to the lawfulness and functionality of this method .", "On DATE , the Minister of Justice informed ORG that , once she would have taken notice of the final outcome of CARDINAL trials in which the lawfulness of this method had been raised as well as the ORG advice , she would take a final decision as to the acceptability of this interrogation technique . In the meantime , she had instructed the public prosecution department to suspend the use of this technique . In DATE , in conformity with the advice contained in the ORG report of DATE , the Minister of ORG decided to prohibit the use of the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d .", "The PERSON report describes the \u201c NORP verhoormethode \u201d as an interrogation technique based on the so - called CASE CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) communication method . The method was developed by a communication expert and was further elaborated for police practices .", "CASE DATE is described in the report as a communication method focussing in particular on the way in which a person internally perceives the outside world . The application of the CASE CARDINAL technique allows to obtain a very accurate picture of the behaviour of a person and the internal processes on which this behaviour is based , thus enabling to communicate effectively ( a correct statement by the suspect ) and efficiently ( within a short time ) .", "The CASE CARDINAL technique is based on ORG ( ORG ) ; originally a form of psychotherapy . ORG has been defined as \u201c the study of the structure of subjective experience \u201d . ORG provides a model of human behaviour and communication which answers questions like \u201c How does a person behave in relation to his environment , how does he take in information and how does he process this information ? \u201d An interrogation according to the CASE CARDINAL communication method is aimed at the creation of a tie between the suspect and interrogators through which an optimal communication must become possible and thus to attain the truth via communication .", "The actual interrogation is prepared by planning certain steps to be taken during the interrogation . This planning includes , amongst other things , the allocation of individual roles ( father figure , specialist , analyst , person of confidence ) to each member of the interrogation team . Furthermore , a preliminary meeting with the suspect takes place in order to find out which pattern of thought ( in detail or global ) he uses and what his \u201c focal points \u201d are , i.e. to what points he looks when he is not specifically asked to look at something . A determination of \u201c focal points \u201d is relevant for the making of \u201c visual chronological lines \u201d .", "In having the suspect draw ( visual ) chronological lines during the interrogation , it is attempted to verify when what has taken place . This takes place , inter alia , by making a suspect relive an experience in his mind . If a suspect has an auditive preference , there is a bigger chance of communication and a reliving when he is made to listen to recordings , like telephone conversations . Has the suspect a sensory preference , the chance of communication is bigger when having him touch an object found at the crime scene , whereas in case of a visual preference , he can be shown photographs of the crime scene .", "In case a suspect has a \u201c focal point \u201d on a particular spot on a wall , it is possible to place photographs there . He will unconsciously look at them after which , as the intention is , he will remember facts insofar as he has been responsible for them . The showing of photographs includes both photographs connected to the offence and photographs linked to the suspect \u2019s person , like photographs of his spouse or children . These CARDINAL kinds of photographs are either shown separately or combined with each other .", "The interrogation team leader and the external communication expert watch and listen to the interrogation in another room . There are CARDINAL hidden cameras covering the entire interrogation room and CARDINAL hidden camera aimed at the suspect \u2019s face . The suspect is informed that the interrogations are recorded but does not know where the cameras are . The interrogators receive instructions via earphones from the team leader or the external communication expert during the interrogation . The interrogation is constantly adapted to the suspect \u2019s behaviour . The suspect \u2019s non - verbal communication is followed and whether his behaviour is congruent , i.e. whether his body language is in conformity with her verbal expressions . Other features of this interrogation technique are the copying of a suspect \u2019s physical behaviour which is intended to reassure the suspect and the so - called \u201c pushing in \u201d , i.e. to push CARDINAL by CARDINAL and on deliberate moment the chairs of each interrogator close to the suspect until in the end all interrogator sit intimately around the suspect .", "The interrogations are conducted within DATE , lasting on average TIME per day depending on how the interrogation proceeds ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
