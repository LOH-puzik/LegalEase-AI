The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants and the late Mr PERSON worked in LOC . Under a collective agreement concluded in DATE , they were entitled to a remote - area allowance , which was added to their salaries as a bonus for working in a remote part of the country . The amounts of the allowance were calculated on the basis of a given area \u2019s remoteness . By a collective agreement concluded on DATE , the remote - area allowance was abolished . This would have resulted in a reduction of the salary payable to civil servants whose duty station was PERSON . In order to prevent such a reduction , the collective agreement granted them DATE individual wage supplements from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE was incorporated into LOC by a decision of ORG ( sis\u00e4asiainministeri\u00f6 , inrikesministeriet ) . Following the incorporation , the ORG duty station changed . They also lost their individual wage supplements and the length of their commute allegedly increased by CARDINAL QUANTITY per day as they had to travel from GPE to GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , following their request of CARDINAL DATE to that effect , ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4nin poliisijohto , l\u00e4nspolisledningen ) promised that their loss would be compensated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the request of ORG , submitted a request for authorisation for the payment of DATE individual wage supplements , amounting to CARDINAL and MONEY ( ORG ) ( DATE ) per person , to those police officers and other personnel whose duty station had been changed from GPE to GPE . The request referred to an allegedly analogous case ( the PERSON case ) in which ORG ( valtiovarainministeri\u00f6 , finansministeriet ) had granted a request for individual wage supplements on DATE . On DATE ORG replied that it could not grant such authorisation . It gave no reasons for its refusal .", "CARDINAL .

By a letter of DATE , ORG recommended to ORG the retroactive payment from DATE of individual wage supplements to those civil servants whose duty station , after the incorporation , is ORG .", "By a letter of DATE , [ ORG ] informed ORG that it had found that it could not grant the request .", "Following the [ ORG ] decision , competence to decide on individual wage supplements was transferred to ORG . On DATE , in a negotiation meeting held by ORG at which the applicants were represented by PERSON , it was noted that negotiations were pending with regard to ORG in GPE , which was a corresponding case . As [ ORG ] , which had the relevant competence , had already decided the claims concerning LOC , it was concluded that , on grounds of fairness , the decision in PERSON would be adhered to in GPE were it to depart from the view of ORG . ORG rejected the application and the decision was upheld by ORG .

Its view had been shown through its support of the application .", "ORG , using its discretion and basing itself on the earlier decision by the competent authority , considers that the decision has acquired a certain res judicata effect . Emphasising the principles of equality and fairness , ORG also bases itself on the prevalent practice throughout the country . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE CARDINAL of the applicants lodged a complaint with the Chancellor of ORG ( oikeuskansleri , justitiekanslern ) who , in his decision of DATE , drew attention to the fact that the applicants had still not received any answer to their application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against ORG decision and requested an oral hearing which , they asserted , would make it possible to establish the facts of the case , in particular that a promise had been made by ORG .

Competence to decide the matter lay at that time with ORG , which in its letter of CARDINAL DATE had stated that it considered that it could not accede to the request . Since DATE ORG has had competence to decide on the wages of local police .", "ORG has in its decision , subject to appeal , based itself on the decision by the former competent authority and on the fact that after DATE no compensation had been awarded to personnel in other cases in which incorporation had taken place . The decision is therefore based on the prevalent practice at that time in the entire country . The decision can not be considered unreasonable in those circumstances . It has been possible to dismiss the request for rectification . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed further , requesting an oral hearing and emphasising that similar wage supplements had been granted to personnel from other police districts in corresponding situations .

On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , having received observations from ORG and the ORG Attorney and having communicated them to the applicants for comment , upheld the lower court \u2019s decision . It reasoned :", "\u201c ORG has examined the case .", "The promises made by ORG of ORG as regards compensation for costs arising from the incorporation of police districts have no legal relevance to the case . Thus , the holding of an oral hearing is manifestly unnecessary . Accordingly , ORG , having regard to section CARDINAL ) of LAW , refuses [ the appellants\u2019 ] request for an oral hearing .", "In their letter of DATE , [ the appellants ] requested compensation in the form of individual wage supplements of costs arising from the incorporation of their police district .

The implementing instruction of CARDINAL DATE on the application of the collective agreement with regard to the payment of a cold - area allowance to civil servants provided :", "\u201c A civil servant working ( before DATE ) in a municipality not covered by the new collective agreement is entitled to an individual wage supplement ... as long as he or she is working in the municipality giving rise to an entitlement to such an allowance . Where a civil servant entitled to an individual wage supplement is ordered , temporarily or as a substitute , to perform the duties of another civil servant , or where his or her duty station is transferred to a municipality in which the previous remote - area allowance has not been paid , the said civil servant will not be paid the individual wage supplement during the period he or she is performing those other duties because , in order to receive the wage supplement , the civil servant has to perform his or her duties in a municipality giving rise to entitlement to the wage supplement . \u201d", "According to the applicants , this instruction was not relevant to the present case , in that it allegedly concerned only temporary transfers , whereas the transfer of the applicants\u2019 place of duty had been of a permanent nature .", "CARDINAL . In its request of CARDINAL DATE , ORG referred to an allegedly analogous case in which ORG had on DATE granted a request for individual wage supplements following the incorporation of LOC into that of GPE ( the PERSON case ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused a request for compensation for commuting costs lodged by a civil servant whose duty station had changed following the incorporation of the LOC into that of the NORP and LOC .

An oral hearing may however be dispensed with if a party \u2019s request is ruled inadmissible or immediately dismissed or if an oral hearing would be clearly unnecessary due to the nature of the case or other circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The explanatory report on the Government Bill ( no . CARDINAL ) for the enactment of LAW examines the right to an oral hearing as provided by LAW and the possibility in administrative matters to dispense with the hearing when it would be clearly unnecessary , as stated in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the said LAW . It notes that an oral hearing contributes to a focused and immediate procedure but since it does not always bring any added value , it must be ensured that the flexibility and cost - effectiveness of the administrative procedure is not undermined . An oral hearing is to be held when it is necessary for the clarification of the issues and the hearing can be considered beneficial for the case as a whole .", "CARDINAL .
