The first , second and third applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . In the period DATE the first applicant visited GPE on a number of occasions . It appears that in DATE he obtained a temporary residence permit on the strength of his business activity . In DATE he was granted a permanent residence permit .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he met the second applicant and from DATE they lived together . Following a complicated pregnancy , on DATE their son , the third applicant , was born . The child \u2019s health has been fragile ever since , with frequent episodes of pulmonary disease .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG at ORG made an order for the first applicant \u2019s expulsion on the ground that he presented a threat to national security . He also deprived the applicant of the right to reside in GPE and excluded him from entering NORP territory for a period of DATE . No factual grounds were given . The order relied on a classified internal document of DATE , which was not served on the applicant . It appears that the applicant was able to consult it during the ensuing court proceedings ( see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) .", "CARDINAL . The internal document stated that the first applicant was involved in drug trafficking for the purposes of financing the militant NORP separatist group ORG ( the former ORG ) . The order stated that the first applicant should be detained pending expulsion and that it was subject to appeal to the Minister of ORG , but not to judicial review , and that it was immediately enforceable .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was served with the order on DATE . On DATE the head of another government agency , ORG of the national police , made another order for the first applicant \u2019s detention pending expulsion . The applicant was arrested and placed in a detention facility in GPE . Pursuant to an order of DATE he was transferred to another special detention facility outside the city .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was released on DATE . It appears from his submissions that on an unspecified date after his release he was interviewed at the NORP embassy about his alleged connections with a NORP separatist organisation .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the first applicant sought judicial review of the expulsion order by ORG , claiming that the order was unlawful and referring to his difficult family situation due to the complicated pregnancy of his partner , the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant also appealed against the order for his expulsion to the Minister of ORG . On DATE the appeal was returned to the applicant on the ground that it had been submitted out of time and that judicial proceedings for the order \u2019s review were pending .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the court proceedings the first applicant provided the court with a document , issued by ORG , certifying that at that time no criminal proceedings were pending against him . He also submitted written observations in which he claimed that he had never been involved in the activities mentioned in the classified internal document . He also referred to his family situation , the ORG and the case of LOC v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The defendant , ORG , submitted a copy of the internal document of DATE which had served as the basis for the expulsion . Despite the first applicant \u2019s request to this effect , the court did not order the head of ORG to produce further information or evidence regarding the reasons for the applicant \u2019s expulsion .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court found , inter alia , that the document of DATE had to be regarded as an official certification that the first applicant was a threat to national security and that as such it was binding on the court .", "CARDINAL . Upon the first applicant \u2019s appeal , by a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment , fully endorsing its conclusions and not engaging in examination of the evidence allegedly supporting the view of the authorities that the first applicant posed a threat to the national security . The court held that the deportation order was lawful and fully justified by the attached internal document and did not run counter to the Convention because the applicant had been able to challenge it before a court . The court further stated that the first applicant \u2019s rights had been restricted in accordance with the law and for the protection of the public interest . It also noted that given the existence of information about the first applicant \u2019s involvement in drug trafficking for the purpose of financing a terrorist organisation , the executive authority had rightly decided that the applicant constituted a threat to national security .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the first applicant challenged the order of CARDINAL DATE for his placement in a special detention facility before ORG . On DATE he requested suspension of the execution of the detention order .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the court granted the request and suspended the effect of the detention order for the course of the proceedings . The court stated , in particular , that the authorities had failed to provide evidence for the necessity of such a measure . It pointed to the duration of the detention ( at that time DATE ) and to the family situation of the first applicant . The decision became final on an unspecified date as the parties had not lodged an appeal and the applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings without examining the appeal on the merits . It held that the order for the applicant \u2019s placement in a detention facility was subordinate to the order for his expulsion and issued within the course of expulsion proceedings . It was not therefore subject to judicial review by itself .", "CARDINAL .
