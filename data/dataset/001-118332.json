On DATE the ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) remanded the applicant in custody on reasonable suspicion that he had committed a series of offences related to the running of the company . The court also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was justified by the severity of the penalty which could be imposed if he were convicted and the risk that he might attempt to obstruct the proceedings , especially since the applicant \u2019s and his co - accused \u2019s testimonies had been contradictory . That decision was upheld by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was subsequently extended by decisions of the ORG of DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , which were upheld by ORG on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively . In their decisions , the domestic courts repeatedly relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged , the serious nature of the offences , the complexity of the case which involved many individuals and the risk that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings , for example , by inducing witnesses to give false testimony . The domestic courts considered the latter argument particularly relevant in light of the fact that the penalty which the applicant faced was severe . In addition , the domestic courts invoked the difficulties in obtaining evidence , including from abroad , and the need to examine CARDINAL witnesses and many accounting , tax and auditing experts . On DATE the case file already consisted of CARDINAL volumes .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG decided to lift the preventive measure and to release the applicant . The court considered that continuing the applicant \u2019s detention was no longer necessary because CARDINAL of the co - accused , who had initially been detained , had already made their statements and CARDINAL of the other co - accused had remained at liberty throughout the proceedings . For these reasons there was no need to keep the applicant in pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending .", "CARDINAL .

He submitted that in each cell there had been a bunk bed ( QUANTITY ) .
