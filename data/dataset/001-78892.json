In a number of these articles the actions and declarations of high - ranking NORP officials were harshly criticised . The applicant emphasised , however , that it did not call for any violent or unlawful act and , in the impugned articles , expressly qualified such expressions as \u201c to annihilate \u201d ( \u201c \u0443\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u201d ) as meaning \u201c political annihilation [ of FAC leader ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

ORG illustrated his request with CARDINAL examples of phrases from the impugned articles , namely :", "\u201c The lack of legal balance between the [ FAC ] and GPE , as a recognised ORG , allows the latter to approach the negotiations from a position of superiority and dictatorship , which is the main reason for the slow pace of the negotiation process \u201d ; \u201c In the circumstances of an ongoing political , diplomatic and economic blockade of FAC by GPE we consider impossible a meeting between the Presidents of MRT and GPE \u201d .", "Since the applicant \u2019s publications , while formally presented as an exercise of the right to inform the public , were contrary to LAW ( see below ) and the applicant had been warned against continuing to violate the law , the court was requested to order the closure of the newspaper .", "CARDINAL .
