The first applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The second applicant , ORG , is a religious association ( kerkgenootschap ) with legal personality under GPE law and its statutory seat in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr T. van Kooten , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and apparent from documents available to the public , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is an office - holder of the second applicant . The second applicant is a religious association .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant association claims affiliation to FAC PERSON ( ORG of the Universal Flowing Light PERSON , \u201c ORG \u201d ) , an organisation based in GPE . The aim of the applicant association as set forth in its statutes is to \u201c research , study and practise the teachings of FAC and to incite with its works and rituals its godly spark with a view to its integration with the divine \u201d . Its teachings are stated to be based on revelations by PERSON to the religion \u2019s founder , PERSON ( DATE , referred to by his followers as PERSON ( \u201c Master \u201d ) Ireneu ) . ORG was founded after the death of PERSON by PERSON ( DATE , alias ORG ( \u201c Godfather \u201d ) ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . An essential part of the applicant association \u2019s rites is the drinking of a particular hallucinogenic decoction , or brew , during the services . This decoction is stated to be produced in accordance with prescribed religious rituals ; its ingredients are taken from plants and vines unique to the ORG region . It is described as the \u201c GPE \u201d of the applicant association and is referred to by believers as \u201c PERSON \u201d ( from the NORP dai me , \u201c give me \u201d ) . In other circles it is more commonly referred to as ayahuasca ( from the NORP aya , spirit , and waska , liana or vine ) .", "CARDINAL . The plants that are used for the production of ayahuasca , and hence the decoction itself , contain , inter alia , N , ORG , also described chemically as ORG ( hereafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG is a substance that can cause hallucinations if taken internally . When it is consumed in the form of ayahuasca , other possible effects include gastrointestinal reactions , such as nausea and vomiting . There is a possibility of more serious symptoms of acute toxicity , such as hypertension and increased body temperature , a rapid pulse rate and hyperventilation , sensory impairment in the limbs and difficulty walking .", "CARDINAL . On DATE police officers searched the first applicant \u2019s house . During this search the police found and confiscated , among other things , CARDINAL jerrycans each containing QUANTITY of an unknown liquid . ORG analysis performed by ORG ( ORG ) showed that the confiscated liquid contained ORG , which is CARDINAL of a number of banned substances featuring on List CARDINAL annexed to LAW ( PERSON , see below ) . The liquid was identified as ayahuasca .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( rechtbank ) found the first applicant guilty of , inter alia , the offence set out in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , namely the possession of a substance featuring on LAW annexed to that LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) , sitting in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against the first applicant as it found that the length of the appeal proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a notice of complaint ( klaagschrift ) with ORG , sitting in GPE , requesting the return of the CARDINAL jerrycans that had initially been confiscated . She stated that she was a member of the \u201c PERSON church \u201d , within which ayahuasca is the most important sacrament . She further argued that the continued confiscation of the ayahuasca violated her rights under LAW as this interference with her right was not necessary in a NORP society : in her submission , scientific expert reports showed that there were virtually no health and safety risks related to the drinking of ayahuasca .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing on the first applicant \u2019s case in the course of which she restated her arguments , claiming that , in her case , the protection of freedom of religion should outweigh the interests protected by LAW . According to the official record of the hearing the first applicant stated , in reply to a question from the court , that she could also practise her religion without the use of ayahuasca . The public prosecutor submitted that since the ayahuasca brew contained ORG , a substance featuring on LAW annexed to LAW , the jerrycans could not be returned to the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s complaint . It considered that her religion , as practised by the applicant association , was protected by LAW . However , since expert reports indicated that the use of ayahuasca did constitute a threat to public health , the court found that the interference with the first applicant \u2019s rights had not been unreasonable as it was necessary in a NORP society . ORG further noted that it had also taken into consideration the first applicant \u2019s statement that the use of ayahuasca was not indispensable for the practice of her religion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) . She submitted that ORG had drawn the wrong conclusions from the expert report since , after listing the effects of drinking ayahuasca , the report continued by stating that ayahuasca was used in the PERSON church \u2019s services on such a small scale , and its consumption took place in such a controlled environment , that there existed virtually no risk to public health . According to the first applicant ORG had failed to explain why it had not included that part of the report in its reasoning . The first applicant further submitted that the comment she had made at the hearing before ORG had been taken out of context , since she had only meant to say that she would still adhere to her religious denomination even if she could not use ayahuasca . Accordingly , the confiscation of the ayahuasca did indeed interfere with her freedom to practise her religion following the church \u2019s own rules and rituals .", "CARDINAL . In his advisory opinion , the Procurator General ( ProcureurGeneraal ) at ORG expressed the view that the appeal on points of law should be dismissed . He considered that the judiciary was not empowered to set aside a general prohibition of the possession of the substance solely because of the particular circumstances in which it was used , i.e. the specific situation being judged not to constitute a threat to public health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It considered that ORG had established that ayahuasca contained ORG which was included amongst the banned substances appearing on LAW annexed to LAW . ORG further noted that it appeared from the parliamentary history ( wetsgeschiedenis ) of LAW that the substances included on LAW were banned , among other reasons , in order to comply with international treaty obligations concerning psychotropic substances that could cause damage to health . The fact that section CARDINAL of LAW banned the possession of substances included on LAW therefore constituted a measure for the protection of public health . ORG concluded that ORG had not made any errors of law in finding that the ban on the possession of ayahuasca was prescribed by law and necessary in a NORP society for the protection of public health . It further noted that this conclusion was not altered by the first applicant \u2019s arguments that ayahuasca , in the manner in which it was used during church services , caused virtually no danger to ( public ) health , nor by the suggestion that ORG had drawn the wrong conclusions from the scientific report . In relation to the first applicant \u2019s comments made at the hearing before ORG , ORG held that it had not been unreasonable for ORG to consider them in relation to its finding that the interference with the first applicant \u2019s freedom of religion was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought proceedings seeking a declaratory judgment which was to hold that , firstly , the applicant association was a religious denomination under section CARDINAL:CARDINAL of GPE Code ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) , secondly , that the members of the applicant association were excluded from section CARDINAL of LAW for the possession and the use during services of the \u201c GPE \u201d ( ayahuasca ) , and , thirdly , that the ORG was prohibited from prosecuting the members of the applicant association for the possession and use during services of the \u201c PERSON \u201d for as long as the ORG had not brought its policy into line with the rights protected by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of The Hague dismissed the first request ( ORG ) , \u201c LJN \u201d ORG ) , holding that , although it was of the opinion that the applicant association was indeed a religious denomination within the meaning of section CARDINAL:CARDINAL of LAW , the applicant association had not substantiated its interest in such a declaration . ORG also dismissed the second and third claims , referring to ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant sections of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c It is prohibited to", "NORP import to or export from the territory of the GPE ;", "B. cultivate , prepare , modify , process , sell , deliver , supply or transport ;", "C. possess ;", "D. manufacture", "the substances featuring on List I annexed to this LAW ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .

PERSON appears on List I annexed to LAW under the appellations N , N - dimethyltryptamine and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( LJN : ABCARDINAL ) ORG held , in a case similar to the present one , that expert reports indicated that the PERSON church should be considered a legitimate religious association and that its teachings constituted a religious conviction ( geloofsovertuiging ) in themselves . It held that the prohibition contained in FAC should not be applied in view of the fact that the ritual use of ayahuasca in church services entailed virtually no risks to public health . ORG therefore considered that , since the drinking of the ayahuasca tea was such an essential part of the NORP religious practice , freedom of religion as guaranteed by LAW should attract greater weight than the prohibition contained in LAW . Subsequently , the accused was discharged from further prosecution of the criminal offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( LJN : BHCARDINAL ) \u2013 i.e. after the decision of ORG in the present case \u2013 the Haarlem Regional Court ruled on a case involving a person who had been apprehended at FAC with a number of bags containing ayahuasca in his luggage , intended for use during church services as described above . ORG found that there were virtually no risks to public health involved in the consumption of the brew in the setting of the church services . ORG further considered that the import of ayahuasca was regulated by specific rules and regulations issued by the church . It concluded that in these circumstances the protection of freedom of religion guaranteed by LAW outweighed the prohibitions contained in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( LJN : PERSON ) ORG upheld ORG judgment of DATE , against which ORG ( Openbaar Ministerie ) had appealed . ORG considered that there was a certain difference between the case before it and the case decided by ORG on DATE i.e. the first applicant \u2019s case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In this case , the accused had established that the drinking of ayahuasca was indeed an essential part of the practice of his religion . ORG held that this conclusion warranted an examination of the merits of the case and its specific circumstances , whereas ORG in DATE had only carried out an abstract examination of the merits of the case . Restating the judgment of ORG , it held that in this case the application of LAW was not \u201c necessary \u201d within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government informed the ORG that an appeal on points of law had been lodged by ORG against ORG judgment of DATE . As far as the ORG is aware , the proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL . The Convention on Psychotropic Substances ( United Nations Treaty Series , \u201c ORG \u201d , volume CARDINAL , pages CARDINAL and following ) was adopted in GPE on DATE . It entered into force on DATE . The GPE acceded to it on DATE . Attached to that Convention are CARDINAL Schedules listing various categories of psychotropic substances .", "CARDINAL .
