SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Wilhelmina Thomassen", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in LOC .", "A.", "On DATE I. , the then CARDINAL-year - old daughter of the applicant \u2019s cohabitee , PERSON , reported to the police that he had sexually harassed her . ORG then decided to take ORG into public care on a provisional basis under the DATE ORG ( lagen med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga ) .", "The decision was upheld on DATE by ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . PERSON appealed against this decision , but it was upheld by ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE on DATE .", "", "ORG later applied to ORG for a care order under LAW . The applicant was summoned to give evidence but he was not a party to the proceedings as NORP was not his child and he did not have custody of her . By judgment of DATE the court granted the application , finding that the applicant had made sexual advances towards NORP and verbally abused her .", "Both the applicant and PERSON appealed to ORG . The applicant claimed that the inferior court \u2019s judgment contained false accusations against him . On DATE the appellate court found that the applicant had no standing in the case and therefore dismissed his appeal . By judgment of DATE , the court rejected the appeal lodged by PERSON , giving the following reasons :", "( Translation )", "\u201c I. has , according to the [ court ] , made a mature and credible impression . The information she has provided regarding the events and facts of relevance to the case is also in several respects supported by other circumstances and statements . The [ court ] finds that it must be considered to have been established in the case that [ the applicant ] on some occasions has kissed and caressed [ I. ] in a way which was improper with regard to the fact that they were in a stepfather \u2013 stepdaughter relation to each other . [ I. ] has recounted CARDINAL of these occasions to [ E. ] . The information concerning how [ E. ] has reacted to this is not coherent but at least it is apparent that she has not taken [ ORG \u2019s ] allegations seriously , be it because she did not believe [ I. ] or because she did not find the matter called for action . In both these cases [ E \u2019s . ] care for [ I. ] must , as stated by ORG , be deemed to have been seriously lacking . It is true that some time has now passed since these events took place and that they seem not to have recurred since JanuaryFebruaryCARDINAL . Furthermore , [ I. ] has now stated that she is no longer afraid of [ the applicant ] . However , the [ court ] finds that what has happened entails such a grave disloyalty to [ I. ] that it constitutes an apparent deficiency in the home of [ E. ] as long as [ the applicant ] resides there , even if it should be possible to prevent a recurrence . The facts further show that [ I. ] has been subjected to degrading treatment in the home . Firstly , she has been caused to undergo an abnormally strict control of her whereabouts , a control which to some extent amounted to a violation of her privacy . She has also been subjected to degrading epithets and accusations and [ the applicant and PERSON have ] also [ made ] mainly entirely unsubstantiated reports and requests [ concerning ORG behaviour ] to school and police authorities . In these respects both [ E. ] and [ the applicant ] have , on several occasions , treated [ I. ] in a very peculiar way , as it appears often with [ the applicant ] as instigator . In sum , the [ court ] finds , with reference to the above , that there prevail such severe deficiencies in [ ORG ] home that there must be deemed to exist a palpable risk of her mental health and social development being impaired if she , against her will , is forced to live with [ E. ] and [ the applicant ] . \u2013 [ E. ] is still cohabiting with [ the applicant ] . It is true that she has declared that she intends to leave him for a home of her own in PERSON as soon as the opportunity occurs , but her intentions in that respect seem rather vague . She has also stated that , for the time being , she does not intend to discontinue her relationship with [ the applicant ] , who will consequently be in her home whether she moves or not . Having regard hereto , the [ court ] finds that necessary care presently can not be provided [ I. ] by [ E. ] and that [ I. ] therefore must be placed in a foster home . Since [ E. ] does not consent to such a measure there are , as ORG has found , reasons for providing [ I. ] with care pursuant to [ LAW ] . Consequently , the appeal shall be rejected . \u201d", "On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused the applicant leave to appeal against the appellate court \u2019s decision of DATE . On DATE ORG found that he had no standing to appeal against the appellate court \u2019s judgment of DATE and thus dismissed his appeal in this respect .", "On DATE the applicant was informed by ORG in GPE that he was going to be questioned regarding suspicions of having committed sexual harassment . On DATE the applicant was informed that the ORG had decided to terminate the preliminary investigation on the ground that it could not be proved that a crime had been committed .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "Care pursuant to the DATE Act shall be provided for a young person DATE if one of the situations referred to in LAW CARDINAL of the LAW is at hand and the necessary care presumably can not be given to the young person with the consent of the person having custody of him and , if the young person himself has reached the age of DATE , with his own consent . According to LAW care shall be provided if there is a palpable risk of impairment of the health or development of the young person due to ill - treatment , exploitation , lack of care or any other condition in the home .", "Decisions on whether to place a young person under public care are made by ORG following an application from ORG .", "The concept of health or development in the DATE Act was taken directly from the previous legislation in this area as a description of a person \u2019s physical or mental health or development . The concept refers to situations where the young person is risking his physical health or where mental suffering is inflicted because of the situation in the home .", "According to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the DATE Act the expression palpable or apparent risk ( p\u00e5taglig risk ) was deemed well suited for indicating at what level a compulsory care order could be justified . A subjective assumption that a young person is in danger is not enough and irrelevant circumstances such as public order must not be the basis of a care order . There has to be concrete or apparent circumstances supporting the fact that there is a risk for the young person \u2019s physical or mental health ( cf . Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "According to LAW may order the immediate taking into care of a young person ( \u201c provisional care order \u201d ) if he probably needs to be provided with care under LAW and a court decision on the matter can not be awaited owing to the risk to the young person \u2019s health or development or because the continuing inquiry can be seriously impeded or further measures prevented . A provisional care order shall be put before ORG which shall rule on whether the order shall be upheld awaiting the ORG \u2019s judgment regarding the application for public care .", "According to LAW , subsection CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen ) a decision made by a county administrative court or an administrative court of appeal may be appealed against by a person whom the decision concerns , provided that the decision affects him adversely ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
