NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who lives in PERSON . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in Rijsbergen .", "CARDINAL . GPE on DATE and requested asylum . In the course of interviews held with immigration officials , he stated that he had been born on DATE . In DATE or DATE he had been taken away from his parents by soldiers of ORG , who had taken him to a military base where he had stayed for DATE and where he had received education . He had not been allowed to leave the LOC . During DATE of his stay at the military base , he had been trained to become a soldier . After having heard that he had to fight against troops of ORG for ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) he had managed to escape the base with the help of his uncle , who had also been stationed there .", "CARDINAL . During the first interview held with the immigration authorities the applicant consented to cooperate in an age - verification examination . This radiographic examination was performed on DATE and disclosed that the applicant was DATE and must thus have been born in DATE rather than in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's asylum request was rejected by the Deputy Minister of ORG ( staatssecretaris PERSON ) , who found that the applicant 's account could not be considered credible . The applicant lodged appeals , but eventually to no avail . After ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE had quashed the rejection of the asylum request CARDINAL consecutive times for formal reasons or because it lacked adequate reasoning , the immigration authorities again refused to grant the applicant a residence permit for the purpose of asylum on DATE . The subsequent appeal of the applicant was rejected by ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , on DATE . ORG of ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak PERSON , \u201c the NORP \u201d ) upheld the judgment of ORG on DATE . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for a residence permit \u201c at the discretion of the Deputy Minister \u201d ( conform beschikking staatssecretaris ) , arguing that he had been residing in the GPE for DATE , during which period he had become integrated into NORP society and had developed personal , social and economic ties as a result of the course in electrical engineering he had been following , his membership of a football club , and his adherence to the GPE 's Witnesses .", "CARDINAL . The request was denied by the Deputy Minister on DATE for the reason that the applicant did not hold a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) , which was to be applied for at a representation of the GPE in the country of origin and which is a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit for purposes not related to asylum .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision , arguing that he ought to be exempted from the visa requirement . The Deputy Minister dismissed the objection on DATE , after which the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to be able to await the outcome of the objection and , subsequently , the appeal proceedings in the GPE , the applicant also applied for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) . By judgment of DATE , the provisional - measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of GPE , sitting in GPE , quashed the Deputy Minister 's decision on the objection for lacking adequate reasoning . However , the judge upheld the legal consequences and , at the same time , rejected the request for a provisional measure . The provisional - measures judge reiterated that the ratio of the visa requirement for obtaining a residence permit for purposes not related to asylum lay in preventing the national authorities , prior to a decision on a person 's request for admission having been taken , from being confronted with a fait accompli as a result of that person 's presence in the GPE . Furthermore , the provisional - measures judge considered that the authorities were not under a positive obligation to exempt the applicant from the visa requirement , as the fact that the applicant had been allowed to reside in the GPE for DATE pending the asylum proceedings could not be considered a special circumstance on the basis of which he should be exempted from the visa requirement . No other circumstances had been submitted justifying the conclusion that the decision not to exempt the applicant from the visa requirement constituted an exceptional hardship ( onbillijkheid van overwegende ORG ) and neither had any such circumstances appeared . The provisional - measures judge added that since the obligation to leave the GPE in order to apply for a visa was in principle only temporary in nature , it was only in exceptional cases that the refusal to exempt an alien from the visa requirement would amount to an unjustified interference with that alien 's right to respect for private life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the judgment of the provisional - measures judge . No further appeal lay against this decision . On DATE , the judgment of the ORG was sent to the applicant pursuant to LAW ( PERSON ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
