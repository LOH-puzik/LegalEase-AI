It does not seem realistic to believe that after all that they have endured \u2013 some with their careers in ruins , others with their careers in jeopardy- that they require much by way of deterrent or by way of reform , and no proper sentence which I pass will make an impression on terrorists while other members of the police force are no doubt already embarrassed , sufficiently embarrassed and shocked by what has happened in these cases and been seen to happen to their colleagues . ... I must remember that whatever sentence is just it would follow that it would be imposed on a different and lower scale from that appropriate to terrorists , no matter whichever side , whose aim is to achieve their political ends by violence and to attack the very fabric of society . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It had been advanced by the defence and accepted by the trial judge that PERSON had only aimed to shoot the applicant in the legs and had done so .", "CARDINAL .

On or DATE , ORG , an NORP television channel , broadcast a television programme that contained allegations of security force involvement in a number of deaths , including that of PERSON . PERSON made allegations on that programme that members of the ORG and GPE were directly involved in the attack on ORG . A ORG programme produced a similar documentary dealing with these allegations .", "CARDINAL . These allegations attracted considerable attention on both sides of the NORP border and became the subject of police investigation in both jurisdictions . The Government stated that the police investigation in GPE was focussed on determining whether PERSON 's allegations should be assessed as sufficiently credible to require a full investigation . They obtained from the journalist an edited transcript of the interview with PERSON . While his whereabouts were unknown to the ORG , PERSON met with senior NORP police officers at FAC on DATE .

In DATE a substantial report was compiled by the ORG for the GPE dealing with PERSON 's allegations . It profiled PERSON and dealt inter alia with a description of the DATE investigation into ORG and others . It concluded that the investigation would continue but that his credibility was in doubt . According to ORG , despite inquiries being conducted , PERSON 's whereabouts could not be traced . This report was not disclosed as the investigation was continuing . An internal ORG report dated DATE concluded that it would be necessary to interview ORG before any view could be finalised in respect of the credibility of his allegations : such interview was not possible as his whereabouts were not known . The report noted the absence of any previous mention of the allegations before DATE and that much of what he said was hearsay and speculation .

The ORG director of ORG , Detective Chief Superintendent PERSON ORG , took over personal supervision of the investigation which has progressed through the first CARDINAL of CARDINAL stages of the HET process ( collection of all relevant material ; assessment of the investigations to date ; review of evidence , with intelligence and open and non - police sources , together with a meeting with the families of the victims of the attack ) .

The Government have provided recent information that PERSON finally agreed to meet with the ORG in GPE ; he refused , however , to make a written statement or to give evidence in court .", "There has been contact between the police and the applicant , as well as with the ORG acting on behalf of a number of concerned families .
