According to the official statistics from the census carried out in GPE in DATE , CARDINAL persons stated that they were ethnic NORP , amounting to PERCENT of the persons who answered that question , and CARDINAL persons stated that they were of NORP religion . Since DATE , the members of those communities have been involved in major migrations leading many of them to settle in GPE . ORG has no official information on the exact number of NORP citizens who are ethnic NORP or NORP living temporarily or permanently in GPE . Estimates of that number vary considerably , generally ranging from CARDINAL individuals , in all the age brackets .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was founded in DATE . Its statutes define it as a liberal political party endeavouring to help unite all NORP citizens and to protect the rights and freedoms of minorities in GPE as guaranteed by the LAW and national legislation , as well as by the international instruments ratified by GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has put up candidates for all general and local elections in GPE since its inception . It has won seats in the national ORG in all the general elections held since DATE .

He is currently a ORG deputy of ORG .", "CARDINAL . These CARDINAL applicants submit that most of the NORP citizens currently living in GPE have voted for the DPS at all the general elections held over DATE .", "CARDINAL . By Decree of DATE the NORP President set DATE as the date of the elections to ORG . The electoral law laid down a new hybrid electoral system : CARDINAL deputies were to be elected on a first - past - the - post basis in single - member constituencies , and CARDINAL deputies were to be elected on a proportional basis at national level in CARDINAL multiple - member constituencies .", "CARDINAL . NORP citizens living abroad were entitled to vote in the general elections , but only for parties and coalitions , and their votes were taken into account in the proportional distribution of ORG among the different political formations at the national level ... Having obtained the consent of the competent authorities in the countries concerned , the NORP diplomatic representations opened CARDINAL polling stations in CARDINAL countries , CARDINAL of them in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG registered the ORG as participating in the general elections . The ORG presented lists of candidates in several single- and multiple - member constituencies . It was also included on the ballot paper designed for voting by NORP citizens living abroad .

Thirteen of the CARDINAL applicants ( see appended list ) ( nos . , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and DATE ) submitted that they had all personally submitted prior declarations of intention to vote to the NORP diplomatic representations in GPE . The NORP diplomates has asked them to take part in local electoral committees in GPE , ORG , ORG , ORG and GPE as presidents , secretaries or ordinary members , which they had agreed to do . On DATE they had been invited to the offices of the NORP diplomatic and consular representations , where NORP diplomats had informed them about the formalities to be complied with on DATE , and in particular how to draw up the electoral rolls . Some of the applicants affirmed that they had only been given CARDINAL instruction on that subject , to the effect that persons attending the polling station on DATE without preregistration should be included on the additional pages of the electoral roll , and that the last name added on DATE should be suffixed with a \u201c Z \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants submitted that their names had not been included on the list at the polling station where they were to function as members of the electoral committee . They had all voted in their respective polling stations by registering on DATE and signing opposite their names and forenames . Furthermore , they submitted that they had carefully indicated their choices on their ballot papers , without any other type of indication , and slotted the papers into the ballot box .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants also pointed out that there had been no particular problems on DATE . Their respective electoral committees had been made up of NORP nationals living in their respective towns and representatives of ORG . Some of the polling stations had been visited by the NORP Ambassador and PERSON , and others had been reported on by NORP public television and radio teams , and no irregularities had been noted . At the close of polling on DATE the local committees had counted the votes , filled in the requisite report forms and submitted the electoral documents to the NORP diplomatic representatives .", "CARDINAL . The other CARDINAL applicants submitted that at the material time they had been living in GPE . Some of them had sent prior statements of intention to vote to the NORP diplomatic representations , but they had never been informed in return of which polling stations to vote in . On DATE all the applicants in question had attended the nearest polling stations in their respective towns . Their names had been handwritten into the electoral rolls , and after voting they signed opposite their names .", "CARDINAL . According to information available on ORG website ( http://piCARDINAL.cik.bg ) , following the DATE elections , CARDINAL political parties and coalitions garnered more than the minimum PERCENT of votes cast and were included in the process of proportional distribution of seats in ORG : ORG , the Coalition for GPE , the ORG , ORG , ORG and the RZS party .", "CARDINAL . The ORG obtained a total of CARDINAL votes , or PERCENT of the valid votes , which made it the country \u2019s third political party . It garnered PERCENT of the out - of - country voting , that is to say CARDINAL votes , CARDINAL of which were cast in polling stations in NORP territory . It came out well ahead in the QUANTITY polling stations \u2013 in GPE , ORG , ORG , ORG and GPE DATE in which the CARDINAL applicants had voted . By decision of DATE ORG assigned the DPS CARDINAL parliamentary seats under the proportional representation system , together with a further CARDINAL seats won in the first - past - the - post constituencies .", "CARDINAL . Following the apportionment of seats won by the DPS at the national level in the CARDINAL multiple - member constituencies , the party won CARDINAL seat in the CARDINALth constituency . However , another political formation , ORG , having appealed to ORG and the votes cast in a polling station in the CARDINALth constituency having been recounted , ORG conducted a reassignment of the seats won at the national level among the CARDINAL multiple - member constituencies . This gave the ORG a second seat in the CARDINALth constituency , where Mr PERSON was in second place on his list of candidates , and removed CARDINAL of the CARDINAL seats initially won in DATE multiple - member constituency . On DATE Mr PERSON was declared elected to ORG . He was sworn in as a deputy and became a member of his party \u2019s parliamentary group . On DATE he was elected member of ORG and the Fight against Corruption and Conflicts of Interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President and CARDINAL other members of the RZS ( Red , GPE , ORG , PERSON and ORG \u201d ) , a right - wing conservative party , requested the Attorney General to lodge with ORG the appeal provided for in CARDINAL of LAW in order to annul the election of CARDINAL DPS deputes on the grounds of several irregularities which had occurred in the CARDINAL polling stations operating in NORP territory . The CARDINAL appellants complained of several breaches of electoral legislation in connection with the setting up of the said polling stations and their handling of the voting : they claimed that the rule requiring a polling station to be opened for DATE prior statements of intention to vote had been flouted in NORP territory ; some electors had exercised their voting rights once in NORP national territory and again in a polling station in NORP territory ; incorrect information had been included in the reports drawn up by the electoral committees concerning the number of voters in the polling stations in question ; CARDINAL of them had allegedly dealt with CARDINAL voters , which would have been a practical impossibility in view of TIME of the polling station and the time required to complete the requisite formalities for each voter , and the electoral committees attached to those polling stations had , in certain cases , reportedly allowed persons into the voting booths without valid NORP identity papers . The appellants invited ORG to verify the authenticity of the prior voting requests issued in NORP territory , to check the electoral rolls drawn up in the region of GPE where the individuals wishing to vote in GPE had their permanent addresses , and to declare null and void the records drawn up by the electoral committees responsible for the polling stations opened in NORP territory . According to the appellants , the large number of irregularities committed in the voting procedure in the QUANTITY polling stations in question necessitated the annulment of the votes cast in them , which annulment would have changed the election results and led to the ousting of CARDINAL DPS deputies from their seats .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General transmitted the request submitted by the President and CARDINAL other members of the RZS party to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court declared the appeal admissible and designated as parties to proceedings ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG responsible for ORG and CARDINAL non - governmental organisations . It sent copies of the request and the relevant documents to the parties to proceedings and gave them a deadline of DATE to submit their observations on the merits of the case . That court asked ORG responsible for ORG to ascertain how many voters had voted in the national territory and then again in NORP territory , and invited it to submit certified copies of the lists of persons having voted and the reports on voting drawn up by the polling stations in NORP territory . The President of ORG , GPE , and Judge PERSON signed the admissibility decision , while issuing a separate opinion . They argued that the Attorney General should have submitted a reasoned request to ORG rather than merely transmitting the request for annulment lodged by the ORG political party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG parliamentary group of ORG presented its written observations on the case . It first of all disputed the admissibility of the appeal lodged by the CARDINAL appellants , arguing that the Attorney General had failed to conduct a prior assessment of the merits of the said request , merely transmitting it to ORG , that the appeal had been lodged belatedly , after the deputies in question had been sworn in , and that the CARDINAL DPS deputies mentioned in the request had been designated randomly since the out - of - country votes had been used solely to apportion the seats among the various parties at the national level and not for the benefit of any given list of candidates . Secondly , the ORG parliamentary group submitted that the request had been ill - founded for the following reasons : the legal conditions for setting up the CARDINAL polling stations in question had been fulfilled ; there had been very few cases of double voting , and voting secrecy precluded determining for which party exactly those persons had voted ; the number of persons included on the additional electoral rolls on DATE had been higher than that of preregistered voters because the number of persons wishing to exercise their voting rights had far exceeded the number of voters having previously declared their intention to vote outside the country ; and in several of the out - of - country polling stations the number of persons voting had exceeded CARDINAL , and that had not been the case only in the polling stations in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the ORG party , ORG ordered a CARDINAL expert assessment to provide the answers to the following questions : ( i ) how many prior statements of intention to vote were submitted for the territory of GPE , from which towns were they sent , and did their number correspond to the number of polling stations set up ? ( ii ) were the identity papers of electors voting in the CARDINAL polling stations valid ? ( iii ) did the numbers of electors voting recorded in TIME drawn up on DATE correspond to the total number of preregistered electors and persons registered on the rolls on DATE , and were there any polling stations in which none of the preregistered persons exercised their right to vote ? ( iv ) what was the maximum number of persons who could vote in a polling station over DATE ? The CARDINAL experts were given leave to consult all the documents on elections in NORP territory which the diplomatic service of ORG had submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The expert report was submitted to ORG DATE . It indicated that there had been a total of CARDINAL prior declarations of intention to vote in respect of the territory of GPE : CARDINAL of those declarations had been received at ORG in GPE , CARDINAL at FAC in GPE and CARDINAL at FAC in GPE . The NORP diplomatic services had opened CARDINAL polling stations in the GPE region , CARDINAL in the GPE region and CARDINAL in the LOC region . The experts had noted that some polling stations had been opened without the threshold of CARDINAL declarations of intention to vote having been reached .", "CARDINAL . The experts were unable to answer the second question , on the validity of the NORP identity papers of those voting in GPE . They pointed out that it would have been very time - consuming to carry out the necessary verifications and would have required access to the population database administered by ORG . Furthermore , in several cases the local electoral committees had merely mentioned the type of document presented , i.e. an identity card or passport , without recording the document number .", "CARDINAL . As regards the third question , the experts replied that there had been some very slight differences \u2013 CARDINAL between the numbers of persons voting recorded in the polling station TIME and the numbers of voters included in the electoral rolls . According to the experts , that might have been due to inadvertent omissions . Moreover , they observed that the additional electoral lists in CARDINAL polling stations , which had been drawn up on DATE and contained data on the persons who had turned out without having been preregistered , had not been signed by the chair or secretary of the local electoral committee . The experts noted that the personal data on electors contained in those lists had been handwritten , apparently unhurriedly , and those entries would have taken a considerable length of time to write . Furthermore , in some of the polling stations none of the preregistered persons had turned out to vote . In some other polling stations there had been TIME on file , or else the first page of TIME had been missing .", "CARDINAL . As regards the fourth question put by ORG , the experts concluded , from a reconstitution of the requisite formalities in dealing with voters and their ballot papers , that the minimum time required for voting would have been TIME . Having regard to the total duration of DATE , that is to say TIME , the experts estimated that a polling station could deal with a maximum of CARDINAL voters . The maximum number of persons voting as thus calculated had been exceeded in CARDINAL of the polling stations operating in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG responsible for ORG presented ORG with the results of its inquiry into cases of double voting . The department pointed out that CARDINAL persons had voted several times and that CARDINAL cases of double voting had been noted in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to ask the CARDINAL experts to examine an additional point : it asked them to recalculate the election results after deducting all the votes cast in CARDINAL polling stations and some of those cast in another polling station , all located in NORP territory . The court \u2019s request covered : ( i ) all the votes cast in CARDINAL polling stations where none of the preregistered voters had voted and where the additional lists of those voting had not been signed by the members of the local electoral committees and therefore lacked the probative value of official documents ; ( ii ) all the votes cast in a polling station in which the TIME on voting were missing ; ( iii ) all the votes cast in CARDINAL other polling stations where the first page of the minutes was missing ; ( iv ) all the votes cast in a polling station where the list of preregistered voters was missing ; ( v ) CARDINAL votes cast for the ORG by persons included in the unsigned additional list at another polling station where that party had garnered all the votes and where CARDINAL preregistered persons had voted ; ( vi ) all the votes cast in another polling station where the list of preregistered voters had not been put on file and where the additional electoral list had not been signed by the members of the local electoral committee .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts submitted their supplementary conclusions to ORG . In the introductory section of the report they pointed out that they had been mandated to deduct from the outcome of the election the votes cast in polling stations where : ( i ) none of the preregistered voters had voted and where the additional lists of those voting had not been signed by the members of the local electoral committees ; ( ii ) TIME were not put on file ; ( iii ) the first page of the minutes was missing . The report presented estimates of the votes cast in CARDINAL polling stations : ( i ) in CARDINAL of those stations , none of the preregistered voters had voted and the additional list of voters had not been signed ; ( ii ) in the case of another polling station , TIME had been put on file and the additional list of voters had not been signed ; ( iii ) for CARDINAL other stations , the first page of the minutes was missing and the additional list of voters had not been signed ; ( iv ) in another polling station , the first page of TIME had not mentioned the number of persons having voted and none of the preregistered voters had voted . The experts considered that a total of CARDINAL votes should be deducted from the election results , CARDINAL of which had been case for the DPS . ORG conducted the provisional reassignment of seats among the political parties on the basis of the expert report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parliamentary group of the ORG submitted supplementary observations challenging ORG choice of criteria for excluding the votes cast in the aforementioned polling stations from the vote count . The ORG deputies pointed out that the outcome of the voting had been based on the data set out in the polling station TIME , and not on the electoral rolls . They added that electoral legislation did not require the chairs and secretaries of out - of - country local electoral committees to sign below the additional lists of voters drawn up on DATE . At all events , in the GPE opinion , the shortcomings of members of the electoral administration could not lead to the annulment of electors\u2019 votes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG presented its findings to ORG . It pointed out that according to mathematical projections , the annulment of the votes cast in the CARDINAL polling stations mentioned in the experts\u2019 supplementary conclusions would deprive the ORG of CARDINAL seat which would be assigned to the ORG political party and that in the CARDINALth multiple - member constituency the ORG candidate concluded in second place on the party \u2019s list , Mr PERSON , would lose his parliamentary seat .", "CARDINAL . ORG presented ORG with observations made by CARDINAL of its CARDINAL members on the merits of the case . Those CARDINAL members voiced the opinion that the arguments put forward by the appellants and the experts\u2019 conclusions could not be used to justify annulling the votes cast in the polling stations in question . They explained in particular that the lists of persons voting in the out - of - country polling stations had been drawn up by the NORP diplomatic representatives accredited on the basis of the prior declarations of intention to vote which they had received . They nevertheless stated that no prior information had been given on the distribution of the voters in question around the various polling stations , as they could attend any polling station or choose not to vote at all , which in their view explained why in some stations none of the voters on the main list had voted . The members of ORG considered that that should not lead to the invalidation of the ballots of other electors who had voted in the same polling station . They pointed out that under domestic legislation the election documents had to be packaged and sealed by the local electoral committees and then sent to ORG . However , when the election documents had arrived from GPE , it had been noted that the packages containing the documents had already been opened and then re - sealed by the diplomatic services of ORG . At all events , the absence , attributable to the NORP diplomatic services or the local electoral committees , of election documents from out - of - county polling stations could not have justified annulling votes cast in those stations , given that the election results from outside the country had been based on data transmitted via diplomatic telegrams to ORG . Finally , the members of ORG , referring to domestic legislation , submitted that the fact that a member of ORG had not signed TIME of voting or the accompanying documents did not invalidate them and did not constitute grounds for annulling the votes cast in the station in question . They considered that the recalculation of the election results was based on arguments which had not been mentioned in the request to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG and CARDINAL of its deputies applied to ORG for leave to join the proceedings in question as a party . In that application the ORG stated that it fully endorsed the observations submitted by its parliamentary group on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . On DATE Mr PERSON requested leave to join the proceedings as a party . In order to demonstrate his interest in taking part in the proceedings he referred explicitly to the additional expert report ordered by ORG and the reapportionment of seats effected by ORG on the basis of the experts\u2019 findings . All those requests remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private session , adopted its decision in the case in question . It delivered its judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the pleas of inadmissibility put forward by the ORG parliamentary group in its observations of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It considered , first of all , that the procedure for applying to the court had been respected . Secondly , it observed that the case concerned the contestation of election results rather than the eligibility of an individual candidate , which enabled it to assess the case even though the deputies in question had been sworn in and were already in office . It joined to the merits of the case the third plea of inadmissibility concerning the lack of a direct link between the out - of - country votes and the election of the CARDINAL DPS deputies named in the initial request . Judges PERSON and ORG set out separate opinions on the admissibility of the request for annulment of the election results . They considered that the Attorney General had merely transmitted the request submitted by the ORG party instead of himself lodging a reasoned application for the annulment of the elections .", "CARDINAL . Considering that it should begin by clarifying the scope of the case , ORG pointed out that it had been invited to find unlawful the election of a number of ORG deputies owing to several alleged irregularities in the polling stations operating in NORP territory . Having regard to the specific mode of functioning of the NORP electoral system , in which votes cast by NORP citizens living abroad were taken into account solely for the proportional distribution of seats among political parties at the national level , it was impossible to determine in advance which deputies would be affected by the invalidation of some or all of the votes cast in NORP territory . Thus , in the framework of that case , ORG considered that it had been called upon to determine whether there had been any serious irregularities in the voting procedure in the CARDINAL polling stations in GPE . It held that a finding of such irregularities could lead to a change in the election results , a fresh apportionment of seats among the political parties and the annulment of the seats of deputies who had not been explicitly targeted by the initial application lodged by the leader and a number of candidates of the RZS party in the general elections .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected all the arguments put forward in the initial statement of claim . It first of all noted that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL) ( CARDINAL ) of the Electoral Law gave NORP diplomatic representatives outside the country carte blanche to open as many polling stations as they considered necessary for the proper conduct of the elections .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , it considered that the question whether a given voter had voted without a valid NORP identity card was immaterial to the outcome of the proceedings , since voting secrecy ruled out ascertaining which party the person had voted for .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that the experts had noted that in some polling stations none of those on the main electoral roll had voted , while in other stations only a few of those on the roll had voted . It pointed out that according to the experts the names added on DATE had been written clearly and apparently unhurriedly , which would seem rather unlikely given the large number of such additions and the pressure under which the members of the electoral committees would have been working on DATE . However , ORG considered that such considerations were mere suspicions which had not categorically demonstrated that the results of voting in those polling stations had been manipulated .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that the experts had reached the conclusion that the maximum number of persons who could vote in CARDINAL polling station was CARDINAL . However , it considered that in the absence of precise information on the alleged irregularities in the voting procedure in the polling stations with CARDINAL persons voting , that finding did not provide grounds for invalidating the election results . At all event voting secrecy precluded determining for whom the persons registered after CARDINAL on the list of voters had cast their vote .", "CARDINAL . For those reasons ORG dismissed the application for the annulment of the seats of the CARDINAL deputies explicitly covered by the initial request submitted by the leader and candidates of the RZS party .", "CARDINAL . However , it decided to deduct from the results obtained by each of the political parties respectively all the votes cast in CARDINAL polling stations in GPE , that is to say a total of CARDINAL votes , CARDINAL of which had been cast for the DPS . It pointed out that in those polling stations none of the voters preregistered on the main electoral rolls had voted , or else the first page of TIME of the voting , certifying that the preregistered persons had voted , was missing . The court pointed out that in the CARDINAL polling stations in question the additional lists of voters drawn up on DATE did not bear the signatures of the chairs and secretaries of the local electoral committees , which deprived them of the probative value of official documents . ORG accordingly considered that they could not be used in evidence to demonstrate that the registered persons had voted . That approach had allegedly also enabled it to determine how many votes had been deducted from the election results of each party or coalition and to reallocate the GPE seats in ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the additional objections raised by the ORG parliamentary group on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It considered that the irregularities noted in the electoral rolls in the various polling stations had also affected the legitimacy of the minutes drawn up by the electoral committee on completion of the voting because they contained data on the exact number of persons having voted in the polling station in question and the election results had been determined on the basis of the minutes . Even though domestic legislation did not explicitly require the members of the out - of - country local electoral committees to sign additional electoral lists , the module additional electoral list approved by the President of the Republic pursuant to the Electoral Law provided for such signatures . ORG therefore took the view that such signature was a legal condition for the validity of such official documents . At all events , the signature was one of the fundamental and obvious components of any official document . The lack of those signatures on the additional voter lists drawn up in the CARDINAL polling stations thus deprived them of their official probative value in respect of the fact that the registered persons had actually cast their votes .", "CARDINAL . ORG declared that the votes in question had been valid under domestic legislation but that they had been deducted from the election results owing to the irregularity of the voter lists and the voting minutes . It considered that the seats in ORG had to be reallocated . For those reasons , and having taken into account the prior calculations submitted by ORG , ORG annulled the parliamentary seats of CARDINAL deputies , including Mr PERSON . It ordered ORG to reapportion the seats in ORG by deducting from the election results the CARDINAL votes cast in the CARDINAL polling stations in question .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE , pursuant to the judgment of ORG , ORG declared CARDINAL other candidates elected . Consequently to that redistribution of seats , the ORG was the only party to have lost a parliamentary seat and ORG , which had won the general elections , obtained an additional seat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG and CARDINAL of its deputies in ORG in turn lodged the appeal provided for in CARDINAL of LAW and contested the lawfulness of the election of the CARDINAL deputies which ORG had declared elected by decision of DATE . Mr PERSON lodged the same appeal in his own name .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG declared the CARDINAL appeals inadmissible on the grounds that the dispute in issue had already been the subject of proceedings before it , leading to its judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINALst ORG constituted following the general elections of CARDINAL DATE sat until DATE , when it was dissolved by Presidential Decree .", "CARDINAL . The elections to ORG were held on CARDINAL DATE . At those elections the ORG obtained CARDINAL votes , that is to say PERCENT of the validly cast votes . It obtained CARDINAL votes in NORP territory . It sent CARDINAL deputies to ORG , where it was the third biggest parliamentary group . Mr PERSON was elected deputy of the CARDINALth multiple - member constituency , where he headed his party \u2019s list .", "CARDINAL . The lawfulness of those general elections , particularly as regards the polling stations opened in NORP territory , was disputed before ORG by a group of CARDINAL deputies from ORG . The deputies requested the annulment of the elections in the CARDINAL polling stations operating in GPE owing to several alleged irregularities in the voting procedures : they submitted that the polling stations had been set up on the basis of forged prior declarations of intention to vote ; they had opened despite their electoral committees lacking the minimum number of members ; unidentified persons had canvassed the areas inhabited by NORP citizens in GPE , had obtained NORP identity papers from various electors and had returned them to their owners DATE before the elections telling them that they had voted ; several voters had not shown any valid NORP identity papers ; the number of persons voting in some of the polling stations had exceeded , which was unrealistic in view of the time required to complete the formalities linked to the voting procedure ; there had been several cases of double voting ; the lists of electors registered on DATE had not been properly drawn up and had not been signed by the chair and the other members of the electoral committee . The request referred explicitly to the reasoning of the judgment delivered by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal lodged by the CARDINAL ORG deputies . It considered and rejected , on the basis of the evidence gathered , all the allegations of breaches of electoral legislation advanced by the appellants . It noted , inter alia , that the relevant members of all the electoral committees set up in NORP territory had signed at the bottom of the lists of voters added on DATE , which gave those documents the probative value of official documents .", "CARDINAL . During the CARDINALnd legislature the ORG took part in a coalition government which resigned in DATE . Following those events ORG was dissolved on DATE by Presidential Decree .", "CARDINAL . The elections to ORG were held on CARDINAL DATE . The ORG obtained CARDINAL votes , that is to say PERCENT of all valid votes cast , and sent CARDINAL deputies to ORG . No admissible appeal was lodged before ORG against those election results . The ORG is currently the third biggest political party in the country and the second biggest opposition party .", "CARDINAL .
