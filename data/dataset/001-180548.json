ROMANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing)", "JUDGES": "Egidijus K\u016bris;Iulia Motoc;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company , ORG , is a NORP company whose registered office is in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter , \u201c the ORG \u201d ) instituted enforcement proceedings against the applicant company on the grounds that it had an outstanding tax liability for DATE amounting to CARDINAL NORP lei ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company , represented by its appointed lawyer , Mr. PERSON PERSON , challenged before ORG the ORG \u2019s decision to open enforcement proceedings . It claimed that it had no outstanding fiscal debts and submitted documentary evidence in this respect .", "CARDINAL . At the first hearing in the proceedings the ORG acknowledged that the applicant company had no outstanding tax liability and that the enforcement proceedings had been instituted in error . Invoking Article CARDINAL of LAW of the Civil Procedure ( hereinafter , \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it also contended that as it had acknowledged its error at the first hearing in the proceedings it should not be ordered to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG allowed the applicant company \u2019s challenge concerning the ORG \u2019s decision to open enforcement proceedings and ordered the ORG to pay the applicant ORG CARDINAL ; this sum represented respectively the fees of the applicant company \u2019s lawyer ( CARDINAL PERSON ) , stamp duty and trial tax ( CARDINAL ORG ) . The court held that although the ORG had acknowledged its error at the first hearing it could not be exonerated from the payment of the costs and expenses incurred by the applicant company , as the challenge proceedings were the result of a mistake on its part . The court further noted that the ORG had started enforcement proceedings against the applicant company for a non - existent debt and that the latter had accordingly had to hire a lawyer and pay the trial fees in order to defend itself . The court also noted that the applicant company had submitted evidence to support its request for the reimbursement of the expenses it had incurred .", "CARDINAL . The ORG lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of DATE . It claimed that the first - instance court had not observed the principle of adversarial proceedings and of equality of arms , as it had not had the opportunity to challenge the amount paid by the applicant company in lawyer \u2019s fees , which in its opinion were too high .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as unfounded . While holding that the lawyer \u2019s fees corresponded to his input in the case , the court reiterated that the judge was entitled to increase or to reduce a lawyer \u2019s fees , according the specific criteria set out by LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court thus concluded that the judgment given by ORG was lawful and well - founded ; it further awarded the applicant company the amount of CARDINAL ORG in legal costs in respect of the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The ORG lodged with ORG an application for the judgment of CARDINAL DATE to be set aside ( contesta\u0163ie \u00een anulare \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on the grounds that ORG had not examined all the arguments that it had raised in its appeal on points of law ; the ORG referred in particular to the fact that before the Timi\u015foara ORG they were not given the possibility to bring their arguments concerning the amount requested by the applicant company and then awarded in legal costs and expenses by the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting in a different formation from that of CARDINAL DATE , allowed the request : it set aside the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and allowed the appeal lodged by the ORG against the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which it partly amended . ORG held that the appellate court had not examined the arguments raised by the defendant in their appeal on points of law in relation to the manner in which the first instance court applied LAW of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; in particular , the first instance court had not allowed the parties to bring their arguments concerning the amount of the legal costs requested by the applicant company . Such an omission was sufficient , in ORG view , to justify the quashing of the previous judgments .", "CARDINAL . ORG then re - examined the amount paid by the applicant company in lawyer \u2019s fees and considered that in relation to the lawyer \u2019s input in the case , it was justified to reduce that amount from PERSON CARDINAL to PERSON CARDINAL . It also considered that the stamp duty and trial tax in the amount of CARDINAL ORG were not to be granted to the applicant company , in so far as this amount could be requested separately from the fiscal authorities , based on the PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on stamp duty , as a consequence of the fact that the challenge to the enforcement had been allowed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
