He was charged with having murdered a CARDINAL-year - old girl by cutting her throat . In the ensuing proceedings he was assisted by a defence counsel of his choice .", "On DATE ORG preferred a bill of indictment .", "On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . ORG relied on , inter alia , evidence given by the applicant at trial .", "On appeal , on DATE ORG held a hearing . It held that the first - instance judgment was ill - founded within the meaning of subparagraphs ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of section CARDINAL ) of LAW ; consequently , it had to be quashed under sections DATE ) and CARDINAL ) of that Code and remitted to the first - instance court . It ordered ORG to analyse the contradictions contained in the various statements made by the applicant during the investigations and at trial .", "In the resumed proceedings , on DATE ORG convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and barred him from participating in public affairs for DATE . ORG relied on the fact that , during the investigations , the applicant had admitted the murder , on the testimonies of CARDINAL witnesses , the opinion of CARDINAL experts , documentary evidence , the inspection of the crime scene and forensic analyses . The defendant did not wish to testify ; instead , he maintained the statements he had made during the investigations along with those which he had made before ORG during the first trial . His previous statements were read out in court .", "In the appeal proceedings , on DATE ORG refused the request of the applicant \u2019s lawyer to obtain copies of the video recordings made during the investigation . ORG pointed out that he was entitled to obtain copies of any written TIME prepared on the basis of the recordings .", "On DATE ORG , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW and in response to the submission by the defence of the opinion of a private expert , instructed the expert chemist who had given an opinion during the first - instance trial to complete his report concerning the alleged mishandling of the material evidence in the case .

The court refused to appoint an additional expert in physics , as was proposed by the defence , and declared the taking of evidence closed .", "A further hearing took place on DATE . ORG rejected the defence \u2019s further proposals to obtain the opinions of an expert physicist and an expert in graphological lie - detection , as well as to hear the applicant .", "At the hearing of DATE , ORG again refused to hear the applicant , despite insistence by the defence . It was pointed out that during the first - instance proceedings the defendant could have , at any time , pleaded his case , but he had deliberately chosen not to . At the appeal stage , the hearing of the applicant \u2019s testimony would only be permitted if necessary to complete the findings of fact . In any event , he had the right to address the court last .", "At the hearings of CARDINAL and DATE the applicant addressed the court last .", "On DATE ORG adjudicated on the applicant \u2019s appeal . It made a preliminary review of the judgment which it found well - founded as a whole . It made several corrections to the text and then considered that it was of a sufficient standard to be considered on the merits rather than quashed ( \u00e9rdemi fel\u00fclb\u00edr\u00e1latra alkalmas ) . In the light of the evidence which it had completed itself , it was able to make a rectification to the relevant part of the first - instance decision by way of an order ( v\u00e9gz\u00e9s ) rather than a judgment . Thereafter it upheld the conviction and sentence .", "In particular , ORG noted that ORG had respected its instructions on to how to repeat the first - instance proceedings . It observed that , since the applicant had refused to give evidence in the resumed proceedings before ORG , all his utterances previously made in the case had been read out before ORG and the applicant had been free to comment on them . Moreover , the video tapes available to ORG were played at the hearings and all the persons involved in the case were heard . Furthermore , additional expert opinion was obtained .", "ORG emphasised that , the taking of evidence having been closed in the first - instance proceedings , the provisions of LAW did not allow for a repetition of that evidence before the second - instance court , which was only called on to review , under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , the disputed judgment and the earlier proceedings . Insofar as the opinion of the defence \u2019s private expert was concerned , ORG specified that it was admitted to the file as documentary evidence , although largely irrelevant .", "Act no .
