It was established that the interests of [ the child ] require that she be placed in her father \u2019s care [ as he ] was established to be a more suitable caregiver ; at the same time it was established that as a result of [ the child \u2019s ] separation from her father the former \u2019s psychological well - being [ has been affected ] . It was established that for DATE the father , unlike the mother , has been cooperating with [ the custody and guardianship authority ] , and the [ guardian ] had therefore had a real possibility to examine the father \u2019s living conditions and his situation ; ... it was established that he can provide [ the child ] with normal accommodation ... The father is financially stable , which enables him to provide [ the child ] with the material [ items ] and non - material values necessary for her health , mental , cultural and physical development . [ The child ] will soon go to primary school and the father , in view of his education and indisputable interest in [ the child ] , is capable of providing her , along with the possibility of school education , with everything she needs . ... Despite the fact that the father was and is still being prevented from communicating with [ the child ] , he [ supports the child financially by giving money directly to the mother and making deposits into the child \u2019s bank account ] , and in addition to alimony the father gives [ the child ] presents whenever he has the possibility to meet her .", "The mother , on the contrary , was characterised as unstable , authoritative , unfriendly to the father and inclined to impulsive aggression and rash behavior . While carrying out her parental duties she harms [ the child ] , she has abused her parental authority since DATE at least ... Therefore , she acts both unlawfully and contrary to the interests of [ the child ] and the court \u2019s decision . While exercising her parental authority the mother consciously and purposefully acts in total disregard of the recommendations of the experts and her lawful duties ; she completely prevented communication between the father and [ the child ] , at first without any reason . Subsequently , under an invented pretext , in DATE she took [ the child ] , without the permission of the father , the court or [ the custody and guardianship authority ] abroad to GPE , where she has kept [ the child ] until now . At the same time the mother has not complied with the decision of the court pursuant to which she should have handed [ the child ] over to the father , to render to the father [ the child \u2019s ] travelling passport and not to remain [ with the child ] outside the territory of GPE . [ It was established that the decision in question ] was served on [ the mother ] first of all through her representative in GPE , and thereafter to her personally in the course of the proceedings at the courts in GPE and GPE . Furthermore , the mother refuses to send an invitation for visiting GPE to the father , [ who ] has to go through demanding procedures to obtain NORP entry visas , and when the father succeeds in obtaining a visa and goes to GPE the mother often hides [ the child ] and refuses to communicate with the father[. ] [ S]he does not even allow the father to talk to [ the child ] on the telephone , and even if she lets them talk she purposefully manipulates the father \u2019s and [ the child \u2019s ] mindset according to the situation .

She has interfered with [ the child \u2019s ] right to freedom of movement and to choose her place of residence , and her right to free entry to her homeland , GPE . Thereby the mother has breached the rights guaranteed by the ORG in the framework of Conventions on Human Rights , including the Convention on the Rights of the ORG . The mother , unbeknownst to the father , the court or [ the custody and guardianship authority ] and without their consent in contravention of the legal order of GPE , applied to NORP administrative authorities to grant [ the child ] , a national of GPE , NORP citizenship , on the basis of which in a record - breaking short term of DATE the latter was granted NORP citizenship .", "...", "Regarding the father \u2019s claim for termination of the mother \u2019s parental rights , the court has decided to dismiss it [ since termination of parental rights is the most serious interference in relations between parents and children , when the violation of GPE duties is so serious that the termination of parental rights is the only possible solution to protect the interests of the child ] .
