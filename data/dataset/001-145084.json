The applicants are the publication director and the publisher respectively of the DATE magazine ORG . PERSON ORG is a NORP national and was born in DATE . The company LOC , a legal entity incorporated under NORP law , has its registered office in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP newspaper ORG published claims by PERSON , alleging that PERSON , reigning Prince of GPE since his father \u2019s death on DATE , was the father of her son . The article referred to the forthcoming report in ORG magazine and reproduced the main points of that report , together with CARDINAL photographs , CARDINAL of which showed the Prince holding the child in his arms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having been informed that an article was about to appear in GPE Match , PERSON served notice on the applicants to refrain from publishing the article in question .", "CARDINAL . In spite of the notice to refrain , the DATE magazine ORG , in its edition no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL copies of which were printed , published an interview in which PERSON presented her son A. as having been born from her intimate relationship with the Prince , who had succeeded his father on DATE . PERSON on the magazine \u2019s cover under the headline \u201c PERSON of GPE : A. , the secret child \u201d ( \u201c PERSON : A. , l\u2019enfant secret \u201d ) the CARDINAL - page article , entitled \u201c A. is PERSON \u2019s son , says his mother \u201d , included several photographs showing the Prince beside PERSON or the child . Those of the Prince and the child had been taken by PERSON with the Prince \u2019s consent . PERSON , who had sole parental authority , had handed them over to ORG for publication .", "CARDINAL . The article , in which PERSON to the questions put by a journalist , gave details about the circumstances in which she had met the Prince , their meetings , their intimate relationship and feelings , the way in which the Prince had reacted to the news of PERSON pregnancy and how he had behaved on meeting the child . It noted that the boy had been born on DATE and that the Prince had formally recognised him before a notary on DATE , but had requested that this fact should not be made public before the death of his own father , Prince PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prince brought proceedings against the applicants in the PERSON tribunal de grande instance on the basis of LAW , seeking compensation for invasion of privacy and infringement of his right to protection of his image through the publication of the above - mentioned article on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court allowed the Prince \u2019s claim , awarding him MONEY in damages and ordering that details of the judgment be printed in a full - page feature on the magazine \u2019s front page , on pain of a DATE fine and at the publisher \u2019s expense , under the headline \u201c Court order made against ORG at the request of Prince PERSON of GPE \u201d . The judgment was immediately enforceable .", "CARDINAL . NORP In allowing the Prince \u2019s claims , the court noted , in particular , that from the first page onwards , the magazine disclosed the Prince \u2019s paternity through the headline \u201c PERSON of GPE : A. , the secret child \u201d , accompanied by a photograph showing him holding the child .", "It added that the CARDINAL - page article dealt with the issue of the Prince \u2019s father - son relationship with the child , by means of questions which led the child \u2019s mother to discuss her relationship with the Prince , the feelings of those involved , the GPE \u2019s private life and reactions and the child \u2019s recognition child before a notary . It added that numerous photographs , clearly taken in the context of the intimacy of the ORG private life , had been deliberately chosen to illustrate and lend support to the disclosure ; they were accompanied by the magazine \u2019s own captions , which also referred to the PERSON \u2019s emotional life , analysing his conduct , his reactions to the young woman and the child , and speculating as to his feelings with regard to this secret child .", "The court considered that the entire article and the accompanying pictures came within the most intimate sphere of emotional and family life and that they were not apt to be the subject of any debate of general interest .", "It added that the claimant \u2019s accession to the throne of the Principality of GPE did not deprive him of the right to respect for his private life , nor of his right to protection of his own image in the face of mere rumours concerning the civil status of a child , which could not serve as a legitimate pretext for providing information to a prying and curious public about the lives of public figures , their feelings and their private conduct . In addition , the court held that a newspaper could not seriously claim to take the place of the courtroom , where the rights of children and women were lawfully defended .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that the impugned article , which treated rumours in a sensational manner , both in its wording and through the completely irrelevant accompanying pictures , amounted to a serious breach of the claimant \u2019s fundamental personality rights , the latter having specifically served notice by a bailiff on the publishing company to respect those rights on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment and obtained a suspension of the judgment \u2019s immediate enforceability .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prince issued a statement in which he publicly recognised the child . The notarised document was entered in the register of births , deaths and marriages during the same period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment .", "CARDINAL . It noted that , through the interview with the child \u2019s mother , the impugned article focused on revealing the birth of the child , who was presented as having been born from the intimate relationship she had conducted with the Prince since DATE .", "Furthermore , on DATE of the article \u2019s publication , both his birth and his father \u2019s identity were unknown to the public .", "CARDINAL . The court of appeal emphasised that emotional , love or family life and issues of paternity and maternity came within the sphere of private life and were protected by LAW and LAW , which , according to the court , made no distinction between anonymous persons and public figures , whatever their civil , political or religious functions .", "It noted that the fact of the Prince \u2019s fatherhood \u201c had never been publicly recognised \u201d , that LAW made it impossible for a child born outside wedlock to accede to the throne and that the Prince had not given his consent to the disclosure of his possible paternity of the child , having on CARDINAL DATE indicated to the applicant company his opposition to the publication of those facts . In consequence , it concluded that the applicant company had deliberately breached the provisions of LAW and of LAW . It considered that this offence could not be justified by the requirements of current affairs reporting , the legitimacy of the information or readers\u2019 right to information , which did not cover the Prince \u2019s secret paternity , even if he had become the reigning Prince of the ORG since his father \u2019s death in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court of appeal further noted that the article did not merely disclose the existence of a \u201c secret \u201d child . It also contained numerous digressions derived from the confessions made by the child \u2019s mother , concerning the circumstances of their meeting , the Prince \u2019s feelings , his most intimate reactions in response to the news of the pregnancy and his attitude towards the child during private encounters . It considered that this could not be justified by the concomitant publication of these facts in a NORP magazine , or by the media impact caused by the content of the article , or by the fact that other publications had subsequently repeated these reports ( which had become common knowledge through the fault of the publishing company ) , or by the alleged legitimacy of such a disclosure . The child had no official status which would have rendered his birth and the disclosure of the father \u2019s identify a subject which the media , as part of their duty to provide information , were required to bring to the public \u2019s attention .", "It found that although the photographs which accompanied the article and showed the respondent with the child had been taken by the latter \u2019s mother and with the Prince \u2019s consent , he had not consented to their publication , and that consequently she was at fault .", "CARDINAL . The court of appeal concluded that the publication in question had caused the Prince irreversible damage , in that the fact that he was the child \u2019s father , which he had wished to keep secret , and which had remained so from the child \u2019s birth until publication of the impugned article , had suddenly become public knowledge , against his wishes . The non - pecuniary damage thus caused justified the issuing of an order for publication , as supplementary compensation , which , in view of the nature of the breach and the seriousness of its consequences , was in no way disproportionate to the competing interests and , on the contrary , represented the most adequate redress in such circumstances .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the contested judgement , in particular the payment of MONEY in damages , and merely varied the conditions of the order for publication , which was no longer to appear under a headline and occupy CARDINAL third of the front cover . Thus , the court ordered that in the first issue to be published in DATE following service of the judgment , a box covering the lower third of the front page and containing the following text was to be printed on a white background , failing which the applicant company would be fined CARDINAL per issue :", "\u201c By a judgment of ORG , upholding the judgment delivered by the PERSON tribunal de grande instance , the company ORG in issue no . CARDINAL , dated CARDINAL DATE , of the newspaper ORG , in an article entitled \u2018 PERSON of GPE : A. The secret ORG has been found to have invaded the privacy and infringed the right to his own image of PERSON of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This statement was published on the front cover of edition no . CARDINAL of the magazine , dated DATE , under the following editorial commentary : \u201c PERSON of GPE : The truth is condemned . ORG disclosed the existence of his son , A. The courts have penalised freedom to impart information . The international press reacts to support us . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law . In their further pleadings , they relied , in particular , on LAW , given that the disclosure of the Prince \u2019s paternity was a matter of public life and was justified by the requirements of imparting information , in view of the functions that he occupied as sovereign of a ORG with a hereditary monarchy .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal on the grounds , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... every person , whatever his rank , birth , property or present or future functions , is entitled to respect for his private life ; the judgment notes on the one hand that , on the date on which the article was published , the child \u2019s existence and his family relationship were unknown to the public , and that , on the other , the ORG \u2019s LAW rules out the possibility of his accession to the throne , since he was born outside wedlock , a situation that , moreover , the company did not allege to be a subject of debate in LANGUAGE or Monegasque society or of examination in the impugned publication , and , lastly , [ that ] the article contained multiple digressions on the circumstances in which PERSON and PERSON met and about their relationship , the Prince \u2019s reactions to the news of the pregnancy and his subsequent attitude towards the child ; in the light of these findings and considerations , the court of appeal correctly noted the lack of any topical news item or any debate on a matter of general interest which justified its being reported at the time of the impugned publication on the grounds of legitimate imparting of information to the public ; moreover , the publication of photographs of a person to illustrate subsequent content which amounted to an invasion of his privacy necessarily infringes his right to control of one \u2019s own image . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The interview with PERSON and the disputed photographs were also published in the NORP DATE magazine ORG CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having brought urgent proceedings against this magazine in order to prevent any further publication , the Prince \u2019s case was dismissed on DATE by a judgment of ORG ( ORG ) , upheld on DATE by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) .", "CARDINAL . The NORP courts placed the public \u2019s right to information over the PERSON \u2019s interests in protection of his private life , having regard to his status as sovereign of a NORP principality . They described him as an \u201c undeniable figure of contemporary society \u201d and considered that the issue of a male descendent was of decisive importance in a constitutional hereditary monarchy , given that a change to the rule prohibiting a child born out of wedlock from claiming the Monegasque throne could not be ruled out in the future .", "CARDINAL . They considered that it was for the child \u2019s mother , and not for the Prince , who had not recognised him , to decide whether the disclosure of the child \u2019s existence fell within the protected private sphere . However , ORG ordered that a photograph showing the Prince in PERSON \u2019s company was not to be published ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
