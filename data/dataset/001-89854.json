The applicant was detained on DATE and was charged with aiding and abetting another individual to commit murder and attempted murder on DATE , DATE the applicant had been in the car of the victim when the latter and his wife had been shot and was a close relative of the alleged murderer . The applicant was placed in pre - trial detention on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on CARDINAL DATE and a restriction was placed on him not to leave his place of residence without the authorisation of the public prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP regional public prosecutor \u2019s office terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant as unproven and lifted the restriction on his movement .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was detained at ORG detention facility .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that at this detention facility there had been ( a ) overcrowding , as he had been accommodated in a cell with another CARDINAL detainees , ( b ) insufficient oxygen in the cell , ( c ) inadequate hygiene , as he had had no access to a toilet and all QUANTITY detainees had had to drink from the same water container , ( d ) insufficient food , ( e ) no possibility for visits by friends or relatives , and ( f ) no access to newspapers or other media . He also claimed that as a result of having been detained in such conditions his selfesteem had declined and he had endured physical and psychological suffering .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant initiated a civil action for damages against ORG under LAW DATE ( the \u201c ORG \u201d : renamed in DATE ) . He claimed that he had been charged with an offence which he had not committed , that on DATE he had been detained for DATE and that a restriction had then been placed on his movement for DATE . The applicant also argued that he had had to endure physical and mental pain and suffering as a result of the unlawful criminal proceedings against him and the inadequate conditions of detention at ORG detention facility . In addition , because of the prolonged restriction on his movement he claimed to have suffered loss of income as he had been unable to accept a job in GPE . The applicant sought MONEY ( ORG : MONEY ( ORG ) ) in compensation of which ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) represented compensation for pecuniary damage and ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) represented compensation for nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG found in favour of the applicant and ordered ORG to pay him BGN CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) . This represented compensation for the non - pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant as a result of the unlawful acts and actions of the public prosecutor \u2019s office during the period from DATE to DATE in charging him with aiding and abetting another individual to commit murder , holding him in pre - trial detention and then replacing it with a restriction not to leave his place of residence without the authorisation of the public prosecutor \u2019s office . In reaching its decision , ORG took into account the fact that the criminal proceedings and the associated restrictions imposed on the liberty and movement of the applicant had lasted for DATE , which it found had caused him suffering and had brought about the break - up of his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e . The court further found that he had been detained in \u201c extremely harsh conditions \u201d at ORG detention facility , which it considered to have caused him physical and mental pain and suffering and to have had a negative effect on his dignity as he had been held in an overcrowded cell with another CARDINAL individuals , without access to a toilet , bathing or any other facilities in order to maintain even basic hygiene , had been given food only once a day , had not been allowed visits by friends or relatives and had had no access to newspapers or any other media . ORG also took note of a report by the paramedic at the said detention facility that the applicant had been healthy at the time of his arrival there , but had then developed an inflammation of the sciatic nerve accompanied by pain in the pelvis area and down the left leg . Lastly , the court found that the applicant \u2019s reputation had been damaged as a result of having been unlawfully held in pre - trial detention and having had criminal proceedings initiated against him . ORG dismissed as unsubstantiated the remainder of the claims in respect of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage and , by applying section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG , ordered the applicant to pay court fees of PERCENT on the dismissed part of his claim , which amounted to ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the NORP regional public prosecutor \u2019s office appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG reached similar conclusions on the facts of the case . It also found that the applicant had had a good reputation and no criminal record and that the criminal proceedings against him , his arrest and detention in inadequate conditions and the restriction on his movement had damaged his reputation and had caused him pain and suffering . Nevertheless , ORG considered the amount awarded to be excessive and lowered the compensation for non - pecuniary damage to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . It upheld the remainder of the judgment of ORG and ordered the applicant to pay MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL ) in court fees , proportionate to the additionally dismissed part of his claim .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG found that cells were often overcrowded DATE CARDINAL persons in cells measuring QUANTITY The cramped conditions were aggravated by the lack of direct access to natural light , poor artificial lighting and the absence of a differentiated day / night system , and inadequate ventilation . Further , the cells were in a poor state of hygiene and repair : the beds were dilapidated and in a bad state of repair , giving a very uneven base for the thin , tattered mattresses , and the blankets which were filthy . Similar to the reports cited above ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG recommended that cell occupancy rates be reduced to an acceptable level by applying a minimum standard of QUANTITY per detainee in multiple - occupancy cells .", "CARDINAL .

Further , the general medical screening was cursory and did not identify detained persons\u2019 health needs . Access to outside hospital facilities was in principle not a problem , but authorisation was needed from a prosecutor for such a transfer , and medical recommendations could be slowed down or overridden by legal considerations ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
