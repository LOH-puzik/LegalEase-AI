GPE had a lease in respect of this flat . On DATE GPE died and her tenancy expired .", "Subsequently , GPE moved to GPE to live with his sister , GPE", "On DATE , in accordance with the housing law of DATE , the applicant lodged a motion with ORG for PERSON ( PERSON ) to take over the tenancy of the flat where her grandmother had lived . In a letter of DATE , ORG informed the applicant that she could only enter into such a contract on the basis of a judicial decision .", "On DATE PERSON lodged a motion with ORG for a declaration of her brother \u2019s GPE \u2019s legal incapacity . On DATE GPE , represented by his sister PERSON , lodged a claim with ORG , seeking a declaration that he had succeeded to the tenancy agreement between his mother and the municipality , and thus acquiring the tenant \u2019s rights and obligations in the flat .", "On DATE the applicant , represented by her lawyer , lodged a claim with the ORG seeking a similar declaration to her benefit . In her claim , the applicant indicated her current address where she had permanent registration as an inhabitant .", "On DATE the ORG summoned the applicant to appear at the hearing to be held in her civil case on DATE . The summons was sent to the applicant \u2019s correct address .", "On DATE she was summoned as a witness to attend the hearing on DATE in the case brought by GPE This time the summons was sent to the address of the applicant \u2019s parents where she had not lived .", "On DATE a hearing in the case of the applicant \u2019s uncle was held . On CARDINAL and DATE ORG sent CARDINAL identical letters , which included a copy of the court \u2019s decision of DATE and a summons to attend the hearing to be held on DATE . Again , the summonses were sent by the registered letter to the wrong address . The letters were returned to the court with the notes that they had not been delivered to the applicant .", "On DATE a hearing in the applicant \u2019s case was held . It lasted TIME . The court informed the applicant that the cases would be joined . The applicant was not given an opportunity to address the court .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the cases be joined . This order , along with a summons indicating the date of the hearing of DATE , was subsequently sent to the applicant in a registered letter , with an acknowledgment of receipt , to CARDINAL addresses . She received CARDINAL of them at her permanent address and acknowledged it on DATE . An identical letter was delivered to her lawyer on DATE .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim and held that GPE succeeded to the tenancy agreement between his mother and the municipality . Neither the applicant nor her lawyer had attended the hearing .", "The applicant appealed . She contended that the proceedings were null and void as neither the applicant nor her lawyer had been informed of , or summoned to , the hearing on DATE . Accordingly , her interests could not have been presented and protected properly . She had only been correctly informed about the order of the ORG of DATE .", "In the meantime , by virtue of a decision of ORG of DATE , ORG had been legally incapacitated . His tutor was appointed on DATE .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "The court held inter alia as follows :", "\u201c Contrary to the applicant \u2019s allegations , no procedural shortcomings on the part of the first - instance court were found . As it transpires from the documents enclosed with the case file no I C CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( case of PERSON v. GPE concerning the establishment of a tenancy of a flat ) , at the hearing of DATE both the applicant and her lawyer were informed that the proceedings concerning the establishment of a tenancy of the same flat instituted by GPE were already pending and that both cases would be joined . In fact , the court \u2019s joinder order issued on DATE , together with a summons for the hearing of DATE , was delivered both to the applicant and her lawyer .", "This order , together with the summons indicating the date of the hearing , was sent to the address of the apartment in dispute in PERSON at CARDINAL FAC , which the applicant had declared as her residence . As could be seen from the note made by the postman , due to the fact that the applicant had not collected the letter at the declared address , the letter remained at the post office on DATE and was finally collected by a person called Sopotnicka on DATE . Therefore , the court found unreasonable the applicant \u2019s argument it had been another person , not herself , who had collected that document .", "An identical joinder order , together with the summons indicating the date of the hearing of DATE , was delivered to the office of the applicant \u2019s lawyer , PERSON , in PERSON at CARDINAL FAC , and its delivery was confirmed by the office \u2019s stamp and the signature of its employee . The court , therefore , considers unreasonable the argument of the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the signature was made by an employee who was not authorised to receive documents , especially in the light of the fact that the same signature was made on the acknowledgment of receipt of a summons giving notice of the appellate hearing , and that receipt , in particular its validity , has not been contested by counsel . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant , represented by her lawyer , lodged a cassation appeal with ORG . She submitted that , in the letter of DATE , she had only been informed that ORG had ordered the joinder of both cases , without any information concerning the hearings .", "She stressed the fact , which could be seen in the case - file , that on DATE the ORG sent CARDINAL identical letters , which included a copy of the court \u2019s decision of DATE and a summons to attend the hearing to be held on DATE , to the wrong address \u2013 that of her parents , where she had not lived . The letters were returned to the court with the notes that they had not been delivered to the applicant . Moreover , the court , being aware of this mistake , had failed to inform the applicant by sending the summons to the correct address which was indicated by the post office . Furthermore , the applicant was not cited in these letters as a plaintiff , but only as a witness . The applicant argued that by the letter of DATE , delivered on DATE , her lawyer had only been informed about the court \u2019s order to join the cases without being summoned to the hearings . Therefore , the applicant asked to have the case remitted to the second instance court .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded . The court upheld the conclusions of the second - instance court in respect of the service of the summonses . The court held inter alia as follows :", "\u201c The applicant \u2019s complaints are focused on the statement that neither she nor her lawyer were duly summoned to the hearing held before ORG on DATE , and that , consequently , they did not have any possibility of asking the court to admit evidence which ORG should have taken .", "That argument is unfounded . ORG , on the basis of the acknowledgments of receipt of the summonses , established that the applicant PERSON and her lawyer had been duly summoned to the hearing held before ORG on DATE and informed about the court \u2019s joinder order . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
