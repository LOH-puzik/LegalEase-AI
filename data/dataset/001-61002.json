THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a GPE national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He has been a practising lawyer ( advocaat ) since DATE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , the applicant agreed to act as defence counsel for a PERSON in criminal proceedings brought against the latter . At that time , PERSON was in pre - trial detention . In connection with this case , the applicant met several times with PERSON , who at that time was Mr PERSON 's wife .", "CARDINAL . At some point PERSON told PERSON that on DATE the applicant had made sexual advances towards her . PERSON informed the police officer investigating his case , Officer PERSON , of this , who in turn informed the public prosecutor in charge of the investigation against Mr K. , Public Prosecutor T. The latter gave instructions that a criminal complaint against the applicant should be filed with the vice squad . On this basis , Officer PERSON contacted both PERSON and Officer NORP of the vice squad .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was initially reluctant to lodge a criminal complaint against the applicant as she feared that her word \u2013 the only evidence available \u2013 would be insufficient against that of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Following discussions between Officers NORP and PERSON of the vice squad and Public Prosecutor T. , the suggestion was made to PERSON to connect a tape recorder to her telephone in order to allow her to tape incoming conversations with the applicant . Police officers subsequently connected a cassette tape recorder to PERSON telephone in her home and suggested that she steer her conversations with the applicant towards the latter 's advances . PERSON was shown how to operate the device . The police came to her home twice in order to collect the recordings and load new cassette tapes into the tape recorder .", "CARDINAL . PERSON recorded CARDINAL conversations with the applicant , which were transcribed by the police . These transcripts were added to the case - file on the investigation against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The case was reported in the press . This induced CARDINAL other women to come forward and lodge criminal complaints against the applicant : CARDINAL PERSON , who claimed to have been raped and sexually assaulted by the applicant , and one PERSON , who also complained that she had been sexually assaulted by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently summoned to appear on DATE before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE on charges of sexual assault and rape .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings in the course of which a hearing was held on DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of having sexually assaulted PERSON and PERSON , and acquitted him of the charges brought in respect of PERSON sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment , DATE of which were suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the public prosecutor lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE , convicted the applicant of having sexually assaulted PERSON and PERSON and acquitted him of the charges in respect of PERSON It sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment , suspended for DATE , and a fine of MONEY . It based the applicant 's conviction on statements taken from the applicant , PERSON , Mrs C. and CARDINAL other persons . The recorded telephone conversations were not relied on as evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's subsequent appeal on points of law was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In so far as is relevant to the case before the ORG , the applicant complained under inter alia LAW that ORG had wrongly rejected his argument that the prosecution should be declared inadmissible or that evidence had been unlawfully obtained in respect of the recordings made of his telephone conversations with PERSON ORG dismissed this complaint in the following terms :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . It is ... correctly assumed in the grounds of appeal on points of law that no interference by any public authority is permitted in the exercise of the right to ' respect for his private life and his correspondence ' guaranteed by LAW unless , and to the extent , provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . What is decisive in the instant case is therefore the answer to the question whether , noting the part played by the police in the recording of the telephone conversations that PERSON has had with the suspect , there has been an interference by the police in the exercise of the right of the accused to ' respect for his private life and his correspondence ' .", "CARDINAL . Against the background of the facts and circumstances ... the finding of ORG that the police has not acted in such a directive manner \u2013 in which finding ORG apparently had in mind the entire part played by the police in the recording of the telephone conversations by DATE that there has been an interference by any public authority within the meaning of LAW is not incomprehensible , and furthermore it does not reflect an incorrect understanding of the law , in particular , not as regards the contents of that provision of the Convention ...", "After all , [ the case ] concerns in essence a ( female ) victim of a sexual offence , this woman not having any other prima facie evidence than her own account and to whom the police has given information about a possibility for her to obtain additional proof and to whom and to this end the police has subsequently provided practical ( technical ) aid for performing certain acts \u2013 the recording , in her own home and in the absence of the police and with the aid of a device connected by the police to her own telephone line , of an incoming telephone conversation which the perpetrator conducts with her DATE , which act does not , for that woman , she being a party to the telephone conversation recorded , constitute an act prohibited by law .", "Nor does the finding that the circumstance that the suspect in his capacity of practising lawyer has a ' privileged status ' is not relevant in this matter reflect an incorrect understanding of the law . On the above grounds , ORG could conclude that this was not a situation referred to in LAW . The findings of ORG are sufficiently reasoned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , Articles CARDINALf - h of LAW ( Wetboek van Strafvordering ) provided as follows :", "Article CARDINALf", "\u201c CARDINAL . In case of discovery in flagrante delicto of a criminal offence in respect of which detention on remand is permitted , or of the criminal offence referred to in Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) < i.e. bugging and the unlawful interception of communications by computer > , any person employed by the holder of the concession referred to in LAW , first paragraph , of LAW ( Wet op de telecommunicatievoorzieningen ) ( ... ) shall , when so required , provide to ORG , or during the preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) , to the investigating judge , all desired information concerning all traffic not intended for the public that has taken place through the telecommunication infrastructure and in respect of which there is a presumption that the person suspected of the offence has taken part in it .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL \u2013 CARDINAL shall apply by analogy . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL g", "\u201c During the preliminary judicial investigation the investigating judge is empowered , if the investigation urgently so requires and if it concerns a criminal offence in respect of which detention on remand is permitted , to determine that data traffic through the telecommunications infrastructure that is not intended for the public , and in respect of which there is a presumption that the person suspected of the offence is taking part in it , shall be tapped or recorded by an officer with powers of investigation ( opsporingsambtenaar ) . An official record of the tapping or the recording shall be made within TIME . \u201d", "Article ORG", "\u201c CARDINAL . The investigating judge shall order the destruction in his presence , as soon as possible , of the official records and other objects from which information can be derived that he has obtained as a result of the information referred to in Article CARDINALf , or that has been obtained by tapping as referred to in the preceding Article , and which is of no importance to the investigation . An official record of the tapping or the recording shall be made without delay .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigating judge shall , in the same way , order the destruction without delay of official records and other objects as referred to in the previous paragraph in so far as they relate to statements made by or to a person who , pursuant to LAW , would be able to decline to give evidence if he were questioned as a witness as to the content of those statements .", "CARDINAL . The investigating judge shall add the other official records and other objects as referred to in the first paragraph to the case - file no later than the moment at which the decision to close the preliminary judicial investigation becomes final .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor shall order the destruction in his presence of the official records or other objects from which information can be derived that he has obtained as a result of the information referred to in LAW , if he does not seek the opening of a preliminary judicial investigation within DATE after obtaining that information . He shall make an official record of the destruction . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , which is referred to in the provisions quoted above , provides as follows :", "\u201c Persons who , by virtue of their position , their profession or their office , are bound to secrecy may ... decline to give evidence or to answer particular questions , but only in relation to matters the knowledge of which is entrusted to them in that capacity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Guidelines for the Interception of Telephone Conversations ( PERSON ) of DATE , a copy of which could be obtained by any interested person , set out the way in which the power to intercept telephone conversations was to be exercised in practice . These Guidelines , which were in the nature of published policy and official instructions rather than \u201c law \u201d , were issued in the form of a circular letter from the senior public prosecutors to the police . The model of this circular letter was published in , inter alia , ORG ( Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Mensenrechten ) of DATE , pages CARDINAL and following . According to these Guidelines , the procedure to be followed was this :", "CARDINAL . The interception and recording of telephone conversations should be considered only if it could lead to the detection of crimes which , in view of their nature or frequency or the organised context in which they were committed , constituted a serious interference with the legal order . It should be limited to those cases in which the aim pursued could not reasonably be achieved otherwise .", "CARDINAL . A police officer in charge of an investigation who considered such a measure indicated was , after consulting his commanding officer , to discuss the matter with the public prosecutor . The latter , if he agreed with the police officer , was to discuss it with the investigating judge . If the public prosecutor decided that the measure was necessary , the police officer in charge of the investigation was to provide certain necessary factual information in the form of a written report . The public prosecutor would then submit this report to the investigating judge and ask for permission in writing to proceed with the measure .", "CARDINAL . An official record was to be made of all interceptions , even if they yielded nothing useful , within TIME . Any recordings , transcripts or documents were to be kept in such a way that they were not accessible to persons not involved in the case . The tapes , with a final report , should be submitted to the investigating judge , with an indication of the number of copies still in the hands of the police . If the investigating judge decided that any part of the recordings or transcripts was to be destroyed , the copies too should be handed to him for that purpose .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINALf - h of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were repealed by LAW of DATE , Staatsblad ( Official Gazette ) DATE , no . CARDINAL , with effect from DATE . It is now provided that the public prosecutor may order the recording of telecommunications if the investigation urgently so requires ; if the criminal offence concerned is CARDINAL in respect of which detention on remand is permitted ; and which , in view of its nature or its connection with other criminal acts committed by the suspect , the criminal offence concerned constitutes a serious interference with the legal order ( LAW ) .
