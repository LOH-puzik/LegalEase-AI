While Mr. PERSON was head of the treasury department , his father , who had been a regional government member responsible for finance until DATE , was also on the bank \u2019s supervisory board .

On DATE the ORG filed criminal information ( PERSON ) about offences committed in relation to the business of ORG against the CARDINAL members of the executive board and PERSON , accusing them of embezzlement by investing money entrusted to the bank contrary to the instructions of the executive board . In substance , the ORG alleged that Mr PERSON had authorised highly speculative transactions with foreign currency derivatives ( swaps ) , disregarding instructions by the executive board .", "CARDINAL . In its issue of DATE , the applicant company published an article on the investigations into the heavy losses incurred by ORG . The front cover of ORG had the words : \u201c PERSON \u2013 PERSON \u201d ( \u201c Carinthian Hypo affair - How much did PERSON know ? \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The article , headlined \u201c Schwere GPE \u201d ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , ran to CARDINAL pages . It reported on the enormous loss of ORG CARDINAL incurred by ORG in DATE , the question of who was responsible for the damage and whether there were failings in the bank \u2019s risk management . It accused the bank \u2019s executive board of failing to give information to the supervisory board , the bank \u2019s accountants and the ORG , and of trying instead to hush up the losses by manipulating the balance sheets for DATE , which meant that the full extent of the damage was only discovered by external accountants when examining the balance sheets for DATE . The accountants had then informed the FMA . Furthermore , the article featured an interview with Mr PERSON , confronting him with those accusations . Mr PERSON was quoted as accusing Mr PERSON of having disregarded internal guidelines in his foreign currency transactions .", "The relevant passages of the article read as follows :", "\u201c By the time the warning system was triggered the disaster had long since run its course . On DATE the risk management and control software programme in the head offices of ORG in GPE showed , in all the relevant departments of the bank , exactly the kind of figures which bring managers of credit institutions out in a cold sweat : staggering losses on investment operations . In the treasury division , which manages the bank \u2019s liquidity and for that purpose trades , among other things , in interest rates and currencies , there was a shortfall of MONEY . \u2018 At that point we immediately called a ORG said CEO PERSON . However , as several similar operations were in progress simultaneously , it was impossible \u2018 to close the floodgates at once\u2019 . When that was eventually done , the losses stood at MONEY , several times higher than the self - imposed threshold of CARDINAL .", "ORG manager PERSON , who was responsible for authorising the transactions , was immediately told to clear his desk . ( This son of the former ORG regional finance chief PERSON was not available for comment ) . However , the consequences of the orgy of speculation , which lasted DATE , continue to preoccupy the bank \u2019s management . And they are not the only ones : in particular , the manner in which PERSON and his colleagues dealt with the loss - making transactions has also come to the attention of the authorities in DATE . DATE the financial markets supervisory authority ( the FMA ) even saw fit to lodge a criminal complaint against the entire executive board .

After all , high stakes mean correspondingly high profits if all goes according to plan . A marked surplus on his account would undoubtedly have boosted his chances of securing the post . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article continued with an overview of the history of ORG , which had gone from being a regional bank to an international investment bank in the space of DATE . The article looked at previous business transactions which had resulted in risks and losses for the bank and the conduct of the executive board . Finally , the article examined the relationship between the bank \u2019s management and local politicians and asked how much Mr PERSON , the then regional governor of PERSON , knew of the losses , and when he had found out about them . It noted that the Land of PERSON owned PERCENT of the bank and that funds from the bank had financed a number of political projects in the region , in particular Mr PERSON \u2019s Future Fund ( GPE ) , designed to fund infrastructure and other large - scale projects .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Rauscher brought proceedings against the applicant company for disclosing his identity in breach of section CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) . He submitted that he was not a public figure and that his position at the bank had not been such as to justify the disclosure of his name . He asserted that when authorising the transactions at issue he had acted in accordance with his instructions and with the approval of his superiors . The publication of his name had had negative repercussions on his professional advancement and had not been justified by any public interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) dismissed Mr PERSON \u2019s action . It found that the following facts had been established : the article had provided a comprehensive report on the losses of ORG . At the time the article had been published , ORG had owned PERCENT of the bank . The claimant \u2019s father had been a regional government member responsible for finances and had also been on the bank \u2019s supervisory board until DATE . The claimant had been the head of the bank \u2019s treasury department since DATE . He had not been active in politics nor had he been in the public eye in connection with his professional activity . ORG noted that the task of a bank \u2019s treasury department was to carry out liquidity and finance planning for the bank . PERSON treasury department had been directly answerable to the executive board . The transactions which had subsequently led to such enormous losses had been carried out DATE and DATE and the claimant had been the main person in charge . On DATE the FMA had sent information to the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office on CARDINAL members of the executive board , who were suspected of manipulating the bank \u2019s balance sheets , and on the claimant who was suspected of embezzlement for carrying out unauthorised foreign currency transactions . Following receipt of that information the public prosecutor \u2019s office had started preliminary enquiries . From DATE preliminary investigations ( Voruntersuchung ) had been conducted by ORG . Criminal proceedings against the claimant had been discontinued in DATE . After accusations against the claimant had been published in various media , his employment contract had been terminated . He had not been able to find a similar position in another bank .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that section ORG ( CARDINAL ) of LAW required a weighing of the claimant \u2019s interest in the protection of his identity and the public interest in its disclosure . As a rule , adults who were suspected of having committed a crime were only protected against the disclosure of their identity if such disclosure disproportionately affected their professional advancement .", "CARDINAL . It observed that at the material time the Land of LOC owned PERCENT of ORG . That fact alone demonstrated an increased public interest as the taxpayer had a right to know who was responsible for the bank \u2019s losses . The applicant had been a senior employee at the bank , and had been suspected of embezzlement . Although the criminal proceedings had still been at an early stage , ORG , the competent controlling authority , had laid criminal information against the claimant . Moreover , the chief executive of the bank , Mr PERSON , had levelled of obtaining information outweighed the claimant \u2019s interest in not having his name disclosed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) granted an appeal by the claimant , declared that the disclosure of his identity in the article had violated his rights and ordered the applicant company to pay him ORG MONEY in compensation and to reimburse his procedural costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that ORG conclusion had been wrong after it had weighed the conflicting interests at issue . It shared the view of ORG that there was a public interest in knowing who was responsible for ORG losses due to the fact that the Land owned PERCENT of the bank . However , the article should have confined itself to mentioning the head of the bank \u2019s treasury department without disclosing his name . The public interest in reporting on the criminal offences at issue had not in itself been sufficient to justify disclosing the claimant \u2019s identity . The fact that the claimant had been answerable to the executive board , although he had an important position in the bank , and that the criminal proceedings against him had been at an early stage , meant that the claimant \u2019s interest in protecting his identity outweighed the public interest in the disclosure of his name .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged an application under LAW of LAW ( GPE ) with ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) . It submitted in particular that ORG judgment had violated LAW as there had been an overriding public interest in what it had reported , including the disclosure of PERSON identity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s application . It examined in detail the reasons given by ORG . Referring to the ORG \u2019s findings in \u201c ORG \u201d ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , ORG found that the appeal court had correctly weighed the conflicting interests of the claimant under LAW one hand and of the applicant company under LAW other , especially because of the early stage of the criminal proceedings against the claimant .", "CARDINAL .
