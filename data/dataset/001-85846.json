FRANCE [Extracts]", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and live in FAC and GPE respectively . They were represented before the ORG by Mr Bigot , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are doctors . At the material time , although they remained registered with ORG ( ordre des m\u00e9decins ) for the city of GPE , they were not practising medicine but were working as journalists for \u201c Sciences et Avenir \u201d , a DATE science magazine for the general public of which they were the editor - in - chief and deputy editor .", "Issue number CARDINAL of the magazine , published in DATE , was entitled \u201c Hospitals , DATE edition \u201d with the following coverlines : \u201c League - table of CARDINAL NORP hospitals \u201d , \u201c Best results : the top CARDINAL facilities \u201d , \u201c Blacklist of problem hospitals \u201d and \u201c Exclusive : mortality in your hospital \u201d .", "It was stated in the magazine that this special issue had been produced by the applicants , without their status as doctors being mentioned , and by a third journalist who was not a doctor . Its contents included a league - table of the CARDINAL best and CARDINAL worst hospitals in CARDINAL specialist fields . They were ranked according to CARDINAL criteria : their activity , based on health - establishment data from the ORG ( medicalised information system programme ) ; mortality , assessed by reference to a national mortality indicator for patients in the same age bracket and with similar medical conditions ; and notoriety , which was in fact measured by the attractiveness of the hospital for patients from outside the d\u00e9partement . The combination of these criteria produced an overall rating out of CARDINAL . Information letters and requests for explanations were also sent to the directors of hospitals where major shortcomings had been found .", "ORG ranked thirteenth in the list of the CARDINAL hospitals with the worst results in the field of digestive surgery , with an overall rating of CARDINAL out of CARDINAL and a mortality rate CARDINAL times higher than the norm .", "On DATE Doctor PERSON , head surgeon at FAC , lodged a complaint with the d\u00e9partement council ( conseil d\u00e9partemental ) of ORG for the city of GPE . He criticised the applicants for the highly inaccurate nature of their investigation , as a result of using inappropriate criteria , failing to take account of specificities related to the precise type of medical condition and not distinguishing between emergency and scheduled admissions . Moreover , in his opinion there had been no subsequent moderation , whether in the commentary or in the choice of persons interviewed . He thus considered that his reputation and that of his staff had been seriously impugned , all the more so because he was working in a small town . He lastly argued that the investigation , by casting doubt on the quality of this local - community medical facility , might lead to inappropriate attitudes on the part of patients , particularly in the event of an emergency .", "By a decision of DATE , the d\u00e9partement council referred the complaint to ORG regional council for ORG and requested to be joined to the proceedings on account of a breach of LAW and CARDINAL of LAW for medical practitioners . The rapporteur from the d\u00e9partement council made the following submissions in particular :", "\u201c Whilst the seriousness of the journalists ' work is not at issue , it does not appear upon reading the article that any disclaimer as to the limits of the methodology used has been clearly indicated .", "The headings of the articles and paragraphs and the comments inserted in the boxes add a sensationalist tone which turns a report into an indictment .", "Lastly , the possibilities for the criticised heads of department and hospital directors to defend themselves have been very limited .", "Generally - speaking , the specific case of ORG raises the issue of the limits to the transparency of medical information . In the long term such transparency is desirable , but in the short term the beneficial effects of selecting the most efficient services for patients may be counter - balanced by the negative repercussions of anxiety - provoking remarks for a section of the population that is limited in its choice of hospital treatment by age , geography or social situation .", "ORG and concern about the repercussions of remarks among members of the public , as required by LAW [ sic ] of LAW , do not seem to have guided the authors , who should have ensured that the limits to their work were made clear and , in such a sensitive area , should have avoided provocative headings . \u201d", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the regional medical council dismissed the applicants ' plea of inadmissibility , which had been based on the possibility of raising the defences available under LAW of DATE , and found as follows :", "\u201c Notwithstanding the existence of LAW of DATE , it is clear that everyone is free to use the means of his choosing to enforce his rights without such possibility being open to challenge . \u201d", "The regional council gave the CARDINAL applicants a warning ( avertissement ) based on the following reasoning :", "\u201c On the basis of data that could be regarded as objective , albeit open to debate and debated , Doctors PERSON and PERSON , by inserting crossheads , boxes and passages in italics , transformed an informative article into a sensationalist one ...", "By placing the unwritten ethics of journalists before those of doctors , which have been codified in a regulatory text , they crossed a boundary which must not be overstepped , especially as LAW for medical practitioners has the aim of protecting patients \u2013 a section of the population that is weak both physically and psychologically . It can not validly be argued that ORG and PERSON submitted their article to the magazine without concerning themselves with the publication or without being aware of the sensationalist additions designed at least to lure readers and perhaps to boost sales ; if that were the case , they failed in their obligation to verify the ultimate and potential use of their statements or the possible impact of those statements on the general public .", "In this connection it is ineffective to claim that , since they were not practising medicine , Doctors ORG and PERSON were not bound by the provisions of LAW for medical practitioners ; on the contrary , their voluntary registration with ORG shows their desire to abide by that Code , especially the provisions in the first section dealing with the general duties of doctors .", "After studying the material in the file and hearing representations from the parties , it appears that ORG and PERSON interpreted information to give it a sensationalist and derogatory character , thus causing damage , perhaps unintentionally , to the complainant Doctor PERSON and to his patients , which is even worse . In these circumstances it is appropriate , in order to reiterate the need for medical ethics , to impose a penalty in the form of a warning . \u201d", "The applicants , relying in particular on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the [ NORP ] Convention [ on Human Rights ] , then lodged an appeal with ORG .", "On DATE the disciplinary section of ORG dismissed a complaint by the applicants concerning the rapporteur 's participation in the deliberation of the regional council , finding that his duties were consonant with the principle of impartiality enshrined in LAW . The disciplinary section further found that the applicants had breached their duty of care when imparting information to the public , as provided for in LAW for medical practitioners :", "\u201c Doctors ORG and PERSON were , at the material time , respectively the editor - in - chief and deputy editor of the magazine ' Sciences et ORG ' , and it was in their capacity as journalists that they wrote the offending articles published in the DATE issue of that magazine . The fact that they were not practising medicine , that the acts were committed in the context of their work as journalists and that they did not invoke their status as doctors is not capable of precluding the application of LAW for medical practitioners , by which every doctor remains bound once he or she is registered with ORG . This fact obliges the disciplinary body , which has jurisdiction to rule on breaches by doctors of LAW for medical practitioners , only to reconcile the ethical duties of doctors with the requirements of the freedom of expression afforded to journalists . In that latter respect , whilst the first paragraph of LAW guarantees freedom to impart information and ideas , the second paragraph of that Article stipulates that the exercise of this freedom , carrying with it duties and responsibilities , may be subject to such restrictions or penalties as are necessary , in particular , for the protection of the reputation or rights of others ...", "... the right for doctors to inform the public about the quality of hospital services , even designated by name , and to give a critical assessment of some of them , can not be called into question , provided only that in presenting their analyses they do not breach the duty of care by which they are bound under the above - mentioned provisions of LAW . Whilst they set out the criteria by virtue of which they had drawn up a league - table of hospitals , they failed to take the precaution , which was all the more necessary as the publication was intended for the general public , of indicating the limits and the relative nature of a qualitative analysis based on data from the ORG ( medicalised information system programme ) , which they presented , by contrast , on page CARDINAL of the publication , as ' an outstanding tool with remarkable accuracy ' . Not only are the published results presented as unquestionable and scientifically established but they are also accompanied by comments and headings such as \u201c Its hospitals make GPE sick \u201d , \u201c Blacklist of problem hospitals \u201d , and \u201c underperforming facilities can be found virtually everywhere \u201d , the purpose of which is not to inform patients but to dramatise the information without any concern for the repercussions of this presentation on the patients who use services whose quality has been seriously impugned . Having regard to the applicants ' level of responsibility in the publication , they can not claim that they are mere employees working under the authority of the magazine 's management without any right of scrutiny in respect of the articles published , nor that the presentation of the facts , the headings and the comments are the work solely of the publication director and were not even tacitly approved by them ... \u201d", "The applicants then lodged an appeal on points of law with the ORG d'Etat . They submitted that the professional disciplinary bodies did not have jurisdiction in respect of doctors who were not practising medicine professionally . They further complained that they had been deprived of a fair hearing , within the meaning of LAW , as they had not been given prior knowledge of the rapporteur 's report to the CARDINAL professional bodies . They lastly observed that the application of LAW for medical practitioners to doctors not practising medicine , in respect of acts they committed while engaged in the activity of journalism , and without their status as doctor being invoked , constituted a mistake of law . They based that latter argument on the wording of LAW of LAW for medical practitioners , which referred only to \u201c participation in an educational and health - related action of public information \u201d and on the incompatibility between the guarantees attaching to the status of journalist under LAW of DATE and the rules of medical ethics .", "On DATE the ORG d'Etat dismissed the applicants ' appeal on points of law on the grounds that the professional disciplinary bodies did have jurisdiction because the applicants were registered with ORG , that the report \u2013 simply a statement of facts \u2013 drawn up by the rapporteur appointed by the chairman of the disciplinary section did not necessarily have to be communicated to the parties , and that LAW for medical practitioners could apply to acts relating to the applicants ' activity as journalists :", "\u201c It transpires from the provisions of the above - mentioned LAW DATE that the disciplinary bodies of ORG have jurisdiction , in connection with proceedings brought before them , to assess the conduct of any registered doctor with regard in particular to the provisions of LAW for medical practitioners . It can be seen from the material in the file submitted to the tribunal of fact DATE and it is not in dispute \u2013 that PERSON and PERSON were , at the time of the impugned acts , registered with ORG . Accordingly , these doctors are not justified in arguing that the disciplinary sections of ORG regional medical council and of ORG were acting ultra vires in ruling on the breaches of professional duty that they were alleged to have committed in respect of certain articles published in a magazine under their management . The disciplinary section of ORG did not commit any mistake of law when it found that LAW for medical practitioners was applicable to facts relating to the applicants ' activity as journalists . \u201d", "...", "...", "Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE laying down a Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners reads , in relevant part , as follows :", "\u201c The provisions of the present Code shall be binding on medical practitioners who are registered with ORG ... \u201d", "\u201c When a medical practitioner participates in an educational and health - related action of public information , regardless of the means of dissemination , he shall only impart information that has been confirmed , shall act with care and shall be concerned about the repercussions of his remarks among members of the public . In such a context he shall refrain from courting publicity , whether for personal reasons , for the benefit of bodies for which he works or to which he provides assistance , or in support of a cause that is not in the general interest . \u201d", "\u201c All medical practitioners shall abstain , even when not exercising their profession , from any act that might bring discredit upon that profession \u201d .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
