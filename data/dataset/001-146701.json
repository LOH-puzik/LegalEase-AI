The applicant lives at GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON , who was then the applicant \u2019s wife , bought a property named Ekheim from him for MONEY ( ORG ) , currently corresponding to MONEY ( ORG ) . The couple drew up marital agreements ( \u201c ektepakt \u201d ) in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON and the applicant concluded an agreement stipulating that they each owned PERCENT of the PERSON estate , regardless of what was stated or might follow from formal entitlements ( hereinafter referred to as the joint ownership agreement ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , after their divorce , the applicant lodged an action against PERSON ORG ( tingrett ) , seeking a ruling to the effect that the marital agreements were invalid and that the joint ownership agreement was valid . By a judgment of DATE , ORG found against the applicant and in favour of the respondent , concluding that the marital agreements were valid and that the joint ownership agreement was invalid . The applicant did not appeal against this judgment , which gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON sold the PERSON estate to ORG , a limited liability company , for ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted civil proceedings before ORG against ORG claiming that he had title to PERCENT of the PERSON estate and seeking , firstly , an order that the latter convey PERCENT of the property to him and , secondly , that he held a pre - emption right with respect to PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . According to the summary of the applicant \u2019s submissions made by ORG in its judgment referred to below , the applicant argued in the main as follows :", "( a ) The question was how to interpret the former spouses\u2019 joint ownership agreement of CARDINAL DATE . In the case that had previously been decided by ORG on DATE , the subject - matter of the dispute had been whether the marital agreements from DATE and DATE were valid . The subject - matter in the present case was different . CARDINAL spouses having completely separate property had the opportunity to conclude a mutual agreement involving an obligation of performance for each party . According to legal doctrine , such a contract was not dependent on any condition as to form .", "( b ) The contract had been a reality in the present case . ORG had purchased the CARDINAL of the Ekheim estate that had been in PERSON ownership , not the CARDINAL owned by the applicant , because PERSON had had no right to sell CARDINAL . Consequently , ORG ought to transfer by deed of conveyance CARDINAL of the PERSON estate back to the applicant .", "( c ) The applicant further submitted that in its DATE judgment ORG had not reviewed the validity of the joint ownership agreement . In any event , the legal force of that judgment extended only to the relationship between PERSON and the applicant , not between ORG and the applicant . The applicant referred to legal doctrine , according to which a judgment as a main rule only had legal force in the relationship between the parties to the proceedings . Moreover , the parties\u2019 arguments ought to be taken as a starting point in the assessment of whether any new factual circumstances had arisen .", "( d ) The applicant \u2019s argument was that in the period since DATE the estate had increased so greatly in value that ORG now had to assess the ownership issue independently of the conclusion reached in the DATE judgment . At that time the mortgages on the property had clearly exceeded its value and it had therefore been unproblematic to hold that , in light of an on - going bankruptcy at the time , the applicant would not have been in a better position in the absence of the marriage settlement agreements . It would be unreasonable if PERSON or her successors should be able to profit from the tremendous increase in the property \u2019s value .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG found in favour of the respondent PERSON , on the ground that the applicant did not have title to the property in question as the respondent company had derived its rights from PERSON and ORG had ruled in her favour in its DATE judgment . It rejected the applicant \u2019s argument based on legal doctrine that the DATE judgment only had legal force between the parties by referring to another passage in the legal manual in question from which it appeared that the point only applied to disputes between a private party and public authorities . The action brought by the applicant had no public - law aspects and ORG did not consider that the legal doctrine referred to had any bearing on the present case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) . He argued in particular that ORG had confused his pleadings and references to legal doctrine made at the oral hearing and had shortened the overall duration of the hearing from DATE initially scheduled to TIME . TIME into the hearing ORG had truncated the hearing of the applicant \u2019s witnesses , including the presentation of documentary evidence regarding the disputed agreements . ORG hearing record had also been marred by formal mistakes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG warned the applicant that it envisaged refusing admission of his appeal and gave him until DATE to comment . After an extension of this time - limit to CARDINAL DATE the applicant on the latter date requested that his appeal be admitted for examination or , in the alternative , that ORG quash ORG judgment and refer the case back to ORG for fresh examination . On CARDINAL and DATE he filed additional submissions .", "CARDINAL . In a unanimous decision ( beslutning ) of DATE ORG concluded that it refused to admit the appeal ( \u201c Anken nektes fremmet \u201d ) , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c The High Court finds it clear that the appeal will not succeed , and that its admission should therefore be refused pursuant to LAW ) of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against ORG decision to ORG , arguing notably that the refusal of admission of the appeal lacked reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts ankeutvalg ) , pointing out that its jurisdiction was confined to reviewing the High Court procedure ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) , unanimously found it clear that the appeal would not succeed and therefore rejected the appeal under LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
