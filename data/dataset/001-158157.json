On DATE the applicant \u2019s husband filed a petition for divorce with ORG . This was on the ground that his marriage to the applicant had broken down irretrievably because , among other reasons , he and the applicant had been separated for DATE ( that is , DATE longer than the minimum period required by law : see relevant domestic law and practice at paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The case was set for a directions hearing on DATE . On that date the applicant appeared in person and asked for additional time to file her defence to the petition : ORG acceded to her request and adjourned the hearing to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for legal aid . The hearing of that legal aid application was fixed for DATE . On DATE the applicant appeared before the court and asked for a DATE extension as she was not sure if she would maintain her application . The court adjourned the legal aid hearing to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant attended court and requested a further extension for filing her defence to the petition on the ground that her legal aid application was pending . The court adjourned the case to CARDINAL DATE and directed that the applicant file her defence by that date .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did in fact decide to maintain her legal aid application . When this legal aid application came before ORG on DATE , the court considered that the application came within the scope of ORG ( see relevant domestic law and practice at paragraph CARDINAL below ) so it instructed ORG to prepare a social welfare report on the applicant and adjourned the hearing of the legal aid application to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant failed to file her defence to the petition for divorce by DATE as directed . She also failed to appear in court on DATE . In her absence , counsel for the applicant \u2019s husband requested that the case be set for trial . The court acceded to this request and a trial date of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal aid application came before the court on DATE as scheduled . The applicant attended court . However , because no one from ORG was present , the court adjourned its examination of the application to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant did not appear at court for the trial in the main proceedings . The applicant \u2019s husband attended with counsel . In the applicant \u2019s absence , the court proceeded to hear the evidence of her husband who stated that the couple had been suffering problems and had been separated since DATE . No other witnesses were heard . The court gave an ex tempore judgment granting the petition for divorce .", "CARDINAL . Although the petition for divorce had been granted , the hearing in the legal aid application went ahead as scheduled on DATE . The applicant was not present at court . A representative of ORG informed the court that , from a letter in the court file dated DATE , which had been sent by a welfare officer to the court registrar , it appeared that the applicant was no longer interested in receiving legal aid . The court accordingly dismissed the legal aid application for want of prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG judgment to ORG . She was legally represented on appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted CARDINAL grounds of appeal : that ORG had wrongly proceeded with the hearing of the petition for divorce in her absence , and that it had wrongly decided on the dissolution of the marriage .

In the reasons accompanying her grounds of appeal , she again made reference to LAW and the right of litigants to present their case before the court and to be defended by counsel . The applicant again submitted that the rules of natural justice safeguarded the right to be heard . She further stated that she had informed ORG that she had applied for legal aid . She had been under the impression that her legal aid application would be examined by the same bench that would hear the petition for divorce . As the legal aid application had been fixed to be examined at a date subsequent to the date the divorce petition was fixed ( DATE for the legal aid hearing as against CARDINAL DATE for the divorce petition hearing ) , she presumed that the divorce petition would be examined following the granting of legal aid so she could file a defence through a lawyer . It was for this reason that she had not appeared in court on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s husband died . In his will he bequeathed part of his property to another woman . As a consequence of the divorce , the applicant was not entitled to inherit from his estate or to receive a widow \u2019s pension .

ORG further directed that once the skeleton arguments were submitted , the appeal was to be set down for a hearing .", "CARDINAL . In her skeleton argument dated DATE , the applicant developed her ground of appeal relating to LAW , stating that ORG had acted contrary to PERSON ) ( the right of access to court ) , Article CARDINAL ) ( the right to present one \u2019s case and to have sufficient time for its preparation ) , and Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) ( the right to counsel and to free legal assistance ) . She relied on both the relevant case - law of the NORP courts on these provisions and on the relevant case - law of this Court on the corresponding provisions of LAW , including PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL . In respect of her submission as regards the rules of natural justice , she referred to GPE \u2019s ORG ( CARDINALth ed . , PERSON , \u00a7 DATE ) and the court \u2019s duty to provide every party with a fair chance to set his case before the court .", "CARDINAL . A hearing on the merits of the appeal took place before ORG on DATE . At the hearing , the applicant adopted her written submissions . Counsel for the applicant \u2019s ex - husband submitted that PERSON could be distinguished on the basis that the Convention did not grant a general right to legal aid and , in any event , the present case was not so complex as to require it . The hearing was adjourned to CARDINAL DATE . On DATE , counsel for the applicant provided the court with copies of the relevant case - law cited in the applicant \u2019s written submissions . No further submissions were made and the court reserved judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It found :", "\u201c It is the appellant \u2019s position that she had informed the court that she had submitted an application for legal aid and , because she believed that her application would be examined by the court which would examine the substance of the petition for the dissolution of the marriage , she failed to appear on DATE , with the consequence that the case was heard in her absence and the petition for divorce was granted against her .", "Regarding the allegations of violation of the provisions of LAW CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL and the principles of natural justice , no specific reasons have been put forward which could substantiate the above allegations , which are accordingly dismissed .", "Regarding the alleged violation of LAW , the appellant has not specified which particular paragraph has been violated and this allegation is dismissed for vagueness . Independently of this conclusion , we have already made detailed reference to what took place both in the proceedings concerning the application for legal aid and the divorce proceedings . From the above , it appears that judgment under appeal was the result of the complete indifference of the appellant to respond to the directions of the ORG to file her defence and her failure to appear before the court . The appellant can not claim that her failure to appear was due to the fact that she believed that the divorce petition would be examined by another court .", "The appeal is dismissed with costs . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
