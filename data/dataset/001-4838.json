SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national born in DATE . She is unemployed and resides in PERSON .", "A.", "The applicant and her husband agreed to transfer the tenancy of an apartment situated at FAC DATE in PERSON to an individual . The latter orally promised to the applicant that her family could move to a smaller apartment situated at FAC in LOC .", "On DATE the applicant and her husband signed a formal agreement according to which the right to use the apartment situated at GPE street DATE would be transferred to the aforesaid individual as from DATE . Section III \u00a7 CARDINAL of the agreement stated that the applicant and her husband were liable to pay the rent until the agreement became operative , and that after the transfer their address would be GPE street CARDINAL . The agreement was signed in the presence of a representative of the co - operative which owns the apartment situated at GPE street DATE . ORG", "Subsequently the applicant found out that her family could not move into the apartment situated at GPE street CARDINAL as it was occupied by another person . She therefore challenged the agreement of DATE before ORG s\u00fad - \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on the ground that the individual concerned had made her sign the agreement under false pretences .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . At the hearing a representative of the co - operative concerned stated that the applicant and her husband had signed the agreement of their own free will and without any reservations . Neither this witness nor the CARDINAL other witnesses heard by the court were in a position to confirm the applicant \u2019s allegation that she had been promised the right to live in the apartment situated at GPE street CARDINAL . Since there was no evidence which supported the LOC allegation , the court concluded that the applicant had failed to show that she and her husband had concluded the agreement under circumstances which could affect its validity within the meaning of Sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201c below ) .", "The applicant appealed . She alleged that the individual who had offered them the deal had acted in a fraudulent way and invoked Sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "On DATE the ORG ( Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad - \u201c ORG \u201c ) upheld ORG judgment of DATE . ORG found that ORG had established all relevant facts of the applicant \u2019s case with sufficient certainty , and that it had assessed them correctly from the legal point of view . In particular , ORG noted that CARDINAL witnesses had confirmed that the applicant and her husband had signed the agreement of their own free will . It found no evidence indicating that the agreement was void for any of the reasons set out in Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "In ORG view , Section III \u00a7 CARDINAL of the agreement of DATE referred to GPE street CARDINAL as the applicant \u2019s future address solely in the context of arrangements regarding the advance payments of the rent for the apartment situated at GPE street DATE until the applicant \u2019s departure from that apartment . ORG held it therefore for irrelevant that the applicant could not actually move into the apartment situated at GPE street CARDINAL .", "On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to vacate the apartment situated at GPE street DATE . On DATE ORG upheld this decision . Both courts established , with reference to the reasons set out in their judgments of DATE and DATE respectively , that the applicant and her husband had transferred the right to use the apartment in question to another individual and concluded that they lived in it without any legal ground .", "B.
