He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , PERSON , PERSON and Mr. PERSON , ORG .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of DATE and DATE ORG Skatteverket ) reviewed the applicant \u2019s taxation for income received in DATE ( i.e. DATE ) and found that payments made by NORP county councils and health care districts to a company registered in GPE and PERCENT owned by the applicant should be considered as salary for work performed as a medical doctor for which he was liable to pay income tax in GPE . His income was revised upwards by CARDINAL , CARDINAL and MONEY ( SEK ) , respectively , for DATE . Furthermore , as the applicant had failed to account for the amounts in question in his DATE tax returns and had thus supplied ORG with incorrect information , the ORG ordered him to pay tax surcharges ( skattetill\u00e4gg ) , amounting to PERCENT of the increased tax liability .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s appeals , ORG made obligatory reviews of its decisions but did not change them .", "CARDINAL . By judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE upheld ORG decisions .", "CARDINAL . It is not clear whether the applicant appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , but he did so against the judgment of DATE which concerned income received in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( kammar - r\u00e4tten ) in GPE agreed with the principal considerations in ORG decision but lowered the amounts in question \u2013 following new information obtained by the Agency DATE to MONEY and QUANTITY for DATE ( in total CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . It appears that ORG and , upon appeal , the administrative courts have made similar tax revisions for income received in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant on DATE in regard to the above conduct .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tt ) convicted the applicant of an aggravated tax offence ( grovt skattebrott ) and sentenced him to DATE and DATE in prison . The conviction concerned the period DATE , corresponding to all DATE which had been subject to tax revisions , and thus including DATE which are relevant in the present case before ORG . The court found that the applicant had systematically and intentionally given ORG misleading information as to where he lived and worked . Although he had lived and worked in GPE during DATE in question , he had incorrectly claimed that he had left the country and worked abroad . The total undeclared income amounted to MONEY and the evaded income tax came to MONEY SEK . In sentencing the applicant , the court took into account that a long time had passed since the offences had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hovr\u00e4tt ) of GPE and PERSON upheld ORG judgment . While the appellate court did not find that the time between the commission of the offences and the indictment gave reason to reduce the length of the prison sentence , it found that the considerable tax surcharges imposed on the applicant constituted such a reason . The court did not , however , give any details as to how much the sentence was reduced due to the surcharges . In conclusion , it upheld the sentence passed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( ORG domstolen ) granted leave to appeal with respect to the question whether , pursuant to LAW , the imposition of tax surcharges barred the criminal trial or conviction of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG found , by a majority of CARDINAL votes to QUANTITY , that there was no reason generally to invalidate the NORP system with double proceedings by virtue of LAW No . CARDINAL ( published in Nytt juridiskt arkiv ( ORG ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . The court considered that , following the judgment in PERSON v. RussiaIf the later proceedings concerned identical or essentially the same facts as the earlier proceedings , it was a matter of proceedings concerning the same offence . However , ORG noted that the GPE case - law left some room for several punishments for the same offence that could be decided by separate organs at different times and mentioned by way of example , inter alia , the conviction for a traffic offence and the resultant withdrawal of the offender \u2019s driving licence . ORG further found that the invalidation of a NORP system regulated by domestic law with reference to the LAW required that either the LAW itself or the ORG \u2019s jurisprudence provided clear support for that conclusion and considered that neither LAW No . CARDINAL nor the jurisprudence provided such support in the matter at hand . There were no other grounds for finding that LAW No . CARDINAL prevented the trial or conviction of the applicant because of the fact that tax surcharges had been imposed on him . In these circumstances , there was no reason to grant leave to appeal in regard to the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence . ORG judgment was accordingly upheld .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started to serve his prison sentence on DATE . He was released on probation on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the applicant \u2019s request , decided to re - open the criminal proceedings in so far as they concerned the applicant \u2019s liability for tax offences in DATE ( corresponding to the taxation DATE ) and the sentence fixed by ORG . In those respects , the case was referred back to the appellate court for a new examination . Referring to LAW and to its decisions of DATE and DATE ( see further paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) , ORG noted that the applicant had been convicted by ORG after the PERSON judgment of DATE and that the tax surcharges previously imposed on him concerned the same conduct as the criminal indictment . However , the court rejected the petition for a re - opening of the criminal case to the extent that it concerned offences committed in DATE and DATE as , in those respects , the conviction had occurred before ORG decisions on surcharges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed its judgment of CARDINAL DATE in so far as it concerned the part that had been re - opened by ORG ( that is , DATE ) and dismissed the indictment in that respect . The sentence for the remaining tax offences , committed in DATE and DATE , was fixed at CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has appealed to ORG against the sentence fixed by ORG . Thus , his appeal does not concern the DATE relevant in the present case . The appeal is presently pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings for damages against the ORG before ORG . He claimed CARDINAL ( approximately FAC ) for suffering due to his having been imprisoned following dual proceedings that allegedly violated LAW . The claimed amount was calculated in accordance with the practice of the Chancellor of ORG ( NORP ) ( see further paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The compensation proceedings have been adjourned pending the outcome of the re - opened criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The rules on taxes and tax surcharges relevant to the present case were primarily laid down in , as far as income tax was concerned , LAW ( Taxeringslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) and , with respect to GPE , LAW ( Skattebetalningslagen , DATE ) . Both laws have since been replaced by LAW Skattef\u00f6rfarandelagen ; CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A tax surcharge could \u2013 and still can \u2013 be imposed on a taxpayer in CARDINAL situations : if he or she , in a tax return or in any other written statement , has submitted information of relevance to the tax assessment which is found to be incorrect ( LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW , and LAW , LAW ) or if , following a discretionary assessment , ORG decides not to rely on the tax return ( LAW , section CARDINAL , and LAW , section CARDINAL , respectively ) . It is not only express statements that may lead to the imposition of a surcharge ; concealment , in whole or in part , of relevant facts may also be regarded as incorrect information . A discretionary tax assessment is made if the taxpayer has submitted information which is so inadequate that ORG can not base its tax assessment on it or if he or she has not filed a tax return despite the obligation to do so . In certain circumstances , the tax surcharges may be exempted .", "CARDINAL . A person who intentionally furnishes incorrect information to an authority or fails to file a tax return or other required information , thereby causing a risk that taxes will be withheld from the public treasury or wrongly credited or repaid to him or her , is criminally liable under sections CARDINAL of LAW ( Skattebrottslagen , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . The possible sentence ranges from a fine for a tax misdemeanour ( skattef\u00f6rseelse ) to imprisonment for a maximum of DATE for an aggravated tax offence . Section CARDINAL provides that a person who is not considered to have furnished incorrect information with intent but to have been grossly negligent in doing so ( v\u00e5rdsl\u00f6s skatteuppgift ) may be sentenced to a fine or a maximum of DATE in prison . The term \u201c incorrect information \u201d in LAW is considered to have the same meaning as in the above provisions on tax surcharges ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG considered whether a person could be convicted of a tax offence in criminal proceedings following the imposition of a tax surcharge in tax proceedings ( NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . Having noted that , under internal NORP law , a surcharge is not considered a criminal penalty and does not prevent trial and conviction for a tax offence relating to the same act , ORG went on to examine the matter under LAW . It first considered , in the light of the ORG \u2019s case - law , that there were weighty arguments for regarding LAW as being applicable under its criminal head to proceedings involving a tax surcharge . Even assuming this to be the case , it held , however , that the principle of ne bis in idem , as set forth in LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW presupposed that the initial conviction or acquittal had been delivered in accordance with the penal procedure of the ORG . Therefore the principle did not prevent criminal proceedings from being brought against someone for an act in respect of which a surcharge had already been levied . This view was confirmed in later judgments delivered by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the reverse situation , that is , where the question of imposition of tax surcharges arose after a criminal conviction for a tax offence ( judgment published in PERSON \u00e5rsbok ( R\u00c5 ) DATE , ref . CARDINAL ) . In assessing whether there was a violation of the prohibition on double punishment under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , the court referred to the fact that the relevant NORP provisions aimed at ensuring that the combined sanctions \u2013 criminal conviction and imposition of tax surcharges \u2013 were in reasonable proportion to the conduct for which the individual had been found liable . It further noted that the NORP legal system contained the special feature of separate general courts and administrative courts . In the court \u2019s opinion , LAW No . CARDINAL had to be interpreted in the light of such special features in the national legal systems . While acknowledging that the ORG \u2019s recent judgments in PERSON v. GPE ( cited above ) and PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) suggested a change in the GPE case - law , ORG noted that they did not relate to the NORP legal system and concluded that this system , allowing for both a conviction for a tax offence and an imposition of tax surcharges , was in conformity with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in its decision concerning the present case , ORG examined the issue anew and again found that there was no reason generally to invalidate the NORP system with double proceedings by virtue of LAW No . CARDINAL ( see further paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . By a plenary decision of DATE ( NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) ORG overturned its previous conclusions . In line with its DATE decision , the court held that the imposition of tax surcharges and the conviction for a tax offence based on the same information supplied in a tax return are founded on identical factual circumstances and the relevant proceedings thus concern the same offence within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL . However , where the court in DATE had found that the invalidation of the NORP system required clear support in the Convention itself or in GPE case - law , the court now noted that the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON ( CARDINAL NORP DATE , case no . C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) already prohibited double proceedings and punishments with respect to VAT . As the NORP system had thereby been partially invalidated , the legal and practical consequences of further changes were not so radical as to require the intervention of the legislature . The court also took into account that no legislative amendments had been made despite the developments in GPE case - law since DATE and that it would be inexpedient and difficult to apply different rules on similar contraventions within a system meant to be coherent . Consequently , the court held that there was sufficient support for concluding that the NORP system of tax surcharges and tax offences was incompatible with LAW . This conclusion applied not only to ORG , but also to income tax , employer \u2019s contributions and similar payments .", "ORG further found that the protection under NORP law against double proceedings and punishments was valid also in cases where the state exacted personal liability on an individual for tax surcharges imposed on a legal person . Having regard to the strong and systematic connection in NORP law between the principles of res judicata and lis pendens , the court also held , although the ORG \u2019s jurisprudence was unclear on this point , that ongoing , not finalised proceedings on tax surcharges precluded a criminal indictment concerning the same factual circumstances . The procedural hindrance against an indictment materialised when ORG took its decision to impose surcharges .", "However , whereas the imposition of tax surcharges and the conviction for a tax offence based on the same factual circumstances concerned the same offence and were thus prohibited , the situation was different when the criminal conviction concerned a bookkeeping offence . According to ORG , which had regard to the case - law of the ORG , the concrete factual circumstances forming the basis of a bookkeeping offence could normally not be considered inextricably linked to the factual circumstances leading to the imposition of tax surcharges . In addition to the breach of bookkeeping obligations under LAW , the imposition of a tax surcharge involved a further factual element , namely the submission of incorrect information in a tax return .", "In the case at hand , which involved the imposition of tax surcharges against an individual in DATE and the criminal indictment of him in DATE for , inter alia , aggravated tax offences and an aggravated bookkeeping offence , ORG quashed the appealed judgment of ORG in so far as it concerned the tax offence relating to his personal income tax and dismissed the indictment in that respect . However , nothing prevented the examination of the bookkeeping offence or the tax offences concerning ORG and employer \u2019s contributions . In the latter respect , the conclusion was due to the tax surcharges relating to LOC and employer \u2019s contributions having been imposed on the appellant \u2019s limited liability company and not on him personally .", "CARDINAL . In a further decision , taken on DATE ( NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , ORG examined the question whether a former defendant could be granted a re - opening of criminal proceedings ( resning ) under LAW , section CARDINAL of the Code of Judicial Procedure ( R\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) if he or she had been convicted of an offence under LAW in a manner incompatible with LAW , as interpreted by the decision of DATE . The court concluded that , on the basis of the Convention , in particular LAW , a NORP court may decide , in certain situations , that a case is to be re - opened notwithstanding the special conditions specified in LAW , section CARDINAL . The court also took the position that the incompatibility of NORP legislation regarding sanctions for tax - related offences with LAW No . CARDINAL had arisen by virtue of the PERSON judgment ( cited above ) , thus on DATE . ORG decision led to criminal proceedings being re - opened in respect of an individual \u2019s conviction for an offence under LAW . As a result , the possibility of being granted a re - opening of criminal proceedings applies retroactively to judgments having been delivered in criminal proceedings as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took another decision of relevance ( NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . It stated therein that , if criminal proceedings have commenced before ORG has decided to impose tax surcharges , the prohibition against ne bis in idem can not result in a criminal judgment that has become final being re - opened and quashed . Instead , it is the second set of proceedings to be commenced DATE the tax proceedings involving surcharges \u2013 that are contrary to the law . The violation of the right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence is therefore in this situation a matter for the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . By a plenary judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( HFD DATE ref . CARDINAL ) , ORG ( now ORG f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) reversed the position taken in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE and confirmed in a judgment of DATE ( R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL ) . Agreeing with the conclusions drawn by ORG , ORG found that the same principles should apply when the order of the tax and criminal proceedings is different , that is , when the tax proceedings are commenced later . Accordingly , a criminal indictment constitutes a procedural hindrance against imposing tax surcharges based on the same submission of incorrect information .", "In the case at hand , where the individual had been indicted in DATE and surcharges had been imposed by ORG in DATE , ORG concluded that the latter decision violated LAW . The appeal made against the appellate court \u2019s judgment on tax surcharges was accordingly granted and the surcharges set aside .", "CARDINAL . ORG has since examined several petitions for the re - opening of tax proceedings in which tax surcharges had been imposed . In a decision of DATE ( cases nos . CARDINAL - CARDINAL and DATE ) it rejected the petition , stating that the earlier criminal proceedings had not led to an indictment of the individual but to a decision by the prosecutor to discontinue the preliminary investigation and that , accordingly , no violation of the prohibition against double proceedings had occurred . In a judgment of DATE ( cases nos . CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) it granted a re - opening , noting that , pursuant to ORG decision of DATE , the applicant would have had a right of re - opening of the criminal proceedings if the tax surcharge decision had preceded the indictment and finding that the situation at hand , which was the reverse , should not be treated differently . ORG accordingly re - opened the tax proceedings and quashed the tax surcharges in question . The latter case had already been examined by ORG as part of the original tax proceedings in DATE prior to the recent developments in NORP case - law \u2013 and had then been considered not to involve a breach of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( cases nos . DATE and MONEY ) ORG examined a different situation where tax surcharges had been imposed on a person by a decision of ORG in DATE , upheld by ORG in DATE . During the subsequent examination before ORG , the person in question was , in separate criminal proceedings , indicted for a tax offence but acquitted thereof by a judgment of ORG in DATE which soon afterwards acquired legal force . As a consequence , ORG , in DATE , quashed the surcharges that had been imposed . ORG agreed with this course of action , noting that the ORG had established in several judgments ( including PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) that , in the event that CARDINAL of CARDINAL concurrent sets of proceedings becomes final , LAW No . CARDINAL required that the other set of proceedings be discontinued . ORG judgment was delivered in ordinary proceedings which had not involved any re - opening . Furthermore , all the decisions and judgments in the case were delivered after the PERSON judgment .", "CARDINAL . Following the above judicial changes , ORG ( Riks\u00e5klagaren ) and ORG ( GPE - myndigheten ) decided to examine all tax cases where there may have been double punishments in accordance with the conclusions by the CARDINAL supreme courts . Whenever the conditions were met , the prosecutor would file a petition for the criminal proceedings to be re - opened , provided that the individual agreed to this course of action and had not already sought a re - opening him- or herself . The undertaking , expected to be finalised by DATE , was to cover all cases ending with a judgment , an order of summary punishment ( straff\u00f6rel\u00e4ggande ) or a decision not to prosecute ( \u00e5talsunderl\u00e5telse ) since DATE .", "On DATE the NORP newspaper ORG , basing itself on information provided by ORG , reported that CARDINAL cases concerning tax offences had been examined . Out of CARDINAL individuals who were serving prison sentences , DATE had been released . Those who had not been released had been convicted also for other crimes than tax offences . A further number of persons who were about to start serving prison sentences did not have to do so . CARDINAL individuals who had already served their sentences had been asked whether they wished assistance in filing petitions for re - opening of proceedings and , so far , CARDINAL of them had accepted and CARDINAL cases had been re - opened . In some re - opened cases the convictions had been quashed in their entirety ; in others , involving several offences , the proceedings had to be repeated .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act on Compensation for Deprivation of Liberty and Other Coercive Measures ( ORG om ers\u00e4ttning vid frihetsber\u00f6vande och andra tv\u00e5ngs\u00e5tg\u00e4rder ; CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) stipulates that a person who has served a prison sentence is entitled to compensation if , following an appeal or a re - opening of proceedings , he or she is acquitted or given a less severe sentence or the judgment containing the conviction is quashed . Under section CARDINAL of that Act , compensation is awarded for costs , loss of income , interference in business activities and suffering . Normally , in accordance with the practice of the Chancellor of ORG , compensation for suffering is set at a rate of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for DATE , SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for DATE up to and including DATE and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) per month after that . Certain circumstances can lead to a higher rate of compensation . This is primarily the case if the suspicions have concerned a particularly serious crime or if the matter has attracted extensive media attention .", "CARDINAL . An action for damages can also be based on LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . Under LAW , LAW , compensation is awarded for damage caused by fault or negligence on the part of a public authority . Requests can be lodged with the Chancellor of ORG . If dissatisfied with the Chancellor \u2019s decision , the individual has the option of bringing an action for damages against the ORG in the general courts . He or she may also institute such proceedings directly without having made a request to the Chancellor .", "CARDINAL . In addition , ORG has developed case - law which provides that , in order to provide redress for victims of Convention violations , compensation may be awarded without direct support in NORP law . Based on this case - law , the Chancellor of ORG has awarded compensation in many cases following requests from individuals . The ORG has had regard to this development and has concluded that , following a ORG judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE N CARDINAL ) , there is an accessible and effective remedy of general applicability , capable of affording redress in respect of alleged violations of the Convention ( see , for example , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE , and PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no .
