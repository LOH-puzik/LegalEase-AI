CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Paul Lemmens;St\u00e9phanie Mourou-Vikstr\u00f6m;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in Split .", "CARDINAL . The legislation of the former GPE , in particular LAW of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , prohibited the acquisition of ownership of socially owned property by adverse possession ( dosjelost ) .", "CARDINAL . When incorporating the DATE LAW into the NORP legal system on DATE , ORG repealed the above - mentioned provision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the new LAW of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , provided that the period prior to CARDINAL DATE was to be included in calculating the period for acquiring ownership by adverse possession of socially owned immovable property ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Following several petitions for an abstract constitutional review ( prijedlog za ocjenu ustavnosti ) submitted by former owners of properties that had been appropriated under the socialist regime , on DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) accepted the initiative and decided to institute proceedings to review the constitutionality of section CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG invalidated section CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW . It held that the impugned provision had retroactive effect , resulting in adverse consequences for the rights of third parties ( primarily those who , under the restitution legislation , were entitled to the restitution of property appropriated during the NORP regime ) and was therefore unconstitutional ( for the relevant part of the decision see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . The decision came into effect on DATE when it was published in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively , the applicants bought CARDINAL plots of land from various individuals . However , the plots were recorded in the land register in the name of GPE as the legal predecessor of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought a civil action in ORG ( PERSON ) against ORG ( Grad Split DATE hereinafter \u201c the local authorities \u201d ) , seeking a declaration of their ownership of the CARDINAL plots of land and registration in their names in the land register . They submitted that the property at issue , even though it had been recorded in the land register in the name of GPE as the legal predecessor of GPE , had been in the possession of their legal predecessors for DATE . Given that the statutory period for acquiring ownership by adverse possession had elapsed in respect of their legal predecessors , the applicants claimed that by buying the land from them they had validly acquired ownership .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG ruled in favour of the applicants . It established , firstly , that the land in question had been in social ownership on CARDINAL DATE and that under the relevant legislation it had not been possible to acquire ownership of socially owned property by adverse possession before that date unless the statutory requirements for doing so had been met by DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . It found , however , that the applicants had proved that their predecessors had had continuous possession of the CARDINAL plots of land in good faith for DATE before DATE , and had continued to do so until they had sold them to the applicants ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicants\u2019 predecessors had therefore , under LAW ( applicable in GPE from DATE until DATE , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , acquired ownership of the land by adverse possession even before that date .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal by the defendant authority , on DATE ORG ( PERSON ) reversed the first - instance judgment and dismissed the applicants\u2019 action . It stated that even though ORG had established the facts correctly , the ORG predecessors had only been in possession of the land in question ( continuously and in good faith ) since DATE . The DATE time - limit for acquiring ownership by adverse possession set forth in LAW had not therefore expired by DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the subsequent period DATE and DATE the relevant legislation had prohibited the acquisition of ownership of socially owned property by adverse possession ( see paragraph CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . This had interrupted the running of the statutory time - limits elapsed before that period . The time elapsed before DATE had therefore not continued to run after CARDINAL DATE \u2013 it had actually started to run again .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then lodged a constitutional complaint against the second - instance judgment , alleging violations of their constitutional rights to equality before the law , equality before the courts and fair procedure .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed their constitutional complaint and on DATE it served its decision on their representative ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
