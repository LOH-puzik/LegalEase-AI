The commission of inquiry held CARDINAL hearings , which were attended by the Attorney - General on behalf of the Republic and counsel on behalf of the families of the deceased , the police and the MMAD . Directions were given concerning the collection and preservation of all real evidence and the carrying out of all appropriate forensic tests . CARDINAL exhibits were examined and CARDINAL witnesses were heard . The witnesses testified under oath and were examined and cross - examined by all interested parties .

The following expert evidence was tendered to the commission of inquiry .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , an ex - colonel of the NORP army and a professional anti - terrorist and negotiations trainer , criticised the following aspects of the rescue operation . The witness considered that in most cases which did not involve terrorists or hardened criminals , negotiations could secure the release of the persons held and render the use of force unnecessary . In the case under examination , however , some of the main rules concerning negotiations had not been followed . The witness considered that the result of the negotiations could have been much more satisfactory if they had been based on a \u201c give and take \u201d approach . In general it was better for the negotiations to be conducted by persons who were not or did not appear to be police officers . The police could have ensured that no unauthorised calls reached PERSON by disconnecting his telephone and providing him with another line . PERSON should not have been able to see the crowd outside .", "CARDINAL . The MMAD platoon should have used multiple entries for their armed intervention . An observer should have been placed by the skylight who could have informed the police of PERSON movements . Special care should have been taken , however , because the head of the person at the skylight could have been seen by PERSON . The armed intervention should have taken place earlier on and stun grenades should have been used instead of tear gas . A fire engine could have poured water into the flat in order to neutralise PERSON . However , it would have been necessary to ascertain PERSON exact position . The witness did not exclude the possibility that the officers might have mistaken PERSON CARDINAL shots for CARDINAL . In this case , however , they should have lured PERSON into using his second shot . Well - trained officers like those of the MMAD should have realised that PERSON was not holding a gun and , in any event , should have fired the least possible number of bullets . No bullets should have been fired after PERSON had fallen to the ground .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , an ex - police officer from GPE and a professional crisis management and hostage negotiations trainer who had trained some of the officers of the MMAD , was not critical of the rescue operation . Although persons holding hostages often extended their deadlines , symbolic deadlines were to be taken more seriously . The failure to use the skylight was not \u201c a big issue \u201d . It was not a mistake to use tear gas instead of stun grenades . In PERSON view , it could not have been the ORG intention of PERSON to wait for the tear gas to produce its effects since that usually took some time . The tear gas was thrown to divert PERSON attention . In GPE there were CARDINAL schools of thought regarding multiple entry . Although he tended to favour it , others avoided it for fear that the hostage might be caught in the crossfire . In any event , there was nothing to reproach in the plan of the head of the MMAD platoon , PERSON , who had considered and excluded all other possible options .", "CARDINAL . PERSON also testified that he had trained the MMAD officers to such a level that they had to fire real bullets at balloons attached to his body . He had trained the officers to use lethal force as the last option . When it was necessary , however , they had been trained to shoot at the thorax . They had been trained to shoot until the target ceased to be a threat . In the case under examination , the use of lethal force became justified when PERSON opened fire . The officers should not have been concerned about the number of bullets fired . When cross - examined by applicants\u2019 counsel , the witness accepted that he had taken part in a number of operations involving ordinary civilians who held others under the threat of a gun where a negotiated solution had been found .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a ORG chemist who examined the kebab pie which had not been consumed , testified that the quantity of PERSON that she had found in the pie indicated that CARDINAL QUANTITY pills had been used . PERSON had consumed a very large portion of her pie . PERSON was a tranquilliser and anti - anxiety drug which also had soporific effects . It started producing its effects within TIME of absorption . Its maximum effects occurred after TIME .", "CARDINAL . P. GPE , the pharmacist who provided the soporifics , testified that PERSON started producing its effects within TIME . Its maximum effects occurred TIME after absorption .", "ORG . PERSON , the general practitioner who placed the soporifics in the food , testified that , if PERSON and PERSON had eaten the pies , the drug would have produced its effects in TIME and they would have fallen asleep . If PERSON had been administered , they would have fallen asleep in TIME .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , a forensic expert from GPE , who had prepared a noise time chart on the basis of the video recording , testified that the second shot from PERSON gun was fired TIME after the first . In the witness \u2019s view , PERSON second shot , like the first , was directed towards the door . The witness had reached this conclusion on the basis of the small number of pellets found in the flat . The noise time chart indicated that a number of distinct shots were fired after the MMAD officers entered the flat in the following sequence : CARDINAL single shot , CARDINAL triple shot and CARDINAL double shot . These shots started TIME and ended TIME after the first tear gas shot . PERSON considered that PERSON must have been wounded at that stage because her screams , which could be heard on the video recording , were significantly reduced after the CARDINAL shots . However , the witness was not sure whether the screaming had stopped entirely . The noise time chart further indicated that a burst of firing followed the single shots . It began TIME and ended TIME after the first tear gas shot .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON , a university Reader in forensic pathology in GPE , an ex - ORG pathologist and an examiner in forensic pathology for ORG of Pathologists , testified that PERSON must have received her wounds at the early stage of the operation because she was not heard shouting after the first shots heard in the video recording . However , he did not exclude that she might have stopped shouting for another reason or that the noise of the shooting might have covered her screams .", "CARDINAL . Dr M. Matsakis , the ORG pathologist , conducted a post - mortem examination on PERSON body on DATE . He found CARDINAL wounds to PERSON head and neck , CARDINAL wounds to the thorax , abdomen and pelvis , QUANTITY wounds to the right arm , QUANTITY wounds to the left arm and CARDINAL other wounds , all caused by bullets fired by the machine guns of the officers of the MMAD . CARDINAL bullets had hit PERSON . The position of the wounds was such that , in PERSON opinion , for at least part of the firing , the arms of PERSON had been interposed between the guns and his thorax . Before the commission of inquiry PERSON testified that these could have been among the first wounds inflicted .", "CARDINAL . In his report PERSON also specified that it was possible that the wounds inflicted to the left and right side of PERSON body had been caused by bullets fired from different directions . Many of the bullets had been fired when PERSON was not in an upright position . At least some of the bullets which had entered the right front side of the body ( mainly the abdomen ) and had exited from the right lumbar region , had been fired while PERSON body had been lying on the floor . Before the commission of inquiry , PERSON specified that the last bullets had hit PERSON body while the right side of his back was in contact with the floor .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON testified that , if PERSON had been covering the right side of PERSON during the shooting , as Officer no . CARDINAL had testified , PERSON would not have received the wounds to the right side of his thorax , his right shoulder and his abdomen . He further testified that the position of PERSON wounds was such that PERSON could not have been covering his right side , as Officer no . DATE had testified . Moreover , the position of the wounds inflicted when PERSON was already lying on the floor could not be reconciled with the testimony of the officers of the MMAD that PERSON had been found covering his abdomen .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the examination of Dr A.C. ORG it was accepted by both sides that PERSON was already dead when the last shots were fired .", "CARDINAL . Dr M. Matsakis , the ORG pathologist , also performed a post - mortem examination on PERSON body on DATE . CARDINAL bullets fired from the machine guns of the MMAD officers had penetrated her body . The first bullet had entered the left lower postero - lateral region of the thorax and had exited from the right side of the mid - thorax . The second bullet had entered the lower right back and exited from the right side of the abdomen . The distance between PERSON body and the machine guns must have been CARDINAL metre .", "CARDINAL . Dr M. Matsakis also found CARDINAL areas of wounding caused by the shot fired from PERSON shotgun . A wound to the right hand was caused by contact or near - contact firing . PERSON considered it very likely that it had been caused by the same shot which had injured Officer no . CARDINAL . There was a second wound to the left hand also caused by contact or near - contact firing . A third wound to the upper left thoracic region and the front region of the left upper shoulder had been caused by the LAW same shot which had injured PERSON left hand . The same shot had also caused slight wounding to PERSON left ear .", "CARDINAL . There were also signs that PERSON had been beaten in the face before her death .", "CARDINAL . Dr M. Matsakis concluded in his report that PERSON death had been caused by the wound inflicted by the machine - gun bullet which had penetrated her right lung , liver , stomach and spleen .", "A second machine - gun wound to the abdominal area and the shotgun wounds to the anterior left upper thorax and hands had contributed to her death .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the commission of inquiry , PERSON specified that the first wound was capable of causing PERSON death on its own . The chances that PERSON might have died , if she had only received the wounds to the anterior left upper thorax and hands , were very slim . However , this could not be excluded , in the sense that even the most insignificant wound could cause death if it became seriously infected . The ORG pathologist was invited to explain what he meant when he stated in his report that the wounds in the anterior left upper thorax and hands contributed to PERSON death . He replied that PERSON had died because her brain was not receiving oxygen due to the bleeding . Although the principal wound had caused intense bleeding , the wounds to the left upper thorax and arms had also caused bleeding .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON , the doctor who had operated on PERSON , testified that the presence of an ambulance at the scene would not have prevented PERSON death .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON , a surgeon called on behalf of the families of the deceased who was present during the post - mortem examination , accepted before the commission of inquiry that the wounds inflicted by PERSON gun had contributed to PERSON death . However , he specified that PERSON would have died in any event . In his view , there could be no doubt that PERSON would have survived if she had only received the wounds caused by PERSON gun . He specified that she would have had to spend DATE in hospital .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON testified that the wounds to the anterior left upper thorax and the hands \u201c should [ not ] have been put as a contributory cause . It is like saying ... that somebody who has had their head cut off , death was influenced by a broken leg . The wounds described in the first paragraph are so catastrophic that there would be no need for any contributory cause . And I have never seen a death from a discharge of a shotgun which has not penetrated a body cavity or the head or neck . Finally , it would be also more a matter for the surgeon who saw the wound in life \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Ar . PERSON , the police officer who had collected the fingerprints , testified that he was sure that all the fingerprints on PERSON gun , with the exception of CARDINAL , belonged to PERSON . CARDINAL fingerprint could have belonged to PERSON and one did not . PERSON , a bio - chemist at ORG , was not in a position to testify that PERSON blood was found on his gun .", "CARDINAL . A. Nikolaidis , a police officer and an expert in ballistics , testified that PERSON gun had not been hit by any bullets and that it could not be excluded that the gun might have fallen accidentally , instead of having been placed , on the armchair . The ORG pathologist , PERSON , expressed the view that PERSON gun could have fallen on the armchair while PERSON was collapsing .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON also testified that , if PERSON had been holding a gun when being shot at , the gun would have fallen on the floor . It could not have fallen on the armchair in the position in which it had been found . It might have fallen on the armchair only if the armchair had been in front of PERSON when he dropped the gun .", "CARDINAL . PERSON testified that the position in which PERSON gun had been found , its muzzle pointing towards the door , and the absence of blood suggested that it had been placed there by PERSON . He considered that PERSON had sufficient time to place the gun there between the time of firing the shots and the entry of the first MMAD officer .", "CARDINAL . The investigation was concluded on CARDINAL DATE and the report of the commission of inquiry , totalling CARDINAL pages , was published on DATE . The main findings of the commission of inquiry were the following .", "CARDINAL . The negotiations between the police and PERSON were conducted in the best possible manner under the circumstances , given in particular the stance he had adopted . He had been granted everything he had requested , namely a telephone , cigarettes and food . Although the food arrived after some delay , this had been done on purpose to exhaust him and make him surrender . He had also been given assurances that no consequences would follow if he agreed to release PERSON . However , he would not accept anything less than the departure of the police . There were no indications that PERSON had any particular enmity vis - \u00e0 - vis the police . In any event , it would have been extremely improvident for the police to withdraw and leave PERSON in his hands .", "CARDINAL . NORP The non - involvement of psychologists , who had been sought but not found , did not affect the validity of the commission \u2019s conclusion concerning the manner in which the negotiations had been conducted . The police used the deputy director of GPE police as principal negotiator , an officer with great experience in dealing with people , who immediately won PERSON confidence and who communicated with him until the end . Trained negotiators , members of the police force , were also present . Their knowledge was used and they could have intervened if mistakes had been made . Moreover , the police used all available persons who could have influenced PERSON in the direction of abandoning his plan .", "CARDINAL . No attempt to prolong further the negotiations could be made , as there were grounds for believing that PERSON was determined to abide by his deadline . PERSON made repeated and consistent references to something which would happen at TIME on DATE . The symbolic importance of the time chosen could not be easily ignored .", "CARDINAL . There was nothing reproachable in the GPE police director acting as commanding officer . An attempt was made to disperse the crowd . The suggestion of counsel for the families of the deceased that the police missed several opportunities to neutralise PERSON , when he opened the window to take the telephone , the cigarettes and the food , was entirely unrealistic .", "CARDINAL . When deciding to dispatch the MMAD the chief of police acted responsibly , correctly and within his competence . All necessary information had been made available to him . There was no indication that the involvement and deployment of the MMAD had been decided and planned in a sloppy manner . The MMAD was a body specially trained to deal with such situations , which could not be handled by ordinary police officers . It was wrong to assume that the MMAD could only be used against terrorists or in wartime operations .", "CARDINAL . Despite some testimony to the contrary , the commission was satisfied that the food which PERSON had ordered arrived at TIME The pharmacist who provided the drugs and Dr A. GPE agreed that the soporifics which were administered to the food would have started producing their effects within TIME . The other expert , ORG , made a distinction between the time which the particular soporific took to produce its effects , which she put at approximately thirty- TIME and the time the drug took to produce its maximum effects , which she put at TIME . These estimates , however , applied to situations where a normal dose had been administered . In any event , even if the wrong dose or the wrong drug had been administered as suggested by the applicants , PERSON did not eat the food and the operation could not have been planned exclusively around that factor .", "CARDINAL . The police formed the view that PERSON was planning to kill PERSON and commit suicide at TIME on the basis of all necessary and available information . This was the opinion of PERSON doctor , who had had extensive discussions with him . PERSON had told the director of GPE police verbatim : \u201c There is no Christmas for us , I will celebrate DATE with PERSON and at TIME you will come inside and take her . \u201d PERSON herself claimed that PERSON intended to kill her . PERSON had not accepted any of the assurances offered to him and had threatened to shoot whenever it had been suggested to him that somebody might try to enter the flat .", "CARDINAL . There was no indication that the police were in a hurry to close the matter before TIME because it was DATE , as suggested by the applicants . The fact that the police had not been fully informed about the particulars of PERSON relationship with PERSON could not have affected the validity of their assessment of the situation . Although reference had been made to PERSON having been abducted , the police knew that PERSON had not initially been taken to PERSON flat against her will .", "CARDINAL . The head of the MMAD platoon carefully inspected the scene , gathered information about the layout of PERSON flat and was fully briefed about the events preceding his arrival . He was also in possession of all the information which had been made available to him subsequently or which he had himself acquired . That the sole aim of the operation was to save PERSON life was proved by the fact that no explosives were used to break down the door and no stun grenades were thrown . The use of a water hose , multiple entries or an observer by the skylight would not have been advisable in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The armed intervention was planned for TIME in the hope that PERSON could be persuaded to release PERSON . The head of the MMAD platoon had relied on surprise , quickness and accuracy to ensure the success of the armed intervention . No disproportionate importance should be attached to the fact that some of the expert witnesses would have planned the armed intervention in another manner . The test to be applied was whether the head of the MMAD platoon had planned the armed intervention in a \u201c reasonable \u201d manner , which he had done .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was not taken by surprise because of an unauthorised telephone call which he received just before the armed intervention . PERSON could have answered the phone without lifting the receiver by activating the loudspeaker facility . When the first officer of the MMAD entered the flat he found PERSON hiding behind PERSON and pointing a gun at him . PERSON fired QUANTITY shots , one at the MMAD officer and CARDINAL at PERSON . The commission of inquiry did not accept expert testimony to the effect that the second shot was not aimed at PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The commission of inquiry rejected the suggestion that the officers entered the flat with the intention of killing PERSON out of vengeance . It also considered that the officers of the MMAD could not exclude the possibility that the second cartridge in PERSON gun had not been used because the QUANTITY shots had been fired immediately one after the other . When the officers entered the flat , they did not see whether PERSON was still holding his gun . Moreover , the possibility could not be excluded that PERSON could be in possession of other weapons . As a result , the commission of inquiry did not consider it necessary to determine whether PERSON gun could have accidentally fallen on the armchair where it was eventually found . The officers saw PERSON in front of PERSON , her back to the door . She moved together with PERSON and , as a result , they considered that he was using her as a shield .", "CARDINAL . NORP The officers were justified in their decision to start shooting as soon as they entered the flat because they were under the impression that their lives and that of PERSON were in danger . As long as PERSON moved , they considered that the threat persisted . They shot repeatedly at PERSON torso and head , as they had been trained to do , in order to neutralise him as quickly as possible . CARDINAL bullets were used . When PERSON fell on PERSON right shoulder , her body left part of his torso and his pelvis uncovered . All the shots were fired in a very short period of time and that explained why the last CARDINAL bullets penetrated PERSON body when his back or part of it was very close to or already touching the ground . The situation was comparable with that in the PERSON , PERSON and PERSON case in which ORG considered that firing CARDINAL shots at a person lying on the ground engaged no responsibility when the aim of the person firing was to neutralise a perceived risk . No inferences could be drawn from the exercise by CARDINAL MMAD officer of his right not to incriminate himself .", "CARDINAL . NORP The commission of inquiry considered that , taking into consideration the explanations provided by the ORG pathologist , the latter was right in considering that the wounds inflicted on PERSON by shot fired from PERSON gun contributed to her death . Although PERSON had a different view , he specified that \u201c it would be also a matter for the surgeon who saw the wound in life \u201d . PERSON also accepted that the wounds inflicted by PERSON contributed to PERSON death . However , he specified that PERSON would have died even if these wounds had not been inflicted .", "CARDINAL . The commission considered that PERSON was injured by the officers of the MMAD because \u201c she had moved when they were shooting to save her \u201d . In accordance with expert testimony , the presence of an ambulance at the scene would not have made any difference to PERSON fate .", "CARDINAL . In the light of all the above and relying , among other things , on the findings of ORG on the merits of application no . CARDINAL ( ORG , PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ) , the commission of inquiry concluded that the use of force by the officers of the MMAD , as a result of which PERSON and PERSON died , was no more than absolutely necessary for the rescue of PERSON and the self - defence of those who carried out the rescue operation and fell within the exceptions in LAW ( a ) of LAW and LAW ( a ) of the LAW . Neither was there any lack of due care in the planning of the operation . Although no criminal acts had been committed and the police could not be criticised in any way for their handling of the case , the commission of inquiry recommended that the Government should examine the possibility of making an ex gratia payment to the families of the deceased on the basis of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE of ORG in the case of GPE v.
