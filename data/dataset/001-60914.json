ITALY (No. 2) [Extracts]", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Not necessary to examine Art. 13;Not necessary to examine Art. 14;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he worked as a prosecutor at the GPE public prosecutor 's office .", "CARDINAL . At an election meeting in GPE on DATE , Mr PERSON , a member of the NORP parliament , made the following speech :", "\u201c I had heard of GPE because of the misdeeds of a prosecutor called GPE , who gave it its only claim to fame with the inquisition he conducted and is still conducting there , while being defamatory of the LOC . I will pursue my fight against those judges who are in cahoots [ collusi ] with the [ political ] parties , who just want to wage political battles instead of defending justice . ... I remember something unacceptable ... : out of a delusion of omnipotence and wish to dominate , this prosecutor sent CARDINAL carabinieri ... to seize the membership lists of ORG . Bugger off , GPE , bugger off [ GPE , vaffanculo ] ! You should not tolerate a judge spending your money for his own greater glory , just to assert himself . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At a second meeting , which took place in GPE on DATE , Mr PERSON made another speech , the following extracts of which are relevant to the present case :", "\u201c The first town in GPE to do so , GPE nominated a candidate for the ' Miss GPE ' competition , thus creating a contrast with that ugly mug GPE , who has brought a complaint against me ... You know there are some complaints I am proud of , but I simply said something about this Mr GPE which he knows is true , that he is nicknamed ' bulldog ' [ mastino ] ; and I said he looked so much like an actor that he could play both the policeman and the police dog , and he brought a complaint against me ; I thought he did n't have much of a sense of humour , but I 'm not worried about the complaint , because if someone is happy to be nicknamed ' bulldog ' , and he really looks a bit like one , it 's hard to understand why he gets annoyed over one of my jokes ; but , to show how the national legal service take advantage of their power , he has brought a complaint against me , and I 've even been sent for trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As he considered that his honour and his reputation had been attacked by Mr PERSON 's remarks , the applicant lodged a complaint for aggravated defamation .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , the NORP public prosecutor 's office committed Mr PERSON for trial before GPE and set the hearing date for DATE . On the latter date the applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated DATE , the text of which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG gave Mr PERSON a suspended sentence of DATE imprisonment , and ordered him to compensate the applicant for the damage suffered , with quantum to be determined at a civil trial . It also awarded the applicant an immediate payment of MONEY ( MONEY ) to be offset against the total award of damages .", "CARDINAL . ORG began by stating that it had not considered it necessary to stay the proceedings in order to seek the opinion of ORG . It was clear simply on reading the charges that the remarks in issue had not been made in the exercise of parliamentary functions ; they were therefore not protected by the constitutional safeguard of parliamentary immunity ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ) . In relation to the merits of the case , ORG observed that , leaving aside the plainly vulgar and insulting expressions ( the word \u201c vaffanculo \u201d in particular ) , Mr PERSON 's allegations tended to depict the applicant as a self - regarding prosecutor who used his office and public money exclusively in pursuit of his own greater glory , and who did not serve the interests of justice but those of certain political parties . In the circumstances , there could be no doubt that Mr PERSON 's allegations were defamatory . Although , like any other citizen , he was entitled to criticise a member of the national legal service , he should do so in polite terms and refer to objective and precise facts , which he had not done . On the contrary , Mr PERSON had started a personal quarrel by alleging , in an entirely unspecific and unjustified manner , that the applicant had behaved unethically .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed against that judgment . He applied for the proceedings to be stayed and the file to be remitted to ORG . That application was founded on LAW no . DATE ( as then in force ) , under which if a court rejects a defence based on the applicability of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW pleaded by CARDINAL of the parties , it is required immediately to forward a copy of the file to the legislative chamber to which the parliamentarian belongs . Once the file has been forwarded the proceedings are thereby stayed until the legislative chamber concerned has debated the issue . Such a stay may on no account last for more than a total of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , the GPE ORG upheld the first - instance decision . In relation to the application for a stay , it observed that ORG had already remitted the file to ORG , which had thus had an opportunity to debate the question of the applicability of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW . Moreover , the statutory time - limit of CARDINAL had long since expired .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , ORG stayed the proceedings and ordered the file to be remitted to ORG . The question was first examined by ORG ( ORG le autorizzazioni a procedere ) , which proposed a finding that the facts on the basis of which Mr PERSON had been tried did not concern opinions expressed in the exercise of his functions , and that LAW was therefore not applicable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a debate on the issue , ORG in plenary session rejected ORG proposal by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , with CARDINAL abstentions .", "CARDINAL . In a written submission dated CARDINAL DATE , the applicant , considering that the decision of ORG had wrongly encroached on the jurisdiction of the courts , requested ORG to raise a conflict of ORG powers before ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the text of which was lodged with the registry on DATE , ORG quashed the judgments of the Reggio di ORG and ORG , declaring them null and void on the ground that the accused had been acting in the exercise of his parliamentary functions .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that CARDINAL interests enshrined in the LAW were in conflict : on the one hand , the autonomy and independence of ORG , and , on the other , the right of all citizens to ask the courts to uphold their right to have their reputation protected . A resolution by which a legislative chamber recognised that a certain act or statement was covered by LAW halted all criminal , civil or administrative proceedings against the parliamentarian responsible for that act or statement , and therefore resulted in the first interest prevailing over the second . Such resolutions could not be quashed by the ordinary courts . However , the courts could raise a conflict of ORG powers before ORG if they considered that , in the particular circumstances of a given case , ORG had wrongly exercised its powers , arbitrarily encroaching on and restricting the institutional jurisdiction of the courts .", "CARDINAL . In the opinion of ORG , the resolution of ORG of DATE had been neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable . Although it had widened the protection afforded by LAW to cover views expressed outside the ambit of parliamentary activities in the strict sense , a broad interpretation of the concept of \u201c parliamentary functions \u201d encompassing all politically inspired acts , even those occurring outside ORG , had often been adopted in the past , and was not per se manifestly contrary to the spirit of the LAW . ORG had thus been entitled to opt for such an interpretation without thereby exceeding its powers . Accordingly , ORG considered it unnecessary to raise a conflict of powers before ORG and quashed Mr PERSON 's conviction .", "... [ The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in GPE v.
