On DATE the respondent ORG filed a defence , inviting the court to dismiss the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed another submission with the first - instance court , further elaborating on his claim . The relevant parts of that submission read as follows :", "\u201c The PERSON \u2019s pastoral service was constituted ... on the basis of election by ORG and confirmed by the dean of the ecclesiastical district as well as the bishop of the ecclesiastical region . Its terms were laid down in the Letter of Appointment ... which remained in force during the period indicated in the case .", "The pastoral service was carried out by the Plaintiff in person . Its content and accomplishment has not been in dispute between the parties . The Plaintiff \u2019s pastoral activities were manifold . In particular , he was responsible for the community services of the Parish \u2013 e.g. preaching , handling the sacraments , outreach , evangelisation , maintaining the bond between the NORP and the ORG and various related tasks of pastoring , teaching and administration , which included the tutoring of his assistant and deputy pastor . The Plaintiff as pastor , together with the caretaker , represented the NORP and had numerous other administrative tasks as well . As part of his pastoral duties , the PERSON was also obliged to take part in management and teaching .", "Neither the establishment of the pastoral service relationship nor the substance of the resulting mutual obligations was the subject of any dispute between the parties involved .", "As to the legal classification of the pastoral service relationship itself ... we hold that the Plaintiff \u2019s activity is best characterised as agency because its content and nature correspond to the factual elements of an obligation of means necessitating personal involvement . For the above reason , we consider that the relevant rules are those of LAW on agency contracts ...", "Despite the fact that the Respondent \u2019s dean \u2013 the Plaintiff \u2019s immediate superior \u2013had already confirmed in writing the legal basis and the amount of the fees due for the period of suspension , in its correspondence dated DATE ... , these were , in fact , paid only partially . Namely , the pastoral cash allowance was paid only up until DATE and the fee due for religious teaching only up until DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant based his claim in the first place on Articles CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( as in force at the material time ) seeking payment of overdue fees stemming from an agency contract he believed he had with ORG . He maintained that for the period from DATE , when the suspension allegedly became unlawful , until the date of termination of his appointment , he was entitled to a fee for his services , which corresponded to the service allowance set out in his Letter of Appointment . He thus sought enforcement of the agency contract . Alternatively , he based his claim on ORG CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , which provided for damages for breach of the agency contract he had allegedly entered into with the respondent ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Pest Central District Court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim , holding as follows :", "\u201c An agency contract , according to the particulars of LAW of DATE on LAW ... is a mutual legal transaction ( Article CARDINAL ) . Such transactions are regarded by LAW as contracts of material exchange , as LAW , in accordance with LAW ) , typically regulates pecuniary rights .", "Contracts , by definition , are between parties with common material interests : they need whatever value the other has to offer . The goal of the contract is to obtain such value from each other .", "Pursuant to LAW , mutual property services are contracts for valuable consideration \u2013 with the notable exception of gratuitous CARDINAL - party transactions in which CARDINAL party provides a material service whereas the other is not obliged to do so . The alleged agency contract between the PERSON and the Respondent might be gratuitous if the agent receives no payment from the principal . Except that there was no statement from the PERSON to that effect . Quite the contrary : he filed the lawsuit with the clear intention of obtaining material gain from the Respondent . Thus it can be said that the Plaintiff based his claim on a non - gratuitous agency contract , as provided for in LAW .", "In view of the above , this required the Plaintiff to provide some sort of material service , interest or condition in return , something with clearly defined market value . The pastoral service provided by the PERSON ( according to exhibit no . CARDINAL , it also involved preaching , handling the sacraments , outreach , evangelisation and various related tasks of pastoring , teaching etc . ) , however , does not qualify as material service . It is , for all intents and purposes , religious activity .", "If the undertaking of mutually agreed conduct is not gratuitous , and the conduct of CARDINAL of the parties has no material value , then , according to the rules of LAW , there can be no civil - law contract for valuable consideration .", "Agency contracts , like all contracts , are based on mutual agreement : CARDINAL party makes a formal proposal containing all the key elements of the deal to another , which , in turn , issues a statement of acceptance \u2013 see LAW ) and ( CARDINAL ) , and ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The parties involved are free to negotiate terms on the basis of legal parity .", "The documents submitted show that the Plaintiff \u2019s appointment was an ecclesiastical process , the terms of his service were set out in a Letter of Appointment ... formulated by the Presbytery of his NORP . The Respondent and its officials exercised various rights vis - \u00e0 - vis the Plaintiff ( suspension , reprimand by the ecclesiastical court , relocation to service roster , demotion , etc . ) . Within the meaning of LAW , the parties did not negotiate the details of the service , and the Plaintiff became a pastor by appointment , not as a result of a binding agreement . Due to the lack of legal parity between the Plaintiff and the Respondent , the Plaintiff did not enter as a civil - law party into a legal relationship with another civil - law party .", "The lack of binding agreement means that the Plaintiff \u2019s primary claim DATE with reference to ORG and CARDINAL of LAW is insufficient to support his case .", "Pursuant to LAW , the rules of tort liability are applicable to liability for breach of contract . Once again , the lack of binding agreement means there was no breach of contract nor any material damage involved . In view of this , the Plaintiff \u2019s secondary claim is also unfounded .", "The acknowledgment of debt , by legislative nature and in practice , is a contractual institution which allows CARDINAL party to affirm its financial obligation towards another . Statements stemming from relationships beyond the control of civil legislation are , for that very reason , neither valid nor binding pursuant to LAW . The letter submitted by the Plaintiff ( illegible reference number ) as acknowledgement of debt is , in this context , rather irrelevant : the sender does not legally represent the Respondent , which might not endorse , or even share , his opinion .", "The documents and statements presented by the Plaintiff were sufficient for a review of the case . As the claim was unfounded , the amount at issue was not determined . The hearings of the bishop ... and dean ... were also deemed unnecessary as their opinions feature prominently in the documents and cover all necessary aspects . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It proves that a legal relationship was established between the Plaintiff and the Parish of ORG , an independent legal entity .", "In its pleadings ... , the Respondent referred to LAW and LAW of DATE , thus confirming that the Parish of G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 ... is an independent legal entity within ORG .", "In view of the above , the second - instance court came to the conclusion that the Plaintiff \u2019s claim was unfounded vis - \u00e0 - vis the Respondent , ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a petition for review with ORG , in which he stated as follows :", "\u201c .... ORG held that , based on the Letter of Appointment , the Plaintiff \u2019s legal relationship was with ORG . But , as indicated by us several times , the Letter of Appointment does not mention the lectures on ecclesiastical history the Plaintiff has been giving in a ORG . The fees for these lectures were paid by the Respondent to the Plaintiff directly . Our motions to take evidence were dismissed because of the decision of the first - instance court , which ORG overruled DATE but it is the lack of this very evidence that caused the second - instance court to disregard the difference between the nature and the remuneration of the above - mentioned activities .", "Pursuant to Articles CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW , a legal relationship \u2013 namely agency DATE is established when CARDINAL party ( the agent ) is obliged to provide quality service and the other ( the principal ) is obliged to pay for the said service in accordance with the agreement . As far as teaching is concerned , the Respondent was the sole principal . ORG had nothing to do with DATE which is evident from the fact that the fee was determined according to ORG standards ...", "The decisions of the courts are , first of all , only partially compliant with Article CARDINAL of LAW , which lays down the requirement of full justification , and secondly , constitute an infringement of multiple provisions of LAW , namely LAW ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , and much of the content of LAW . Due to the dismissal of our motions to take evidence , the contradictory decisions of the courts are not based on the true nature of the material service exchanged between the parties , and regard pastoral service and teaching in a ORG as one and the same , despite the fact that these activities greatly differ from each other in both nature and practice of execution ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The respondent ORG replied to this petition in a submission dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings , finding as follows :", "\u201c The Plaintiff commenced his action specifically in order to claim fees arising from his contractual relationship with the G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 Parish , as contained in his Letter of Appointment . He did not make any reference to a contract between him and the G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 Parish to provide teaching of church history , nor did he claim any fee in connection with such a contract . He submitted a claim regarding such a contract for the first time in his petition for review [ to ORG ] . Consequently , the fact that the lower courts did not analyse that contractual relationship between the parties and did not take evidence regarding that issue can not be considered an omission on their part ...", "In order to determine the rules applicable to the agreement in question and to the implementation of the rights and obligations arising from it , it is necessary to have regard to the very purpose of the agreement underlying the Plaintiff \u2019s actual claim as well as the elements thereof defining the parties\u2019 rights and obligations . The first - instance court rightly stated in its assessment that the agreement serving as the basis of the applicant \u2019s claim was not an agency contract under civil law or concluded by and between parties enjoying personal autonomy in the marketing of [ goods and services ] . The PERSON was appointed as a pastor in an ecclesiastical procedure , and the obligations of the Respondent were defined in an appointment letter issued by the assembly of presbyters . The parties established between themselves a pastoral service relationship , governed by ecclesiastical law .", "Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of Act no .

Under sub - section ( CARDINAL ) , no State coercion can be used to enforce the internal laws and regulations of Churches .", "Relying on the above provisions , the applicant can make a claim under the ecclesiastical law before the relevant bodies of ORG . The fact that the agreement entered into under ecclesiastical law resembles a contractual agreement under LAW does not entail ORG jurisdiction or the enforceability of the claim in a judicial procedure within the meaning of LAW . ( In the particular case , the basic elements of an agency contract and the execution of such a contract could not be established either . )", "ORG reached the same conclusion in the earlier proceedings when assessing the claim under ORG labour law and dismissing its enforcement in judicial proceedings .", "The first - instance court was right to point out that as the impugned agreement lacked a civil - law legal basis , the court could not examine the applicant \u2019s secondary claim ( compensation for breach of contract ) .
