He is the proprietor , editor - in - chief and journalist of a local DATE Komu i Czemu , published in the PERSON and ORG .", "CARDINAL . At DATE PERSON . , a local businessman providing services to a district hospital , visited PERSON , the district mayor ( starosta ) , to complain about GPE , the director of the hospital . It appears that the hospital owed some money to the businessman . PERSON . recorded the conversation and the following day passed it on to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to the district mayor and asked him to explain why he had delayed informing the prosecution authorities about the alleged corruption at the district hospital . In reaction to the letter , the district mayor summoned GPE to respond to those allegations . He also sent a copy of the applicant \u2019s letter to the prosecution service asking for the matter to be examined . In his letter to the prosecution service , the district mayor stated that the applicant \u2019s allegations were insinuations aimed at undermining the public trust in him . A copy of this letter was sent to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON . notified a local member of parliament ( \u201c MP \u201d ) that the director of the hospital had received bribes from PERSON . He stated that his recent conversation with the district mayor indicated that the latter had some knowledge about the bribe - taking . On DATE the MP relayed this information to the Minister of ORG and Administration . Subsequently , the information was transmitted to ORG and then , in turn , to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the article \u201c PERSON took bribes \u201d published in issue no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) , the applicant stated that \u201c the hospital director was being protected by the district mayor who knew that the subordinate director had taken bribes \u201d . In the article \u201c Corruption of Madame Director \u201d published in issue no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) the applicant wrote that the district mayor had known that GPE was corrupt but had not notified the prosecution authorities . The same allegation was made in the article published in issue no . DATE ) . In the article \u201c PERSON prosecutor examines PERSON [ the district mayor ] \u201d published in issue no . CARDINAL the applicant stated that \u201c the district mayor is obviously fibbing , because he received information that the director took [ bribes ] from CARDINAL sources \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the district mayor lodged a private bill of indictment against the applicant with ORG . He accused the applicant of defamation committed through the mass media under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The bill of indictment related to CARDINAL separate charges . The first concerned an article entitled \u201c Hey those district roads \u201d published in issue no . DATE in which the applicant had discussed mismanagement of road works in the district . The second charge concerned CARDINAL articles published by the DATE in DATE and DATE in which the applicant alleged that the district mayor had known that GPE was corrupt but had failed to inform the prosecution service . The district mayor claimed that the impugned articles lowered his standing in the eyes of the public and undermined the public confidence necessary for the discharge of his duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski ORG gave judgment . It acquitted the applicant of the first charge and convicted him of defamation committed through the mass media in respect of the second charge . ORG held that the applicant had wrongly alleged in his articles that the district mayor had known that GPE accepted bribes but had not informed the police about it , despite having been under a duty to do so . Thus , the applicant had lowered PERSON \u2019s public standing and undermined the public confidence necessary for the discharge of his duties . ORG sentenced the applicant to a fine of MONEY ( ORG ; MONEY ( ORG ) ) . It further ordered him to pay the private prosecutor \u2019s costs ( ORG CARDINAL ; LAW ) and the costs of ORG ( ORG MONEY ; ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . When examining the first charge against the applicant , the trial court observed that the contours of the offence of defamation specified in LAW were delimited on one hand by the protection of reputation and dignity of a person and , on the other , by socalled legitimate criticism ( dozwolona krytyka ) which derived from LAW . It noted that in accordance with the GPE case - law political or public activity inevitably resulted in subjecting officials to the judgment of the public opinion . Persons holding important offices were thus required to show a higher degree of tolerance to criticism .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the second charge , the trial court heard evidence from the applicant , the district mayor , PERSON . , PERSON and PERSON ( spokesperson of the district mayor ) . It further heard the recording of the conversation between the district mayor and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the applicant and the district mayor had once been good colleagues ; however their relations had deteriorated since PERSON \u2019s election as district mayor in DATE . From then onwards the applicant \u2019s newspaper had begun publishing articles virulently criticising the district mayor and his staff .", "CARDINAL . The court established that the local businessman PERSON . , who provided services to the local hospital and was dissatisfied with his cooperation with the hospital director ( GPE ) , had informed the district mayor that GPE had been taking bribes . PERSON . had recorded his conversation with the district mayor . Subsequently , he had provided the applicant with the content of the recording and informed him that he had given bribes to GPE", "CARDINAL . The court found that the applicant had alleged in a series of articles published DATE and DATE that the district mayor had covered up the corruption affair , without having verified the information received from PERSON . and disregarding the actual content of the recording .", "CARDINAL . The court further established that the applicant , when publishing a series of articles about the alleged corruption affair , had relied exclusively on the recorded conversation between the district mayor and PERSON . It noted that neither the recording nor the statements of PERSON . had confirmed the allegation that the district mayor had known about bribe - taking in the hospital , and thus the applicant \u2019s assertions had been untrue . Even if the district mayor had some misgivings about the management of the hospital it could not be inferred from that that he had specific knowledge about the corruption . The trial court noted that allegations of covering - up corruption were of immense gravity and that the applicant had published them without having them verified . It underlined that shortly after having received the applicant \u2019s letter of DATE the district mayor referred the matter of corruption allegations to the prosecution service . In the court \u2019s view , the applicant had flagrantly breached the journalistic principles of diligence and objectivity . The court further noted that in none of the impugned articles had the applicant referred to the uncertain nature of the presented information . The applicant , as an experienced journalist , should have been particularly cautious with the information received from the disgruntled businessman as he had been aware of a sharp conflict between him and the hospital management . However , he had failed to display particular diligence and had exploited that information for sensational purposes in making the district mayor and his alleged cover - up of the corruption the central part of his articles . The trial court referred to section CARDINAL of LAW which obliged journalists to display particular diligence in gathering and using the information , and , in particular , to verify the truthfulness of obtained information .", "CARDINAL . ORG held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c There is no doubt that by imparting information clearly presupposing that PERSON [ the district mayor ] had allegedly covered up the corruption affair [ the applicant ] not only did not demonstrate the requisite diligence but in general did not take the trouble to confirm and verify in any way the information he had received . Without having regard to the gravity of the allegations made against PERSON , the applicant hastily used the words of his informant for the purposes of settling his scores with GPE ... The articles discrediting PERSON did not serve anything but the personal satisfaction of [ the applicant ] , and the concern for the respect of law in the local hospital appeared to be of marginal importance .", "Having read the series of the above - mentioned articles it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the attention of the applicant was focused on damaging the reputation of the district mayor , while the hospital director PERSON was put on the sidelines . ... Besides , these actions constitute not the only but certainly the most far - reaching element of the personal war with PERSON waged in the weekly PERSON i czemu .", "Defamation committed with the knowledge that information and opinions concerning the behaviour or characteristics of another person are false never serve to defend a justifiable public interest .", "Such actions do not benefit from the protection granted to freedom of expression and the right to criticise under LAW of LAW or LAW .", "The real effect of the applicant \u2019s publication can not be assessed in isolation from the public office held by PERSON It is obvious that the office of the district mayor must be based on public trust and respect . Imparting by means of mass communication information about the alleged participation of the district mayor in the cover - up of a corruption scandal does not enhance his popularity . It risks not only the loss of the office , but also lowers his public standing creating an atmosphere of scandal and suspicion . ... By attributing to GPE behaviour constituting an offence and doing so by means of mass communication , PERSON made out all the statutory features of the offence specified in LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial court noted that the applicant published CARDINAL separate articles containing defamatory statements in respect of the district mayor within DATE . Those statements fell outside the limits of permissible criticism referred to in LAW since they had been untrue .", "CARDINAL . The trial court considered that the degree of the applicant \u2019s guilt was significant and for that reason the proceedings could not have been conditionally discontinued . \u2019s guilt and his financial standing which was beyond average . With regard to the latter , it had regard to the profits from the ownership of CARDINAL of the most widely read newspapers in the region . As regards other relevant factors , the court noted that the applicant had deliberately infringed the district mayor \u2019s reputation and had been motivated by personal animosity . At variance with the professional and deontological standards , he failed to respect the requirement of particular diligence when using information at his disposal . The trial court took further into account that the applicant had not in any way recognised that he had acted inappropriately .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He contested the factual findings of the first - instance court , in particular that the recorded conversation between PERSON . and the district mayor had constituted the only source of information about the bribe - taking . He further alleged that the first - instance court had erroneously assessed the evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski Regional Court upheld the first - instance judgment and found the applicant \u2019s appeal manifestly illfounded . It ordered him to pay costs of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG endorsed the lower court \u2019s findings . It noted that PERSON . had been in conflict with the director of the hospital which was related to unpaid invoices of his company . In the past he had frequently complained to the district mayor about the director of the hospital .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the recorded conversation and information passed orally by PERSON . to the applicant had constituted the only basis of the allegations made against the district mayor . According to the court , there was not a single statement of the district mayor in that conversation indicating that he had been aware of the alleged corruption of the director of the hospital . The allegations made by the applicant had been based on isolated parts of the conversation which were taken out of context . ORG also noted that the applicant had not sought comments from GPE At the time of the publication the applicant had not disposed of any information corroborating the alleged cover - up of the corruption . Nor had such information been disclosed during the trial . ORG , having regard to the evidence heard by the trial court , found that the district mayor had learnt about the alleged corruption in the local hospital from his conversation with PERSON . at DATE and then from the applicant \u2019s letter of DATE . It accordingly confirmed that the allegations raised by the applicant in his articles had proved to be untrue .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the case - law of ORG , it recalled that the limits of acceptable criticism were wider with regard to politicians than with regard to private individuals . However , it did not follow from that that the insulting of a politician could go unpunished .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
