The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a film director , historian , and author of press articles often commenting on current issues . The Government contested that the applicant could be considered a journalist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant participated in a debate on a regional radio station , ORG . During the debate he stated as follows :", "\u201c ... among the informers ( informator ) of the [ communist - era ] secret political police is Professor [ J.M. ] \u2013 this information confirms the theory that among those who speak out the most against lustration are people who have good reasons for doing so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant called PERSON an \u201c informant \u201d ( konfident ) on television . The matter was widely commented on in the media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a special commission set up at ORG to examine the problem of covert surveillance of academics issued a statement in the case of PERSON The statement included a list of documents concerning PERSON , which had been found in the archives . The commission concluded that those documents had not led it to the unequivocal conclusion that PERSON had been a collaborator with the secret police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON brought a civil action for protection of his personal rights against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG allowed the action . It ordered the applicant to pay MONEY ( ORG ) to a charity and to reimburse the claimant LAW for the costs of the proceedings . The applicant was also ordered to publish an apology for having damaged the claimant \u2019s good name in CARDINAL national and regional newspapers , on CARDINAL national TV channels and on PERSON . The court considered that the applicant had clearly used several expressions indicating that the claimant had been a secret collaborator with the DATE secret services . The main question to be considered was whether such statements could be considered true .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that PERSON was a distinguished linguist and wellknown person in GPE . He was a member of ORG and for DATE had been presenting a programme on television . The court established that DATE PERSON had been summoned by agents of the secret services on CARDINAL occasions for interviews in connection with applications he had made for passports and returns from stays abroad . This was not contested by the claimant , who had himself made this information public . In DATE PERSON had been formally registered as a secret collaborator ( a \u201c NORP \u201d ) . Other notes from ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) archives indicated that until DATE a CARDINAL - volume file on the claimant had existed ; however , the file could no longer be found at the ORG branch of the ORG .", "The court noted that the case of PERSON had been examined by a special commission set up at ORG to examine the problem of covert surveillance of academics , but that the commission had been unable to reach any unequivocal conclusions .", "CARDINAL . The trial court heard the applicant and the claimant as well as a number of witnesses : historians ( specialists on lustration ) , former agents of the secret services assigned to recruiting collaborators at ORG , and employees of the ORG . Some of them testified that many files on secret collaborators had been destroyed when the regime fell in DATE . A few witnesses testified that they had not known of any case of fictitious registration of somebody as a secret collaborator or of a situation in which the services had kept a file on somebody for DATE even though he or she had not actually been collaborating .", "The director of the ORG branch of the ORG testified that he had heard of an instance of fictitious registration of somebody as a ORG . However the probability of such a situation was very low . He also declared that on the basis of the available documents , he would not have concluded that the claimant had been a NORP police informant . Another historian called to testify declared that it had been impossible to draw any unequivocal conclusions . A third historian stated that the claimant had been a \u201c real agent of the security service \u201d . A fourth historian testified that the internal files of the secret services were reliable ; the regime would only falsify documents for external purposes . The same witness considered that on the basis of the information available to him , he would also have concluded that PERSON had been an intentional and secret collaborator with the DATE secret services .", "CARDINAL other witnesses , former agents of the secret services , were unable to remember whether they had recruited PERSON as a secret collaborator .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that once he had discovered that PERSON was on the list of secret collaborators with the secret services it had been his duty to inform the public about it . His intention had not been to offend the claimant . He had acted in the general interest , taking part in a public debate on matters of considerable importance to society . Moreover , his assertion had been provoked by public statements made by the claimant , who had questioned the importance of lustration . The applicant also argued that he had not alleged that the claimant had caused harm to other people or that he had been paid for his services . The information provided by him - that PERSON had been a collaborator - had therefore been truthful and given in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the court noted that no documents confirming that the claimant had agreed to be a collaborator or that he had actively reported to the secret services were available . The court referred to the definition of collaboration contained in the DATE LAW and reiterated that collaboration had to be intentional , secret and consist of passing on information . It concluded that registration by the secret services alone was not sufficient to consider that someone had been a secret collaborator .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment . He argued that the registration of PERSON as a secret collaborator by the services , in light of generally known facts , had allowed him to conclude that he had been a collaborator . PERSON had remained registered as a ORG for DATE , his files had been destroyed , and the secret services had not been known for falsifying their internal files . According to historians , in DATE the services had only destroyed the files of important collaborators . The applicant underlined that he had acted in the general interest as the claimant had been a public figure who had recently criticised the process of lustration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It further ordered the applicant to pay the claimant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL as reimbursement of the costs of the appellate proceedings . The court accepted all the findings of the first - instance court regarding the facts of the case . It considered that when personal rights had been breached by a statement of alleged facts , the illegality of such action could be excluded only if the statement contained truthful information . Acting in the general interest did not exclude responsibility for making untrue statements . In the present case there was no evidence , in the form of either documents or witness statements , proving that PERSON had indeed actively collaborated with the secret services . Therefore , in the light of the material collected in the case , the court concluded that the applicant had not proved the veracity of his statements . Furthermore , the court considered that the applicant had not fulfilled his duty to act with particular diligence and caution in making serious allegations on the basis of unconfirmed circumstantial evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment and requested that a hearing be held .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing , held on DATE , ORG announced the judgment and gave an oral summary of the reasons . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal but amended the text of the apology and limited its reach to CARDINAL national DATE newspaper and ORG . The applicant was ordered to reimburse the claimant a further ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the costs of the cassation proceedings .", "The text of the apology to be published by the applicant was as follows :", "\u201c I apologise to Professor PERSON for having made , on DATE , the untrue assertion that he had been an informer of the [ communist - era ] political police \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following the announcement of the judgment the applicant \u2019s lawyer requested the court to prepare written reasons and to deliver them to him . ORG judgment with reasons , CARDINAL pages long , was received by the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In analysing the interplay between CARDINAL competing rights \u2013 the right to freedom of expression and the right to protect one \u2019s good name \u2013 the court referred to a resolution of ORG ( DATE , III CZP QUANTITY OSNC DATE , nr CARDINAL , p CARDINAL ) . According to the conclusion of this resolution a journalist \u2019s actions would not be considered illegal if they were made in the public interest and the duty to act with due diligence was fulfilled . Imposing an obligation on a journalist to prove the veracity of each statement would unjustifiably limit the freedom of the press in a NORP society . However , ORG considered that this approach could not be applied to the applicant \u2019s case as his statement had been of a private nature and the applicant could not be considered to be a journalist with a socially necessary duty to inform . Therefore , the interpretation of the law adopted by the lower courts was correct . Making false allegations was illegal , whereas the question of due diligence would be taken into account only when assessing the fault of the defendant .", "CARDINAL . The court agreed with the facts as established by the lower courts in particular as regards the conclusion that the statement made by the applicant had not been true . Following the approach taken in the case thus far , the court considered that making an untrue statement that offended the personal rights of a person would always be contrary to the law . Breaching someone \u2019s personal rights would not be against the law only if the statement could be proven to be true . An untrue statement would remain illegal even if all efforts had been made to diligently collect and examine its factual basis . In consequence , whether the applicant had acted in good faith and in the public interest or believed that the statement had been true did not influence the illegality of his action and could only be considered when assessing his financial liability for offending the personal rights of Mr J.M."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
