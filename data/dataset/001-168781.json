M.K. , the applicant \u2019s son born in DATE , was taken to ORG on DATE suffering from an acute episode of paranoid schizophrenia . ORG is a public institution of GPE specialising in neurology , orthopaedics , psychiatry and pulmonology . It is situated on a vast area outside the city center in the west of the green - belt of GPE , consisting of CARDINAL hospital buildings with annexes , a church , a museum , a theatre and a large park .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE , ORG ( LOC ) ordered PERSON \u2019s involuntary placement in the psychiatric unit of that hospital pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Hospitalisation Act ( Unterbringungsgesetz ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE TIME failed to return from an authorised walk in the hospital grounds . He had escaped from the LOC and died after jumping in front of a subway train .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in DATE the applicant brought a civil action in ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr GPE ) under LAW ( Amtshaftungsgesetz ) against GPE ( PERSON ) as the authority responsible for the hospital , seeking compensation of MONEY ( ORG ) plus interest in respect of nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . She stated that in DATE and DATE her son had already undergone inpatient treatment for paranoid schizophrenia at ORG and ORG ) . Hospitalisation had been ordered on DATE because PERSON had posed a danger both to himself and others . He had attacked a chewing gum dispenser with a sledgehammer and appeared to be utterly confused when the police arrived on the scene . The expert PERSON , who was called to assess PERSON \u2019s mental state , diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia . Because of ORG delusional behaviour , there was a risk that he would harm himself or others . The expert concluded that ORG mental state required him to be placed in a closed psychiatric institution .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on CARDINAL and DATE CARDINAL PERSON managed to escape from the closed ward of ORG and was found and brought back only after a search conducted by the police and the hospital staff . On DATE he escaped from the open ward to which he had been transferred in the meantime , and committed suicide by jumping in front of a subway train .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant claimed that she had suffered a massive shock as a result of her son \u2019s death . Before his involuntary placement in the hospital , GPE had lived with her in the same household and they had had a very close relationship . The applicant claimed that as a result of his death she had suffered from depression and insomnia and had been seeing a psychotherapist since DATE . Nonetheless , her mental state had not improved since .", "CARDINAL . The fact that her son had been able to escape from the hospital LOC led the applicant to conclude that the hospital staff had acted negligently in the performance of their duties . Because PERSON \u2019s behaviour had been unpredictable , he should have been under strict supervision . In the circumstances , and especially because he had managed to escape twice before , restriction of his freedom of movement within a closed ward was proportionate , necessary and adequate . Furthermore , such restriction should have included a degree of supervision by the hospital staff . The contract for ORG treatment had included duties of protection and care . There had been signs of suicidal thoughts on the patient \u2019s part , and the hospital staff should therefore have prevented him from leaving the ward . However , the necessary diligence had not been exercised . For these reasons , the applicant claimed that GPE had been at fault and was therefore responsible for the non - pecuniary damage she sustained .", "CARDINAL . GPE asked ORG to dismiss the applicant \u2019s claim . It argued that GPE \u2019s involuntary placement in the psychiatric institution on DATE had been necessary as he had not been aware of his mental illness and had refused to be treated . At the time , he had been utterly confused and it had not been possible to reason with him . Because of the threat he posed to himself and others , he had repeatedly had his freedom of movement restricted whilst in hospital and had had to be medicated parenterally . On DATE he had left the acute station without permission and went to his GPE place . When the police and the ambulance brought him back to the hospital , he had had to be sedated intravenously because of the highly psychotic state he was in . On DATE , DATE , he escaped again from the acute station , but was apprehended by the hospital \u2019s security staff on the premises of the hospital . However , from DATE , ORG attitude changed and he became willing to take oral medication . From DATE on , his freedom of movement was no longer restricted . He had appeared well - adjusted and friendly . In view of the progress in his treatment , and as he appeared more reasonable and able to abide by agreements , he had been transferred from the acute station to the subacute ward on DATE . However , he had then succumbed to socalled \u201c dynamic exhaustion \u201d ( dynamische PERSON ) , which manifested itself in a noticeable loss of drive and the desire for a quiet environment . The hospital staff had therefore tried to animate PERSON through occupational therapy and recreational walks in the hospital grounds , which \u2212 on the basis of a well - documented medical order \u2212 he had been allowed to take on his own as of DATE . This medical order had taken into account the fact that PERSON had twice before escaped from his ward . Thereafter , however , PERSON had continued to receive treatment for DATE and there had been a considerable improvement in his condition . Moreover , he had been made aware that he was not allowed to leave the hospital LOC and had to notify the staff before going out for a walk and again upon his return . He had also been permitted to leave the building to smoke a cigarette . The hospital had maintained detailed documentary records of his medical treatment and progress . There had been no indication of suicidal thoughts . However , on CARDINAL DATE at CARDINAL.CARDINALpm the doctor on duty was informed by the hospital staff that the applicant \u2019s son had not returned from an authorised walk in the hospital grounds and had apparently taken his personal clothing with him . A search operation had immediately been initiated on the LOC and at the same time the police had been asked to search for him . At TIME the police informed the hospital that GPE had been killed in a subway train accident at TIME .", "CARDINAL . GPE submitted that under the provisions of LAW and in keeping with current practice in the treatment of mentally ill patients , \u201c open \u201d psychiatry was the norm and restriction of a patient \u2019s freedom of movement was permissible only in cases of absolute necessity and within the bounds of proportionality . In the present case , by CARDINAL DATE restriction of the physical movement of the applicant \u2019s son ( known as \u201c fixation \u201d ) , and/or the spatial restriction of his movement to the confines of a psychiatric bed , or his permanent supervision , were no longer medically indicated , nor would such measures have been reasonable or adequate . On the contrary , the lack of any indication of suicidal thoughts on the part of GPE would have rendered any further restriction of his freedom of movement unlawful under LAW .", "CARDINAL . During the oral hearing of DATE the applicant reduced her claim to CARDINAL ORG plus PERCENT interest per annum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the claim . It found that even shortly before his death on CARDINAL DATE , it could be assumed that GPE still posed a threat to himself and others , in particular because he still suffered from the delusional idea that he was a different person and did not recognise his parents as his own . Self - harming behaviour could occur outside the hospital environment , due to overstimulation , even in patients who had shown progress after a psychosis . It was no longer possible to determine whether the applicant \u2019s son had jumped in front of the subway train in order to deliberately commit suicide , or whether he followed a spontaneous impulse or a delusional thought to that end . In any event the hospital should have made sure that he was not able to leave the hospital grounds , even if therapeutic walks were medically indicated and permissible in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . From a legal perspective , ORG affirmed that , as the authority responsible for ORG , GPE could be held accountable for any culpable action or omission by its organs or officials , pursuant to CARDINAL of LAW . At the material time , the applicant \u2019s son had been lawfully hospitalised by a decision of ORG of DATE , which remained valid until DATE . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW in force at the time provided that , in cases where hospitalisation had been ordered , it was also necessary to guard against threats potentially posed by the patient . Accordingly , the hospital was obliged to ensure restriction of the patient \u2019s freedom of movement in order to protect against potential damage . In the instant case , PERSON was allowed to take walks on the hospital premises because such walks were medically indicated . However , no measures were taken to ensure that he respected the restrictions on his freedom of movement . There was no effective supervision of his walks or their duration . By disregarding its duty of supervision , the hospital had implemented LAW incorrectly . It was immaterial that the applicant \u2019s son had not shown any signs of suicidal tendencies because the hospitalisation was originally effected because of the danger he posed to himself and to others . Therefore , even if he did not pose a threat to himself anymore , the requirement for hospitalisation was still valid because of the threat he posed to others . In the instant case , the lack of supervision of GPE resulted in the applicant having to suffer the shock of the death of her son . The court concluded that the civil claim was justified and granted the applicant LAW plus interest by way of compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . GPE appealed , claiming that the court had wrongly assessed the evidence , that its finding of facts was incorrect , and that it had wrongly interpreted the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) granted the defendant \u2019s appeal and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . In its view , there had been no causal link between the wholly unexpected suicide of the applicant \u2019s son and the alleged dereliction of the hospital \u2019s duty of supervision under LAW . Although it was stated in the hospital admission report that there was a danger of ORG putting himself and others at risk due to his disoriented state , it was also explicitly mentioned that he had no suicidal thoughts . According to the expert opinion by Dr P of CARDINAL DATE , the continuation of ORG hospitalisation on CARDINAL DATE was indicated only because of the threat he posed to others , in particular to his mother , but no longer to himself . This was the reason why his freedom of movement at that point had been restricted to the hospital LOC rather than just the closed ward . The court found that in the light of the improvement in his symptoms , it was not unusual that he had been allowed to take walks for therapeutic purposes , even if it might have been advisable to allow these walks only when accompanied by hospital staff .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further affirmed that there had been no indication of self - harm during PERSON \u2019s entire stay at the hospital . He had not voiced suicidal thoughts or undertaken any actions of a suicidal nature . It could not be established whether his jumping in front of the subway train was a suicide which he had planned even before he left the hospital premises , or whether it had been a spontaneous act of self - harm resulting from his psychosis . Naturally , PERSON would not have been able to commit suicide if he had been prevented from leaving the hospital grounds . Even with patients whose psychotic symptoms had improved , the phenomenon of overstimulation could occur if they left the therapeutic environment , whereas such a situation was much less likely to occur within the confines of a hospital . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW referred , as its purpose , only to the protection of the life and limb of the mental patient himself and third parties . The behaviour of GPE had not been foreseeable because there had no longer been any indication of possible self - harm at the material time and his action was therefore not attributable to the hospital . The fact that the risk of self - harm could never be entirely excluded in the case of psychotic patients did not change this assessment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that at the time when PERSON had committed suicide , the initial decision by ORG on his hospitalisation had still been valid and was based on the assessment that he posed a danger to himself and others because of his paranoid schizophrenia . No new expert opinion had been obtained , and the hospital had not informed the guardianship court ( GPE ) that the threat of selfharm had ceased to exist . Consequently , the medical indication would still have been a restriction of GPE \u2019s freedom of movement . By failing to restrict his movement , the hospital had acted contrary to the court decision ordering his hospitalisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , upholding the legal and factual findings of ORG . It added that a lawful implementation of LAW was possible both inside and outside a closed ward . PERSON \u2019s hospitalisation had therefore not been unlawful , even though he had been placed in the open ward from DATE . Contrary to the applicant \u2019s line of argumentation , ORG had not had a duty to implement ORG decision on ORG hospitalisation in a manner which compelled it to restrict his movement . This followed from section CARDINAL of the Hospitalisation Act \u2013 according to which a hospitalisation order could be lifted at any time by the head of the institution \u2013 and section CARDINAL , which stated that restriction of movement was permissible in limited cases only . ORG decision had not defined the extent or duration of any specific restriction of movement . LAW of the Hospitalisation Act provided that a restriction of freedom of movement might only be used as an exceptional measure and \u201c last resort \u201d . Also , ORG and CARDINAL of the LAW restricted the permissibility of isolating mentally ill patients . Even within a closed ward , mentally ill patients had to have the widest possible amount of freedom of movement . Only the more restrictive measures under LAW of LAW were subject to judicial review .", "CARDINAL . ORG also stated that from a therapeutic perspective PERSON had been allowed to take unaccompanied walks because of the improvement in his condition . Moreover , from the time he had been authorised to take these walks , he had always returned without problems . This measure , which had been ordered by the psychiatrist treating him , had therefore been proportionate and necessary pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW . In conclusion , the hospital had not acted culpably , for which reason the applicant \u2019s claim under LAW was not justified ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
