He was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s wife died on DATE at DATE . She had been in receipt of a retirement pension for DATE . He made a first enquiry in DATE to ORG about inheriting part of his wife \u2019s pension , and received a negative response . He reached State pension age in DATE . He made further enquiries over DATE about the possibility of receiving additional pension on the basis of the social security contributions paid by his wife , and submitted a claim for bereavement benefits on DATE . The claim was rejected by ORG on DATE . The applicant appealed , and expressly raised the issue of inherited pension . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( SSAT ) upheld ORG decision regarding bereavement benefits . It did not address the applicant \u2019s claim for inherited pension , as this matter had not been part of the decision under appeal . The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG . This was refused by a decision of the Commissioner of CARDINAL DATE , who held that the inherited pension issue had not been before the SSAT , which had therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider it . The applicant applied for permission to seek judicial review of the Commissioner \u2019s decision . Permission was refused by Mr Justice GPE on DATE , who observed that the Commissioners had been bound to refuse leave to appeal . He noted that the correct course of action for the applicant seemed to be to make a clear , separate claim for inherited pension . The applicant made a separate claim for inherited pension on DATE . He was informed by ORG , in a letter dated DATE , that his pension could not be increased . His subsequent appeal was held to be inadmissible . The SSAT informed him that since the relevant decision in his case dated from DATE , his appeal was out of time .", "The possibility of obtaining a higher retirement pension was introduced by LAW DATE . This made provision for the payment of extra social security contributions by employees , entitling them to receive Graduated Retirement Pension ( GRB ) along with the basic ORG contributory pension . Where a married man who had paid such extra contributions died , his widow was entitled to receive an additional pension equal to CARDINAL the rate of the deceased \u2019s GRB . This was payable immediately if the widow had already reached pensionable age , or upon reaching pensionable age , as long as she had not remarried . The scheme thus afforded some additional financial protection for widows in old age . Subsequent legislative reform ended the payment of graduated contributions in DATE . The right of widows already receiving part of their husband \u2019s ORG , or to receive it when they reached pensionable age , was preserved . ORG was replaced by ORG Earnings - Related Pension Scheme ( SERPS ) , introduced by the Pensions Act DATE . This too provided for widows to inherit part of the pension earned by their husbands .", "The right of widowers to inherit part of the additional pension earned by their wives took effect on DATE . Men widowed after that date could receive a higher pension on condition that their wives had satisfied the prescribed conditions and that both husband and wife had attained pensionable age at the time of bereavement , a condition that did not apply to widows . The social security position of widowers was generally improved as of DATE , from which date they became entitled , in principle , to an identical suite of bereavement benefits to widows ( for details of the relevant legislative provisions , see Runkee and NORP v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) . This group of widowers may inherit additional pension under the same conditions as widows . According to the ORG , ORG opted to achieve full equalisation in relation to inherited additional pension in stages . This will take effect on DATE . All widowers who reach pensionable age after that date , irrespective of when their wives died , will be able to claim additional pension on the basis of the social security contributions paid by the latter . This change will not , therefore , affect the applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
