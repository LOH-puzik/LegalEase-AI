The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was a judge and the President of ORG ( PERSON ) . He was also a member of ORG ( PERSON sudbeno vije\u0107e , hereinafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) . Sometime in DATE the ORG filed a request with the ORG to open disciplinary proceedings against the applicant . They alleged that from DATE the applicant had conducted sexual relationships with minors and that from DATE onwards he had used his position to protect the financial activities of CARDINAL individuals who were known for their criminal activities , and had thus caused damage to the reputation of the judiciary , which amounted to a serious disciplinary offence . For these reasons they proposed that disciplinary proceedings be instituted against the applicant and that a disciplinary sanction be imposed , including that he be permanently removed from office as a judge and as President of ORG . Furthermore , they asked for the applicant \u2019s immediate provisional removal from office during the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant . On DATE the applicant filed a motion seeking the withdrawal from the case of CARDINAL members of the ORG , namely GPE , PERSON and PERSON , on the ground that they had shown their bias towards the applicant in interviews published in various national newspapers . The motion was denied on DATE as being unfounded . At the hearing held on DATE the ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request that the hearings before it be public on the ground that the exclusion of the public was necessary for the protection of the interests of the applicant and the judiciary as such without any further reasoning . Further hearings were held on DATE and DATE . On DATE the ORG found that the applicant had committed a disciplinary offence in maintaining contacts and appearing in public with ORG and PERSON despite knowing that they had been convicted of numerous crimes , and of using his position to protect these CARDINAL ORG interests and gains from DATE . The ORG further found the remaining allegations against the applicant unfounded and thus requiring no disciplinary measures . It was decided to remove the applicant from his post as judge and President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent \u201c request for protection \u201d ( zahtjev za za\u0161titu ) to ORG PERSON ) was dismissed on DATE . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint in which he maintained that the proceedings had been unfair and that his right to respect for his correspondence had been infringed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the decision of ORG of DATE as well as the decision of ORG of DATE . ORG found that the disciplinary proceedings before the ORG had been defective because some of the evidence presented in the proceedings , such as audio recordings of intercepted telephone calls and testimony by a member of the ORG who sat on the ORG panel which considered the applicant \u2019s case , had not been obtained in accordance with the law . The case was remitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings the first hearing was held on DATE . The applicant filed a motion seeking the withdrawal from the case of CARDINAL members of the ORG , namely GPE , GPE , GPE , and GPE , alleging that they had failed to show impartiality in statements to the press . The ORG declared inadmissible the request for GPE \u2019s withdrawal , since he had already withdrawn from the proceedings . The request for the withdrawal of GPE , GPE and GPE was dismissed without any further reasoning .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further requested that the proceedings be public . The request was denied . The relevant part of the transcript from the hearing reads as follows :", "\u201c The President of the ORG informs those present that the public shall be excluded from the disciplinary proceedings because it has not been decided that the proceedings shall be public pursuant to LAW paragraphs CARDINAL of ORG .", "Defence counsel PERSON requests that the disciplinary proceedings be public , justifying the request by the gravity of the case , the general public interest , the importance of the proceedings and the need to protect the defendant \u2019s rights .", "Defence counsel GPE supports the request and adds that the right to a public hearing is the basic principle of criminal procedure and that the ORG \u2019s decision to exclude the public would be an attack on that right and would breach the fairness of the proceedings . If , however , the ORG decides to exclude the public from the proceedings , he requests that the ORG and ORG representatives who are waiting outside the courtroom be allowed to attend the hearings .", "Counsel for the Government M.K. leaves the decision to the ORG and adds that he is not opposed to the exclusion of the public from these proceedings .", "...", "The ORG announces its", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the Government dropped all charges against the applicant save for those alleging that in the period from DATE to DATE he had continually socialised in public places with CARDINAL individuals , GPE and PERSON , who had a criminal background . Counsel asked the ORG to CARDINAL witnesses on behalf of the Government in order to prove their case , without further explanations . The ORG allowed that CARDINAL of those witnesses be called and also ordered that CARDINAL further witnesses be called ex officio . The applicant and his counsels at that time had not asked that any witnesses be called .", "CARDINAL . The second hearing in the resumed proceedings before the ORG took place on DATE . The ORG allowed a representative of the ORG and a representative of the LOC to be present at the hearing . All present were warned , under threat of criminal sanctions , that they were obliged to keep secret all that they learned at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The ORG heard evidence from CARDINAL witnesses , including GPE and GPE , all of whom called on behalf of the Government . The evidence showed that the applicant had occasionally been seen in the company of ORG , where the applicant had a flat and was spending some of his holidays , and in the company of FAC in GPE , the applicant \u2019s hometown . Both PERSON and ORG stated that they had not been the applicant \u2019s friends , that they had no close contacts with the applicant and that they had occasionally been in the same company as the applicant , but always in public places and always in the company of other persons .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the Government nominated another witness to give evidence about the applicant \u2019s contacts with FAC in GPE . The ORG accepted that proposal . As to the evidence relied on by the applicant , the transcript of the hearing reads :", "\u201c Dr PERSON submits a written list of witnesses to be called on his behalf .", "... [ the defence counsel states as follows ] :", "\u2018 We call witnesses [ from the list of evidence ] to prove to the ORG that in the material period Dr GPE was indeed occasionally in the company of the persons with the alleged \u2018 criminal background\u2019 , but that each time , without exception , they were together with a large number of persons . Furthermore , PERSON was present only in his capacity as the owner of a restaurant and it was natural that as such he was occasionally present in the same company as Dr GPE . We call further witnesses who were often in the company of Dr GPE in GPE when GPE would occasionally join them . Our aim is to show the true nature of the allegation [ that the applicant ] \u201c had socialised \u201d and \u201c had been in the company of ... in public places \u201d ... \u2019", "...", "The defence counsel also asks that further witnesses , mentioned in the enclosed decision of ORG , be called", "...", "The ORG announces its", "...", "All proposals of the defendant PERSON are dismissed as unimportant , since the circumstances to which the evidence in question refers have either already been established or are of no importance for the decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The last hearing in the applicant \u2019s case before the ORG was held on DATE . The ORG allowed a representative of the ORG and a representative of the LOC and an interpreter to be present at the hearing . All present were again warned , under threat of criminal sanctions , that they were obliged to keep secret all that they learned at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG heard evidence from a further witness , called on behalf of the Government . It also heard the applicant , who stated that the proceedings against him had been politically motivated because of his opposition to the ORG \u2019s senior officials with regard to the concept of the judiciary . He also stated that on DATE he had been asked to resign from the office of President of ORG and offered a post as an Ambassador , which he had refused . As to the allegations against him , he stated that he had occasionally been in the company of the CARDINAL individuals concerned but that these meetings had always been in public and in the presence of various other persons , and that the individuals in question had not been his friends . The relevant part of his statement reads :", "\u201c ... as a high ORG official aware of my position and the responsibilities I bear , I can not and will not accept a demand ... asking me to forsake CARDINAL persons whom I knew before I was appointed to a position of responsibility in GPE . However , my acquaintanceship and relationship with them , irrespective of their past , never went beyond the boundaries of what was acceptable or would have made them questionable from the legal or moral standpoint . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The defence asked that CARDINAL further witnesses be heard concerning the facts of the case , which was denied .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG established that the applicant had committed a disciplinary offence in that he had maintained contacts and socialised in public places with CARDINAL individuals who had a criminal background , a behaviour which had harmed the reputation of the judiciary and was contrary to his judicial duty . He was dismissed from the office of judge and from that of President of ORG . The relevant part of the decision reads :", "\u201c Dr PERSON ... bears disciplinary responsibility", "in that he", "from DATE to DATE , while holding the post of the President and a judge of ORG , maintained contacts and appeared in public in GPE and GPE with GPE and PERSON although he had known that they had been known as delinquents", "...", "As to the exclusion of the public , the ORG held as follows :", "\u201c Under section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of ORG , disciplinary proceedings are in principle secret . Bearing in mind the nature of the disciplinary offence [ in question ] and the information in the case file , the ORG has dismissed the defendant \u2019s request that the proceedings be public , in order to protect the defendant \u2019s dignity and the dignity of the judiciary as such . Pursuant to LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW , in conjunction with LAW paragraph CARDINAL of ORG , the ORG has allowed the presence of ORG , employee of the ORG [ ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ] at the hearings held on CARDINAL and DATE , ORG , counsel for human rights at the OSCE [ Organisation for Security and Co - operation in LOC ] at the hearing held on DATE , and PERSON , member of the LOC mission to GPE and his interpreter PERSON at the hearing held on DATE . \u201d", "On DATE ORG upheld the decision .", "CARDINAL . In his subsequent constitutional complaint of DATE , the applicant complained , inter alia , about the exclusion of the public from the disciplinary proceedings against him . He also alleged that CARDINAL members of ORG , namely GPE , GPE and GPE , had been partial . He further complained that no witness called on behalf of the defence had been heard in the proceedings . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an interview with V.M. , a member of the ORG , was published in the national DATE newspaper \u201c GPE list \u201d . It was entitled \u201c GPE was a partisan candidate , not me \u201d , and the relevant parts of the interview read as follows :", "\u201c In the case at issue the ORG established that for DATE of time PERSON had had frequent public social contacts with QUANTITY persons who not only had been convicted of numerous criminal offences , but against whom criminal proceedings are currently pending - in CARDINAL case for assault on a policeman , and in the other for the trade of QUANTITY of heroin - and that he had even intervened on their behalf . PERSON was acquitted of all the other charges . All this harangue against the members of the ORG , and PERSON defence , are focussed on the part [ of the charges ] of which he was acquitted , so now many persons are unhappy because it does not fit into what [ the defence ] presented . The [ charges ] for which PERSON was found liable are clear on the facts . What is disputed is whether this amounts to a serious disciplinary offence and , if it does , which sanction is to be applied .", "...", "I joined Dr. PERSON \u2019s request [ for my withdrawal ] because I publicly voted against his appointment as President of ORG , and I was also mentioned as a candidate for the post of President of ORG ...", "... In the case at issue , telephone conversations were not a basis for the conviction because they concerned the part of the [ charges ] for which Dr. PERSON was acquitted . Therefore , all attempts to present the ORG \u2019s decision as contrary to law have failed . All the evidence called by the defence referred to the [ charges ] of which he was acquitted , and it was therefore dismissed as unnecessary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE an interview with ORG , the then president of ORG , entitled \u201c Judges are appointed , but also created \u201d was published in the same DATE newspaper . The relevant parts of the interview read :", "Question : \u201c -The National Judicial Council has lately been mentioned in public mostly in connection with the \u2018 Oluji\u0107 case\u2019 . What is the truth about the former ORG President ?", "Answer : - The decision has been taken and reasons have been given in it . I do n\u2019t think that I have to explain a reasoned decision , everything was said in it . For me these proceedings are in the past .", "Q : - However , for the sake of the public , which has received conflicting information about this case , could you be more specific ?", "A : - Since you insist , I shall just say that Dr PERSON has committed a disciplinary offence not only by \u201c socialising \u201d with perpetrators of numerous criminal offences , although this in itself is a serious matter for any president of ORG , but primarily because , while President of ORG , and aware of these NORP criminal activity , that is , that they belonged to the international criminal milieu , he used his personal influence and contacts in order to protect their interests and gains . Analysis of the evidence and defence [ pleadings ] clearly showed that the ORG \u2019s request to institute proceedings had in no way been politically motivated or a fabricated indictment put forward by the political and partisan elite , as Dr PERSON stated in his defence and alleged before the media , referring to the President of GPE . On the contrary , the case is about indecent activities which are incompatible not only with the office of ORG President , which Dr PERSON held for a short period , but with judicial ethics in general .", "Q : - And what about the interception of telephone calls ?", "A : - The interception of telephone conversations concerned legally recorded telephone conversations between the above - mentioned perpetrators of numerous criminal offences , but not at all Dr GPE \u2019s telephone conversations . [ Oluji\u0107 ] \u201c was netted \u201d by this operative measure , as CARDINAL of the witnesses expressed it illustratively .

These fabricated and unsupported statements , coming from a man who held a number of highly responsible functions in the NORP judiciary , where , due to his lack of experience and knowledge , he was a corpus alienum ( a foreign body ) , do not really deserve special attention because they belong to the place from which they originate , namely , the coffee - bars . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
