GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 14+P1-1-1 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property;Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Erik M\u00f8se;M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Mits;Yonko Grozev", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE and the second applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is the natural son of PERSON , who recognised paternity DATE after his birth . The first applicant had a personal relationship with his father and worked in his business . The father died on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for a certificate of inheritance attesting that he was entitled to PERCENT of the estate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG granted the certificate , upon which the first applicant took the estate into his possession and disposed of it . However , on DATE ORG withdrew the certificate , stating that the first applicant , being a child born outside marriage , was not Mr H. \u2019s statutory heir . The first applicant appealed against that decision , but on DATE ORG upheld it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant again applied for a certificate of inheritance stating that he was entitled to PERCENT of PERSON estate , referring in particular to ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the GPE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s application , holding that the judgment in PERSON ( cited above ) was not applicable to his case . Instead , it granted certificates of partial inheritance to the first applicant \u2019s CARDINAL - sister and to the grandchildren of the deceased \u2019s wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that under LAW of LAW , which states that children born outside marriage must be provided by legislation with the same opportunities as are enjoyed by children born within marriage , there were no reasons he should be treated differently from children born within marriage . He stated that if he was refused the certificate the NORP ORG would be liable for compensation claims .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG decision , holding that the first applicant was not a statutory heir . ORG referred to a decision by ORG of DATE , in which section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside ORG had been found to be in conformity with LAW . The principles developed in PERSON ( cited above ) were not applicable to the present case . There was a need to protect the legitimate expectations of the deceased and other heirs . ORG also considered that an interpretation of the relevant provision of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act in conformity with the case - law of ORG was not possible as the domestic law was clear and therefore not open to any interpretation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that the application of the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act would discriminate against him and breach his inheritance rights and therefore violate his right to equality before the law under LAW and his rights under LAW . The first applicant stressed that ORG reasoning disregarded the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON ( cited above ) and was therefore unlawful . The first applicant further noted that he had maintained a close relationship with his father until the latter \u2019s death and had even worked in his business . The first applicant \u2019s father had assumed that the first applicant would be his sole heir .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal on the grounds that it was bound by the decisions of ORG and that it had found that the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act was in conformity with LAW . ORG judgment in PERSON ( cited above ) did not require a change of position because NORP courts were not bound by the decisions of that court . ORG added that interpreting domestic law in the light of the Convention was restricted when domestic law was clear and therefore not open to interpretation . That was the case with the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act . ORG of Appeal further noted that the first applicant \u2019s appeal had been an appeal on points of law only . The first applicant \u2019s argument , therefore , that he had had a close relationship with his father , which was a statement of fact , could not be taken into account when deciding on the appeal because it had been submitted for the first time before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant is the natural son of a Mr B. and was born in the former GPE , where he lived until his flight from the country in DATE . In DATE Mr B. was ordered by the GPE - Blankensee ORG to pay maintenance for the applicant . He met his father on CARDINAL occasions , but was asked by the latter not to get involved in the lives of his wife and daughter . The father died on DATE , naming his daughter as sole heir in his will .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , after ORG had issued its judgment in PERSON ( cited above ) , the second applicant brought an action for a compulsory portion of the deceased \u2019s estate ( Plichtteilsklage ) with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s claim , holding that under the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act the second applicant was not a statutory heir . That provision was in conformity with LAW . ORG referred to ORG judgment of DATE . It noted that PERSON ( cited above ) was not applicable to the case at hand because there had been no regular contact between the second applicant and his father , the deceased had a natural daughter and the second applicant had not lived in the former GPE for most of his life .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that ORG in PERSON ( cited above ) obliged the NORP courts to grant children born outside marriage the same inheritance rights as those born within marriage . The special circumstances of PERSON ( cited above ) , which were referred to by ORG , were not conditions that had to be present in order to apply the principles laid down in that judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG upheld ORG decision , endorsing its reasoning . It referred to ORG case - law , arguing that there was a need to protect the legitimate expectations of the deceased .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed to ORG , which confirmed ORG reasoning in a decision on DATE . ORG argued that neither the old nor the amended first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act discriminated against children born outside marriage before DATE because the difference in treatment was based on legitimate grounds . Regarding the amended first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act , expanding the retroactive scope of the reform beyond the one adopted was not necessary as the basic principles of legal certainty and legitimate expectations had to be respected . Those principles were also necessarily inherent in the LAW , meaning that even though the inheritance rights of children born outside marriage fell within the scope of the protection of LAW , a ORG was dispensed from reopening legal acts or reviewing situations that pre - dated the delivery of a court judgment . ORG also noted that the facts at issue did not fall within the ambit of Article CARDINAL or that of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He claimed discrimination and therefore a violation of LAW by applying the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act because there were no reasons why children born outside marriage should be treated differently from those born within marriage . The case - law of ORG , which considered that provision to be valid , disregarded ORG in PERSON ( cited above ) and was therefore unlawful . That led to a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant also lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . Relying on the judgment in PERSON ( cited above ) , he complained that the application of the amended version of the first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act discriminated against him compared to children born within marriage . As a consequence he had been denied his inheritance rights .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed both applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints ( file FAC . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the judgment in PERSON ( cited above ) had led the NORP legislature to pass LAW of DATE ( Zweites Gesetz zur erbrechtlichen GPE nichtehelicher Kinder ) . The first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act of DATE had been changed retroactively , with the effect that the difference between children born outside marriage before and after DATE had been set aside in cases of successions after CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Even though the first applicant \u2019s claim of a close relationship with his father had only been made for the first time in his appeal to ORG , ORG noted that that statement of fact was not relevant for the issue before it . It declared both applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints admissible .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court confirmed the conformity of the amended first sentence of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act with LAW . It reiterated that the cases at hand only needed to be examined under LAW of LAW and not under LAW , which contained the right to protection of property . The difference between children born outside marriage before and after DATE had been abolished by LAW of DATE . The general discrimination against children born before and after that date therefore no longer existed . The time - limit in the new provision was not linked to personal characteristics but to a coincidental external event ( zuf\u00e4lliges , von au\u00dfen kommendes LOC ) . Any discriminatory treatment was therefore of a lesser degree .", "CARDINAL . Making the reform retroactive was not necessary as the conformity of the relevant provision of the Children Born outside Marriage ( Legal Status ) Act had been repeatedly confirmed by ORG . The PERSON case ( cited above ) had not changed that position because ORG had clarified in ORG v. GPE ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) that the principle of legal certainty , which was necessarily inherent in the law of the Convention as in NORP Law , dispensed a ORG from reopening legal acts or reviewing situations that predated the delivery of a judgment by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the domestic courts in the proceedings at issue had interpreted the relevant provision in accordance with LAW . ORG Human Rights\u2019 judgment in PERSON ( cited above ) did not necessitate a different interpretation , particularly because the first applicant \u2019s submission about a close relationship with his father had been made belatedly while the second applicant had not claimed any relationship with his father at all ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
