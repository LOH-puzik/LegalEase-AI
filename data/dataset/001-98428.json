In this respect , ORG would like to express its concern about a draft law on the modification and completion of certain legislative acts adopted in its first reading by ORG on DATE . According to this draft law , only persons having exclusively GPE citizenship are entitled to work in senior positions in the government and in several public services . From the information it has received , ORG understands that if this draft law enters into force as it stands , NORP citizens with multiple citizenship would be seriously disadvantaged compared with other NORP citizens in access to public functions . It thus appears that , if the law enters into force as such , this could lead to discrimination , i.e. unjustified differential treatment on the grounds of citizenship . ECRI understands that a wide - ranging debate is occurring within GPE at the time of writing this report as far as this draft law is concerned and that many sources both at the national and international level have stressed the need to revise the text thoroughly before its final adoption in order to ensure its compatibility with national and international standards .", "...", "CARDINAL .

The amendments introduced to LAW in DATE raised the electoral threshold from PERCENT , did not provide for electoral coalitions of political parties and socio - political organisations and introduced a ban on the exercise of elevated public functions by NORP citizens holding multiple nationality .

A new paragraph to LAW denies the right to \u2018 be elected\u2019 in parliamentary elections to \u2018 persons who have , beside GPE nationality , another nationality for the position of deputy in the conditions of LAW . LAW states that a person may stand as a candidate with multiple citizenship , provided he / she upon election denounces other citizenships than the NORP .

I strongly encourage you to obtain the approval by ORG in respect of the recent amendments to the legislation which will apply in the next elections , namely in what concerns the electoral threshold , the electoral blocs and the dual nationality .

On DATE , Mr PERSON , President of ORG , addressed a complaint to ORG alleging that PERSON no . CARDINAL was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG delivered a judgment on the constitutionality of PERSON no . CARDINAL . It found the PERSON to be constitutional and valid in its entirety . It held that the provisions of the PERSON were clear and unambiguous , that they were accessible in that they were published in ORG and that they were foreseeable as they enabled , with sufficient precision , NORP citizens wishing to stand for ORG but holding another nationality to adopt appropriate social - minded conduct to ensure that their rights were not curtailed . It emphasised that PERSON no . CARDINAL did not prevent dual nationals from becoming MPs as it offered them the possibility of complying with the law . It further considered the provisions of the PERSON to be in conformity with norms of international law , concluding that the various international instruments permitted GPE to stipulate incompatibilities relating to the holding of multiple nationalities by public officials .", "CARDINAL . The court also found PERSON no . CARDINAL to be in pursuit of a legitimate aim , namely loyalty to ORG , in the light of the importance of ORG sovereignty and the need for a permanent political and legal link between an elector and the ORG . It considered that for NORP citizens holding the nationality of another ORG , the significance of NORP citizenship was substantially diminished as such a person might not be guided only by the constitutional requirements of GPE and the interests of the NORP people but also by the interests of a foreign State . Accordingly , allowing MPs to hold dual nationality was contrary to the constitutional principle of the independence of the mandate of MPs , State sovereignty , national security and the non - disclosure of confidential information . In this regard , the court insisted that ensuring national security and consolidating NORP statehood had become an urgent necessity in the light of movements to undermine the Moldovan State .", "CARDINAL . The court also considered the interference to be proportionate since it did not affect the substance of electoral rights but merely made the exercise of the right to be an MP conditional upon holding exclusive NORP citizenship . ORG could choose between holding a job which required single citizenship and retaining their multiple citizenships but working in a different post .", "CARDINAL . As regards the argument that PERSON no . CARDINAL resulted in unequal treatment of NORP citizens , the court considered that the principle of equality should not be confused with the principle of uniformity . Those holding multiple nationalities were not in the same position as those holding single NORP nationality and the QUANTITY cases were therefore not comparable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE legislative elections were held . ORG obtained CARDINAL seats in ORG . The CARDINAL opposition parties gained CARDINAL seats altogether : ORG and ORG obtained CARDINAL seats each ; and ORG obtained CARDINAL seats .
