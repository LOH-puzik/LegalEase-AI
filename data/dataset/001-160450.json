NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON of ORG , a firm of solicitors based in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Ms A. McLeod , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant held the lease of premises housing a nightclub called ORG and was co - manager of the club . In DATE he was made aware of police concerns about high levels of drug usage at the club . He met with the licensing officer in DATE and in DATE and offered assurances that he took the problem very seriously and would introduce a \u201c CARDINAL tolerance \u201d approach to drugs on the LOC .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE an undercover police operation commenced into drug use at ORG . Over the course of the operation , CARDINAL undercover police officers attended the club and a number of them purchased ecstasy there from several drug dealers . A police raid on the nightclub took place on DATE . Around CARDINAL ecstasy pills were recovered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his co - manager were charged with permitting premises to be used for the supply of ecstasy DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s trial commenced at ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution case was that the applicant had failed to take reasonable steps to address the drugs problem in the club . They relied on evidence covering the indictment period , namely :", "- the detail and nature of the contact with police concerning the drugs problem by way of meetings and letters ;", "- the prevalence of drug dealing witnessed by members of staff and by the undercover officers , who successfully purchased drugs ;", "- the volume of drugs found during the search in DATE ;", "- oral evidence from former members of staff that in the period following DATE the management could have done more to address the drugs problem to which they had been alerted in warning staff as to their responsibilities ;", "- data recording the number of ambulances attending the LOC ; and", "- oral evidence to the effect that the management of the club had informed door staff that they should cut back on the number of searches .", "CARDINAL . The oral evidence from the undercover police officers was given anonymously and they were screened from the public , the defendants and defence counsel .", "CARDINAL . The club \u2019s former head of security , PERSON , who had worked at the club in DATE , gave evidence of the applicant \u2019s tolerance of drug dealing and his obstructive approach when he , PERSON , had tried to eject and report on those caught dealing drugs at the club . He also told the jury that he was a former ORG . PERSON was cross - examined by the applicant \u2019s trial counsel . It was put to him that he had been sacked by the applicant for stealing money and drugs from a drug dealer , rather than arresting him . PERSON denied this . It was further put to him that his dismissal had also been informed by the fact that he had been present at a drugs murder nearby DATE before . PERSON replied that he had merely been a witness to the murder and was assisting police in that capacity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant gave evidence in his own defence . He said that he was strongly opposed to drug use and supply . He and his staff had sought to enforce a policy of CARDINAL tolerance in relation to drug supply . He had responded positively to police warnings from DATE by replacing his ORG system and changing his security company . It was impossible to keep drugs out of the club , but he had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the supply of drugs .", "CARDINAL . In his summing up to the jury , the trial judge reminded the jury that PERSON had worked at ORG in DATE for DATE and so was not there during the period covered by the indictment .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant was convicted by a jury and on DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In his sentencing remarks , the judge commented that there had been \u201c large - scale , blatant supply of and use of ecstasy \u201d in the club , of which the applicant had been well aware and to which , at the very least , he had turned a blind eye in order to maximise the profits and reputation of the club . He referred , inter alia , to the evidence of the undercover police officers , of PERSON , of the club \u2019s head doorman in DATE , of other doormen at the club and of a customer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence , challenging the special measures permitted at trial to screen the undercover police officers when they had given evidence . The appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The court said it had no doubt that there was ample evidence , outside the evidence emanating from the undercover police officers , from which it would have been open to the jury to conclude that there was substantial dealing in drugs at the club and that no adequate steps had been taken by management to prevent or discourage the sale of drugs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c CCRC \u201d ) referred the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence to ORG . The statement of reasons set out a single reason for the referral , namely information giving rise to the \u201c real possibility \u201d \u2013 this being the criterion stated in the relevant legislation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) \u2013 that ORG would find the trial evidence of \u201c an important prosecution witness \u201d , namely PERSON , no longer capable of belief .", "CARDINAL . The report detailed new evidence not disclosed at trial that PERSON had been working as a doorman in another club in DATE and had offered to sell drugs to off - duty police officers . He had told the officers that he was earning MONEY a week from selling drugs . The ORG considered that this would \u201c severely damage \u201d the credibility of the witness . It was also revealed that PERSON had lied on oath by claiming that he was a former ORG . The statement continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In the course of its enquiries the ORG has located a further record which appears to be of relevance regarding [ ORG ] . The record , which is sensitive , is considered further in a FAC ( \u2018 FAC C\u2019 ) that will be provided to ORG and ORG . For reasons associated with the principle of ORG , FAC will not be provided to Mr ORG or his representatives . Whilst this course of action is contrary to the general practice of providing an applicant with full reasons for any decision made , the Commission considers that it is inappropriate in this case to pre - empt any decisions on disclosure that may be made by ORG or ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed the applicant that further sensitive information had been disclosed to ORG and to the prosecution . Again , for ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) reasons , a decision had been taken not to disclose the information to the applicant or his representatives . He was invited to make an application to the court or the prosecution for disclosure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted provisional grounds of appeal to ORG . His first ground claimed that his conviction was unsafe \u201c by reason of fresh evidence concerning [ PERSON ] \u201d . The grounds referred to the need for a \u201c detailed disclosure exercise \u201d in the light of the PERSON report including , in particular , disclosure of ORG to that report . Appended to the grounds was a schedule of disclosure requests . The defence invited the court to conduct a thorough ORG exercise and order disclosure of the file and such further material as might be relevant . He also invited the court \u201c to review the ORG exercise conducted by the trial judge DATE \u201d . Finally , the defence asked that the prosecution disclose all material concerning PERSON \u2019s role in the drugs murder in respect of which he had been cross - examined at trial and invited the court to review any relevant ORG material .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE further disclosure took place . A police statement of DATE confirmed that in DATE PERSON had claimed to off - duty police officers that he made MONEY a month selling drugs . A letter of DATE contained antecedents for PERSON Material related to PERSON \u2019s arrest and questioning in DATE about the drugs murder was also disclosed . A witness statement by the police officer who had given evidence at trial confirmed that he had \u201c commissioned a review of all material held by the police \u201d concerning PERSON and it had not uncovered anything which assisted the defence or undermined the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the prosecution indicated that it intended to make a ORG application and make ex parte submissions . Part of the ORG application , it said , would relate to ORG to the ORG \u2019s statement of reasons . The prosecution invited the applicant to provide further particulars of the case to inform the court and the prosecution in their assessment of the potential value to the defence case of the retained material .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the prosecution invitation , the applicant submitted a note on ORG and disclosure for consideration at the ORG hearing . He contended that much of the material now disclosed by the prosecution should unquestionably have been disclosed at trial , since it would have undermined the prosecution cases and assisted the defence . He argued in particular that ORG should plainly be disclosed , since it was prima facie capable of assisting the defence or undermining the prosecution given that it had led the ORG to refer the case back to ORG . He also requested permission to address the court prior to the ORG hearing and invited the court to consider whether the interests of justice required the appointment of special counsel to represent the applicant \u2019s interests at the ORG hearing . He advanced CARDINAL principal arguments : first , that PERSON had provided crucial evidence against him and that the fresh evidence \u2013 and any material not yet disclosed on account of ORG \u2013 would have undermined his credibility ; and second , that the judge \u2019s directions to the jury had been inadequate . The note explained :", "\u201c There may be no breach of Article CARDINAL ) in circumstances where material not in the possession of the prosecution at trial was first considered by ORG in an ex parte hearing . It is important that the ORG be able to consider the impact of the new material of the safety of the PERSON \u2019s conviction with the assistance of detailed argument from the Appellant \u2019s counsel . Article CARDINAL will not be violated if the undisclosed material is found to add nothing of significance to what has been disclosed at trial ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ex parte ORG hearing took place in ORG to consider whether material referred to by the ORG should be disclosed to the defence . Special counsel was not appointed to represent the applicant \u2019s interests at the hearing . The applicant was subsequently informed that , save for very limited disclosure , no further disclosure had been ordered . The court issued a direction requiring the applicant \u2019s representatives to confirm that \u201c complete and unambiguous disclosure \u201d by the prosecution had taken place or , if it had not , to thus inform the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a note on disclosure , the applicant \u2019s representatives informed the court that they were not able to provide the confirmation sought . They expressed concern that a review of material held by the police had been conducted by unknown persons on the instructions of an officer who had given evidence against the applicant at trial . They commented on the prosecution \u2019s failure to supply any schedules of unused material or to provide any clear indication of how the process of disclosure had been conducted , explaining that it left them with \u201c a deep sense of unease as to the adequacy and efficiency of the process ... \u201d . They concluded that it was , in their view , for the prosecution to confirm that their disclosure obligations had been met .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response , on DATE the prosecution informed the applicant that the \u201c vast preponderance \u201d of the material in GPE had been disclosed in the context of the further disclosure which had taken place in DATE and DATE . They confirmed that prosecuting counsel had personally reviewed the material placed before ORG at the ORG hearing . They concluded that they were satisfied that they had complied with their disclosure obligations .", "CARDINAL . Further disclosure took place on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his skeleton argument dated DATE , the applicant set out detailed argument concerning his first ground of appeal . He introduced his submissions as follows :", "\u201c The issue is whether the fresh evidence , if available at trial , might reasonably have affected the jury \u2019s decision to convict the Appellant ... It plainly would have . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He complained that his inability properly to challenge PERSON and his account at trial because of the lack of disclosure meant that there was a real risk that the applicant \u2019s credibility had been unfairly damaged at trial . Lack of disclosure in relation to PERSON had , he claimed , \u201c potentially devastating consequences \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal against conviction was dismissed . Regarding the PII application , the court noted that it had upheld the prosecution \u2019s ORG claim on CARDINAL DATE , being of the view that the material sought to be withheld would not assist the applicant and that nothing had happened to suggest a different view . It summarised his grounds of appeal as follows :", "\u201c ( i ) [ PERSON ] was an important prosecution witness against the appellant at trial . Had the fresh evidence relating to him been available , it would have undermined his credibility and assisted the defence .", "( ii ) Inadequate directions and insufficient guidance were given to the jury ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Concerning the impact of the fresh evidence on the evidence given by PERSON at trial , the court noted that the indictment period began in DATE and that PERSON had worked as head doorman in DATE . It remarked that the jury had been reminded by the trial judge during his summing - up that PERSON was not at the club during the period covered by the indictment . The ORG observed that the critical question for the jury was whether they were sure that from DATE , the applicant had encouraged , allowed or failed to take reasonable steps to prevent drug use at the LOC . On this question , it said , PERSON could give no direct evidence whatever . It referred to the applicant \u2019s argument that with the disclosed material the whole balance of the case changed , since he would have been in a much stronger position to undermine the prosecution case and advance his own . However , it considered that , while the judge had clearly paid attention to what PERSON said , the latter \u2019s evidence was \u201c by no means \u201d at the heart of the case . It underlined again that PERSON \u2019s evidence related to DATE or more before the indictment period and that no amount of cross - examination of PERSON to expose him as a drug dealer was capable of offering any refutation of the objective evidence of the test purchase officers and other evidence of what was happening in the club at the time . The court concluded :", "\u201c DATE . ... The real issue here was what the appellant did or did not do after the warnings given to him at the beginning of the indictment period . As regards that , the evidence of open and blatant supplies of ecstasy at the club , effectively under the noses of the staff , seems to us entirely compelling . We are wholly unpersuaded by the submission urged upon us DATE that the [ undercover ORG ] evidence did not plainly implicate the appellant . His absence over periods of time when drugs were being openly and blatantly supplied has to be viewed against what the ORG was required to prove , namely that the appellant failed to take reasonable steps to prevent drug use at the LOC . He knew full well that drugs were being frequently supplied on the LOC , to put it at its lowest . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The appeal against sentence was successful on the basis that new sentencing guidelines had entered into force since the applicant \u2019s first appeal and ought to be taken into account . The sentence was reduced to DATE . The court explicitly stated that the fresh evidence in respect of PERSON played no part in the reduction of sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was informed by senior counsel that the appeal turned on disclosure and the determination that the conviction was safe was a factual determination . No matter of law of general public importance , amenable to certification for a further appeal to ORG , arose . Counsel therefore concluded that no further avenue of appeal existed .", "CARDINAL . Where a person has been convicted on indictment , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE gives the ORG the power to refer at any time the conviction to ORG . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , any such reference is to be treated for all purposes as an appeal by the person concerned against conviction . LAW sets the conditions for making references . It provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A reference of a conviction ... shall not be made ... unless\u2013", "( a ) the Commission consider that there is a real possibility that the conviction ... would not be upheld were the reference to be made ,", "( b ) ORG", "( i ) in the case of a conviction ... because of an argument , or evidence , not raised in the proceedings which led to it or on any appeal or application for leave to appeal against ... , and", "( c ) an appeal against the conviction ... has been determined or leave to appeal against it has been refused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act allows the ORG to require a body which has possession or control of material which may assist it in the exercise of it functions to produce the material or allow the ORG access to it .", "CARDINAL . Under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) DATE , the prosecution must make \u201c primary disclosure \u201d of all previously undisclosed evidence which , in the prosecutor \u2019s view , might undermine the case for the prosecution . The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court , setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution . The prosecution must then make a \u201c secondary disclosure \u201d of all previously undisclosed material \u201c which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused \u2019s defence as disclosed by the defence statement \u201d . Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court .", "CARDINAL . Following the judgments of this ORG in PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , and ORG and Others and PERSON and Others v. GPE , DATE , Reports CARDINAL , the GPE introduced legislation making provision for the appointment of a special counsel in certain cases involving national security . The provisions are contained in ORG Act DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) and LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Under this legislation , where it is necessary on national security grounds for the relevant tribunal to sit in camera , in the absence of the affected individual and his legal representatives , the Attorney\u2011General may appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings . The legislation provides that the special counsel is not however \u201c responsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent \u201d , thus ensuring that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which can not be disclosed . The relevant rules giving effect to the DATE and CARDINAL Acts are set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. H. ; PERSON UKHL CARDINAL , decided on DATE , ORG of ORG held , inter alia :", "\u201c DATE since the ... enactment of the ORG have witnessed the introduction in some areas of the law of a novel procedure designed to protect the interests of a party against whom an adverse order may be made and who can not ( either personally or through his legal representative ) , for security reasons , be fully informed of all the material relied on against him . The procedure is to appoint a person , usually called a \u2018 special advocate\u2019 , who may not disclose to the subject of the proceedings the secret material disclosed to him , and is not in the ordinary sense professionally responsible to that party but who , subject to those constraints , is charged to represent that party \u2019s interests ...", "There is as yet little express sanction in domestic legislation or domestic legal authority for the appointment of a special advocate or special counsel to represent , as an advocate in ORG matters , a defendant in an ordinary criminal trial ... But novelty is not of itself an objection , and cases will arise in which the appointment of an approved advocate as special counsel is necessary , in the interests of justice , to secure protection of a criminal defendant \u2019s right to a fair trial . Such an appointment does however raise ethical problems , since a lawyer who can not take full instructions from his client , nor report to his client , who is not responsible to his client and whose relationship with the client lacks the quality of confidence inherent in any ordinary lawyer - client relationship , is acting in a way hitherto unknown to the legal profession . While not insuperable , these problems should not be ignored , since neither the defendant nor the public will be fully aware of what is being done . The appointment is also likely to cause practical problems : of delay , while the special counsel familiarises himself with the detail of what is likely to be a complex case ; of expense , since the introduction of an additional , high - quality advocate must add significantly to the cost of the case ; and of continuing review , since it will not be easy for a special counsel to assist the court in its continuing duty to review disclosure , unless the special counsel is present throughout or is instructed from time to time when need arises . Defendants facing serious charges frequently have little inclination to cooperate in a process likely to culminate in their conviction , and any new procedure can offer opportunities capable of exploitation to obstruct and delay . None of these problems should deter the court from appointing special counsel where the interests of justice are shown to require it . But the need must be shown . Such an appointment will always be exceptional , never automatic ; a course of last and never first resort . It should not be ordered unless and until the trial judge is satisfied that no other course will adequately meet the overriding requirement of fairness to the defendant . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE provides that ORG :", "\u201c ( a ) shall allow an appeal against conviction if they think that the conviction is unsafe ; and", "( b ) shall dismiss such an appeal in any other case . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
