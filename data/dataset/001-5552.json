POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE , residing in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "PERSON The facts of the case", "During the Second World War the applicant and her mother lived near FAC . The applicant \u2019s mother was of NORP origin . Before the war she did not have any citizenship . Later on , during the war , she obtained NORP citizenship and was put on the \u201c NORP \u201d .", "In DATE the applicant and her mother were arrested and detained in prison in GPE . While detained , the applicant worked with other prisoners , clearing the streets of GPE of rubble . When the applicant was released in DATE , she was informed that her mother had died during her detention .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to institute criminal proceedings concerning her and her mother \u2019s detention in DATE . Apparently , on DATE the PERSON regional branch of the ORG questioned the applicant in respect of the circumstances of her and her mother \u2019s detention and her mother \u2019s death .", "In a letter to the applicant dated DATE the commission stated that the acts of the agents of the communist regime towards her and her mother were indeed deplorable . The applicant was requested to accept sincere apologies . She was further informed that due to prescription it was now impossible to institute criminal proceedings in order to identify persons responsible for these acts . However , legislative amendments were under way such as to allow the victims of the communist persecution to seek moral and pecuniary satisfaction for their sufferings .", "On DATE the commission declared that it lacked competence to investigate the applicant \u2019s case and later on , transmitted it to ORG .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the commission informed the applicant that on DATE amendments to LAW had been adopted , according to which certain crimes were not any more subject to prescription . Accordingly , it became possible to investigate the applicant \u2019s case . However , the commission lacked competence to do so as its task was to investigate cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity . Thus , it was outside its jurisdiction to investigate the individual case of a DATE child detained in a labour camp .", "On DATE the documents concerning the applicant and her mother \u2019s case were submitted , through the office of ORG , to ORG .", "In DATE ORG discontinued the investigations of the applicant \u2019s complaints . It was established that the applicant and her mother , who was of NORP origin , had during the war been put on the so - called \u201c NORP \u201d , a list of persons who acknowledged their NORP nationality . In DATE both the applicant \u2019s mother and the applicant had been arrested . Subsequently they had been transported to GPE , to GPE prison at FAC , and afterwards , after DATE of detention , they were put in another GPE prison , serving also as labour camp , known as \u201c LOC . Upon her release in DATE the applicant was informed that her mother had died in prison .", "The prosecutor went on to state that the authorities responsible for the applicant \u2019s detention had breached all applicable laws in that none of the provisions in force at that time , concerning punitive and criminal measures in respect of persons who had accepted NORP citizenship during the war or had otherwise collaborated with the occupants , provided for detention or allowed for any other punitive measures to be taken in respect of children DATE . Certain measures set forth by LAW then in force could be applied to persons DATE , whereas the provisions of LAW could only be applied to persons DATE . However , all investigative measures undertaken by the prosecuting authorities in order to identify persons and authorities responsible for the applicant \u2019s unlawful persecution , had failed . The prosecution authorities had submitted a number of requests concerning the applicant 's imprisonment to : the archives of ORG , the archives of ORG and ORG , ORG in ORG and in GPE , ORG , ORG , and ORG . Despite these efforts , the identity of persons responsible for the decision to put the applicant and her mother in detention could not be established . The applicant \u2019s name was not to be found in the incomplete archives of ORG or of the so - called LOC in GPE . Therefore the prosecuting authorities , having exhausted all available investigative measures , had to discontinue the proceedings .", "By a letter of DATE the office of the ORG informed the applicant that in reply to her query they had requested the Director of ORG of the Minister of ORG to suggest an available legal procedure by way of which she could seek compensation for her unlawful detention in DATE .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed the applicant , in reply to her complaint about the outcome of the investigations which she had submitted on DATE to the ORG , that the decision to discontinue the investigation was justified . This conclusion was supported by a thorough analysis of the case - file , which in particular did not give any ground for the view that the prosecuting authorities had been acting negligently or superficially . The first - instance prosecutor had found that the offence of unlawful deprivation of liberty had clearly been committed in the applicant \u2019s case , as shown by documents of the former ORG , found in ORG . The file No . CARDINAL , containing , inter alia , a list of prisoners for DATE , had confirmed that the applicant had been at that time detained in GPE prison at FAC . It was true that the decision of CARDINAL DATE had failed to indicate detailed findings made in respect of the applicant \u2019s detention and to refer to concrete documentary evidence . However , there was nothing to show that the decision was , on the whole , unjustified . As regards the issue of compensation for the unlawful detention , the prosecuting authorities had no competence to examine it within the framework of their investigations .", "In a further letter of DATE the ORG informed the applicant , in reply to her query about the possibility to obtain , under existing laws , compensation for her detention in DATE , that , regrettably , the laws in force did not offer any prospects of success . Persons seeking compensation for unlawful detention could submit their claims either under LAW of LAW of DATE , or under the provisions of the Civil Code governing liability in tort . However , in the applicant \u2019s case all substantive and procedural time - limits for lodging of such claims had expired long before .", "The applicant twice , by letters of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , disagreed with the opinion expressed in the letter of CARDINAL DATE . In reply , ORG confirmed his position in the letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant , in reply to her complaint about the decision to discontinue the investigations , that her complaints were unfounded . The contested decision and the following letters of ORG contained detailed arguments in support of the decision to discontinue the investigations .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "LAW of DATE provided in LAW for compensation regarding damages arising out of obviously unjustified detention on remand and for arrest and detention up to TIME .
