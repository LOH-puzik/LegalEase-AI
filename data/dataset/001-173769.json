The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s parents , who are of NORP origin , were living in GPE when the applicant was born . They divorced in DATE and his father was awarded sole custody . In DATE , his grandparents , who had been looking after him while his father had been working , moved to GPE and took the applicant and his sister with them . The applicant \u2019s mother also returned to GPE , but founded a new family and did not keep in touch with him . The applicant lived in GPE from DATE until DATE , attending school there for DATE . In DATE , when he was DATE , he and his sister moved back to GPE to live with their father again . For that purpose , the applicant was granted a residence permit by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at DATE , the applicant , together with CARDINAL of his friends , assaulted a man . He jumped on the victim from behind , while his friends beat and kicked the man , causing him serious injuries . They also stole money and cigarettes from their victim . On DATE the applicant attempted to shoplift . On DATE he drove a moped without the owner \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his friends stole an item from a man . CARDINAL the applicant and a group of his friends partly attempted and partly succeeded in stealing the handbags of CARDINAL elderly women through threats or the use of force . The applicant was DATE at that time . He had ripped the handbags from some of the victims ; grabbed CARDINAL of the women from behind , holding her mouth and dragging her to the ground ; hit another one on the head and pushed his knee into her back so that she would fall down ; and had also beaten some of them . CARDINAL of the women were seriously injured as a result .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Straflandesgericht \u2013 hereinafter , \u201c the Criminal Court \u201d ) convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery , attempted theft and unauthorised use of a motor vehicle ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , which was suspended for DATE . ORG considered as mitigating factors that the applicant had no previous criminal record , that he had confessed to his crimes and that he had shown willingness to afford redress to the victim . Aggravating factors were that he had committed several offences , specifically a crime and CARDINAL misdemeanours . In its reasoning of the judgment , ORG noted that the applicant had been notorious for excessive acts of violence and had had to change schools several times already . It observed that the applicant had virtually no age - appropriate capacity of reflection , and attested that he had an enormous tendency to act aggressively , which he used as his strategy for problem - solving .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated robbery as a member of a criminal organisation and theft ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The probationary period of his previous criminal conviction of DATE was prolonged to DATE in total . ORG considered the applicant \u2019s confession to be a mitigating factor , but the repeated commission of offences as an aggravating factor . It argued in its reasoning that the applicant had taken a leading role in the robberies . The applicant and his friends had deliberately targeted elderly women because they had expected they would not resist . Moreover , ORG found that the applicant had been one of the main perpetrators , which is why there was no leeway to pronounce a more lenient sentence than DATE years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) imposed a DATE exclusion order ( Aufenthaltsverbot ) on the applicant pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , and section CARDINAL of LAW ( Fremdenpolizeigesetz ) . It found that even though most of his family lived in GPE , the applicant \u2019s expulsion was justified because of the severity of his offences in order to protect public order and security .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . He argued that he had committed the criminal offences as a juvenile delinquent who had had the wrong friends . The authorities had not properly taken into account his interests , given that his father , paternal grandparents , siblings , CARDINAL - brothers and CARDINAL - sisters all lived in GPE . Because of his young age he would not be able to live in GPE by himself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) partly granted his appeal and limited the exclusion order to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from prison because of his good conduct after having served CARDINAL of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside ORG decision of DATE for lack of jurisdiction and held that ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat \u2013 hereinafter , \u201c the ORG \u201d ) was the competent authority to examine the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an oral hearing , the GPE ORG partly granted and partly dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It confirmed the legality of the exclusion order , but limited it to DATE . It considered that the robberies in particular had been serious offences which demonstrated the applicant \u2019s severe disrespect for the well - being and property of others . The victims had been mostly elderly , fragile women , who had been physically weaker than him and his friends . CARDINAL of the women had been severely injured . The applicant had been one of the main perpetrators . His tendency towards violence and aggression was remarkable and appeared to have even increased between the first and the second conviction . The ORG further took into consideration that the applicant had only been DATE at the time of the offences , and therefore had still been in the process of reaching maturity . This was however put into perspective by the fact that he had not offended only once , but multiple times , and in a particularly brutal manner .", "CARDINAL . The ORG proceeded to examine whether it could be assumed that the applicant still posed a threat to public order and safety . His probation officer ( ORG ) testified that the applicant had developed a sense of justice after his conviction and that cooperation with him had worked well . The applicant had worked as an apprentice during his time in prison . After his release , he had participated in several training programmes and was looking for a job . The ORG noted furthermore that the applicant had not reoffended in DATE since his release from prison . It came to the conclusion , however , that the relatively short time since his release was not enough to prove that he was not a danger to society anymore .", "CARDINAL . The ORG then assessed whether the exclusion order violated the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . It held at the outset that an expulsion of \u201c second - generation migrants \u201d such as the applicant was subject to stricter criteria than an expulsion of other foreigners . Referring to the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIX ) , PERSON v. the GPE ( [ ORG ] no . CARDINAL , ORG ORG ) and PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] no . DATE ) , it found that \u2013 in contrast to PERSON DATE the applicant had repeatedly committed serious crimes of a violent nature . Because of his family and his social integration in GPE , the exclusion order constituted an interference with his rights under LAW . However , he had almost reached the age of majority at the time the exclusion order had been issued . Economic integration could not be observed as he was unemployed at the time . He spoke NORP and had last visited GPE in DATE . His mother still lived in GPE ; he had no contact with her at the time but could get in touch with her . The serious nature of the offences and the resulting public interest in his expulsion therefore outweighed the applicant \u2019s interest in remaining in the country . However , because of his young age , the ORG concluded that a DATE exclusion order would be sufficient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , ORG and ORG declined to hear prior appeals by the applicant against the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE and on DATE the applicant was informed of the possibility to leave the country voluntarily . As he did not leave , he was expelled to GPE on DATE . He was DATE at that time .", "CARDINAL . The DATE exclusion order against the applicant , which had been pronounced in the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE , expired in DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
