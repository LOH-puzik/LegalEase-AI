LIECHTENSTEIN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , ORG , and the second applicant , ORG , are legal entities incorporated under GPE law in DATE which have their registered offices in GPE . The third applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . According to the statutes of the first and the second applicant , the third applicant is the sole beneficiary of their assets . The applicants were represented before the ORG by PERSON and Mr PERSON of ORG , a law firm practising in GPE .", "On DATE ORG of GPE ( PERSON ) in GPE , in investigation proceedings on suspicion of money laundering against PERSON and unknown further perpetrators committed in DATE ( file no . CARDINAL UR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , ordered the seizure for a duration of DATE of all assets which the first and second applicants had deposited with the ORG company and prohibited the latter to dispose of these assets pursuant to section GPE of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic and international law\u2019 below ) . It found that the investigations against PERSON , the former legal representative of the first and second applicants , had revealed that the third applicant had probably bribed several judges in GPE together with another person . The third applicant was suspected of having transferred the proceeds of these offences to the applicant foundations , which were attributable to him , in order to conceal that the money had originated from criminal acts . Therefore , the accounts of the foundations had to be blocked in order to safeguard the subsequent absorption of the profits ( NORP der GPE ) or the forfeiture of the assets in accordance with section PERSON of LAW .", "On DATE ORG of ORG requested ORG to extend the seizure of the foundations\u2019 assets for DATE .", "On DATE ORG , acting in the course of independent objective forfeiture proceedings ( objektives ORG ) under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic and international law\u2019 below ) against the applicant foundations ORG ( file no . TIME ) , prolonged the seizure of the foundations\u2019 assets ordered by it on DATE for DATE pursuant to section GPE CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "ORG noted that the third applicant , being the beneficiary of the foundations , had been sentenced by ORG to eleven years\u2019 imprisonment on CARDINAL DATE with respect to the assets at issue in the present forfeiture proceedings . This judgment was not final yet . As the present proceedings were complex and involved inter - State relations , it had not yet been possible to terminate the investigations .", "On DATE ORG of ORG ) , in the course of the objective forfeiture proceedings concerning the assets of the applicant foundations , endorsed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , confirming that court \u2019s reasoning ( section MONEY \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .", "On DATE the first and the second applicant , represented by counsel , lodged an appeal against the decision of ORG of DATE with ORG . They argued that the initial seizure of its assets on DATE had been ordered by ORG for DATE in criminal investigation proceedings on suspicion of money laundering against PERSON In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG had then ordered a prolongation of this seizure . However , this prolongation had been made in different proceedings , namely in the course of objective forfeiture proceedings concerning the foundations\u2019 assets , in which there had never been an initial blocking of accounts . Therefore , the prolongation order was unlawful . The criminal proceedings against PERSON were terminated by a final judgment so that a continued blocking of accounts in these proceedings was no longer possible .", "Moreover , as ORG order was made in objective forfeiture proceedings it could only be based on section MONEY \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic and international law\u2019 below ) . However , this provision had entered into force only on DATE ; before that date , there was no legal basis for ordering the forfeiture of the assets in question . The third applicant and others were suspected of having received money for offences committed in DATE and of having transferred CARDINAL and MONEY respectively to the account of the applicant foundations in DATE , that is , long before DATE . Therefore , applying section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW in order to prolong the blocking of the foundations\u2019 accounts violated the prohibition of retroactive punishment guaranteed by section CARDINAL read in conjunction with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic and international law\u2019 below ) and LAW .", "ORG transmitted the appeal to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant foundations\u2019 appeal . Referring to its previous case - law , it found that it had jurisdiction to deal with the appeal . As an exception from the rule laid down in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic and international law\u2019 below ) , which was authorised by that provision , no appeal lay to ORG against ORG decision on the prolongation of the seizure of the assets . Otherwise ORG would have to decide twice on the same subject matter following its necessary consent to the prolongation of the seizure . Contrary to the wording of section GPE CARDINAL of LAW , an appeal lay , however , with ORG itself instead .", "ORG found that measures pursuant to section GPE of LAW were aimed at preventing persons suspected of a criminal offence from frustrating the absorption of the profits or the forfeiture of the assets obtained as a result thereof while the investigations into the offence were pending . As rightly found by ORG and ORG , there was a reasonable suspicion of money laundering . The third applicant , being the sole beneficiary of the foundations , had been convicted at first instance by ORG of having received the money later transferred to the foundations as commissions for criminal acts . There were , therefore , reasonable grounds for the assumption that the assets seized would later be declared forfeited .", "ORG conceded that the seizure of the foundations\u2019 assets had initially been ordered in the criminal proceedings against PERSON However , it was lawful to prolong the seizure in the present objective forfeiture proceedings as these were the logical continuation of the said criminal proceedings and as the seizure had been made in the criminal proceedings to make the forfeiture possible .", "A declaration of forfeiture at DATE pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code , which authorised the forfeiture of assets and entered into force on DATE , was not excluded by the prohibition of retroactivity . The forfeiture of assets was not an additional punishment , but an independent pecuniary consequence of the fact that a perpetrator , his legal successor or other beneficiaries , including legal entities , had obtained assets resulting from an unlawful act . It did not require that the perpetrator had acted with criminal responsibility . In case of a refusal of payment , an order of forfeiture was therefore enforced with the ordinary instruments of execution of payment , not by ordering imprisonment for failure to pay a fine .", "As the forfeiture of assets pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code was thus not an ( additional ) penalty for an offence , such a measure did not have to be examined in the light of the prohibition of retroactive punishment enshrined in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The new provisions on forfeiture of assets were applicable to all assets which were found to be in GPE at the time the provisions entered into force . They had not therefore become effective retroactively and had not changed retroactively the consequences of a perpetrator \u2019s past conduct , but concerned a persistent state of affairs , namely assets being situated within the country .", "ORG further found that sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW only played a role in so far as the criminal offence as a result of which the assets in question were obtained was concerned . Proceeds of offences which had not been punishable before the entry into force of section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code were not liable to forfeiture . However , in the present case the offences which were suspected to have generated the assets at issue had been punishable both in GPE and in GPE at the time they had been committed .", "The seizure of the assets was proportionate because the disadvantages suffered by the applicant foundations as a result of the blocking of their accounts were less important than the damage possibly incurred by the victims of the offences if the seizure was not ordered .", "On DATE the first and second applicants lodged a complaint with ORG ) . They claimed that the principle of nulla poena sine lege as guaranteed by LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic and international law\u2019 below ) and LAW had been violated . They argued that the forfeiture of assets authorised by section MONEY of the Criminal Code had to be qualified as an additional punishment . The courts had applied that new penal provision , which had entered into force on DATE , to assets purportedly obtained by criminal offences committed in DATE , that is , before that date , when the forfeiture of such assets had not yet been authorised by law .", "Moreover , the applicants claimed that their right to a fair trial and to be heard by the judge having jurisdiction over the case as protected by LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic and international law\u2019 below ) and LAW had been breached . It had been unlawful and indeed arbitrary to order a prolongation of the seizure of its assets in objective forfeiture proceedings , in which there had not been a seizure yet , the initial seizure having been ordered in criminal proceedings against ORG had therefore not had jurisdiction to order the said prolongation in the objective forfeiture proceedings pending before it . Moreover , the decision on the ORG appeal against this decision should have been given by ORG and not by ORG .", "On DATE the Constitutional Court of the Principality of GPE rejected the foundations\u2019 complaint .", "It found , firstly , that the prohibition of retroactive punishment laid down in LAW and LAW as well as in sections CARDINAL of LAW did not apply to a forfeiture pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . Referring to the criteria laid down by ORG notably in the case of PERSON v. the GPE ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) it found that forfeiture pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW was not a \u201c penalty \u201d within the meaning of LAW .", "It was not a precondition for an order of forfeiture pursuant to that section that the person concerned was convicted of a criminal offence or that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him at all . The assets concerned had to stem from an act punishable at the place of its commission to which GPE criminal law was not applicable .", "The purpose of the new provision on forfeiture was to comply with the obligations arising notably under ORG , Search , LAW ( ETS no . CARDINAL ; see \u2018 Relevant domestic and international law\u2019 below ) and to guarantee that crime did not pay off . Forfeiture was not an additional penalty for offences , the penal sanctions for offences , prison sentences and fines , being sufficient . It was only aimed at absorbing the profits made as a result of an offence . It was therefore not necessary that the person concerned acted with criminal responsibility and forfeiture could also be ordered against the legal successors of a perpetrator . Therefore , forfeiture had to be characterised as a civil law consequence of criminal acts . This was confirmed by the fact that in case of a refusal of payment , an order of forfeiture was enforced with the ordinary instruments of execution of payment orders whereas \u2013 other than , for example , in the PERSON case \u2013 it was not authorised to order imprisonment for failure to pay a fine .", "The objective forfeiture proceedings were separate proceedings to which the procedural rules of LAW applied , but which were independent of the guilt of the person or legal entity owning the assets in question . As to the severity of the measure in question , it had to be noted that the assets forfeited were often only part of the net proceeds of a criminal offence .", "Secondly , ORG found that the applicants\u2019 right to be heard by the judge having jurisdiction over the case under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW had not been violated . It had been convincing and , in any event , not arbitrary for ORG to argue that the present objective forfeiture proceedings were the logical continuation of the criminal proceedings against PERSON and that it had , therefore , been lawful to order the prolongation of the seizure in the objective forfeiture proceedings . Likewise , having regard to ORG reasoning , it had been reasonable and not arbitrary for that court to conclude that an appeal against the decision of ORG to prolong the seizure of the ORG assets did not lie with ORG , but with ORG itself .", "On DATE ORG of GPE , in the course of the objective forfeiture proceedings against the applicant foundations , prolonged the seizure of the foundations\u2019 assets for DATE pursuant to section GPE CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( file no . CARDINAL UR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . Referring to the conviction of the third applicant by ORG on DATE , it argued that the assets were suspected of being the pay - back for bribing civil servants . However , the said judgment was not final yet and the investigation proceedings in GPE depended on the outcome of the proceedings in GPE .", "On DATE ORG of ORG , referring to ORG reasoning and to that of ORG in its decision of DATE , consented to ORG decision ( section MONEY \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .", "On DATE the applicant foundations lodged an appeal with ORG . Disagreeing with the decision given by ORG of GPE on DATE , they reasoned their appeal along the same lines as their appeal of DATE .", "On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed the ORG appeal as ill - founded . Referring to its decision given on DATE , which had meanwhile been confirmed by ORG in its decision of DATE , it found that it had been lawful to order the prolongation of the seizure in the present objective forfeiture proceedings . Moreover , as had been confirmed by ORG , the forfeiture of assets pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code was not an ( additional ) penalty for an offence and therefore did not have to be examined in the light of the prohibition of retroactive punishment . ORG reiterated that it had repeatedly considered it to be disproportionate to freeze assets of GPE citizens or legal entities for DATE without the underlying criminal proceedings being terminated . However , the outcome of the criminal proceedings in GPE prejudged the outcome of the present case and it was likely that a final decision would be given shortly . Therefore , the prolongation of the blocking of the foundations\u2019 accounts was still proportionate , even though the objective forfeiture proceedings should be terminated soon .", "On DATE the foundations lodged a complaint with ORG . They argued again that the application of section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code had violated the principle of nulla poena sine lege as guaranteed by LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW of Liechtenstein and LAW . Invoking LAW of LAW and LAW , they claimed that their right to a fair trial and to be heard by the judge having jurisdiction over the case had been breached . Moreover , the applicants complained that ORG had failed to give sufficient reasons for its view that it had been lawful to order the prolongation of the seizure in the present objective forfeiture proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the foundations\u2019 complaint as ill - founded . It referred to the grounds given in its decision of CARDINAL DATE . As regards the foundations\u2019 claim that ORG insufficiently reasoned its decision , the court found that ORG reference to the grounds given by ORG in its decision of DATE did not breach the duty to give sufficient reasons . The latter decision concerned the same questions raised by the same parties so that the reference was clear and comprehensible .", "On DATE the applicants informed the ORG that the seizure of their assets persisted , without a final judgment on the underlying offences having been given .", "Pursuant to LAW , no one may be removed from the jurisdiction of his lawful judge and extraordinary courts shall not be established .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW stipulates that the threat or imposition of penalties must be in accordance with the law .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW guarantees the inviolability of private property .", "Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code prohibits punishment without law . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , a penalty or a measure of prevention may only be imposed for an act which was punishable according to law at the time of its commission . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of that PERSON provides that no heavier penalty may be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed . A measure of prevention may only be ordered if , at the time of the commission of the offence , this measure or a comparable penalty or measure of prevention had been provided for by law .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW lays down rules on the temporal applicability of criminal provisions . Criminal laws apply to acts committed after the laws\u2019 entry into force . They are applicable to acts committed prior to that date if the laws in force at the time when the offence was committed , having regard to their overall effects , were less favourable to the perpetrator .", "Sections CARDINAL to CARDINALa of LAW , according to their heading , cover penalties , the absorption of profits , forfeiture and preventive measures . Section CARDINAL of that Code regulates prison sentences , section CARDINAL of the LAW provides for fines and sections CARDINAL of the Code contain rules on the absorption of profits . Sections CARDINAL et seq . provide , in particular , for preventive measures such as the placement in an institution for mentally disturbed law breakers , in a detoxification facility or in an institution for dangerous recidivist offenders .", "According to section CARDINALb \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , assets which were derived from an act liable to punishment shall be declared forfeited if the act from which they originate is punishable according to the laws of the place were it was committed , if GPE criminal law does not apply to that act and if the act did not constitute a fiscal offence . Pursuant to section LANGUAGE \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW , forfeiture is excluded in CARDINAL parties , who did not participate in the offences at issue , have legal claims in relation to the assets in question .", "Section CARDINALb \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW was introduced into that LAW by LAW to LAW October CARDINAL , which entered into force on DATE ( see ORG ( LGBl ) DATE , no . CARDINAL , issued on DATE ) .", "Money laundering , that is , in particular , hiding assets originating from a criminal offence or concealing the fact that the assets stem from an offence , is punishable pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . However , a person who has been punished for having participated in the offence which generated such assets is not ( also ) liable to prosecution for money laundering ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "Section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that if there is a suspicion that assets originate from a punishable act and are likely to be declared forfeited ( pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code ) the court , on a motion of ORG , shall order measures aimed at safeguarding their forfeiture if the recovery of the assets is endangered or rendered considerably more difficult otherwise . Such safeguarding measures comprise , inter alia , the seizure of assets or a prohibition on their disposal .", "Section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of that Code stipulates that the court is obliged to fix a time - limit for the safeguarding measure ordered , which may be extended on request . If DATE have passed following the first order without an indictment having been laid or a request for forfeiture having been lodged in separate objective proceedings , further extensions of the time - limit for DATE respectively are only permitted with the consent of ORG .", "The seizure order shall be quashed , in particular , if it can be assumed that the forfeiture will not be ordered or if the time - limit for the order has expired ( section MONEY \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW regulates the forfeiture proceedings .
