ORG Mr. PERSON , who was born in DATE , lives at GPE ( municipality of PERSON ) , where he used to own and run a garage .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , he applied to the municipal authorities , in accordance with LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , for a licence to bring into operation an installation for the delivery of liquid petroleum gas ( \" ORG \" ) to motor vehicles . The installation comprised a surface storage tank with a capacity of QUANTITY .", "The application was made public in order to enable those wishing to object to do so . On DATE , CARDINAL neighbours expressed their fear of fire and an explosion being caused by lightning .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the municipal authorities granted the licence , subject to CARDINAL conditions which they considered would counter the dangers in question . They referred to a letter in which an official of ORG had indicated that he agreed with such a course .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG had written to the municipal authorities to advise them to refuse a licence ; in his view , the proximity of houses involved excessive risks . On DATE , he lodged an appeal with the Crown ( GPE ; see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "The municipal authorities informed Mr. PERSON of the appeal on DATE . They stated that since it had no suspensive effect , he could erect the installation . However , they added that if he did so , they would not be liable for any financial losses he might sustain in the event of the licence being cancelled .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Chairman of ORG of ORG ( Afdeling voor Geschillen PERSON ) - to which ORG it fell to investigate the matter and then advise the ORG - sought information from the Minister of ORG ( sections CARDINAL and GPE ) of ORG ; see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . This information was supplied , in a letter of DATE , by the Director ORG ; he expressed the view that the appeal was well - founded as he considered that further conditions ought to be attached to the licence .", "CARDINAL . ORG After a hearing in the presence of the parties , during which the applicant was heard on DATE , the Chairman of the ORG asked the Director General for additional information .", "The latter explained , in a letter of CARDINAL DATE , that the situation had changed : greater importance was now attached to the dangers involved in storage and delivery . He shared the view of ORG that , pending revision of the current officially - recommended standards , there should not be CARDINAL houses within a radius of QUANTITY from the gas tanks and dispensers , nor QUANTITY between the installation and the nearest houses .", "The Director General therefore concluded that the licence sought by Mr. PERSON should be refused , as these conditions were not satisfied .", "CARDINAL . ORG At a hearing held on DATE , the applicant argued that ORG \" interim position \" , as well as being inadequately motivated , was not based on sufficiently sound technical grounds . Having been asked by the Chairman of the ORG to elaborate on his opinion , the Director General provided , on DATE , further details concerning the safety hazards ; he stated that , pending the results of a study ( which was being undertaken because of the many appeals outstanding ) , a cautious attitude should be adopted when granting licences . He thus confirmed his earlier position .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG sent to the Minister of ORG an opinion recommending that the licence be refused ; a draft of the Decree to be adopted was attached thereto .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , by a Decree in the same terms as the draft , the ORG quashed the municipal authorities\u2019 decision . It considered that a different view should be taken regarding the distance between an ORG installation and the neighbouring houses and that , in the particular circumstances , the risks could not be eliminated merely by the imposition of additional conditions .", "As a result , the municipal authorities issued an order directing Mr. PERSON to cease operating his installation . He lodged an appeal against this decision , but it was confirmed by the ORG by a Decree of DATE . A second decision - dated DATE and providing for the closure of the installation by the authorities themselves - was quashed , on formal grounds , by ORG ( Afdeling Rechtspraak ) of ORG on DATE .

Licence applications , which are submitted to the municipal authorities , are first of all notified to the public , who may make oral or written objections . Certain government bodies - such as ORG - are also given an opportunity to express their views .", "The decision lies with the municipal authorities ( section CARDINAL ) . They may refuse a licence only if the erection , bringing into operation , exploitation , extension or modification of the installation would result in danger or , as regards property , industry or health , damage or serious nuisance , and if such danger , damage or nuisance could not be sufficiently averted by the imposition of conditions ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) in the version in force at the relevant time ) .", "Once issued , a licence covers both the original holder and his assignees ( section CARDINAL ) . It may be granted by the municipal authorities for a limited period or subject to conditions binding upon the licensee ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG After the persons and authorities involved have been informed of the decision , the applicant for the licence , anyone who duly raised objections and the government bodies concerned may lodge an appeal with the Crown within a certain period ( section CARDINAL , which was then in force ) . The ORG determines the appeal on the advice of ORG of ORG ( section CARDINAL ) .", "An appeal has no suspensive effect but , under LAW ( a ) of ORG ( Wet op de Raad van State ) , the appellant may ask the Chairman of the ORG to defer implementation of the decision or to order interim measures .", "CARDINAL .

ORG The Chairman of ORG calls for the necessary official reports and informs the Minister concerned thereof ( section CARDINAL ( c ) ( CARDINAL ) ) .

Prior to that , it may depart from the advice , but only if the Minister concerned has first consulted the Minister of ORG or , where the latter is himself concerned , if he has first consulted the Prime Minister ( sections DATE and DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) and ( b ) ) . In practice , the ORG very rarely takes this course .", "The ORG \u2019s decision , against which no further appeal is available , may be based on considerations of law or of expediency .", "The Decree , which incorporates the reasons therefor , is immediately sent to the interested parties and the ORG . It is then made available for DATE for public inspection at the ORG of ORG ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .
