NORP The applicant club was founded on DATE in GPE . Subsequent to the last changes in its corporate structure , on DATE , the ORG in GPE incorporated the applicant as a branch of a NORP limited liability company , \u201c BAUML GmbH \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Under contracts of CARDINAL May and DATE , the applicant engaged Mr PERSON ( \u201c the footballer \u201d ) as a professional player until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the football club ORG , both members of ORG ( \u201c the GFF \u201d ) , entered into an agreement on the footballer 's transfer to ORG . It was arranged that the footballer would play for the new club after the latter had paid the applicant MONEY ( the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) , according to the applicant ) . In addition , if the footballer was later transferred abroad , the applicant was to receive PERCENT of the international transfer fee owed to ORG . If ORG failed to fulfil that obligation , the agreement between it and the footballer would become null and void .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG paid the applicant the sum agreed in roubles and the domestic transfer took effect .", "CARDINAL . Under a contract of CARDINAL DATE , ORG transferred the footballer to ORG for a lump sum of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . In the event of the footballer 's further transfer by the NORP club for a fee in excess of USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , ORG was entitled to receive PERCENT of the excess amount . Subsequently , ORG indeed transferred the footballer to ORG ORG , and ORG thus received around GBP CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) from the NORP club .", "CARDINAL . Having received the lump - sum transfer fee from GPE City ORG , ORG never remitted to the applicant the percentage agreed under the contract of CARDINAL DATE . Seeking to obtain the amount owed to it , the applicant complained to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the GFF decided that ORG owed the applicant USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) , corresponding to CARDINAL of the transfer fee paid by ORG . ORG was ordered to pay this sum in CARDINAL instalments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant referred the matter to ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) requesting its intervention to secure enforcement by the GFF of its decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reminded the GFF on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of its obligation to enforce decisions and thus to settle the dispute between the NORP clubs , warning that non - compliance with ORG directives might result in disciplinary proceedings against the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that ORG was liable to pay the total amount of ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) to the applicant immediately and that , in case of failure to comply with this decision , ORG would be relegated to ORG . That sanction would not , however , release the debtor from its obligation to fulfil its financial commitments vis\u00e0 - vis the applicant . In addition , the ORG warned both clubs that they were barred , under the PERSON and ORG , from referring the dispute to a court of law .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant 's complaints , on DATE and DATE , that the dispute had still not been settled , the ORG again notified the ORG , requesting the enforcement of the latter 's decisions at the latest by CARDINAL DATE , on pain of international sanctions .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime ORG had taken the matter to a civil court . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the GPE - Saburtalo ORG in GPE declared the transfer agreement signed by both parties on DATE to be null and void . Subsequently , the decision of ORG of the GFF of DATE was also annulled . During the hearing , the applicant pointed out that ORG had no right to examine the issue , since the clubs , as ORG members , enjoyed immunity from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts . That argument was left unanswered . The judgment , not having been appealed , became binding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in view of that judgment , the GFF decided to annul its decision of DATE and thus to terminate the dispute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( \u201c the Bureau \u201d ) , a disputes resolution organ . In a decision of DATE , the ORG considered that the ORG should intervene since it was clear that CARDINAL of the parties \u201c was not behaving properly and that the PERSON was not able to settle the matter by itself \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Without challenging the findings of the Vake - Saburtalo ORG in GPE on DATE about the nullity of the contract of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG stated on DATE that the footballer 's transfer from the applicant to ORG had nevertheless taken place and that no compensation had been paid in return . It therefore concluded that :", "\u201c There had been a transfer of possession of the federative rights to the player between CARDINAL clubs , without any contract binding them ( since the transfer contract had been declared null and void by the court ) and , since CARDINAL of the parties had indeed performed its obligation , it was logical for that party to be properly indemnified for having done so in good faith . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the light of its findings , the ORG decided that compensation for the training and development of the footballer had to be paid to the applicant ; both clubs were instructed to negotiate the amount . In the event of further disagreement , ORG would resolve the issue for them . Furthermore , noting that ORG had severely breached LAW of LAW by submitting the dispute to a court of law , the ORG fined that club CHF CARDINAL ( ORG MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG ( \u201c the Executive Committee \u201d ) , which delivered its final decision on DATE . The appeal having been lodged out of time , ORG rejected it . However , in view of the fact that the clubs had failed to negotiate an amount of compensation , it determined that ORG had to pay the applicant USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Dinamo ORG complied with this decision and fully paid the debt in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Considering that the amount fixed by the ORG was insufficient to compensate for the loss sustained , the applicant brought an action for damages in the amounts of ORG and GBP CARDINAL ( totalling EUR CARDINAL ) against the GFF before a court of law . It argued that the respondent , contrary to its LAW , had failed to abide by its positive obligation to protect the rights of its member clubs . As a result of this negligence , the unjust enrichment of ORG had occurred at the expense of the applicant 's property rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also requested leave to defer payment of the court fees ( known as ORG fees ) until after examination of the case . On DATE the ORG refused to defer payment on the ground that the applicant 's request was not substantiated by evidence of insolvency . The value of its claim being high , the applicant eventually paid the court fees , in the maximum amount of GEL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) under LAW CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Tbilisi Regional Court , as the court of first instance , examined the action on DATE and dismissed it as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with ORG of GPE . Referring to the fact that it had suspended its activities because of financial problems ( near bankruptcy ) caused by the respondent 's wrongful acts , the applicant requested exemption from the court fees for cassation proceedings . In case this motion for total exemption was rejected , the applicant also requested leave to pay the court fees either in a reduced amount or with deferment . It referred to the right of access to a court guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant 's request for partial or full exemption from the court fees . Without referring to any specific circumstances , it bluntly stated that no ground for exemption , under Articles DATE of the ORG , existed in the case at hand . The court invited the applicant to pay the GEL CARDINAL,CARDINAL fee within DATE . When it failed to do so , ORG , in a final decision of DATE , declared the cassation claim inadmissible . This decision , adopted under the written procedure , was communicated to the applicant on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , its inability to receive from ORG proper indemnification in return for the footballer 's transfer , as well as the high costs which it had incurred in the domestic and international proceedings against ORG and the ORG , constituted the main reasons for its financial collapse . The auditor 's report of DATE confirmed the applicant 's insolvency and the resulting cessation of its activities in the sphere of football . The report stated that , due to the inability to pay the participation fee , the applicant had been excluded from the national football championship since DATE . Among other outstanding debts , the report noted arrears of interest on a loan which the applicant had obtained in order to pay the court fee of GEL CARDINAL for the proceedings before ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "\u201c ...
