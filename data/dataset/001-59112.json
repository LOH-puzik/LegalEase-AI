The court considered that the reasons for which the detention had been ordered had not ceased to exist . There was sufficient suspicion based on the evidence that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged . The applicant had to undergo a further time - consuming psychiatric examination and further investigatory measures and evidence had to be taken .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant 's detention since DATE lacked any legal basis , as the detention period had expired on this date , and no further decision relating to the prolongation of the detention had been issued by any authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the decision of DATE . The court first considered ill - founded the applicant 's arguments that the suspicion against him lacked any legal or factual basis . The court further considered that the applicant 's suggestion that his detention since DATE was unlawful , was entirely erroneous . The applicant 's lawyer must apparently have overlooked the fact that the bill of indictment had been lodged with the court on DATE . Therefore the time - limits provided for by LAW had ceased to apply , given that this provision applied only to the pre - trial stage of criminal proceedings . One might have thought , the court continued , that such manifestly obvious conclusion , which required only a cursory perusal of relevant provisions , should not have caused any interpretation difficulties .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court fixed the date for the first hearing for DATE , but it was later adjourned . Subsequently , on CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE and on DATE the applicant requested to be released , but to no avail , as ORG dismissed all his requests .", "CARDINAL .

At the material time , the domestic provisions governing detention on remand were contained in LAW of DATE , which was later repealed and replaced by LAW ( hereafter referred to as the \u201c new LAW ) , which entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the grounds for imposing detention on remand and competent authorities were governed by the following provisions :", "\" CARDINAL .

Under the provisions applicable at the material time , the courts , when ruling on a prosecutor \u2019s request submitted to it pursuant to LAW , were obliged to determine the precise period for which detention could be prolonged . If they refused to prolong detention or if the prosecutor failed to submit a request for a further prolongation before or on the expiry of the last detention order ( regardless of whether it had been made by him or by a court ) , the detainee had to be released immediately .", "CARDINAL . Presence of the parties at court sessions other than hearings on the merits was regulated at the relevant time in ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE which provided , insofar as relevant :", "\" The ORG pronounces its decisions at a hearing if the law provides for it ; and otherwise , at a court session held in camera . ... \"", "\" A court session in camera may be attended by a prosecutor ( ... ) ; other parties may attend if the law provides for it . \"", "However , no rule provided for the attendance of the accused or his or her lawyer before the court in any type of the proceedings concerning detention on remand .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time there were no specific provision governing detention on remand after the bill of indictment was lodged with the competent court . In particular , there was no provision to the effect that lodging a bill of indictment automatically prolonged or replaced previous detention order , or that this event itself resulted in detention , which had originally been prolonged by a court for a fixed period at the investigation stage , being continued either for an unlimited period , or until a judgment at first instance was given . Nor was there any case - law to that effect . Nevertheless , according to the domestic practice , once a bill of indictment had been lodged with the court competent to deal with the merits of the case , detention was assumed to be prolonged pending trial , without any further judicial decision being given .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , referring to the formal requirements that a bill of indictment had to satisfy , stated , inter alia , that it should contain the first name and surname of the accused and information as to whether a preventive measure had been imposed on him or her . It also had to comprise a statement of the offence with which he or she had been charged , a detailed description of the facts of the case along with a statement of reasons for the accusation , an indication of the court competent to entertain the case , and the evidence upon which the accusation was founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in an interpretative ruling of certain provisions of LAW of DATE as amended by LAW DATE , addressed the problems posed by the practice of keeping an accused in detention under the bill of indictment . In its resolution ( no . I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG replied DATE in the affirmative \u2013 to the question whether , after lodging a bill of indictment with the court competent to deal with the merits of the case , that court was obliged to give a decision prolonging detention on remand , which had meanwhile exceeded the period fixed ( or further prolonged ) at the investigation stage . The relevant parts of the resolution read as follows :", "\u201c Under the provisions of LAW which applied before [ CARDINAL DATE , when ] the amendment of DATE took effect , an obligation to determine the period of detention imposed by a prosecutor at the investigation stage was laid down in LAW . However , it did not emerge explicitly from LAW and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the code that , at the investigation stage , a prosecutor or the court competent to deal with the case had each time to determine the point until which detention should last . It was deemed to be obvious that , when prolonging detention at the investigation stage , both the prosecutor and the court competent to deal with the case had to determine the time until which detention was to last under a given decision . It was therefore assumed that the obligation to determine the period of detention arose if a decision on that matter was given before the expiry of the maximum statutory terms applicable at a given stage of the proceedings .", "Comparing the old legislation with the present one leads [ this ORG ] to the conclusion that the legislator , when amending the code in DATE , simply extended [ the scope of ] the rules applicable to continuing and prolonging detention on remand DATE which had previously applied only at the investigation stage DATE to the phase of court proceedings .", "Before the amendment , the legislation was based on the precept that a suspect should not be detained indefinitely as long as his case was not being dealt with by an independent court . Now , the starting - point is that a suspect ( and an accused ) should not be detained indefinitely as long as a first - instance judgment is not rendered .", "Under the previous legislation there was no need to determine the period of detention after a bill of indictment had been lodged with the court because at this point proceedings reached the phase in which there was no statutory time - limit [ on this measure ] . For this reason , the court concerned had no interest in [ knowing ] until when detention had been prolonged under the last decision [ ; ] detention could continue because \u2018 detention of limited ORG had become \u2018 detention of unlimited ORG . There was therefore only a need to ascertain whether there were grounds for continuing detention under LAW code . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its further resolution no . I ORG CARDINAL of DATE , ORG confirmed that :", "\u201c If the case , in which detention on remand had been ordered , has been referred to a court with a bill of indictment and the period of detention which had previously been fixed expires , the court has a duty to consider whether detention needs to be continued and to give an appropriate decision on this matter . \u201d", "Referring to the resolution of DATE , it also stressed that :", "\u201c \u2026 the ratio legis of the amendments to criminal legislation is based on the precept that a suspect ( accused ) should in no case be detained indefinitely until the first - instance judgment is rendered in his case \u2026", "It should be noted that , from the point of view of procedural safeguards for an accused , what is material is not how long his detention at the investigation stage has lasted and how long it has lasted at the stage of the court proceedings , but the total period of his detention and whether his detention and its length are subject to review . If there is such a review at the investigation stage ( section QUANTITY ) , there is no reason why there should not be CARDINAL at the stage of the court proceedings \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . A new Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted by the PERSON ( ORG ) on DATE . Its Article CARDINAL , in its relevant part , reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Detention on remand shall be imposed by a court order .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the investigative stage of proceedings , detention on remand shall be imposed , on a prosecutor 's request , by a district court in the jurisdiction of which investigations are being conducted .

NORP The prosecutor , when submitting to a court a request referred to in \u00a7 CARDINAL , shall at the same time order that the suspect be brought before a court . \"", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , before deciding whether the preventive measures should be imposed , the court shall hear the person charged with offence . The lawyer of the detainee should be allowed to attend in the court session concerning review of the lawfulness of pre - trial detention , if he or she is present at the court . However , it is not mandatory to inform the lawyer of the date and time of this session , unless the suspect so requests , and if it will not hinder the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The court shall inform the lawyer of a detainee of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision , concerning prolongation of detention on remand or an appeal against a decision to impose or to prolong detention on remand , is to be taken . A failure on the part of the duly informed lawyer to attend the session does not prevent the court from pursuing examination of the issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged his application with the ORG on DATE , alleging , inter alia , that the courts were arbitrary in their decisions relating to his detention . He complained in particular that for a certain unspecified period as from DATE his detention on remand had lacked legal basis , as no decision of a competent authority had been given in order to prolong it beyond that date . The applicant complained that he had never been brought before a court in the proceedings concerning the review the lawfulness of his detention on remand . He finally complained that under domestic law applicable at the material time , neither he nor his lawyer had been entitled to attend any hearing in the proceedings concerning review of the lawfulness of his detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The application was declared partly admissible by the Commission on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the Commission declared admissible the applicant \u2019s complaints under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW . In its report of CARDINAL DATE ( former LAW ) it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of LAW in that the applicant \u2019s detention under the bill of indictment had been unlawful , and that there had been a violation of LAW in that the proceedings concerning review of his detention on remand had not been truly adversarial .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that his detention on remand , insofar as it had been effected under the bill of indictment of CARDINAL DATE and after the detention order of DATE had expired , had not been in compliance with LAW , which states , insofar as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person . No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law :", "\u2026", "( c ) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so ;", "\u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that his detention from DATE to CARDINAL DATE lacked any legal basis , and requested the ORG to accept the opinion expressed by the ORG in its report that there had been a violation of LAW ( c ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Government acknowledged that the situation complained of had arisen out of a common practice of the NORP courts , referred to as \u201c placing a detainee at the disposal of a court \u201d , followed at the material time . This practice originated from the absence of any precisely formulated provision which would oblige the court to give , on its own motion , any further decision on the prolongation of detention after the bill of indictment had been submitted to the court .", "CARDINAL . The Government emphasised that this practice had been abandoned since DATE , when the amendments to LAW of DATE , enacted on DATE , had entered into force . Under these provisions , statutory time - limits of pre - trial detention had been introduced . Subsequently , the relevant provisions of LAW , which entered into force on DATE , had put an end to this practice . Under the provisions of the new Code , as currently interpreted in accordance with the case - law of ORG , following an expiry of a detention order given in the investigative stage of the proceedings and after the bill of indictment had been lodged with a court , a case must be referred to a court for a decision on further detention . Following interpretation of the relevant provisions by ORG , the new practice has been implemented by the courts .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not contest that the applicant \u2019s detention had been maintained after DATE without a judicial decision being given as to its prolongation after this date , fixed by the detention order of CARDINAL DATE . This detention , however , was in compliance with the substantive and procedural provisions of the NORP law applicable at the material time . Pursuant to LAW , the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s continued detention had been subject to a permanent supervision by ORG . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s request for release of DATE had been examined by that court as early as DATE , i.e. merely DATE after the preceding detention order had expired . The subsequent appeals , submitted by the applicant \u2019s father and by his counsel , had been dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the ORG stated that they would abstain from making their own assessment of the compatibility of the applicant \u2019s detention during the period under consideration with the requirements of LAW . They emphasised that the applicant \u2019s detention had been prescribed by law and effected in accordance with common practice . This practice had developed on the basis of regulations , which had been accessible , sufficiently precise and foreseeable . On the other hand , these provisions were not admittedly specific enough , and this had led to the practice complained of .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that the expressions \u201c lawful \u201d and \u201c in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law \u201d in LAW essentially refer back to national law and state the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof . While , in the first place , it is normal for the national authorities , notably the courts , to interpret and apply domestic law , it is otherwise in relation to cases where , as under LAW , failure to comply with that law entails a breach of the LAW . In such cases the ORG may , and should exercise a certain power to review whether national law has been observed ( see , among other authorities , GPE v. the GPE [ PERSON , no . NORP , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . However , the \u201c lawfulness \u201d of detention under domestic law is the primary , but not always a decisive element . The ORG must , in addition , be satisfied that detention during the period under consideration , was compatible with the purpose of LAW , which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary manner . Moreover , the ORG must ascertain whether domestic law itself is in conformity with the LAW , including the general principles expressed or implied therein ( see , among many other authorities , the PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; and the Erkalo v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-VI , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stresses in this connection that where deprivation of liberty is concerned , it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty is satisfied . It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law should be clearly defined , and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application , so that it meets the standard of \u201c lawfulness \u201d set by the LAW , a standard which requires that all law should be sufficiently precise to allow the person DATE if needed , to obtain the appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee , to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances , the consequences which a given action may entail ( see the LOC v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B , pp . CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , and , mutatis mutandis , ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ; the PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and the Steel and Others v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the circumstances of the present case , the ORG notes that the applicant \u2019s detention was prolonged , by an order of DATE , until DATE . On DATE the applicant requested to be released . The bill of indictment was lodged with ORG on DATE . On DATE the detention order expired , but the applicant remained in detention in view of the fact that , following lodging of the bill of indictment with ORG , he had been regarded as having been placed at the disposal of the latter . Subsequently , on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release of DATE . It is not in dispute that from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was maintained solely on the basis of the fact that a bill of indictment had in the meantime been submitted to the court competent to examine the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recalls that it found a violation of LAW in its recent judgment in the case LAW GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , where , considering detention under the same legal framework , the ORG stated as follows in \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE :", "\u201c The ORG observes that the domestic practice of keeping a person in detention under a bill of indictment was not based on any specific legislative provision or case - law but , as the ORG had found and the parties acknowledged before the ORG , stemmed from the fact that NORP criminal legislation at the material time lacked clear rules governing the situation of a detainee in court proceedings , after the expiry of the term of his detention fixed in the last detention order made at the investigation stage .", "Against this background , the ORG considers , first , that the relevant NORP criminal legislation , by reason of the absence of any precise provisions laying down whether DATE and if so , under what conditions DATE detention ordered for a limited period at the investigation stage could properly be prolonged at the stage of the court proceedings , does not satisfy the test of \u201c foreseeability \u201d of a \u201c law \u201d for the purposes of LAW .", "Secondly , the ORG considers that the practice which developed in response to the statutory lacuna , whereby a person is detained for an unlimited and unpredictable time and without his detention being based on a concrete legal provision or on any judicial decision is in itself contrary to the principle of legal certainty , a principle which is implied in the LAW and which constitutes CARDINAL of the basic elements of the rule of law .", "In that context the ORG also stresses that , for the purposes of LAW , detention which extends over a period of DATE and which has not been ordered by a court or by a judge or any other person \u201c authorised \u2026 to exercise judicial power \u201d can not be considered \u201c lawful \u201d in the sense of that provision . While this requirement is not explicitly stipulated in LAW , it can be inferred from LAW as a whole , in particular the wording in paragraph CARDINAL ( c ) ( \u201c for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority \u201d ) and paragraph CARDINAL ( \u201c shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power \u201d ) . In addition , the habeas corpus guarantee contained in LAW further supports the view that detention which is prolonged beyond the initial period foreseen in paragraph CARDINAL necessitates \u201c judicial \u201d intervention as a safeguard against arbitrariness . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the protection afforded by LAW against arbitrary deprivations of liberty would be seriously undermined if a person could be detained by executive order alone following a mere appearance before the judicial authorities referred to in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the facts , which had given rise to a violation of the LAW in the case quoted above , had occurred within the same legal framework as in the present case . The ORG sees no grounds , which would justify a different conclusion in the instant case . The ORG accordingly considers that the applicant \u2019s detention was not lawful within the meaning of LAW . Consequently , there was a breach of this provision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also asserted that the respondent ORG had breached LAW which reads :", "\u201c Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the proceedings concerning review of his detention were in breach of procedural requirements of this provision in that they were not adversarial .", "CARDINAL . The Government first referred to the ORG \u2019s case - law , according to which arrested or detained persons were entitled to a judicial review bearing upon the procedural and substantive conditions , essential for the lawfulness , in the ORG sense , of their deprivation of liberty . The competent court had to examine both compliance with the procedural requirements set out in domestic law , and the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention .", "CARDINAL . The Government abstained from making their own assessment of the compliance of the proceedings concerned , with the requirements of the ORG and asked the ORG to give its ruling in this respect . However , the Government emphasised that the provisions under which the applicant had been detained in the present case , had been repealed . Pursuant to the new Code of the Criminal Procedure , effective guarantees of equality of parties to the proceedings concerning review of pre - trial detention had been enacted . Therefore the question examined in the present case was only of a historical character .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recalls that by virtue of LAW , an arrested or detained person is entitled to bring proceedings for the review by a court of the procedural and substantive conditions , which are essential for the \u201c lawfulness \u201d , in the sense of LAW , of his or her deprivation of liberty ( see the PERSON and Others v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under LAW be attended by the same guarantees as those required LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW for criminal or civil litigation ( see the GPE v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question . In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of LAW ( c ) , a hearing is required ( see the PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . DATE , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , the PERSON - GPE v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and the NORP v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . In particular , in the proceedings in which an appeal against detention order is being examined , \u201c equality of arms \u201d between the parties , the prosecutor and the detained person , must be ensured ( ORG v. GPE [ PERSON ] , no . ORG , CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes the information provided by the ORG about the extensive legislative amendments which were effected with a view to bringing LAW in line with the LAW . However , the ORG \u2019s task is to assess the actual circumstances of the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that in the case under consideration , the applicant lodged requests for release , firstly on an unspecified date , and later on DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , and on DATE . ORG dismissed these requests on DATE , on later CARDINAL unspecified dates , and on DATE . The decision given on DATE was , upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , examined by the higher court which gave its ruling on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that it is not in dispute that the law , as it stood at that time , did not entitle either the applicant or his lawyer to attend the court session held in any of these proceedings in which the courts examined whether his detention was lawful and remained justified . Moreover , the applicable provisions of law on criminal procedure did not require that the prosecutor \u2019s submissions in support of the applicant \u2019s detention be communicated , either to the applicant or to his lawyer . Consequently , the applicant did not have any opportunity to comment on those arguments in order to contest the reasons invoked by the prosecuting authorities to justify his detention , either by disputing them directly before the court or by way of written submissions . At the same time the ORG notes that under applicable provisions it was open for the prosecutor to be present at any of court sessions , in which the court examined the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention . It is also to be noted that the prosecutor in fact availed himself once of this opportunity by attending the session of ORG on DATE , when it was examining the applicant \u2019s request for release of CARDINAL DATE , whereas neither the applicant nor his counsel was present before the court .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , in the light of the above considerations , the ORG finds that there has been a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed a sum of CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) as compensation for non - pecuniary damage resulting from his detention , in particular such as significant loss of health caused by his detention .", "CARDINAL . The Government considered that the applicant \u2019s claim is exorbitant and asked the ORG to rule that a finding a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction . In the alternative , they asked the ORG to assess the amount of just satisfaction on the basis of its case - law in similar cases and having regard to national economic circumstances , such as purchasing power of national currency and to current minimum gross salary in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the claim for the alleged damage suffered as a result of violation of LAW , the ORG recalls that in certain cases which concerned violations of LAW and CARDINAL it has made modest awards in respect of non - pecuniary damage ( see the PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Article CARDINAL ) , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and the De Jong , GPE and FAC the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . However , in more recent cases , it has declined to make any such award ( see the PERSON v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ; p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ; the PERSON and Others v. GPE ( Article CARDINAL ) judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B , pp . DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; the GPE v.

GPE , no . CARDINAL , LAW ) . In certain of these judgments , for instance given in cases of ORG , PERSON and ORG stated that just satisfaction can be awarded only in respect of damage resulting from a deprivation of liberty that the applicant would not have suffered if he or she had had the benefit of the procedural guarantees of LAW and concluded , according to the circumstances , that the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction in respect of any non - pecuniary damage suffered .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , the ORG can not speculate as to whether the applicant would have been detained if the procedural guarantees of LAW had been respected in his case . Consequently , the ORG considers that the non - pecuniary damage is adequately compensated by the finding of a violation of this provision .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further considers that as a result of his detention in breach of the provisions of LAW , the applicant suffered non - pecuniary damage , which would not be adequately compensated by the finding of a violation ( LAW GPE cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Accordingly , making its assessment on an equitable basis , the ORG awards the applicant LAW .", "DATE .
