Since DATE Mariannick PERSON has been living with PERSON ( the third applicant ) , who is divorced and has no children . The CARDINAL applicants lived together DATE , when the first applicant left to live with the man she had married . The couple divorced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a serious illness left the first applicant paraplegic . She kept her own home , but needed to be cared for by her mother and the third applicant , whom she regarded as her father . By agreement between the CARDINAL applicants , it was therefore decided that the third applicant should adopt the first applicant so that they could become a real family in the eyes of the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant filed an adoption request with ORG , enclosing CARDINAL letters attesting to the other CARDINAL applicants ' agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG pronounced the adoption .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the cantonal civil status authorities informed the second applicant that the adoption had the effect of terminating her legal parent - child relationship with the first applicant and that the latter would take on her adoptive father 's surname , as she was henceforth his daughter . The first CARDINAL applicants objected to the termination of the mother - daughter relationship between them and requested that it be restored .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the cantonal civil status authorities announced that they were standing by their decision , which was based on LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law \u201d , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Under the provisions of that Article previously existing parent - child relationships were severed on adoption , save in respect of the spouse of the adoptive parent . PERSON and PERSON , however , were simply cohabiting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG , ORG formally rejected the request for restoration of the mother - daughter relationship . The applicants applied to the administrative court seeking to have that decision quashed and requesting a declaration that the adoption had not severed the mother - child relationship and that the adopted child could keep her name . On DATE the applicants instituted parallel proceedings in ORG to have the adoption order set aside . The court suspended the proceedings pending the outcome of the present application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the administrative court partly allowed the application , setting aside the decisions of DATE and DATE in so far as they severed the mother - daughter relationship , and ordering the cantonal civil status authorities to restore that relationship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having been informed of that decision , referred the matter to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal and invited the cantonal civil status authorities to record the adoption in the civil status register . In its judgment ORG considered whether there was an omission in LAW with regard to the adoption by a cohabitant of his or her partner 's child . It pointed out that the adoption of the spouse 's child , whether considered as a form of joint adoption or as adoption by a single person , created a legal parent - child relationship between the child and the adoptive parent without severing the existing relationship between the child and its parent . It also pointed out that adoption should be in the interest of the child , so that joint adoption should be the rule and adoption by a single person the exception . ORG noted that adoption by a single person was not subject to any condition other than that of the child 's welfare . It concluded that adoption could satisfy that condition only if the link between the partners was strong and lasting , which in principle excluded cohabiting partners , between whom relationships were less stable than between married couples . That was also the reasoning behind the adoption of section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of ORG of DATE , which entered into force on DATE and restricted sperm donation to married couples only . ORG reiterated in this connection that ORG had explicitly stated that the requirements in respect of sperm donation could not be less strict than those concerning joint adoption , a possibility which was open only to married couples , that a stable and lasting relationship between the parents was essential to the child 's healthy development , and that common - law partnerships were generally less solid than marriages and , unlike marriage , did not guarantee durability and could therefore not be compared with marriage . ORG thus held that Article CARDINAL a ) \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW could not be applied by analogy , and that there was no omission in the law that needed to be remedied . That court considered that the situation was that provided for in LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic and international law \u201d , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Concerning the Convention , ORG considered that Article CARDINAL did not embody the right to demand a form of adoption that was not provided for by law . Furthermore , the very essence of adoption being the forging of new family ties , prohibiting the accumulation of parent - child relationships was not at variance with LAW . As to LAW , ORG repeated that it referred only to marriage and did not confer a right to adopt . ORG also considered the complaint concerning the applicants ' unwillingness to accept the legal consequences of the adoption , and found that they could bring proceedings to have the adoption annulled for lack of consent . The judgment was served on the applicants on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW are as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
