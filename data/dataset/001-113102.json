This being so , all court proceedings concerning such property had to be brought against the Custodian and not against the NORP - Cypriot owner ( Section CARDINAL ( b ) of ORG ) . The court found therefore that the contract of sale and transfer entered into by the claimants concerning the property under custodianship was in breach of the provisions of LAW and was therefore illegal . The court also found that the contract was contrary to public policy as the contract interfered with the arrangements made by the ORG following the NORP invasion in order to protect NORP - Cypriot property and deal with the needs of CARDINAL of refugees . The court accordingly set aside the first - instance decision enforcing the sale contract and dismissed the action . It issued an order annulling the contract and the order of transfer that had been issued for the purposes of specific performance ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
