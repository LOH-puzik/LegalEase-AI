The applicants are husband and wife . They were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first applicant , who was an artist , purchased from the ORG through ORG a workshop of QUANTITY in GPE . It appears that the second applicant , being the first applicant \u2019s spouse , acquired a share in the property . The price , CARDINAL \u201c old \u201d NORP levs ( ORG ) , was determined in accordance with the relevant legislation and paid by the first applicant . At the relevant time this sum was the equivalent of not CARDINAL average DATE salaries .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants made substantial alterations to the property . The applicants used the property as a workshop and as their home .", "CARDINAL . The property , located in a building constructed not DATE , had originally consisted of CARDINAL separate LOC which had become ORG property in DATE and DATE , when a Mr A. and PERSON , the owners , had each sold their LOC to the ORG , through ORG . The transaction had been executed pursuant to ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , at prices determined by the relevant regulations ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the heirs of PERSON and PERSON reimbursed the price their families had received in DATE and DATE respectively and , claiming that they had thereby restored their title to the respective parts of the property by virtue of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , filed a rei vindicatio action against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings went through CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction and ended with a final judgment of ORG DATE ordering the applicants to vacate the property .", "CARDINAL . The courts noted that in accordance with the DATE Act the former owners of real estate sold to the State under Decree no . DATE could automatically restore their title by reimbursing the price they had received from the ORG . The restored owners were entitled to claim their property from any third person , even where the latter had acquired it by means of a valid transaction . The courts found that in the case at hand the plaintiffs had reimbursed the price their families had received in DATE and DATE and had restored their title . Under the DATE Act the applicants were no longer the owners and had to vacate the LOC . The fact that they had purchased the property in DATE by means of a valid transaction was immaterial .", "CARDINAL . The relevant court judgments in the DATE proceedings , as well as the ORG notary deed , described the property as covering QUANTITY on CARDINAL levels : ( i ) basement , used as a workshop ( QUANTITY ) , ( ii ) art gallery ( QUANTITY ) and ( iii ) upper level ( QUANTITY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were evicted from the property . They moved into a room of QUANTITY belonging to a friend of theirs , where they lived until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants asked the GPE municipality to provide them with a municipal flat for rent . The municipality agreed but proposed to the applicants , in DATE , a squatted flat and later on a flat located below ground level , which the applicants refused as being unsuitable for occupation . Eventually , in DATE the applicants were granted the tenancy of a CARDINAL - room municipal flat at regulated prices .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicants brought an action under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , seeking compensation for improvements in the property from the heirs of PERSON and PERSON By a judgment of DATE ORG awarded the applicants MONEY ( ORG ) ( the equivalent of approximately ORG CARDINAL ) apparently on the basis of up - to - date market prices .", "CARDINAL . On DATE this judgment was quashed by ORG which referred the case for renewed examination indicating that the compensation should be in the amount of the expenses disbursed by the applicants for the reconstruction of their property , calculated with reference to prices as in force at the relevant time \u2013 the CARDINALs .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter the applicants abandoned the proceedings as it became clear that as a result of the devaluation of the NORP currency , inflation and the NORP courts\u2019 practice of refusing revalorisation they could only hope to obtain a token compensation . The proceedings were terminated on an unspecified date in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of Council of Ministers Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , the ORG or municipal enterprises were authorised to \u201c buy up \u201d , from the individuals who owned them , stores , workshops , storage houses or similar LOC . The price was fixed by administrative decision on the basis of legislation . While the Decree provided that the owner should propose that his or her property be purchased , in reality the owners were pressured to sell their property under ORG policy of limiting private economic activity ( see ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , noting , obiter , that the individuals concerned had been forced to sell their shop ) . This policy had been implemented , among other means , via the Citizens\u2019 Property Act DATE , which limited to a minimum private ownership of LOC for economic activity .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG adopted ORG DATE , which provided that the former owners of real property sold to ORG no . DATE could restore their title automatically by reimbursing the price they had received within DATE of the Act \u2019s entry into force ( section QUANTITY ) . The restored owners were entitled to claim their property from any third person , even where the latter had acquired it by means of a valid transaction ( see also ORG judgment no.CARDINAL of CARDINAL in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW persons in the applicants\u2019 position to seek compensation for improvements they have made to the property . They can recover the sums spent for the improvements , not an amount representing the resulting value increase ( see ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In practice , however , these claims only lead to recovery of insignificant amounts owing to inflation , which in DATE depreciated the national currency by a factor of CARDINAL , and as a result of the NORP courts\u2019 practice of refusing revalorisation . LAW does not provide for recovery by persons in the applicants\u2019 position of the price they paid for the property . Theoretically , they could bring proceedings for unjust enrichment under LAW against the ORG or the enterprise or institution which had received reimbursement from the restored owners under LAW but there is no reported case - law confirming this possibility ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
