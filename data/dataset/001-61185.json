According to the evidence given by ORG at the inquest , the police had interviewed CARDINAL people in connection with the murder , but had found that , although their suspicions were not assuaged , and they remained reasonably certain that the main perpetrators of the murder were among the suspects , there was insufficient evidence to sustain a charge of murder .

This had been investigated by the PERSON inquiry team ( see below ) , with whom he liaised closely .

Any evidence or allegation of criminal conduct had been rigorously followed up .
