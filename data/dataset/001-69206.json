Other external findings noted were a slight deformation on the right side of the chest . The nailbeds , lips and ears were described as being cyanosed . There was widespread bleeding under the skin of the back . The external genitalia were normal . The epidermis was described as separating from the dermis .", "CARDINAL . The body was photographed both before and during the internal examination of the body .", "CARDINAL . The internal examination found that there was bruising and haematoma under the sutured injury . The skull was intact . There was no bleeding on either the outside or the inside of the brain membranes . The brain was described as being slightly oedematous . The sections taken of the brain and the cerebellum were normal . The bones of the skull base were not fractured .", "CARDINAL . The mouth , throat and neck structures were described as being normal . The chest deformation was noted to be structural and not due to trauma . There were several bleeding spots on the lung surfaces . The lungs were extensively oedematous and congested .

Stress ulcers seen in the stomach were associated with a little bleeding . The other organs in the abdomen were normal .", "CARDINAL . During the autopsy the Prosecutor and the doctor had regard to a medical report which had been drawn up at ORG on DATE .

There was also a slight wound on the big toe of the right foot . Neither of these CARDINAL wounds was life threatening .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor and the doctor had regard to an arrest report drawn up at TIME on DATE in relation to the arrest of PERSON . This report was also not made available to either the ORG or to the ORG . It appears from the summary of this report , which was reproduced in the autopsy report , that PERSON and CARDINAL other men had been in a flat on the sixth floor of a block of flats . When they were running down the stairs , PERSON had fallen down , injuring his right toe and also a spot above his right eye . The Prosecutor asked PERSON whether the injuries observed during the autopsy could have been caused in the course of the sequence of events as described in the arrest report . PERSON replied that the injuries recorded in report no . DATE were consistent with the injuries described in the arrest report .", "CARDINAL . A decision was made to send the samples taken from internal organs for histology and toxicology examinations .", "CARDINAL . The doctor concluded that the death was due to asphyxiation and added that it would be possible to establish the cause of the asphyxiation after the examination of the body samples at ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to this report , the body samples taken from PERSON body during the autopsy which were subjected to a toxicological examination did not disclose any poisons .", "CARDINAL . This was a report drawn up and signed by a number of doctors . The report referred to the conclusions set out in the above mentioned autopsy and toxicology reports . In this report there was also a reference to a histology report , which had apparently been drawn up on DATE and had concluded that the examination of the samples from the heart , lungs , liver , kidneys and the spleen had revealed the presence of autolysis , but that nothing was seen in the brain or cerebellum . A decision was taken to seek the opinion of ORG .", "CARDINAL . This report was drawn up and signed by CARDINAL doctors , each a specialist in different areas of medicine . They based their opinions on the reports referred to above and on the photographs of the body which had been taken during the autopsy ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The doctors also had regard to CARDINAL statements taken from ORG and Dr PERSON on DATE . It appears from the summaries of these statements , which are reproduced in the report , that ORG had been detained in the same place as PERSON and that ORG had allegedly told Mr Kutlu that he had hurt himself while trying to run away from the police during his arrest and , because of that , his right foot was swollen and he was unwell . Mr PERSON was also said to have added that PERSON condition had worsened during TIME DATE and that he had died TIME .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON was reported as having said in his statement of CARDINAL DATE that PERSON had been brought to him by officials on DATE and that , apart from the findings he had previously observed , he had now also observed a wound , measuring QUANTITY , on the top part of the head which did not require hospitalisation .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that death was due to respiratory failure related to lung oedema . The ORG commented that , apart from the wounds on the top part of the head , above the right eyebrow and the big toe of the right foot , there were no other symptoms of an assault or traumatic change , which excluded the possibility of an external trauma being the cause of death .", "CARDINAL . ORG further commented that , although there was evidence of asphyxiation , no change was observed in the neck area under the skin and there was no evidence of any compression of the chest or abdomen to indicate that death had occurred as the result of mechanical asphyxiation . There was oedema of the lungs and brain , and ulcers in the stomach with bleeding from them , indicating general anoxia and asphyxiation findings related to extreme lung oedema .", "CARDINAL . This decision was taken by ORG at ORG . PERSON , a police officer at ORG , was referred to in the decision as the defendant . The offence in question was recorded as \u201c death in custody on DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor stated that PERSON who is a member of the terrorist organisation \u201d , had fallen down the stairs in an attempt to avoid arrest by police officers and injured himself . He had then been taken by police officers to ORG for treatment . The Prosecutor also referred to the medical reports above , and added that the report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) had been submitted to ORG of ORG on DATE , \u201c to establish the cause of the oedema in the lungs , which had caused the respiratory failure \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A copy of the subsequent report of ORG of ORG ( date unknown ) was not made available to the ORG or to the ORG . However , according to the decision not to prosecute , it was stated in that medical report that there was no evidence to suggest that the oedema in the lungs had been due to a technical or traumatic reason . ORG had apparently concluded that the cause of the oedema could not be established because the body samples sent for microscopic examination had become autolysed . The Prosecutor concluded therefore that there was no evidence that the officer had committed the offence in question and he decided not to prosecute the accused .", "CARDINAL . NORP This decision , which was communicated to the applicant on DATE , became final on DATE as no objection had been lodged against it .", "CARDINAL . In her petition the applicant submitted that her CARDINAL sons , ORG and ORG , had been arrested in their home by the police on DATE . She asked the Prosecutor for information about her sons\u2019 fate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor wrote on the applicant \u2019s petition that \u201c [ the applicant \u2019s sons ] were taken into detention at the ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP This report was prepared on behalf of the applicant by Dr PERSON , a Reader in Forensic Pathology at ORG and consultant pathologist to ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report recounted the findings of the autopsy and of the other reports referred to above . PERSON observed , inter alia , the following shortcomings :", "( a ) no organ weights , in particular the weight of the lungs , were recorded . Furthermore , no description of the presence or absence of petechiae was made , despite the diagnosis of asphyxiation ;", "( b ) the QUANTITY laceration described by Dr PERSON is not described in any of the autopsy reports , even though a QUANTITY wound , or a scar from such wound , should have been noticed . It seems unlikely that a QUANTITY wound seen at autopsy could have been mistaken for a QUANTITY wound ; in any event they were described in different positions ;", "( c ) a QUANTITY wound is a large wound to be caused by DATE ; this wound appears to have occurred whilst in custody , and not in DATE during the arrest ;", "( d ) there is CARDINAL area of the original autopsy report which does not appear to have been commented on , and that is the presence of diffuse bleeding under the skin of the back . Diffuse bleeding strongly suggests that blows have been delivered to the back ;", "( e ) NORP the post mortem findings in this case with lung oedema and congestion , some brain oedema and stress ulcers , and the absence of any natural cause of death , raise strong concerns that death has been caused by mechanical asphyxiation . In positional asphyxia , the pinning of the body and restraint may prevent proper breathing . This could , for example , be caused by the person being laid on the floor and somebody compressing his back . Bleeding into the back would support this scenario .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted to the ORG and to the ORG a number of statements taken by lawyers at the ORG branch of ORG from witnesses who had either witnessed the arrest of the applicant \u2019s son or who had been detained with the applicant \u2019s son . These statements formed the basis of the applicant \u2019s submissions above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
