But the aggressive language used by PERSON has the effect of an electric shock on the reader . ' It is a war ' , writes the ambassador , ' a war GPE must wage , and win , on the external and the domestic fronts ' . He describes Senator PERSON and the NORP organisations as ' adversaries ' , saying that ' most of our adversaries are not to be trusted ' .", "In his paper , PERSON mentions the possibility of concluding an agreement , because ' the NORP organisations and Senator PERSON must be placated as a matter of urgency ' .

PERSON , who heads the embassy , regularly puts his foot in it . In DATE , DATE after moving into his office in the prestigious FAC , this senior diplomat committed his first faux pas . In an interview with ORG , he complained about the NORP administration , saying ' I 've observed a certain lack of courtesy ' . Even PERSON , who was said to ' burst out laughing sometimes at inopportune moments ' , was criticised during the interview . Apparently , Mr PERSON had ' kept [ Carlo Jagmetti ] waiting for DATE before he was accredited . And , according to the ambassador , it was legitimate to ask , on a general note , ' who [ was ] actually governing GPE .", "GPE reprimanded the ambassador for his ill - chosen remarks and for an unconventional public appearance ( PERSON and his wife had been pictured [ in an article in the magazine ORG ] in their bathrobes ) , but the ambassador did not prove much more reticent in his subsequent utterances . And in the highly topical debate concerning the assets of Holocaust victims , PERSON has also given the impression of somebody blundering onto the diplomatic stage in outsize boots . He rebuked the Holocaust survivor PERSON in front of the assembled NORP press , saying that her claims were unfounded as her uncle had emptied the NORP bank account in question . The incident - prone diplomat based his remarks , however , not on proven facts , but on unsubstantiated rumours which had been circulating .", "GPE was left with no choice but to apologise for his undiplomatic remarks in a bid to limit the damage .", "These remarks , which have now been made public , are all the more embarrassing since the tension seemed to be easing .

In its decision ORG , noting that prior to its publication by the applicant , the strategy paper had not been in the public domain , found that the issue of whether the content of the paper should ultimately be divulged was irrelevant . The document had been far from insignificant , as it contained an assessment of the delicate foreign - policy situation in which GPE found itself in relation to the assets of Holocaust victims deposited in NORP banks . It outlined various strategies open to GPE in order to deal with this difficult situation . ORG held that carefully worded evaluations and assessments , provided on a regular basis , were an essential part of the exchange and formation of opinion among ambassadors . That being so , even dissenting points of view were circulated internally . Article CARDINAL of LAW was designed to ensure freedom to form opinions without undue outside influence . In the instant case , the document in question had been aimed at assisting the head of the task force set up by the Government to form his opinion , and would therefore have influenced the country 's handling of the issue concerned . Given its nature , publishing an internal document of that kind could have devastating consequences .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant 's argument that the public had the right to be informed of points of view which were at variance with the official NORP position , ORG considered that the applicant had in reality sought to report on a document whose style he found offensive . He could have started a public debate on the issue without contravening LAW . Lastly , ORG considered that this was not a matter of \u201c minor importance \u201d within the meaning of the third paragraph of that Article . By publishing the paper , the applicant had jeopardised NORP foreign policy .", "CARDINAL . In determining the amount of the fine , ORG took mitigating circumstances into account , notably the fact that the disclosure of the confidential document had not undermined GPE 's very foundations . In addition , the applicant had published the article with the approval of his editor and the newspaper 's legal department , and with the intention of starting an open debate on the subject .", "CARDINAL .

He complained that a journalist could be convicted of an offence under LAW only in exceptional circumstances , namely if the secret published was of unusual importance and publishing it undermined the country 's very foundations . He referred to the public interest in the remarks made by the NORP ambassador and the role of journalists as watchdogs in a NORP society .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeals in CARDINAL judgments dated DATE ( served on DATE ) in which it upheld the decisions of the lower courts . ORG considered in particular that the applicant , in submitting that LAW should apply only to breaches of confidentiality in matters of major importance , was in fact requesting that the legislative provision in question be amended . That was not within the jurisdiction of ORG . Whether or not a fact was confidential depended not on the degree of public interest in the information , but on the content and subject matter of the fact in question .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , ORG PERSON ) had requested ORG ( ORG ) to examine the case .", "ORG acts as a complaints body for media - related issues . It is an institution under NORP private law set up by CARDINAL associations of journalists which formed a foundation ( ORG ) to organise and fund the activities of ORG . According to ORG rules , its activities are intended to contribute to the discussion of fundamental ethical issues in relation to the media . Its task is to uphold freedom of the press and freedom of information , and it adopts opinions , on its own initiative or in response to complaints , on issues concerning journalistic ethics . ORG has adopted a \u201c Declaration on the rights and responsibilities of journalists \u201d which is available on the Internet .", "Below is its opinion ( Stellungnahme ) of DATE concerning the present case ( no .

It must first be established whether diplomats ' reports come under the heading of vital interests . The federal authorities and those who share their point of view argue that these reports are highly sensitive and comparable to the negotiations conducted by ORG and the reports preceding such negotiations . These documents , they argue , merit greater protection than , for instance , expert reports or TIME of parliamentary committees . ORG and ORG can not form an accurate picture of international relations unless the ambassadors provide them with additional information , different to and more sensitive than that provided by the media . Diplomats also provide information they have obtained from confidential sources , behind the scenes or off the record . They need , for instance , to be able to express in plain language their views about violations of human rights and political relations in GPE , the involvement of leading NORP politicians in drug trafficking and the true picture with regard to the balance of power and intrigue in the ORG . If , despite everything , reports of this kind are published , the ambassador concerned will almost automatically be declared persona non grata in the host country . If reports of this kind were to be published on a regular basis , ambassadors would no longer be able to report on everything that was going on . That would have an adverse impact on NORP foreign policy , perhaps even paralysing it completely . And if everything were to be made public , GPE might just as well recall its diplomats and replace them with the media . In exercising their function as critic and watchdog , the media must always remain mindful of their responsibilities . This applies with particular force in the sphere of foreign policy , as the reports relating to foreign policy are also read abroad . If only for this reason , they are more sensitive than reports on domestic policy matters .", "Conversely , the representatives of the media argue that the function of the media as critic and watchdog is much the same in the foreign policy sphere as in other spheres . The tendency to invoke the national interest is particularly marked where foreign policy is concerned . This happened in GPE in the case of the closure of the ORG agency and the revelations concerning the defects in the ORG CARDINAL tanks , and in GPE in the case of the Watergate and ORG scandals . However , NORP foreign policy is not a reserved area . When the media bow to the wishes of the Government , we are dangerously close to the kind of artificial neutrality we had during the Second World War . In all spheres , including foreign policy , it is argued , reforms occur only when the veil of secrecy is lifted .", "ORG acknowledges the importance of the principle that diplomatic correspondence should remain confidential . In the past , the NORP media have observed that principle in substance and have not set out to expose the internal workings of diplomacy to public view . Revelations in the foreign policy sphere have been the exception rather than the rule in GPE . Media bosses are clearly aware of the responsibilities inherent in the media 's role as critic and watchdog in this sphere . At the same time , it should not be forgotten that revelations by the media in the field of foreign policy are commonplace in other countries , particularly in GPE , but also in GPE and GPE . Clearly , other governments and diplomats have long had to contend with this risk of revelations concerning foreign policy , and have learned to live with it . Whether they like it or not , the NORP authorities must also learn to adjust to a situation in which foreign policy is as much the focus of media attention as domestic policy , and in which revelations may come not just from the NORP media but also from foreign media . An approach which places confidentiality before the public interest in too rigid a manner is neither realistic nor legitimate , particularly since diplomatic reports are regularly forwarded to a large number of authorities .", "There can be no doubt that the revelations in ORG and the TagesAnzeiger were a source of embarrassment and problems for those responsible for NORP foreign policy , but they did not restrict their room for manoeuvre substantially . Diplomatic reports are confidential in law , but when the conditions that allow confidential reports to be published are met , freedom of the press must take precedence ( Opinion CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG parliamentary questions ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG must now examine whether the content of Mr Jagmetti 's strategy paper is of such importance that it was appropriate to invoke the public interest , and whether it should have been published . In the view of PERSON , editor of ORG , the public interest lay in the fact that it was important to let people know how the NORP ambassador in GPE perceived the complex issue of the assets of the Holocaust victims and the way GPE was coming to terms with its past , and the kind of aggressive language he used . According to PERSON , his newspaper did not publish any leaked information unless the public interest was at stake . Although there were more leaks now than previously , they were not damaging in principle , and were often the only remaining means of putting a stop to harmful conduct . The representatives of other media also recognised the fact that Mr ORG 's paper was of public interest , as it shed important light on the PERSON affair . The television channels or the Tages - Anzeiger , for example , would have reported on the document in the same way had they happened on it first .", "Those critical of the publication of Mr ORG 's paper , on the other hand , take the view that the public interest of information not intended for public consumption is invariably defined by the media themselves , and that other factors should be considered , such as confidentiality , personality rights , the national interest , the foreseeable consequences of disclosure and the motives and interests of those providing the information . In the present case , so the argument runs , Ambassador ORG 's report was of limited public interest , since prior to publication it had been a non - event , it was already DATE and it could not be made public without damaging NORP interests . In that respect , the ORG undermined NORP foreign policy in a foreseeable and serious manner which was not justified in the public interest . According to this line of argument , the ORG report should properly have been dealt with as a background document in the classic sense and should not have been published , either in full or in part .", "From ORG standpoint , the next step is to assess the strategic importance of PERSON paper . PERSON set out in this document to make a perfectly reasonable analysis of the situation , making a number of constructive proposals . He explored CARDINAL ' extreme ' options DATE the first involving some kind of ' deal ' and the second involving a ' legal approach ' . The paper testifies to a fundamental concern to get at the truth , to find a generous financial solution and to protect NORP interests and the country 's good relations with GPE . However , it could not escape the attention of even the most casual reader that PERSON used very bellicose language and that he regarded his negotiating partners as adversaries who were not to be trusted and who might be amenable to some kind of deal . The language used betrays attitudes which are problematic even in an internal document , since attitudes are liable to be reflected also in negotiations and informal contacts . In that connection , PERSON was to have been engaged in important discussions concerning the assets of Holocaust victims during DATE of his tenure .", "ORG is mindful of the fact that the degree of public interest of confidential information can not be determined in a wholly objective manner , but depends on the ideological , cultural , economic and advertising context in which the medium operates . Nevertheless , in the case of PERSON strategy paper , the public interest was clear , as the debate surrounding the assets of Holocaust victims and GPE 's role in the Second World War was highly topical in DATE and DATE and had an international dimension , and because the NORP ambassador in GPE was to occupy a prominent position in the forthcoming discussions . Knowing what that ambassador thought and how he formulated his opinions was relevant , and not a trivial concern . Leaving aside the question of the public interest and the relevance of the ambassador 's remarks , the publication of this supposedly confidential paper was justified from an ethical viewpoint , as only as a result of its publication did it become clear that those in charge still had no very clear idea , despite the creation of the task force , as to the question of NORP responsibility and what steps should be taken . From the perspective of political transparency , publication of the confidential paper , despite the fact that it was DATE and that in the meantime there had been talk of setting up a fund for Holocaust victims , might have spurred the Government on to overcome the problems , demonstrate leadership and devise convincing solutions .", "CARDINAL . Finally , it is necessary to assess whether the information was made public in the most appropriate form . According to CARDINAL school of thought , the media are in a position of power , since not only do they inform , they also suggest by the way in which they present the information how it is to be viewed . In the present case FAC , it is argued , presented an internal analysis of foreign policy in truncated form and , by publishing it alongside comments from third parties who had not seen the original text , planted in people 's minds the idea that Ambassador PERSON had \u201c insulted the NORP \u201d . The newspaper , by accusing PERSON of antiSemitism , started a rumour in an irresponsible manner . Reproducing the full text would not have placed PERSON under the same kind of pressure and would not have forced him to resign . The manner in which the information was published , therefore , was the source of problems and consternation .", "The opposing school of thought argues that it is vital to analyse the salient points of Mr ORG 's remarks . According to ORG , there was no question of accusing Ambassador PERSON of NORP . Nevertheless , the newspaper 's editors have acknowledged off the record that it would have been wiser to publish the strategy paper in full . They maintain that , on DATE of publication , it would have been virtually impossible to add another page to the newspaper and that plans to publish the full text on the Internet were abandoned owing to technical problems .", "ORG regards these arguments as spurious , and agrees with the criticism regarding the manner of publication . ORG did not make sufficiently clear that Ambassador PERSON had outlined several options in his strategy paper , of which the ' deal ' was just one . Nor did it make the timing of the events sufficiently clear , particularly since the document was already DATE and had reached the addressees before the interview given by the outgoing NORP President on the programme DATE / ORG . The newspaper unnecessarily made the affair appear shocking and scandalous and , by its use of the headline \u201c Mr PERSON insults the NORP \u201d , misled the reader and made it appear that the remarks had been made DATE . It was incorrect to assert that PERSON letter undermined the process which had begun in DATE , particularly since the document had been circulated beforehand and had not previously been in the public domain , and could not therefore adversely affect the talks with the country 's partners at home and abroad . When ORG attempted to contact Mr ORG on DATE in order to obtain a comment , and failed to reach him because he was in GPE , the newspaper 's editors should have considered whether it might not be wiser to delay publication by DATE so as to be able to publish an interview with PERSON alongside the extracts from his paper . The fact that publication went ahead in the next issue can only have been prompted by the fear of competition , which on no account constitutes sufficient justification for immediate publication . Hence , by publishing the strategy paper in the way it did , the ORG omitted vital pieces of information , in breach of the LAW on the rights and responsibilities of journalists ( point CARDINAL of the Declaration of responsibilities ) .", "...", "III . Findings", "CARDINAL . Freedom of the press is too fundamental a right to be made subservient as a matter of principle to the interests of the ORG . The media 's role as critic and watchdog requires them to make information public where the public interest is at stake , whether the source of information is freely accessible or confidential .", "CARDINAL . As to the publication of confidential information , the pros and cons must be weighed up carefully , with an eye to whether interests which merit protection are liable to be damaged in the process .", "CARDINAL . Internal reports by diplomats are rightly confidential , but do not necessarily merit a high degree of protection in all cases . The media 's role as critic and watchdog also extends to foreign policy , with the result that those in charge in the media may publish a diplomatic report if they consider its content to be in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON , the interest to the public of his strategy paper should be acknowledged , as should the fact that its publication was legitimate on account of the importance of the public debate on the assets of Holocaust victims , the prominent position occupied by the NORP ambassador in GPE and the content of the document .", "CARDINAL . NORP In this case FAC , in irresponsible fashion , by printing the strategy paper in truncated form and failing to make the timing of the events sufficiently clear , made PERSON views appear shocking and scandalous . The newspaper therefore acted in breach of the LAW on the rights and responsibilities of journalists ( point CARDINAL of the Declaration of responsibilities ) .
