THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a freelance tax consultant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Inspector of Direct Taxes sent the applicant an assessment of supplementary income tax ( naheffingsaanslag ) for DATE . In accordance with the applicable provisions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) a fiscal penalty was additionally imposed to an amount equal to that of the assessment . The penalty came to MONEY ( NLG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against this assessment with ORG of ORG ( gerechtshof ) . By letter of DATE the registrar of that court asked the applicant to pay a court registration fee of NLG CARDINAL pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG ( GPE administratieve rechtspraak belastingzaken ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal was declared inadmissible by the President of ORG on DATE on the ground that the court registration fee had not been paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection ( verzet ) against this decision with ORG . He submitted that he had sent an order to his bank for the payment by bank transfer of the court registration fee , but that that order had not been carried out . In his view this error on the part of the bank could not be held against him .", "CARDINAL . Having held a hearing on DATE , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s objection unfounded on DATE . It held that , as the applicant had himself chosen to make use of the services of a bank , it had been up to him to see to it that his order was correctly carried out .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . He submitted that ORG had erred in law by holding him responsible for a mistake made by his bank in carrying out his transfer order . In the alternative , he submitted that the imposition of a fiscal penalty amounted to a penal sanction , and that it was inappropriate to levy a court registration fee in any case concerning the determination of a \u201c criminal charge \u201d .", "The Deputy Minister of Finance ( Staatssecretaris van Financi\u00ebn ) filed a written statement of defence ( vertoogschrift ) .", "CARDINAL . One of the advocates - general to ORG submitted an advisory opinion on DATE .

The applicant did not receive a copy of the advisory opinion until ORG delivered its judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE .", "It held that a failure on the part of a bank to carry out an order for the transfer of a court registration fee could not be held against the person who had given such an order if the latter saw to it that the payment was made as soon as possible after he could reasonably be expected to be aware of such failure . Nevertheless , it appeared that the applicant had not paid the court registration fee at all and his primary submission had therefore to be rejected .", "It further held that the court registration fee in question was not such as to constitute any real impediment to a taxpayer \u2019s right of access to a court , and that in appropriate cases a reduction of the fee in question could be granted . The applicant \u2019s alternative submission was therefore also rejected .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Algemene wet inzake rijksbelastingen ) a demand for supplementary tax is made if a tax for which the taxpayer is under an obligation to file a declaration ( die op aangifte behoort te worden voldaan of afgedragen ) is not paid in its entirety or not paid at all .", "In such cases a fiscal penalty is additionally imposed to an amount equal to the amount due in tax ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . It is open to a taxpayer to submit an administrative objection ( bezwaarschrift ) to the competent tax inspector ( section CARDINAL ) .", "An appeal against the latter \u2019s decision lies to ORG ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It is , however , also open to the taxpayer to lodge an appeal directly to ORG without first submitting an administrative objection to the tax inspector ( section PERSON ) ) . This was the course followed by the applicant in the present case .", "CARDINAL . A taxpayer who lodges an appeal with ORG is required to pay a court registration fee , which at the relevant time amounted to NLG CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) of ORG ) . This fee is reduced by NLG CARDINAL if the financial interest is very small ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) , or if the taxpayer is indigent ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "The entire fee is paid back to the taxpayer if his appeal is upheld in whole or in part ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . An appeal on points of law against the decision of ORG lies to ORG ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be lodged by the competent tax inspector or other tax authority as well as by the taxpayer .", "CARDINAL . The defendant party \u2013 tax authority or taxpayer , as the case may be \u2013 may submit a written statement of defence ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG does not hold an oral hearing unless it is asked to do so by one of the parties . Such a request may be made in either the statement of points of appeal or the statement of defence , or after the filing of those statements , by the party which has lodged the appeal on points of law ; in the latter case the time - limit for so doing is DATE after the statement of defence was sent to the party concerned ( section PERSON ) ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP If PERSON expresses the wish to be heard , the case file is sent to him after the hearing , or after the filing of the written statements if no hearing is held ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . He must submit his advisory opinion in writing ( section CARDINAL ) ) .", "It is not provided that the taxpayer must be supplied with a copy of the advisory opinion before the delivery of the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG deliberates in camera . Although there is no legal provision prohibiting the Procurator - General from attending ORG deliberations , in practice he never attends .", "CARDINAL . ORG may quash the decision appealed against on the grounds adduced or on other grounds ( section CARDINAL ) . In that event it decides on the merits of the case , substituting for the decision of ORG the decision on the merits which the latter ought to have given . Only if the decision on the merits depends on important facts which have not been established at an earlier stage of the proceedings does ORG refer the case back to ORG which gave the decision appealed against or CARDINAL of the other courts of appeal ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . The duties and position of the Procurator - General \u2019s department ( openbaar ministerie ) are defined in ORG ( Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie ) .", "CARDINAL . The Procurator - General \u2019s department consists of the Procurator - General and advocates - general of ORG , the procurators - general and advocates - general of the courts of appeal and the public prosecutors of the regional and district courts ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) . The advocates - general of ORG act as deputies of the Procurator - General of that court and are subordinate to him ( sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL and DATE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The Procurator - General \u2019s department must be heard by the courts in so far as the law so prescribes ( section CARDINAL ) . The advisory opinion of PERSON or an advocate - general to ORG takes the form of a learned treatise containing references to relevant case - law and legal literature and a recommendation , which is not binding on ORG , to uphold or reject points of appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
