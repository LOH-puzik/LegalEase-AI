In DATE the applicant lodged a complaint before the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman , alleging sexual harassment by CARDINAL of her male colleagues , a member of the diplomatic staff of the embassy . Following an inquiry , the ORG reported that the applicant was indeed a victim of sexual harassment . The applicant alleged that she had fallen ill because of the tension she was experiencing at work .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was on sick leave from DATE to DATE . On DATE she went to work but was not authorised to enter the embassy building . On DATE the applicant was again refused entry when she arrived for work . The same thing occurred again on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote a letter to the ambassador , informing her about the incidents . On DATE the applicant was notified that she had been dismissed on the ground of her failure to come to work from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought a civil claim , requesting compensation for unlawful dismissal . She did not claim reinstatement . The NORP Minister for ORG issued a note verbale claiming immunity from the jurisdiction of the NORP courts . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings for lack of jurisdiction . On DATE ORG upheld the decision . The final decision was taken by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG established , inter alia , that the DATE agreement on legal assistance between GPE and GPE had not resolved the question of ORG immunity , that GPE had no laws on the question , and that the domestic case - law in this area was only just being developed . ORG therefore considered it appropriate to decide the case in the light of the general principles of international law , in particular the DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that LAW , as then in force , established the principle of absolute State immunity , but that that provision had become inapplicable in practice . It noted that the prevailing international practice was to adopt a restrictive interpretation of ORG immunity , granting such immunity only for acts of sovereign authority ( acta jure imperii ) , as opposed to acts of a commercial or private - law nature ( acta jure gestionis ) . ORG further held , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c ... in ORG view , it is possible to apply the principle of restrictive immunity to GPE . Having regard to the fact that GPE recognises that foreign nationals may bring actions in respect of private - law disputes , it must be accepted that , in order to defend their rights , individuals or entities from GPE are entitled to take proceedings against foreign GPE .", "It is thus necessary to establish in the present case whether the relationship between the claimant and GPE was CARDINAL of a public - law nature ( acta jure imperii ) or a private - law nature ( acta jure gestionis ) . Besides that , other criteria are applicable and should allow [ the court ] to determine whether the ORG concerned enjoys immunity ... in employment disputes . These criteria include , in particular , the nature of the workplace , the status of the employee , the territorial connection between the country of employment and the country of the court , and the nature of the claim .", "Regard being had to the plea of immunity by ORG GPE ... it is possible to conclude that there was a public - service relationship governed by public law ( acta jure imperii ) between the claimant and the embassy of GPE , and that GPE may lay claim to immunity from the jurisdiction of foreign courts . This conclusion is supported by other criteria . With regard to the nature of the workplace , it should be noted that the main function of the embassy ... is directly related to the exercise of sovereignty of GPE . With respect to the status of [ the ] employee ... while the parties had entered into a contract of employment , the very fact that the employee was a switchboard operator implies that the parties developed a relationship akin to that which characterises a public - service function ... The court was unable to obtain any information allowing it to establish the scope of the claimant \u2019s actual duties . Thus , merely from the title of her position , it can be concluded that the duties entrusted to her facilitated , to a certain degree , the exercise by GPE of its sovereign functions . ... It must also be established whether the country of employment is the country of the court , since a court in the country of employment is best placed to resolve a dispute that has arisen in that country . In this respect , it is to be recognised that the exercise of the sovereign powers of the forum ORG is severely restricted with regard to an embassy , even though it is not a foreign territory as such ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) . As to the nature of the claim ... it should be noted that a claim for recognition of unlawful dismissal and for compensation can not be regarded as violating the sovereignty of [ another ] ORG , since such a claim pertains solely to the economic aspect of the impugned legal relationship [ ; ] there is no claim for reinstatement ... However , by reason of this criterion alone , it can not be unconditionally asserted that GPE can not invoke ORG immunity in this case . ... [ The claimant ] has submitted no [ other ] evidence to confirm the inability for GPE to enjoy ORG immunity ( Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) .", "Against the background of the above criteria , [ in view of ] the aspiration of GPE and GPE to maintain good bilateral relations ... and respect the principle of sovereign equality between GPE ... , the chamber concludes that the courts [ below ] properly decided that they had no jurisdiction to entertain this case .", "...", "ORG notes that both ORG of GPE and ORG based the decision to apply jurisdictional immunity to GPE merely on the fact that the latter had refused to appear in the proceedings . Those courts did not examine the question of the application of restrictive jurisdictional immunity in the light of the criteria developed by ORG . However , this breach of procedural rules does not constitute , in ORG view , a ground for quashing the decisions of the courts below . ...", "The application of jurisdictional immunity by the courts of GPE does not prevent the claimant from taking proceedings before the NORP courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . There is no special legislation governing the issue of ORG immunity in GPE . The question is usually resolved by the courts on a case - by - case basis , with reference to the provisions of various bilateral and multilateral treaties .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( applicable at the material time and in force until DATE ) established the rule of absolute State immunity :", "\u201c Adjudication of actions against foreign GPE , and adoption of measures of constraint and execution against the property of a foreign ORG , shall be allowed only with the consent of the competent institutions of the foreign ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision in the case of PERSON v. GPE embassy , regarding an action for unlawful dismissal against GPE embassy in GPE . LAW was considered by the court to be inappropriate in the light of the changing reality of international relations and public international law . ORG noted the trend in international legal opinion to restrict the categories of cases in which a foreign ORG could invoke immunity from the jurisdiction of forum courts . It held that NORP legal practice should follow the doctrine of restrictive ORG immunity . It found , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c State immunity does not mean immunity from institution of civil proceedings , but immunity from jurisdiction of courts . The LAW establishes the right to apply to a court ( LAW ... However , the ability of a court to defend the rights of a claimant , where the defendant is a foreign ORG , will depend on whether that foreign ORG requests the application of the ORG immunity doctrine ... In order to determine whether or not the dispute should give rise to immunity ... it is necessary to determine the nature of the legal relations between the parties ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the plenary of ORG adopted a decision regarding \u201c Judicial Practice in GPE in Applying Rules of Private International Law \u201d ( PERSON , no . CARDINAL ) . It stated that while LAW established a norm whereby \u201c foreign GPE [ and ] diplomatic and consular representatives and diplomats of foreign NORP ] immunity from the jurisdiction of NORP courts \u201d , that rule guaranteed ORG immunity only for \u201c legal relations governed by public law \u201d . ORG pointed out that when deciding whether or not a case containing an international element fell within the jurisdiction of NORP courts , the court in question had to consider whether its judgment would be recognised and enforced in the foreign ORG concerned or whether it would refuse to do so . If the case also fell within the jurisdiction of a foreign court , the forum court would be entitled to relinquish jurisdiction and instruct the claimant to take proceedings in the court of the foreign ORG where the judgment should be enforced .", "This interpretation by ORG had to be followed by the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment in a case that was very similar to that of the applicant , namely ORG v. the embassy of GPE . It found that \u201c despite the fact that GPE had not enacted any legislation on ORG immunity , it could nevertheless be seen from the case - law of the domestic courts that GPE recognised the doctrine of restrictive State immunity \u201d . In that case it was considered that the provisions of LAW and their Property , adopted on DATE , could be taken into account , even though they were not binding , since they reflected a certain trend in international law in matters of ORG immunity . ORG further observed that the case - law of the courts of both States \u2013 GPE and GPE \u2013 being based on common practice in international relations , confirmed that they had been adhering to a restrictive approach to ORG immunity , whereby a ORG could not claim immunity from jurisdiction if the dispute was of a private - law nature . In such cases GPE could not therefore object to the case being heard by the NORP courts . However , ORG held that the dispute between the parties had arisen from a public - law relationship and was not an employment relationship under private law .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that there was no uniform international practice of GPE whereby the members of staff of foreign States\u2019 diplomatic missions who participated in the exercise of the public authority of the GPE they represented could be distinguished from other members of staff . As there were no legally binding international rules , it was for each ORG to take its own decisions in such matters .", "CARDINAL .
