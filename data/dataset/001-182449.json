POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect);Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Krzysztof Wojtyczek", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had a motorcycle accident in which he broke his right arm and right thigh . CARDINAL the applicant underwent an arthroscopy on his right knee . CARDINAL DATE the applicant underwent rehabilitation treatment in ORG and during this stay no dysfunction was diagnosed in his right foot .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , DATE and DATE , he was detained in FAC . While in prison , he was examined CARDINAL times ( on CARDINAL and DATE and on CARDINAL DATE ) by an orthopaedist , who observed that the applicant required physical therapy in the light of a limitation of his knee - joint movement , the atrophy of a thigh muscle , and an injury to a peroneal nerve . On DATE the applicant was examined by a neurologist who likewise found atrophy of the thigh muscle and impaired bending of the right foot , which he attributed to an injury to the peroneal nerve . The applicant never received any physical therapy during his imprisonment , instead being offered only nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory medicines .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , but not DATE , the applicant brought a civil action against ORG for infringement of his personal rights , claiming that the prison healthcare system had failed to provide him with appropriate medical care during his detention and , moreover , that the cells had not met the minimum spatial requirement of QUANTITY per person and had been mouldy and infested with insects . He requested MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation , the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) exempted the applicant from the court fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) and dismissed the remainder of his action . The court held , particularly on the basis of the medical expert opinion , that the applicant had had a motorcycle accident and had required physical therapy as recommended by the prison orthopaedist . However , he had not been given any , either in prison or outside , which had resulted in a deterioration of his health . The court established that , due to the lack of physical therapy , the applicant had suffered atrophy of the thigh muscle and foot drop affecting his right foot . The court compared this finding with the fact that upon his arrival the applicant had not been suffering from foot drop , the pain in his knee had not been severe , and his right leg muscles had been working more effectively . The court emphasised that the applicant had not been offered proper treatment despite a worsening of his symptoms . These changes in his physical condition would not have been irreversible , but the break in the therapy had entailed a prolonged rehabilitation process . The court stated that the rehabilitation process for the applicant would be long and arduous , a situation which could have been avoided had the defendant acted appropriately . The court held that the applicant had suffered physical pain of significant seriousness , which , in turn , had had negative psychological consequences . The court therefore found the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation for lack of adequate medical care partly justified . The claim concerning the alleged overcrowding and inadequate sanitary conditions was dismissed in full . The court also ordered the applicant to reimburse ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) for the costs of the defendant \u2019s legal representation and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) in court fees ( in total : ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not lodge an appeal against the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . Following the defendant \u2019s appeal against the judgment , on CARDINAL DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) amended the judgment , reduced the compensation granted to the applicant to PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , and upheld the first - instance court \u2019s findings of fact and law . The applicant was not ordered to pay the court fees for the proceedings before that court . This court pointed out that in the experts\u2019 opinions it was not specified , even approximately , what the effects of the negligence might be , how much longer the rehabilitation process would take , or how much stronger the pain had become in comparison to pain experienced previously by the applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
