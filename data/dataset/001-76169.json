At the same time , another administrative procedure , which comes fully under the responsibility of the prison administration , is totally lacking in transparency and calls for rapid action on the part of the legislature . This is the procedure for placing prisoners in solitary confinement .", "CARDINAL . When CARDINAL visits prisons , and more specifically the disciplinary blocks , one can usually see the solitary confinement blocks close by . Every prison has them . Under the law , any prisoner may be placed in solitary confinement either at his / her own request or as a precautionary or security measure . In some cases , this regime is used to remove prisoners who are troublesome , under suspicion or ringleaders from the other inmates without their having committed a disciplinary offence .", "CARDINAL . According to the legislation currently in force , solitary confinement is not a disciplinary measure . Prisoners in solitary confinement must be subject to the ordinary prison regime . However , they must not have contact with other prisoners , except by express decision of the prison director , to take part in CARDINAL - off activities with other solitary confinement prisoners . The movements of solitary confinement prisoners within the prison are organised in such a way that they do not meet anyone on their way . In a few establishments , solitary confinement prisoners may engage in a gainful occupation by doing work in their cells . Usually , however , they do not have access to any gainful activity and are entirely dependent on any funds which may be sent to them from outside . All solitary confinement prisoners may , however , receive visits and exchange correspondence in the normal way .", "CARDINAL . There is also a stricter solitary confinement regime for prisoners regarded as particularly dangerous \u2018 because of [ their ] involvement in organised crime or in a terrorist movement or [ their ] legal and criminal background\u2019 . It is for the prison director to determine which solitary confinement prisoners fall within this category . They are subject to particular security measures . Some are regularly transferred from CARDINAL prison to another , DATE . They remain constantly in solitary confinement and never mix with other prisoners .", "CARDINAL . Solitary confinement is usually ordered by the prison director . It may also be ordered by an investigating judge in the course of an investigation . Here I should like to dwell on the administrative procedure for which the prison director is responsible , because I feel that it raises a number of issues likely to undermine respect for the fundamental rights of persons placed in solitary confinement .", "CARDINAL . It emerged from most of my discussions with prisoners , lawyers , representatives of the prison administration and voluntary organisations that the procedure for placing prisoners in solitary confinement depends entirely on an administrative decision by the prison director . There are no legislative provisions or regulations governing this procedure which guarantee the rights of those subject to it , particularly by ensuring that they are given a hearing and the assistance of a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . In principle , there is general legislation which should govern this situation . This is LAW on the rights of citizens in their dealings with the public administration . Under this provision , representatives of government bodies who intend to take an administrative decision against an individual citizen must in principle notify the person concerned in writing with sufficient advance notice , specifying the reasons for the procedure . The person in question must have the opportunity to submit written observations or , if he / she so wishes , oral observations and has the right to be assisted by a lawyer or a representative ( approved or not ) . He / she may also have access to his / her file .", "CARDINAL . Clearly , the decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement would normally be covered by this . However , we were told that this legislation has remained inoperative where solitary confinement is concerned . At present , therefore , the prison director retains sole discretion where solitary confinement is concerned .", "CARDINAL . According to what we heard in the course of our discussions , at present the prisoners concerned are usually informed immediately before the hearing of the intention to place them in solitary confinement . They usually only have TIME in which to prepare their observations before being given a hearing , without any legal assistance , by the prison director . I believe that , as things stand , this procedure must be described as being contrary to the recommendations of ORG ( ORG ) . Furthermore , the purely administrative and non - adversarial nature of this procedure greatly increase the risk of abuses of ORG rights . I therefore feel that there is currently a real need to introduce legislation or regulations bringing this procedure into line with NORP standards .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , it is particularly disturbing to see that solitary confinement may be ordered for an indefinite period , despite its frequently harmful effects on the mental state of the persons subjected to it . The initial period of solitary confinement ordered by the prison director may not exceed DATE . It may be extended beyond that period only after a report to ORG and following a decision by the regional director of prisons . In exceptional cases , solitary confinement may be extended beyond DATE following an initial decision by the Minister for ORG . In such cases , the prison director compiles a file including , among other things , the opinion of the prison doctor and of ORG . The minister is responsible for subsequent extensions , for DATE at a time , in accordance with the same procedure .", "CARDINAL . As may be seen , this procedure is entirely administrative . At present , there is no judicial involvement whatsoever . Yet it is a particularly serious measure , because , although it is not recognised as punishment , the solitary confinement regime imposes significant material restrictions on prisoners\u2019 rights , not to mention its psychological impact . During the visit , I had the opportunity to talk with persons placed in solitary confinement . Some complained about the harshness of their living conditions . According to them , being unable to communicate with anyone for long periods , sometimes well in excess of DATE , is hard to bear . Prisoners placed in solitary confinement have no effective administrative remedy at their disposal , and most of those I spoke to regard solitary confinement as a disguised disciplinary punishment . In the course of the visit I met people who had been in total solitary confinement for DATE .", "CARDINAL . It is difficult not to agree with them when you see some of the restrictions placed on solitary confinement prisoners . In view of the fact that CARDINAL of the requirements of the solitary confinement regime is that the prisoners concerned should have no contact with other prisoners , it is very difficult to allow them to exercise the rights vested in all prisoners not subject to a disciplinary punishment , which should clearly be the case for those in solitary confinement . For example , to allow them to use the library or a sports hall , care must be taken to ensure that no one else enters these LOC at the same time . As we know , owing to prison overcrowding , it is already quite difficult to ensure access for ordinary prisoners to these services . Most of those I spoke to therefore complained that it was impossible for them to exercise the rights to which they should normally be entitled . The same applies to the possibility of engaging in a gainful occupation . In theory , prisoners in solitary confinement are entitled to that , but in practice they may only do so inside their own cell , which is highly problematical in view of the scarcity of work opportunities in general .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the exercise areas available to this category of prisoners are usually the same as those used by the prisoners in the disciplinary block . We visited CARDINAL such area at ORG short - stay prison . It is located on the roof of CARDINAL of the prison buildings , closed in by concrete walls on all sides and covered by wire netting . It is so small that it is more a room in the open air than anything else .", "CARDINAL . I should like to stress that we are talking here about people who are not subject to a disciplinary measure . Furthermore , the fact that a person is left deprived of the rights secured to every prisoner is purely the result of an administrative decision against which it is difficult to appeal . I therefore call on the NORP authorities to take rapid action to bring solitary confinement into line with NORP standards , in particular those upheld by the ORG . I think there is a need for legislative provisions or regulations to govern the solitary - confinement procedure . The adversarial system already introduced for disciplinary punishments should apply to the solitary - confinement procedure . Lastly , I think it would be in keeping with the spirit of the principle of legal certainty if a judicial body were henceforth able to participate in the procedure , for example the judge responsible for sentence enforcement .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , without waiting for legislative reform , the authorities should act to ensure that prisoners in solitary confinement are able to participate in organised activities , particularly as regards work , culture and sports . Their walks and outdoor sports activities should be organised as soon as possible in appropriate places intended for the prison population as a whole , and not for prisoners being held in disciplinary cells . Excluding prisoners from these activities amounts to a disguised punishment . Such changes are bound to lighten the already quite heavy atmosphere which I found in the places of detention visited .", "... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
