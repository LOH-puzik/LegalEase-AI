The Alba - Iulia District Court ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) allowed the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s application DATE . The reasons adduced by the court to justify the first applicant \u2019s detention were the strong suspicion that the offences had been committed , as well as the repeated nature and the gravity of the offences .", "CARDINAL . In assessing the impact on the public the first applicant \u2019s release from detention would have , the court stressed that the acts had allegedly been committed by a significant number of perpetrators over DATE of time .

The first applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was regularly extended by interlocutory judgments of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The reasons adduced by the court were that , although he was a minor , there was a reasonable suspicion that he was guilty of the thefts and would pose a danger to public order , given that he had developed a habit of stealing . His age was not considered to be an argument in favour of his release pending trial . Furthermore , in CARDINAL of the interlocutory judgments it was mentioned that he did not have an occupation or place of work and thus would be unable to support himself by honest means \u2013 there was therefore a risk that he would continue to commit theft .", "CARDINAL .

He also stated that , under national law and the ORG \u2019s case - law , detention of a minor should be a preventive measure of last resort .", "CARDINAL .

The second applicant and the first applicant \u2019s uncle made written statements promising to take responsibility for supervising him if released , and presented to the court a job offer that he could take up if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s request . It had regard to the gravity of the offences allegedly committed by him , the severity of the sentence that could be applied to him and the risk of him reoffending . The judgment was upheld by GPE , which dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law for the same reasons .", "CARDINAL .
