She was represented before the Court by Mrs S. \u010cankovi\u0107 , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s husband was awarded a specially protected tenancy ( stanarsko pravo ) of a flat in GPE . Pursuant to the relevant legislation , the applicant as his wife automatically became a co - holder of the specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue .", "In DATE their daughter , who was at the time spending her DATE with her grandparents in GPE , fell ill . On DATE she was admitted to a hospital in GPE and on DATE underwent eye surgery . The applicant and her husband went to GPE to be with their daughter . She was released from the hospital on DATE . The applicant and her husband then returned to ORG , but on DATE left again for GPE as they were concerned about their daughter \u2019s post - operative recovery .", "On DATE the town of ORG was attacked . On DATE GPE declared its independence .", "In these circumstances the applicant and her husband decided to stay in GPE . She submitted that with the outbreak of war in the region , they could not have crossed the borders and that they also did not have NORP citizenship at that time . The applicant also claimed that her husband had informed ORG , as the owner and the provider of the flat , of their inability to return , and that on CARDINAL DATE their flat had been broken into .", "On DATE ORG issued a decision authorising a certain L.j . DATE an internally displaced person \u2013 to use the applicant \u2019s flat temporarily .", "On DATE ORG brought a civil action against the applicant and her husband in ORG ( PERSON ) , seeking termination of their specially protected tenancy . The plaintiff based its action on section CARDINAL of LAW , arguing that the applicants had been absent from the flat for DATE without justified reason . As the respondents\u2019 residence was unknown , the competent authority appointed a guardian ad litem ( skrbnik za poseban slu\u010daj ) in the case .", "On DATE ORG terminated the respondents\u2019 tenancy . On appeal , ORG ( ORG ) upheld the first - instance judgment .", "Following the guardian \u2019s appeal on points of law ( revizija ) , on DATE ORG ( PERSON ) quashed the lower instances\u2019 judgments and remitted the case , finding that the applicant had not been properly represented in the proceedings since the guardian ad litem had been appointed only to her husband .", "After the applicant returned to ORG in DATE and found out that the action for termination of the tenancy had been brought against her and her husband , she joined , and from then on actively participated in , the proceedings . On DATE she informed the court that her husband had died .", "In the resumed proceedings , on DATE ORG terminated the applicant \u2019s specially protected tenancy , finding that she had been absent from the flat for DATE without justified reason . As to the applicant \u2019s assertion that her daughter \u2019s surgery and the subsequent escalation of the war had justified her absence , the court held that :", "\u201c Having due regard to the concern of the parents regarding the medical treatment of their daughter , the court can not accept [ that the absence was justified ] , because , judging by the medical documents dating from DATE or even later , the patient \u2019s condition had not been so critical as to prevent her from returning to ORG and continuing her treatment in GPE . The arguments of the respondents that they could not return to GPE due to the escalation of war , because they had no documents , can not be accepted either , since it is common knowledge that at the beginning of the war there was chaos and that one could enter the country in various places , not only at border crossings , and , it is very hard to believe that the respondents had not taken appropriate documents with them on such a long journey . \u201d", "On appeal , on DATE ORG ( PERSON ORG ) upheld the first - instance judgment , reasoning as follows :", "\u201c The fact that the respondent \u2019s daughter had actually undergone surgery and was hospitalised for a short period of time during DATE in GPE does not mean ( ... ) , that the conditions from section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW were met ... Notwithstanding whether the medical intervention had to be performed in a hospital relatively far away from the respondent \u2019s residence at the material time , the fact is that the civil action is directed against ORG , that is to say , not against the person who was medically treated , but against her mother ... In any event , had the post - operative recovery of the respondent \u2019s daughter actually necessitated parental presence or care , such care could have certainly been ensured by CARDINAL parent and not both ... \u201d", "The applicant subsequently lodged a complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) . She complained that her constitutional rights to equality before the law , fair hearing and property had been infringed . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , finding that there had been no violation of any of the constitutional rights relied on .", "LAW ( Zakon o stambenim odnosima , ORG nos . DATE , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , as in force at the material time , provided that a holder of a specially protected tenancy ( \u201c the tenant \u201d ) had a right to permanent use of the flat for living purposes , to sub - let part of it to someone else and to participate in the administration of the building in which the flat was located . LAW also provided that , in agreement with the provider of the flat , the tenant could exchange it for another flat and , exceptionally , use part of it for business purposes .", "Section CARDINAL provided that the members of the tenant \u2019s household could acquire the tenancy after the tenant \u2019s death .", "Section CARDINAL read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A specially protected tenancy may be terminated if the tenant [ ... ] ceases to occupy the flat for an uninterrupted period DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The tenancy was terminated as soon as the court \u2019s judgment , upholding the claim of the provider of the flat , became res judicata .", "In decisions ORG . Rev-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , NORP of DATE and Rev-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , ORG interpreted section CARDINAL ) of LAW as follows :", "\u201c War events per se , without any particular reasons rendering use of the flat impossible , do not constitute a justified reason for not using it . \u201d", "In a series of decisions ( for example , in cases nos . Rev-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , ORG - CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , Rev-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) , starting with decision no . CARDINAL of QUANTITY DATE , ORG interpreted another aspect of section CARDINAL ) of LAW as follows :", "\u201c The fact that a flat that is not being used by its tenant is illegally occupied by a third person does not , per se , make the non - use [ of the flat by the tenant ] justified . In other words , if the tenant fails to take the appropriate steps to regain possession of the flat within the statutory time - limits set forth in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ... , then the [ illegal occupation of the flat by a third person ] is not an obstacle to the termination of the specially protected tenancy . \u201d", "ORG ( Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo , Official Gazette no . CARDINAL ) , which entered into force on DATE , entitled the holder of a specially protected tenancy of a socially - owned flat to purchase it from the provider of the flat under favourable conditions .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provided that a written request for purchase ( the first request ) had to be made within DATE of the date of the Act \u2019s entry into force ( this time - limit was by subsequent amendments to the Act extended until DATE ) , and a further request for the actual conclusion of the purchase contract ( the second request ) within DATE following the first request .", "In its decision no . Rev-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ORG interpreted section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of ORG as follows :", "\u201c Since the plaintiff did not make a request for purchase of the flat to the respondents in a written form until DATE , as provided by law , [ ... ] , the lower - instance courts correctly assessed that the plaintiff had lost his right to request a conclusion of the purchase contract . \u201d", "In its decision no . Rev-CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE ORG provided a more extensive interpretation of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The plaintiff made a request for purchase of the flat to the respondent on DATE , that is , after the expiry of the prescribed time - limit ( DATE ) , so the courts [ ruled ] correctly [ when they ] dismissed her claim . The time - limit in question is preclusive , meaning that after its expiry a holder of a specially protected tenancy loses his or her right to make a request to purchase the flat ...", "The fact that the proceedings for termination of the specially protected tenancy DATE that ended by the first - instance judgment [ ... ] of DATE , which became final on DATE \u2013 were pending between the parties at the time when the time - limit expired ( DATE ) is not relevant . [ ... ] [ Those proceedings ] did not prevent the plaintiff from making a request to purchase the flat . ...", "...
