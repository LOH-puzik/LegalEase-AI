THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national of NORP origin , born in DATE and living in GPE , the GPE . She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant came to the GPE from GPE in DATE . She moved in with her brother , who had just divorced from his wife , and with his CARDINAL minor daughters , who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE , and DATE respectively .", "The applicant took up the mother \u2019s role in the children \u2019s life . Various childcare organisations confirmed on a number of occasions that she had a good influence on the children and that she contributed positively to their development . The applicant \u2019s brother remarried in DATE but his wife was apparently not prepared to take responsibility for the children . After her brother \u2019s marriage , the applicant continued to live in his house in a separate room and continued to take care of his children .", "In DATE ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) appointed the applicant \u2019s brother as guardian of the children , particularly in view of the fact that the applicant was taking care of the children as well . As from DATE the applicant was granted a subsistence allowance in the GPE .", "On DATE the applicant filed a request with the head of police ( korpschef ) of the GPE - Rijnmond region for a residence permit ( vergunning tot verblijf ) for the purpose \u201c to take up activities as an employed person \u201d in the GPE ( as provided for in LAW ) . This request was rejected on DATE by the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) on the ground that the applicant did not qualify for a residence permit under the ORG rules since she was not in fact employed . Insofar as the applicant relied on LAW , the ORG Secretary held that , even assuming that there was family life between the applicant and her brother and his family , the decision not to grant her a residence permit in the GPE did not constitute an interference with this family file in that she was not deprived of any residence title .", "On DATE the applicant filed a request for revision ( herziening ) with the ORG Secretary . As this request did not have any suspensive effect as to her expulsion , the applicant requested the President of ORG to issue an injunction on her expulsion pending the proceedings on her revision request .", "On DATE the President of ORG rejected the request for an injunction . On DATE the applicant was expelled to GPE . She returned shortly after to the GPE . On DATE the applicant was expelled to GPE for a second time .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary rejected the applicant \u2019s revision request . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW , the ORG Secretary held that , insofar as the refusal to grant the applicant a residence permit would interfere with her right to respect for her family life with her brother and his children , this interference was justified under LAW in that the applicant \u2019s interests were outweighed by those of the GPE authorities .", "On DATE the applicant returned to the GPE , this time having found employment with a company in GPE . On that basis she was granted on DATE a residence permit , valid until DATE , pursuant to ORG Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC as implemented in GPE and LAW ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ) .", "In DATE the applicant was dismissed from her job for having failed to report to work after a period of leave , thus obliging her employer to hire a person to replace her . The applicant had taken leave to travel to GPE in order to visit her husband , who is suffering from a serious mental disorder since DATE and who had undergone lengthy treatment in a mental institution . The applicant unsuccessfully sought to justify her extended absence from work by arguing that she was urgently required to attend to her husband .", "After her dismissal , the applicant was granted unemployment benefits with a punitive reduction as she bore a certain responsibility for her dismissal . At about the same time the applicant also started receiving a pension from GPE in an amount of CARDINAL PERSON weekly . The applicant unsuccessfully tried to find employment in the GPE .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary withdrew the applicant \u2019s residence permit . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the ORG Secretary claiming entitlement to continued residency in the GPE under ORG regulations . The applicant further argued , inter alia , that the decision was contrary to LAW in that it deprived her of the enjoyment of her family life with her brother \u2019s family and particularly his children .", "On DATE , the applicant moved out of her brother \u2019s house and took up residence in her own apartment . She remained in close contact with her brother \u2019s children and his oldest daughter , who was CARDINAL at the time , stayed with her .", "On DATE , after the applicant had been heard on DATE before ORG for Aliens\u2019 Affairs ( PERSON voor vreemdelingenzaken ) , the ORG Secretary rejected the applicant \u2019s objection . The ORG Secretary held that , as the applicant had lost her job on the basis of which she had been granted her residence permit , this permit could be withdrawn . Insofar as she relied on LAW in relation to her brother and his family , the ORG Secretary noted that she had moved to own accommodation , whereas , in the absence of any substantiation , it was not established that CARDINAL of the daughters of her brother was in fact living with her . In these circumstances , the ORG Secretary did not find that the decision at issue was contrary to the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG sitting in GPE . On DATE , after a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It agreed with the ORG Secretary \u2019s finding that the applicant could not claim any right to a residence permit under the rules of the ORG . As to the applicant \u2019s arguments under LAW , ORG noted that the applicant was living on her own and that the applicant had failed to substantiate her claim that one of her brother \u2019s children , who had come of age , was living with her . In these circumstances , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s family life concerned family life between adult relatives . Referring to a decision taken by ORG on DATE ( Application no . CARDINAL ) , ORG found that there was no evidence of further elements of dependency involving more than normal emotional ties on the basis of which the applicant could invoke the protection afforded by LAW .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a new request for a residence permit . No further information as to the proceedings on this request has been submitted ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
