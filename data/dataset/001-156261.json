With reference to the fact that PERSON failed to return on DATE ( the date agreed with the applicant ) , the court noted that she had been granted temporary custody over her children for the duration of the divorce proceedings . When the interim order was delivered , that is DATE , the children remained in GPE with their father \u2019s consent . Consequently , GPE could have decided to stay in GPE also after DATE and there had been no wrongful retention in the case .", "The court also considered that the interim custody order was not contrary to LAW , since the applicant \u2019s request for return of his children had been received by ORG only on DATE while the custody order had been delivered on DATE .", "Lastly , the court held that the refusal to grant the request for return was not contrary to LAW , since that provision concerned custody decisions delivered after the removal of a child .", "CARDINAL .
