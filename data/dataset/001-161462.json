By a final interlocutory judgment of DATE the court allowed the applicant \u2019s request for an earlier hearing and set a new date of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court allowed the applicant \u2019s application in part and ordered that she be allowed contact every other weekend , DATE during DATE in DATE or DATE and every second GPE DATE .

On DATE the applicant brought proceedings against ORG , seeking the immediate return of the child to GPE , custody , psychological counselling for her and the child in a specialist ORG - run centre , child allowance , contact rights for ORG and rules for the child travelling abroad accompanied by either parent . She argued , inter alia , that the child \u2019s father was denying her contact with her son , and relied on LAW DATE on ORG ( \u201c LAW ) . In addition , she asked for legal aid on account of her limited financial resources and international judicial cooperation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bistri\u0163a - ORG dismissed the proceedings and decided to examine its competence ratione loci of its own motion . It held that ORG had been granted sole custody of the child by the NORP courts and had moved to GPE , taking his son with him . Under the relevant NORP legislation , a parent entrusted with sole custody of a child had the right to take the child out of the country , even without the other parent \u2019s consent . Consequently , the child \u2019s departure to GPE had been , in principle , lawful . Moreover , after GPE joined ORG , the courts\u2019 jurisdiction in matters of recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility was regulated by LAW . Under LAW , matters of parental responsibility came under the jurisdiction of the courts of the child \u2019s ORG country of habitual residence . Under LAW , the courts of the Member State where the child was habitually resident prior to a wrongful removal retained jurisdiction until the child acquired habitual residence in another Member ORG . From DATE the applicant \u2019s son \u2019s habitual residence was in GPE , therefore , regardless of whether his removal from the country had been lawful or not , competence ratione loci for examining the applicant \u2019s application belonged to the NORP courts . The applicant appealed . She argued , inter alia , that the NORP courts had jurisdiction to examine the merits of her case as the parties to the proceedings were NORP nationals , the child had close connections to GPE , and ORG had implicitly accepted their jurisdiction by taking part in the proceedings and submitting observations .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that ORG had been granted sole custody and had therefore been entitled to lawfully decide on his son \u2019s residence without her consent . In addition , the child \u2019s habitual residence was in GPE , and the NORP courts therefore retained competence in respect of the proceedings . The NORP courts had previously examined the applicant \u2019s application for contact because in DATE ORG and the child had still been living in GPE . The exception provided for by LAW invoked by the applicant required , however , that the proceedings should have been opened before the competent NORP courts and to concern the administration of the child \u2019s property and not the child himself .", "( d ) Criminal proceedings opened by the applicant against ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s legal representative opened criminal proceedings against ORG for obstructing the applicant \u2019s contact with her son and for his unlawful removal within the meaning of LAW on account of him being domiciled in GPE by ORG without the applicant \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office dismissed the criminal complaint . It held that from the moment of her departure , the applicant had contacted her son only by telephone and there was no evidence that ORG had obstructed their conversations . It was noted that ORG and CARDINAL other witnesses on his behalf had been questioned . The applicant had not been questioned because she lived abroad and had informed the authorities that her financial situation prevented her from travelling to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the prosecutor \u2019s office order of CARDINAL DATE to the hierarchically superior prosecutor . She argued , inter alia , that her chosen legal representative had failed to notify her of the order prior to CARDINAL DATE and requested that her appeal be considered as having been lodged in due time and allowed . Also , she argued that the prosecutor \u2019s office had wrongly assessed the evidence and had misinterpreted the applicable law . Moreover , she could have been interviewed by CARDINAL of the NORP police officers working in GPE through international judicial cooperation proceedings , but such proceedings had not been initiated in her case .", "CARDINAL . By a final order of DATE the hierarchically superior prosecutor attached to the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge as time - barred . It held , inter alia , that the relevant rules of criminal procedure did not provide for the possibility of a party \u2019s appeal being reinstated once the time - limit for a challenge against a prosecutor \u2019s order had expired . Moreover , the applicant could lodge a new criminal complaint against the child \u2019s father . It does not appear that the applicant appealed against that order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought criminal proceedings against ORG and other third parties for fraud , obstruction of justice , perjury and destruction of evidence committed during the custody proceedings . She stated that although the child \u2019s father was aware of her whereabouts , he had failed to inform the court of her correspondence address . Moreover , he and other third parties had committed perjury by declaring to the NORP authorities that she had abandoned her son and family home and that the father was the only parent raising and supporting him . Furthermore , she was being prevented by ORG and his new wife from enforcing the judgment recognising her contact rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed by the ORG police as part of the criminal investigation opened following her complaint of DATE . She insisted that the NORP authorities question ORG ; however , her request to have him questioned in GPE was allegedly refused .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed part of the criminal proceedings opened on DATE on the grounds that no unlawful act had been committed . The court referred the remaining complaints to the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office . The proceedings still appear to be pending .", "( e ) Contact with other relevant authorities", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant asked ORG for legal aid in respect of all the proceedings required for the final resolution of her predicament , and informed them that she was unable to enforce her contact rights . Moreover , relying on LAW , she requested ORG to take all the necessary steps to have the NORP authorities acknowledge and enforce the judgment . She also asked the NORP authorities to ensure that her son was returned to GPE urgently and to provide them both with counselling so that they could rebuild their relationship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied to the applicant , informing her that after GPE joined ORG , the courts\u2019 jurisdiction in matters of recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility between Member GPE was regulated by LAW . Under the Regulation , matters of parental responsibility , including contact rights , came under the jurisdiction of the courts of the child \u2019s ORG country of habitual residence . The NORP courts had retained their jurisdiction for changing contact rights from a national to an international level for DATE from the date the applicant \u2019s son had moved to GPE lawfully . After DATE had expired , the courts of the Member State where the child was habitually resident retained jurisdiction for applications concerning cross - border contact . In PERSON \u2019s case , jurisdiction was therefore retained by the NORP courts . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s son had left GPE lawfully , as under the relevant legislation in force at the time , a child accompanied by a parent granted full custody by a final court order could leave the country without the other parent \u2019s consent . In order to change her son \u2019s legal status , the applicant had to therefore lodge an application with the court which retained jurisdiction in order to be able to change her contact rights or to gain custody of the child . ORG was unable to represent the applicant or to intervene in the proceedings on her behalf . It was for the applicant and her potential legal representative to litigate the case . In addition , they stated that the NORP court which retained jurisdiction in the applicant \u2019s case was ORG . Lastly , they informed the applicant that given that she was living in GPE , she could notify ORG in order to organise and secure contact between GPE and GPE under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG for ORG to inform her about the status of an application lodged with ORG attached to ORG on DATE . Also , she asked for free legal assistance and support in order to overcome the challenges she had been facing . Moreover , she requested information on whether her son had been living lawfully in GPE , copies of the relevant documents granting ORG custody and the conclusions of any potential social investigation reports carried out at her son \u2019s home . Lastly , she stated , inter alia , that although she had been granted contact rights by the domestic courts , ORG had refused to allow her access to her son .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant through ORG attached to ORG that , according to an investigation carried out by ORG in GPE and a social investigation carried out by the NORP authorities , her son was residing legally in GPE with his father and his new family . The home they all lived in was large and clean . The child was attending kindergarten . His father \u2019s family was very attached to the child and he was able to develop well . Also , all of that information had been sent to the applicant \u2019s legal representative on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a certificate attesting that the applicant \u2019s son had his main registered domicile in GPE , in the town of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Knittelfeld prefect \u2019s office produced a social investigation report in respect of the child \u2019s living arrangements at his home in GPE . The social workers who produced the report interviewed the child , his father and his stepmother . According to the report , the child arrived in GPE with his father in DATE . In DATE the child \u2019s father married another NORP national living in GPE . They all lived in a large and clean home . The child attended kindergarten and was well looked after by the family . According to ORG \u2019s statements , the child \u2019s mother left them in DATE and they had not had contact with her for DATE , although ORG had tried to find her . He raised the child on his own , and on DATE was granted full custody by the NORP courts . Afterwards , ORG left GPE with his son and settled in GPE . He remarried , and the child \u2019s mother contacted him soon afterwards because she wanted to see the child . She was allowed to see him on his birthday and spent DATE with him , but he no longer recognised her . She then did not contact them for some time , but in DATE she was granted contact twice a month at the child \u2019s home . She never took advantage of that opportunity , instead contacting her son by telephone DATE . She never expressed the desire to take the child to her home . The report concluded that the child was well integrated into his family and was being well looked after . He had the opportunity to develop well . Although his mother could contact him , there was no real bond between them because of their past relationship . As far as the child was concerned , his father was the main caregiver .", "( a ) Proceedings regarding the applicant \u2019s contact rights", "CARDINAL .

Until a stronger motherchild bond was established the mother should not be allowed to take the child away .

On DATE the applicant came to ORG and was heard by judge PERSON The judge informed the applicant that ORG had asked for her to only be allowed to see her son at a child protection centre , in his and an interpretor \u2019s presence . According to the applicant , the judge refused to accept any of the evidence she had had translated into NORP and notarised in respect of the contact rights she had been granted by the NORP courts . During the discussion with judge PERSON the applicant said that she would reach an agreement with ORG and she agreed to contact the child first via ORG . The applicant was asked to turn to the child protection centre for any visiting arrangements and an information brochure was handed out to her .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , she telephoned ORG DATE and was informed that a meeting could be set up between her and her son within DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims that she contacted the ORG again on DATE to enquire about the first meeting with her son . She stated that it was explained to her that she would have to bear the costs of a NORP social worker and that meetings had to be approved by judge PERSON", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , ORG would have been able to organise a NORP - speaking assistant , but the applicant and ORG would have had to bear the costs jointly .", "CARDINAL .

Furthermore , the applicant submitted that PERSON had informed her that she would have to accept ORG \u2019s refusal to allow her contact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant sent a request with a number of documents to the President of the NORP ORG for the enforcement of her contact rights . On DATE the President of that court informed the applicant that as an administrative judicial body , it had no jurisdiction in the matter and had thus forwarded her written request and documents to ORG as the court with jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE the applicant applied to ORG for additional contact . In addition , she asked for counselling sessions for her and her son and cross - border cooperation between GPE and GPE in order to enforce the contact rights granted by the NORP judgments . In addition , she requested legal aid and the presence of a translator in case she had to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court awarded the applicant legal aid in respect of any court fees or translation costs .

On DATE the ORG stayed the appeal proceedings while waiting for a decision on the objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection to Judge PERSON as unfounded . Judge PERSON had stated that she had seen no reason to exclude herself from the proceedings .

She also had no personal relationship with the child \u2019s father . The court found that the applicant had not given any specific reasons for her objection to the judge . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and quashed the decision of DATE .

The proceedings had to be continued at the same level of jurisdiction with a hearing with the applicant to establish whether she was requesting enforcement of the NORP judgments in accordance with LAW or a declaration of enforceability of these judgments in accordance with LAW , or whether she wanted to apply for contact in GPE considering the current circumstances . ORG held that the latter was reasonable as ORG was living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was summoned to ORG . An interpreter was present at this hearing . The applicant informed the court of an address in GPE to which any court documents could be sent . The transcript of the hearing indicates that the applicant stated that she did not want to speak on her contact rights , because she did not recognise the jurisdiction of the NORP courts , and that in her opinion there was nothing to clarify before the NORP courts . She only wanted the court to confirm the enforceability of the NORP documents that conceded her custody of her son and she only wanted the NORP courts to enable her to enjoy her existing rights . According to a file note , in the course of this hearing the applicant explicitly stated that although her last contact with her son had been in DATE she wanted to have the custody of her son , to live in GPE with him and the NORP courts had enabled her to do so . Judge PERSON informed the applicant that this would not be correct because in the present situation international and NORP law was applicable and that ORG had jurisdiction in the case . She informed the applicant several times that as the competent NORP judge she could decide on her contact rights , but only after having requested an expert opinion of a child psychologist . The applicant , after having first been happy about this possibility , then changed her mind and reiterated that she did not recognize the jurisdiction of the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that because the applicant had declared that she did not recognise the jurisdiction of GPE , ORG had interpreted this as a withdrawal of her application for contact and closed the file without any further decision .

It also held that LAW , NORP law applied to the present case , because the child \u2019s habitual permanent residence was in GPE . The applicant appealed on points of law on the grounds that the court had assessed the evidence incorrectly and she had fulfilled her obligations under the ORG judgment of DATE to pay child support , so she could only be ordered to pay child support from the date of the court \u2019s judgment . Moreover , the applicant alleged that the court had failed to consider the best interests of the child , as he did not have contact with her ; the court had also failed to take into account the parties\u2019 nationality when determining the lawful domicile of the child and the timelimit for the appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL .
