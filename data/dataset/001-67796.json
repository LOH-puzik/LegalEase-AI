GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in Plattling . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted by ORG ( ORG ) of an offence under LAW ( Vereinsgesetz ) and sentenced to DATE imprisonment on probation . He was found guilty of having participated in GPE in activities of illegal NORP organisations .", "On DATE ORG at ORG served the applicant with a notice to pay the costs , including costs for the translation of his telephone conversations from NORP and NORP into NORP . These conversations were taped in the course of the criminal investigation .", "The applicant unsuccessfully challenged the inclusion of the translation costs in this assessment of the costs . On DATE his appeal was dismissed by ORG ( ORG ) which held , inter alia , that the accused should bear the costs of such part of the proceedings as concerned the act that gave rise to the conviction . The applicant 's conviction was mainly based on the telephone tapping . LAW ( e ) of the LAW did not prevent translation costs being awarded against a convicted person . This provision had the purpose of ensuring that , irrespective of his financial situation , an accused who could not understand or speak the language used in court had the right to an effective defence and accordingly to a fair trial . The free assistance of an interpreter had therefore to cover all the issues which were relevant for the defence . There would be a breach of the principle of equality of arms between the prosecution and the defence where an accused was deprived of the opportunity to have knowledge of these issues .", "However , the situation found in the present case did not affect the applicant 's rights under LAW ( e ) . The translation of the applicant 's telephone conversations was not necessary for his defence . It was required for the investigations to be carried out in a NORP or NORP speaking environment . These costs were therefore excluded from the scope of LAW ) of the LAW . This provision did not imply that a foreign accused was exempted from the payment of the costs of the investigations in so far as they resulted from the use of his mother tongue .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
