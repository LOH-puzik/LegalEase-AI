The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the GPE District Police of Kharkiv instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant , who was DATE at the material time , on suspicion of theft of a mobile telephone and acting as an accomplice in an unsuccessful attempted robbery of earrings , a watch and a mobile telephone , in company with CARDINAL other minors , in DATE . The robbery attempt was interrupted when CARDINAL witnesses to the incident intervened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bill of indictment was drafted and the investigator ordered the district police to bring the applicant in for questioning . In addition , the investigator imposed an undertaking not to abscond on the applicant as a preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police reported that it was impossible to locate the applicant and placed her on the \u201c wanted list \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE District Police of Kharkiv arrested the applicant at her mother \u2019s home address and drew up an arrest report , the relevant parts of which read as follows :", "\u201c Investigator ... L. , on DATE at TIME in accordance with LAW of GPE detained , on suspicion of the commission of a crime : PERSON ...", "The crime which PERSON was detained on suspicion of having committed falls under LAW paragraph CARDINAL [ and ] LAW paragraph CARDINAL of LAW of GPE .", "Grounds and motives for detention : commission of a grave offence ; may abscond from investigation and court , obstruct establishment of the facts of the case ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG , the applicant \u2019s lawyer , lodged a complaint with ORG ( hereinafter DATE \u201c the ORG \u201d ) alleging , in particular , that the applicant \u2019s arrest and detention were in contravention of LAW , which authorised extra - judicial detention only where it was necessary to prevent or stop a crime . He argued that , since the crimes imputed to the applicant had taken place in DATE , in accordance with LAW ( hereafter \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) the investigating authorities had been under an obligation to seek a judicial order in order to arrest the applicant . In addition , he noted that LAW ORG allowed the detention of minors only in exceptional circumstances , which were absent in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating authorities requested ORG to authorise the applicant \u2019s remand in custody . Having held a hearing in the presence of the applicant and her advocate , the court authorised the measure requested . In its reasoning the court noted that the applicant had been charged with serious offences and had absconded from the investigating authorities , and that this justified her placement on the wanted list . Furthermore , her mother , who had been deprived of her parental rights , was unlikely to be able to ensure that the applicant would appear before the investigating authorities , as she herself had a criminal record and suffered from alcoholism . In addition , the court referred to a report from the staff responsible for the applicant \u2019s welfare at the boarding school where she was officially residing , which stated that the applicant had behavioural problems , including a proneness to run away from the school . In the light of these findings the court concluded that if not detained the applicant might commit another crime or obstruct the investigation . The court \u2019s decision bore no reference to the applicant \u2019s advocate \u2019s complaint about the unlawfulness of her arrest and detention DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG appealed against the court decision of DATE . He alleged , in particular , that ORG had failed to analyse the applicant \u2019s situation from the angle of LAW , which allowed for the placement of a minor in detention pending trial only on condition that there existed \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d . He submitted that in the circumstances of the present case the detention was unwarranted . In particular , the crimes with which the applicant had been charged were not exceptionally serious and the findings that she might abscond , obstruct the investigation or commit another offence were speculative . In particular , no evidence had been presented that during DATE which had passed since the applicant \u2019s alleged offences she had attempted to commit another crime or obstruct the investigation . Moreover , by DATE the evidence had been largely collected , which made it improbable that the applicant would obstruct the investigation . As regards the allegation that the applicant had already absconded , which justified her placement on the wanted list , the authorities had presented no evidence that the applicant had ever been subpoenaed to appear for questioning either at her school or at her mother \u2019s address . She had been placed on the wanted list on DATE the order to bring her in for questioning had been issued . Eventually she had been arrested at her mother \u2019s address , which was her permanent address and whose location was well known to the police . In the meantime , the applicant \u2019s health and well - being was likely to be seriously endangered by detention in an ordinary pre - trial detention facility , as she was suffering from tuberculosis and had a history of in - patient treatment for psychiatric disturbances . Mr ORG also noted that he had not been given a copy of the decision of DATE and requested that the applicant be invited to participate in the appeal hearing in person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator in the applicant \u2019s case informed Mr ORG in a letter that he could access the decision of DATE at the investigator \u2019s office at \u2018 any convenient time\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG amended his initial appeal against the decision of DATE . In particular , he noted that his complaint that the applicant \u2019s arrest and detention DATE had been unlawful had not been considered . The applicant submitted to the ORG a copy of this amended appeal bearing Mr ORG \u2019s original signature . There is no receipt slip or any other evidence that the document was ever submitted for judicial consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) dismissed Mr ORG \u2019s appeal following a hearing at which the prosecutor and PERSON , but not the applicant herself , were present . In its decision ORG referred to the same arguments as the first - instance court and additionally mentioned that the applicant \u2019s state of health was irrelevant to the finding that she might abscond , obstruct the investigation or commit another crime .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the GPE District Police suspended the criminal proceedings against the applicant on account of her state of health , stating in its decision that all investigative actions necessary at the material time had been completed . Subsequently the investigation was resumed and suspended on several occasions on account of the applicant \u2019s state of health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Tokarev inquired of ORG in a letter as to the state of consideration of his complaint about the unlawfulness of the applicant \u2019s arrest and detention DATE and allegedly received no answer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided , without a hearing but in presence of the prosecutor , to commit the applicant for an in - patient psychiatric assessment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Dzerzhinsky District Prosecutor allowed the applicant \u2019s premature release from detention under an obligation not to abscond , referring to her tuberculosis , which required in - patient treatment . On an unspecified date the applicant was committed for in - patient psychiatric assessment .", "CARDINAL .
