GEORGIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3;Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Nona Tsotsoria;Vladimiro Zagrebelsky", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was CARDINAL of the CARDINAL founding partners and a holder of PERCENT of the shares of a limited liability company ( \u201c the company \u201d ) set up on DATE to run a retail shop . The shop , privatised by those partners in DATE and valued at CARDINAL NORP laris ( GEL ) ( QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) , was designated as the company \u2019s founding capital .", "In DATE , a certain PERSON brought a court action contesting the lawfulness of the privatisation of the shop and , in a decision of DATE , ORG in GPE declared the privatisation agreement null and void .", "After the decision of DATE became binding , the applicant and another founding partner of the company , Mr N. , entered into friendly settlement negotiations with PERSON On DATE they reached an agreement , according to the written terms of which the applicant and Mr N. were \u201c to cede \u201d to Mrs. PERSON , respectively , PERCENT and PERCENT of their company shares . The agreement did not specify PERSON counter - obligations , if any .", "On DATE the ORG of ORG , on the basis of both GPE request , quashed in a supervisory review the decision of DATE and ordered the parties to abide by the conditions of their friendly settlement of CARDINAL DATE ; the company was ordered to amend its registration records in ORG accordingly .", "As disclosed by TIME of the company ORG general meeting on DATE , the applicant considered that PERSON should pay compensation for the agreed cession of the shares , as this had been her pledge during the friendly settlement negotiations . However , since PERSON now insisted on obtaining those shares free of charge , the applicant stated that she would not cede her part . The applicant \u2019s position was maintained by Mr N. and other partners , and the unanimous decision was not to admit Mrs. PERSON as a new partner .", "On DATE ORG , pursuant to PERSON request , issued a resolution on the redistribution of the company shares in accordance with the decision of CARDINAL DATE and entered the consequent amendments into ORG . Thus , PERSON was designated as a new partner with PERCENT of the company shares , PERCENT of which was transferred from the applicant \u2019s possession .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action before ORG , requesting that the resolution of CARDINAL DATE be declared null and void , and that the disputed PERCENT of the company shares be returned to her . The applicant , relying on the relevant provisions of LAW of DATE on Entrepreneurship ( \u201c the Act on Entrepreneurship \u201d ) , claimed that PERSON lacked the standing to request amendment of the company \u2019s registration records , and that consequently the resolution of DATE had been unlawful .", "On DATE the Krtsanisi - Mtatsminda District Court , finding the applicant \u2019s reading of the Act on Entrepreneurship to be erroneous , dismissed her action . That decision , however , was overturned by ORG on DATE in the applicant \u2019s favour . The appeal court reasoned that the decision of CARDINAL DATE had not rendered PERSON a partner nor transferred any shares to her , but had simply ordered the company to enforce the friendly settlement of DATE . Since the company \u2019s decision - making body \u2013 the ORG general meeting DATE had refused , on DATE , to accept her as a new partner , PERSON should have challenged that decision in adversarial proceedings . The appellate court further reasoned that , by virtue of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , consent to a partial cession of the company \u2019s shares had to be recorded in writing at a general meeting of the partners .", "On DATE ORG , at a hearing attended by the applicant and her advocate , overturned the appellate judgement of DATE and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . Acting as the court of cassation it pronounced the operative part of its decision orally that day . A complete , reasoned copy of the judgment of DATE was served on the applicant \u2019s advocate on CARDINAL DATE .", "ORG stated that since the company had refused to abide by the binding court decision of DATE of its own accord , the resolution of CARDINAL DATE had simply enforced that decision . In any event PERSON could have applied to a bailiff , and the resultant enforcement proceedings would have led to the same result . The court of cassation acknowledged that , as a rule , written approval of the conclusions of the ORG general meeting was required for a partial cession of company shares . However , in the case at hand , the friendly settlement agreement of CARDINAL DATE had implicitly amounted to such an approval , since all the partners of the company had had a genuine interest in the maintenance of the privatised shop . As to the price of the disputed shares , ORG concluded that the company had agreed to cede them not in exchange for monetary compensation , but rather as a quid pro quo for PERSON commitment to abandon her claim for the annulment of the privatisation .", "\u201c CARDINAL .
