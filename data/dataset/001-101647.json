The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC .", "CARDINAL . It appears that from DATE the volume of cross - town traffic in LOC increased , since a toll had been introduced on the neighbouring , privately owned motorway MCARDINAL . In order to avoid the rather high toll charge , many trucks chose alternative routes including the street ( a section of national road no . CARDINAL ) in which the applicant 's house is situated .", "CARDINAL . To counter this situation , from DATE onwards three bypass roads were built ; and several measures , including QUANTITY , were implemented in order to discourage traffic in the neighbourhood . CARDINAL nearby intersections were provided with traffic lights . In DATE road signs prohibiting the access of vehicles of QUANTITY and re - orientating traffic were put up along an LOC thoroughfare , an arrangement which also affected the applicant 's street . The Government submitted that compliance with these measures had been enforced by the increased presence of the police in general in LOC and in particular in the applicant 's street ; in the applicant 's view , however , no effective enforcement was in place .", "CARDINAL . NORP In or about CARDINAL the applicant observed damage to the walls of his house . He obtained the opinion of a private expert , who stated that the damage was due to vibrations caused by the heavy traffic . The applicant also alleges that , because of the increased noise and pollution due to exhaust fumes , his home has become almost uninhabitable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action in compensation against ORG before ORG . He claimed that , due to increased freight traffic in his street , the walls of his house had cracked . The case was transmitted to ORG for reasons of competence on DATE . On DATE , DATE and DATE , the court held hearings . On DATE it dismissed the claims .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , ORG , acting as a second - instance court , held a hearing on DATE , quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings , on DATE ORG appointed as expert ORG at ORG . The latter presented an opinion on DATE which was discussed at the hearing of DATE . The expert stated that the level of noise outside the applicant 's house had been measured as CARDINAL dB(A ) on DATE and CARDINAL dB(A ) on DATE , TIME on both occasions , as opposed to the applicable statutory limit of CARDINAL dB(A ) . On DATE the court held another hearing and ordered the supplementation of the opinion , which was done on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's claims . It relied on the opinion of the expert , documentary evidence and the testimony of the parties . It refused the applicant 's motion to obtain the opinion of another expert since it was of the view that the original opinion was thorough and precise .", "CARDINAL . The court noted the expert 's opinion that the vibration , as measured on the scene , was not strong enough to cause damage to the applicant 's house , nor could the traffic noise entail cracks in its walls although it was higher than the statutory level . The court therefore concluded that no causal link could be established between the measures adopted by the respondent authority and the damage to the house . The court observed that the respondent had spent CARDINAL MONEY on developing the road system in the area , constructed CARDINAL roundabouts and put up several road signs and traffic lights in order to divert traffic from LOC . In sum , it had carried out every measure with a view to sparing ORG from heavy traffic and limiting the speed of cross - town traffic that could reasonably be expected in the circumstances to protect the applicant 's interest . The respondent had to balance competing interests , since the barring of heavy vehicles from a public road might have been advantageous to the inhabitants of LOC but could have caused disproportionate prejudice to the other users or providers of public and private transportation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
