{"ITEMID": "001-4564", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GRC", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "TSARKNIAS v. GREECE", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Marc Fischbach", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant considers himself to be part of a NORP ethnic minority in GPE . In DATE he was ordained a priest in ORG . He used to live and work in the northern district of PERSON and during DATE and DATE became increasingly involved in the advocacy of greater cultural rights for NORP . In DATE , he became a monk in the monastery of GPE near GPE . In DATE he was expelled from ORG . He claims that , since DATE , he has been arrested CARDINAL times and prosecuted for a series of offences , in particular that of abusing of his position as a priest .", "In DATE the applicant was involved in an incident in his church in the village of Aghios Athanasios . The bishop of the city of PERSON , who arrived at the church to attend the mass celebrated by the applicant , was confronted with CARDINAL persons shouting insults at him and calling for the ORG to support NORP cultural rights . The applicant was accused of disrupting a religious congregation , abusing his position as a priest and disturbing citizen \u2019s peace .", "On DATE , he was tried in absentia ( because he was unable to attend for health reasons ) by ORG and was sentenced to QUANTITY imprisonment for having disrupted a NORP congregation . ORG had previously rejected a request to adjourn the hearing . After having heard CARDINAL witnesses for the prosecution , it found that on DATE , the applicant incited the congregation to violent disorder by saying to them that if the bishop arrived at the church by saying that \u201c you must make him understand that you do n\u2019t want him to come in and if he does , blood will flow \u201d . It also found that on DATE , while the bishop had managed to enter the church and had started celebrating the mass , the applicant unplugged the church \u2019s microphones .", "The applicant appealed against this judgment to ORG composed of CARDINAL judges , which heard the case on DATE in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer . CARDINAL witnesses were heard , CARDINAL for the prosecution and CARDINAL for the defence . ORG delivered its judgement on DATE . It found the applicant guilty of disturbing the citizen \u2019s peace ( LAW ) , of disrupting a religious congregation ( LAW ) and of abusing his position as a priest ( LAW ) ; it upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction but reduced his prison sentence to DATE and converted it into a pecuniary penalty of MONEY ( GPE ) DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant appealed on points of law . He maintained that although he had invited ORG to hear CARDINAL witnesses on his behalf , the president of the ORG refused to hear CARDINAL of them and that this refusal had not been included in TIME of the hearing although the applicant \u2019s lawyer had invited the ORG to do so . He also alleged that ORG , contravening LAW , had interrupted the taking of evidence and had examined in between some other small cases ; as a result , the applicant had lost the thread of his defence in violation of LAW . He maintained that the judgment of ORG was not reasoned because it had merely reproduced the wording of the indictment and had not specified in what way the accused had actually committed the offences . In addition , he alleged that the members of ORG and ORG lacked impartiality towards him . Finally , he alleged that the fact that ORG refused to call all the witnesses for the defence amounted to a lack of public hearing .", "ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . It noted that the applicant failed to appeal to ORG sitting in full when its president rejected the request to hear CARDINAL witnesses for the defence ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . It also noted that it did not appear from TIME that any interruption of the taking of evidence had ever occurred during the hearing . It considered that ORG had sufficiently motivated its judgement and held that the plea of impartiality of the judges was not , according to NORP law , a ground for quashing the judgment of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
