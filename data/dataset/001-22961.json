GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr F. Wolff , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant had been working as a nursery - school teacher ( ORG ) in GPE , in GPE ( GDR ) , since DATE . After the reunification of GPE , and in accordance with the relevant provisions of LAW of DATE on NORP Unification ( Einigungsvertrag \u2013 Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL taken together with LAW CARDINAL of Annex I , LAW , ORG , LAW \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , the applicant was incorporated into the civil service of ORG in GPE ( FRG ) and continued working there as a nursery - school teacher .", "On DATE the applicant answered in the negative when asked whether she had signed an undertaking to collaborate ( PERSON ) with ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr DATE the GPE secret police ) , and about any contacts she had had with it , and whether she had received any gifts ( Zuwendungen ) for collaborating . After NORP reunification those questions were asked of civil servants from the GPE seeking definitive incorporation into the ORG civil service . The applicant stated that she had replied fully and truthfully to the best of her knowledge and belief ( nach bestem ORG ) and that she was aware of the fact that an untrue answer on her part could result in her dismissal .", "On DATE a report by the federal commissioner responsible for examining data of the ORG security police ( FAC f\u00fcr die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen ORG , also known as ORG ) revealed that , after a contact period ( Kontaktphase ) from CARDINAL June to CARDINAL DATE , the applicant had been registered as a security collaborator ( PERSON f\u00fcr ORG ) of ORG between DATE and DATE , that on DATE she had signed an undertaking to collaborate , that she had participated in CARDINAL spy operations between CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE and that a ministry official had confirmed that she had received gifts of money on CARDINAL occasions .", "On DATE the applicant was questioned about that report .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , after consulting ORG ( Personalrat ) , dismissed the applicant for having collaborated with ORG and having lied about her collaboration with that ministry .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision , submitting that she did not remember having collaborated with ORG and that , in any event , her collaboration , which had been of minor importance given that she had merely accompanied her husband , went back to such a distant period that it could no longer be held against her DATE and could not in any circumstances justify her dismissal .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Arbeitsgericht ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and held that her ordinary dismissal ( with notice ) ( ordentliche PERSON ) was justified under section MONEY ) of LAW ( GPE \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "The court held that the applicant was not fit to be a member of the civil service because she had untruthfully ( wahrheitswidrig ) declared that she had neither signed an undertaking to collaborate nor collaborated with ORG . The authorities had properly questioned her in that connection and the applicant had objectively and subjectively given an answer which had subsequently been proved to be untrue .", "The court concluded that LAW interest in dismissing a person who had previously lied to her employer about her collaboration with ORG , which had been the instrument of repression in that ORG , accordingly took precedence over the applicant \u2019s age and long years of service .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against that judgment .", "ORG ( PERSON ) upheld that judgment on DATE .", "ORG held that the applicant \u2019s activity could be regarded as collaboration with ORG for the purposes of LAW , LAW , ORG , LAW of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . The fact that she had accompanied her husband in order to provide a smokescreen did not alter that finding .", "In ORG view , the applicant could not have forgotten that she had collaborated with the ORG or that she had signed an undertaking . Indeed , she had carried out many spy missions in the company of her husband and , in her undertaking , had expressly declared that she wanted to protect the ORG from enemy attacks . Furthermore , during questioning on CARDINAL DATE the applicant had herself declared that she had not attached any importance to her past collaboration , which showed that she remembered it .", "The applicant had therefore given an untruthful answer and was accordingly unfit to be a member of the FRG civil service .", "ORG then reiterated that a \u201c lack of personal aptitude \u201d within the meaning of LAW , LAW , ORG , LAW of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) could derive from a lack of trust and from reasons connected with the employee \u2019s character .", "ORG added that in the present case the authorities had been entitled to expect the applicant to reply truthfully to the CARDINAL questions that had been put to her . Indeed , the authorities had to be able to check whether the applicant , who had not been chosen by them as an employee , but had been employed in accordance with the provisions of LAW , could continue to be a member of the civil service or whether she should be dismissed for having collaborated with ORG . ORG found that the lack of truthfulness and honesty in her reply had destroyed the confidence which the authorities had to have in the applicant and made her continued employment in the civil service unacceptable .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesarbeitsgericht ) refused to entertain an appeal on points of law by the applicant on the ground that the ordinary courts\u2019 decisions had been consistent with its own case - law and with that of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) .", "On DATE a bench of CARDINAL judges of ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides :", "\u201c A dismissal shall be socially unjustified unless it is based on grounds relating to the employee himself or to his conduct ... \u201d", "\u201c Sozial ungerechtfertigt ist die PERSON , wenn sie nicht durch GPE , die in der Person oder in dem Verhalten des Arbeitnehmers liegen ... bedingt ist . \u201d", "LAW of DATE on NORP ORG provides that the administrative bodies and other institutions of the civil service in the former territory of the GPE come under the authority of the government of the Land in which they are situated .", "LAW provides that persons who were members of the GPE civil service at the time of reunification are subject to the transitional provisions in GPE", "LAW CARDINAL of Annex I to LAW , LAW , ORG , LAW , provides for the incorporation of civil servants from the GPE into the ORG civil service by means of the substitution of the federal authorities and ORG FRG for the GPE authorities in the existing employment relationship .", "As members of the GPE civil service belonged to an institution that did not satisfy the criteria of a ORG based on the rule of law , special provisions on dismissal were included in LAW CARDINAL of Annex I to LAW , LAW , ORG , LAW .", "Thus , LAW I to LAW , LAW , ORG , LAW , provides :", "\u201c Ordinary dismissal [ with notice ] from the civil service is permissible if", "( a ) the employee does not satisfy the requirements on account of lack of professional qualifications or of personal aptitude ... \u201d", "\u201c Die ordentliche ORG in der \u00f6ffentlichen PERSON zul\u00e4ssig , wenn", "PERSON mangelnder fachlicher GPE oder pers\u00f6nlicher GPE den Anforderungen nicht entspricht oder wenn ... \u201d", "LAW of the same section is worded as follows :", "\u201c A substantial ground for an extraordinary dismissal [ without notice ] exists , inter alia , if the employee", "( b ) has collaborated with the former ORG or for ORG [ of the GPE ]", "and his or her continued employment in the civil service therefore appears unacceptable . \u201d", "\u201c Ein wichtiger ORG f\u00fcr eine ausserordentliche PERSON insbesondere dann gegeben , wenn PERSON", "...", "CARDINAL . f\u00fcr das fr\u00fchere ORG f\u00fcr ORG f\u00fcr nationale GPE war", "und deshalb ein Festhalten am NORP unzumutbar erscheint . \u201d", "In a leading case ORG held that LAW I to LAW , Chapter XIX , Subject A , LAW was in conformity with LAW because a person who had collaborated with ORG the GPE did not generally satisfy the requisite conditions for becoming a member of the ORG civil service . In any event , dismissal required an assessment of each individual case during which account had to be taken , inter alia , of the degree of involvement ( GPE der PERSON ) of the person concerned ( see Collection of Judgments and Decisions of ORG , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "According to the established case - law of ORG , a public employer is entitled to ask a civil servant if he or she collaborated with ORG of the former GPE and whether he or she signed an undertaking to collaborate . The interest of the employer in obtaining a truthful answer takes precedence over the civil servant \u2019s right to decide for himself or herself which information he or she is willing to disclose ( informationelle PERSON ) . Questioning the civil servant in this way is designed to \u201c cleanse \u201d the civil service of staff with a reprehensible past ( vorbelastetem Personal ) so that an efficient civil service can be put in place ( GPE einer leistungsf\u00e4higen \u00f6ffentlichen PERSON ) in the general interest . Anyone who lies by declaring that they did not sign an undertaking and did not collaborate with ORG is generally unfit to be a member of the civil service ( see ORG and Decisions of ORG , vol .
