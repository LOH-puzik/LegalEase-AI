Following the introduction of the application , PERSON died and PERSON King ( her daughter ) continued the case on her behalf . ORG has referred below to PERSON as the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s son , PERSON , was born in DATE and he died on DATE . The present application relates to his death .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was diagnosed with schizophrenia in DATE . He was treated by a mental health team which was operated by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and which assigned Mr PERSON as Mr PERSON \u2019s Care Co - ordinator . On DATE Mr PERSON contacted the applicant and Mr PERSON : he was hearing voices ordering him to kill himself . The applicant and Mr PERSON went to Mr PERSON \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON contacted ORG ( \u201c CRHTT \u201d ) informing it that PERSON might need to be hospitalised . The PERSON is a community - based team of mental health professionals operated by ORG from the psychiatric unit of ORG ( \u201c the Hospital \u201d ) . Mr PERSON was told that no beds were available but that PERSON could have a crisis bed at FAC ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . ORG is responsible for the ORG and it is located in a building of which the ORG is the occupier for the purposes of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . It is staffed by social workers experienced in the care of mental health patients and it provides an alternative to in - patient care where the risk assessment renders this appropriate . ORG patients are not subjected to formal monitoring but staff regularly check on them and have custody of their medication . While patients are voluntary , cameras monitor the outside of the building so that ORG is alerted if a patient leaves .", "CARDINAL . On the way to the ISMOS Unit Mr PERSON told Mr PERSON that he found the \u2018 voices\u2019 so distressing that he felt like killing himself . Mr PERSON therefore took PERSON to ORG ( run by ORG ) for a clinical assessment . This was carried out by a psychiatrist of the PERSON assisted by a psychiatric nurse and Mr PERSON . Mr PERSON was assessed to be a low suicide risk . He had once again reduced his medication in order to drink and socialise at DATE . His psychotic symptoms had therefore returned but he had stabilised rapidly as he had already re - taken his medication that morning . The voices had diminished and were not troubling him any more although he was terrified of their returning . During the assessment , he confirmed that he did not want to kill himself . He had no history of self - harm / attempted suicide , he had not acted on his earlier hallucinations and , even when having hallucinations , he had sought help .", "CARDINAL . Since it was agreed that Mr PERSON needed a safe and supported environment , he was admitted to ORG as a voluntary in - patient . He was allocated one of the crisis rooms across from the staff room on the sixth floor . During dinner he seemed withdrawn and unwell . TIME , he was found wandering outside the building but he returned with staff to his room . At CARDINAL there was a change of shift , the new staff were briefed and PERSON appeared more relaxed and spoke with them .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was due his medication at CARDINAL . At around CARDINAL he broke a window in his room and fell from the sixth floor to his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an internal investigation into Mr Reynolds\u2019 death was completed by the ORG . The resulting ORG recommended , inter alia , that the bedroom windows in the crisis rooms at ORG be reinforced . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s daughter wrote a letter of complaint to ORG . On DATE the Trust responded stating that it had reviewed the information available on the relevant date but that there had been no indication that Mr PERSON would harm himself .", "CARDINAL . The applicant could not afford legal representation for the Inquest . She considered applying to ORG for legal aid and , following receipt of the Coroner \u2019s views as regards the CARDINAL criteria applied by the Commission in deciding on a grant of legal aid , the applicant decided not to pursue a claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Inquest was opened and adjourned by the Coroner . It resumed on DATE . The applicant attended with CARDINAL daughters including PERSON . The Coroner sat without a jury . He explained that the Inquest was to find the answers to QUANTITY limited factual questions : who was the deceased and how , where and when did the death come about . \u201c How \u201d was limited to \u201c how the cause of death arose \u201d since an Inquest was not an opportunity to examine the broad circumstances in which the death occurred so that all questions touching thereon would be excluded as would any question of civil or criminal liability .", "CARDINAL . Oral evidence was given by , inter alia , the psychiatrist and the psychiatric nurse who assessed PERSON ; by the relevant CARDINAL members of staff at ORG ; by the eye witness who saw him step through the broken window ; and by the team leader of ORG . The applicant gave evidence : she considered that her son had not attempted to commit suicide but rather had wished to go home and had not realised he was on the sixth floor . The applicant submitted questions to the Coroner prior to the Inquest and she and her daughters put questions to witnesses during the Inquest .", "CARDINAL . The Inquisition Form recorded that Mr PERSON had been placed in the crisis room for DATE for monitoring ; that TIME he broke a window , climbed through it and walked off the window sill ; and that he sustained fatal injuries as a result of the fall and was pronounced dead that day . The Coroner \u2019s conclusion as to death was an \u201c Open verdict \u201d , he explaining that , while those with schizophrenia presented a high incidence of suicide , there was insufficient evidence that Mr PERSON intended to kill himself .", "CARDINAL . Since the Coroner was concerned about a psychiatric facility on a sixth floor , in DATE he reported the incident to ORG under LAW of LAW . By letter of DATE the ORG informed the Coroner that , since an ORG was used when the risk was low , its location on the sixth floor was not unusual . However , the windows had been reinforced and , in the longer term , there were plans to re - locate the ORG to a CARDINAL storey dwelling .", "CARDINAL . The applicant obtained legal aid and issued an action for damages under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( HRA \u201d ) against ORG and the ORG , arguing that they had failed to adequately discharge their duties to PERSON in breach of ORG , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention in that they had failed to ensure his appropriate placement , failed to ensure that ORG was safe and failed adequately to assess the suicide risk or to admit him for in - patient care . An expert report obtained by the applicant from a consultant psychiatrist for the proceedings ( although not served since the action was later struck out , see below ) considered that the care of PERSON fell below the required standard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG decided the case of ORG ( [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The NHS Trust and the ORG served defences in DATE . The ORG accepted that it owed a common law duty to take reasonable steps to try to prevent PERSON from taking his own life . The ORG accepted that it owed a common law duty of care not to expose PERSON to a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury or harm on the LOC as well as a common duty of care under LAW . However , both defendants argued that the applicant had no cause of action and that the case should be struck out since the High Court judgment in the PERSON case had provided that one had to establish gross negligence of a kind sufficient to sustain a charge of manslaughter in order to establish a breach of LAW . The applicant requested that her action be adjourned pending the appeals in the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment striking out the applicant \u2019s case pursuant to LAW holding that there were no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim . ORG noted that ORG in the PERSON case had accepted that , where the allegations were of clinical negligence , the measure of the duty owed to both voluntary and involuntary patients was as outlined in PERSON v. GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALV ) and in R ( Takoushis ) v. PERSON and Another ( [ DATE ] CARDINALWLR CARDINAL ) namely , that there had to be at least gross negligence of a kind sufficient to sustain a charge of manslaughter . The applicant had not made any such allegations :", "\u201c It is thus clear that there is strong authority which would make it highly unlikely that any decision on appeal in the case of Savage would render [ the ORG and the ORG ] liable under the provisions of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In refusing the applicant \u2019s request for an adjournment , ORG did not accept that the law relating to the treatment of voluntary mental health patients was uncertain or in a state of development which was likely to lead to a change in the law which would enable the applicant \u2019s claim to succeed . It was not persuaded that the prospect of the appeal in the case of PERSON raised a sufficient prospect of an outcome favourable to the applicant as to justify refusing the orders sought by the defendants .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL barristers , experienced in clinical negligence , human rights cases and Inquest law , advised the applicant that an appeal had no realistic prospect of success . CARDINAL of these opinions was submitted to ORG which withdrew legal aid in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the ORG makes it unlawful for a public authority to act incompatibly with Convention rights , unless it is not possible to act differently by virtue of primary legislation . A successful claim under LAW renders the relevant public authority liable under LAW ORG and a judge has the power to award damages under section CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW to hold an Inquest in circumstances where there are grounds to suspect that the person ( a ) has died a violent or an unnatural death or ( b ) has died a sudden death of which the cause is unknown .", "CARDINAL . As to the scope of an Inquest ( including a resumed CARDINAL ) , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the DATE Act outlines the content of the Inquisition Form ( a document completed by ORG jury at the end of the evidence ) . It must set out , so far as such particulars have been proved ( i ) who the deceased was ; and ( ii ) how , when and where the deceased came by his death . Rule CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the DATE Rules \u201d ) requires that proceedings be directed solely to ascertaining : ( a ) who the deceased was ; ( b ) how when and where he came by his death ; and ( c ) the particulars required by LAW to be registered concerning the death . Rule PERSON ) specifically provides that neither the Coroner nor the jury shall express any opinions on any other matters . Rule CARDINAL provides that no verdict shall appear to determine any question of criminal or civil liability on the part of a named person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided ( NORP ( PERSON ) \u03bd GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ; and NORP ( PERSON ) v. GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL W.L.R. CARDINAL ) that the limited scope of Inquests to date was incompatible with the procedural requirements of LAW . Using the interpretation mechanism of section CARDINAL of the ORG , ORG extended the Inquest regime so that \u201c how \u201d ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b)(ii ) of LAW and Rule CARDINAL(l)(b ) of LAW ) was to be interpreted as meaning \u201c by what means and in what circumstances \u201d the deceased came by his death . Lord PERSON clarified that , however the jury \u2019s extended factual conclusions were to be conveyed , Rule DATE was not to be infringed so that there could be no finding of criminal or civil liability . While acts or omissions could be recorded , expressions suggestive of civil liability , in particular neglect , carelessness and related expressions were to be avoided .", "CARDINAL . A person who suffers injury , physical or psychiatric , in consequence of the negligence of another may bring an action for damages for that injury . Upset and injury to feelings resulting from negligence in the absence of physical or psychiatric damage or exacerbation do not entitle a plaintiff to damages . Any personal - injury action maintainable by a living person survives for the benefit of his estate and may be pursued after his death .", "CARDINAL . Claims arising from a death caused by negligence are brought under LAW DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) or LAW ( LAW Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The DATE Act enables those who were financially dependent on the deceased to recover damages for the loss of support : the scheme is compensatory and , save for the sum of currently MONEY for bereavement awarded to the spouse of a deceased or parent of a deceased child under CARDINAL at the time of death , damages are awarded to reflect the loss of support . The DATE Act enables damages to be recovered on behalf of the deceased \u2019s estate and may include any right of action vested in the deceased at the time of death together with funeral expenses .", "CARDINAL . Mr Takoushis , diagnosed with schizophrenia , left a hospital where he was a voluntary patient and committed suicide . His wife challenged certain rulings of the Coroner . ORG , following the approach of ORG , examined , in the first place , whether those rulings were justified on the assumption that LAW was not engaged . ORG did not uphold the ORG \u2019s rulings and ordered a new Inquest .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to examine the applicability and scope of the protection of LAW in such cases partly because the point was evidently of some potential importance for the new Inquest which was now to be held . It accepted that simple negligence in the care of a patient resulting in his or her death was not sufficient to amount to a breach of the ORG \u2019s obligation under LAW to protect life , although the position might be different where gross negligence or manslaughter had been alleged ( relying , inter alia , on R ( ORG ) v GPE and GPE [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) , itself based on PERSON v. GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALV ) . ORG concluded by rejecting the argument that the deceased should be considered an involuntary patient as he would have been detained had he been seen leaving the hospital : the court found that the deceased was clearly a voluntary patient and that there was an important difference between the principles applicable to those who were detained and those who were not .", "CARDINAL . The deceased was an involuntary mental health patient who left an open acute psychiatric ward and committed suicide .", "CARDINAL . The Trust contended before ORG that the extent of the obligations of health authorities to protect a patient \u2019s life was to be found in PERSON v. GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALV ) namely , that the treatment alleged amounted either to gross negligence or to manslaughter . The claimant argued , citing PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) , that a duty to take steps to prevent a particular patient from committing suicide arose if the authorities knew or ought to have known that there was a real and immediate risk of her doing so . The claimant sought to distinguish her son \u2019s position ( an involuntary patient ) from that of a voluntary patient arguing that the test for LAW liability in PERSON did not apply to her son and equating the duty of care owed by the ORG to an involuntary patient with that owed to a prisoner in the criminal justice system . ORG expressly rejected that distinction , finding that the proper test applicable to a breach of the substantive obligation under LAW , in respect of both voluntary and involuntary patients where the relevant allegations were of clinical negligence , was the PERSON test namely , that of gross negligence of a kind sufficient to sustain a charge of manslaughter ( ORG relied on the above - cited Takoushis judgment ) . ORG struck out ORG action . In DATE ORG allowed ORG appeal .", "CARDINAL . The appeal to ORG was rejected by judgment dated DATE . Lord PERSON , giving the main judgment of ORG , noted that the fundamental error in the approach of the ORG was to conceive of the PERSON decision and the PERSON judgment as laying down CARDINAL mutually exclusive approaches whereas the ORG \u2019s case - law did not contain a hint of such an approach . The principles represented by those cases related to different aspects of the LAW obligations of health authorities and Lord PERSON summarised the relevant obligations of the health authorities under LAW as follows :", "\u201c In terms of LAW , health authorities are under an over - arching obligation to protect the lives of patients in their hospitals . In order to fulfil that obligation , and depending on the circumstances , they may require to fulfil a number of complementary obligations .", "In the first place , the duty to protect the lives of patients requires health authorities to ensure that the hospitals for which they are responsible employ competent staff and that they are trained to a high professional standard . In addition , the authorities must ensure that the hospitals adopt systems of work which will protect the lives of patients . Failure to perform these general obligations may result in a violation of article CARDINAL . If , for example , a health authority fails to ensure that a hospital puts in place a proper system for supervising mentally ill patients and , as a result , a patient is able to commit suicide , the health authority will have violated the patient \u2019s right to life under article CARDINAL .", "Even though a health authority employed competent staff and ensured that they were trained to a high professional standard , a doctor , for example , might still treat a patient negligently and the patient might die as a result . In that situation , there would be no violation of LAW since the health authority would have done all that the article required of it to protect the patient \u2019s life . Nevertheless , the doctor would be personally liable in damages for the death and the health authority would be vicariously liable for her negligence . This is the situation envisaged by PERSON .", "The same approach would apply if a mental hospital had established an appropriate system for supervising patients and all that happened was that , on a particular occasion , a nurse negligently left his post and a patient took the opportunity to commit suicide . There would be no violation of any obligation under LAW , since the health authority would have done all that the article required of it . But , again , the nurse would be personally liable in damages for the death and the health authority would be vicariously liable too . Again , this is just an application of PERSON .", "Finally , article CARDINAL imposes a further \u201c operational \u201d obligation on health authorities and their hospital staff . This obligation is distinct from , and additional to , the authorities\u2019 more general obligations . The operational obligation arises only if members of staff know or ought to know that a particular patient presents a \u201c real and immediate \u201d risk of suicide . In these circumstances article CARDINAL requires them to do all that can reasonably be expected to prevent the patient from committing suicide . If they fail to do this , not only will they and the health authorities be liable in negligence , but there will also be a violation of the operational obligation under article QUANTITY to protect the patient \u2019s life . This is comparable to the position in GPE and PERSON . As the present case shows , if no other remedy is available , proceedings for an alleged breach of the obligation can be taken under LAW DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON noted that it was relevant to the LOC obligations under LAW that the deceased was a detained patient and he continued :", "\u201c Any auction in the comparative vulnerability of prisoners , voluntary patients , and detained patients would be as unedifying as it is unnecessary . Plainly , patients , who have been detained because their health or safety demands that they should receive treatment in the hospital , are vulnerable ... not only by reason of their illness which may affect their ability to look after themselves , but also because they are under the control of the hospital authorities . Like anyone else in detention , they are vulnerable to exploitation , abuse , bullying and all the other potential dangers of a closed institution . ORG mutandis , the principles in the case law which the NORP court has developed for prisoners and administrative detainees must apply to patients who are detained . ...... The hospital authorities are accordingly responsible for the health and well being of their detained patients . Their obligations under LAW include an obligation to protect those patients from self - harm and suicide . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON noted the special position of detained patients and that it was not necessary to address in that case the extent of the ORG \u2019s operational duty to protect non - detained patients . Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON agreed with both Lord PERSON and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The deceased was a voluntary patient who committed suicide once released on home leave . Her parents brought a claim under the ORG and LAW , in their own right and on behalf of their child \u2019s estate . The claim under LAW on behalf of the estate for negligent care was settled by the Trust : QUANTITY sterling ( ORG ) in general damages and LAW in funeral expenses , plus legal costs .", "CARDINAL . The High Court ( [ DATE ] EWHC DATE ( QB ) ) and ORG ( DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) held that there was no operational duty under Article CARDINAL on the hospital authorities to take reasonable steps to protect the deceased against the risk of suicide because she was a voluntary patient and the remedy for allegations of clinical negligence as regards voluntary patients was an action in negligence . In any event , the parents were no longer victims for the purposes of the ORG given their settlement of the DATE Act proceedings . The parents appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG ) allowed the appeal , Lord PERSON giving the main judgment . He found that the difference between voluntary and involuntary psychiatric patients was more apparent than real , noting that a voluntary patient who was a suicide risk was taking medication which would compromise his / her ability to make an informed decision , was likely to be detained if he / she attempted to leave and , indeed , may have consented to be a patient to avoid detention . An informal psychiatric patient \u2019s position was therefore more analogous to that of the child at risk of abuse ( Z and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALV ) . Accordingly , he was in no doubt that ORG owed to the deceased patient an operational duty to take reasonable steps to protect her from a real and immediate risk of suicide . On the facts , that obligation had not been fulfilled since the decision to allow her home on leave was one that no reasonable practitioner would have made .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , by settling the DATE negligence claim on behalf of the estate , the parents could not be said to have renounced their own LAW claim for non - pecuniary damages for bereavement to which damages they were entitled . However , negligence proceedings had not been open to them ( section CARDINALA of LAW CARDINAL , the deceased not being a minor on death ) . Lord PERSON awarded each parent GBP CARDINAL under LAW . PERSON , Lord PERSON , and Lord PERSON delivered concurring judgments and Lord PERSON agreed with the main judgment and with the added comments of the remaining judges ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
