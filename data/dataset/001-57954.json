He was born in DATE and resides in GPE , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE an enforcement notice was issued and served on PERSON by ORG requiring the demolition of CARDINAL brick buildings on land which the applicant had bought in DATE . The enforcement notice recited that there appeared to the ORG to be a breach of planning control in that the CARDINAL brick buildings had been erected without the necessary planning permission . The notice required the applicant to demolish the buildings and remove the building materials within DATE . In doing so , the authorities acted in accordance with section CARDINAL of ORG DATE , which consolidated earlier legislation ( \" TCPA \" - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed to the Secretary of ORG for the Environment under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) , ( b ) , ( g ) and ( h ) TCPA ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In accordance with the relevant legislation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , an inspector was appointed to conduct an inquiry and determine the appeal . He was a ORG , a civil servant and a member of the salaried staff of ORG . He had been appointed by the Secretary of ORG after approval of the Lord Chancellor . In his decision letter of CARDINAL DATE the inspector rejected the appeal under grounds ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( g ) but allowed it under ground ( h ) to the extent that the compliance period should be extended from DATE . He held , inter alia , as follows :", "\" The appeal on ground ( b )", "...", "( CARDINAL ) What I need to decide in respect of this ground of appeal is whether , as a matter of fact and degree , the buildings could , from their appearance and layout , be considered to have been designed for the purposes of agriculture . I conclude , from examination of photographs taken during construction and from noting the alterations made since , that the ORG were right to be concerned that the appeal buildings had the appearance of large detached houses . The size , layout , and original external appearance of the buildings and their detailing did little to change that view .", "( CARDINAL ) In my opinion , as originally constructed , the buildings would have led any reasonable person to have concluded that he or she was looking at the start of a small new detached housing estate . Indeed , that appeared to be the widely held view of many local people , supported by the local Member of ORG , who were concerned to see what was being built on the edge of the village . The more recent construction of an , as yet , uncompleted but similar building close to the CARDINAL appeal buildings serves to compound the effect .", "( CARDINAL ) But it is the original appearance of the CARDINAL appeal buildings and particularly the first assessment of ORG which convinces me that the buildings were not requisite or reasonably necessary for the purposes of agriculture . Numerous features of the buildings were more suited to houses than barns . The original openings in building No . CARDINAL were said to be doorways for a veal calf unit . But this building did not incorporate internal drainage considered necessary for such stock . The doorways appeared to have been more likely to have been useful as window openings , none reached ground level as built ; CARDINAL was almost waist high above outside ground level measured from the lower edge of the unbonded brickwork added later . Other features in both buildings include the extensive use of NORP - style windows and other windows made for domestic use . I understand that PERSON PERSON \u2019s contacts allowed him to buy these windows cheaply . But whatever their source , they contribute to an impression that the buildings look more like houses than barns . There are other features which add to that view . The use of domestic - style eaves and gable barge boarding . The residential look of the \u2018 porch\u2019 to No . CARDINAL building . And the [ ORG ] view about the uneconomic layout of both buildings as originally built all add to the impression that these buildings were not designed for agricultural purposes , albeit they have since been modified and adapted for such a use .", "( CARDINAL ) You said that the buildings looked like many local old barns . But it is my view that , as originally built , the appeal buildings would have looked much more like houses . They did not look as if they had been designed for the purposes of agriculture . My opinion is not altered by my finding them now being used for storing hay . The appeal on ground ( b ) fails .", "The appeal on ground ( a )", "( CARDINAL ) The appeal buildings lie in part of the green belt ... They also lie within ORG but outside the village policy area for Higher PERSON shown on the draft ORG . In my opinion , the decision turns on the following main issues . Whether , if the development is inappropriate to the green belt , there are any special circumstances to justify the granting of planning permission ; secondly , whether the appeal buildings enhance or preserve the character or appearance of the conservation area . I shall also consider the effect of the development on the countryside surrounding the village .", "( CARDINAL ) ...", "( CARDINAL ) The appeal buildings have neither enhanced nor preserved the appearance of this part of the conservation area , rather the reverse . Much of the pleasant nature of the area is derived from the grouping of the older housing around the centre and from its rural and agricultural setting . The CARDINAL appeal buildings look like part of a small estate of detached houses with access roads and suitable garden areas . The third building , not subject of this appeal , exacerbates this impression .", "( CARDINAL ) These objections amount to sound and clear - cut reasons why planning permission should be withheld . The fact that other buildings or buildings of a broadly similar nature , if considered to be designed for agricultural purposes , could be built under the provisions of ORG , does not affect my decision . The appeal on ground ( a ) fails .", "The appeal on ground ( g )", "( CARDINAL ) You said that demolition of the buildings and the removal of the materials was an excessive requirement . I do not agree . Harm to the purpose of the green belt has been caused . The appearance and character of the conservation area has not been either enhanced or preserved . Encroachment on the countryside has occurred . Making the buildings look more like those which might have been permitted development as you suggested could mitigate a little of the harm I have identified . But this is not just a matter of cosmetics . The main objections would remain . In my opinion , the proper and necessary course of action is that required by the notice . That includes removal of materials . Such a requirement would not preclude their re - use on site for any possible future permitted development . The appeal on ground ( g ) fails .", "The appeal on ground ( h )", "( CARDINAL ) ... PERSON wanted more time in order to erect a replacement or replacements before demolition . I see no need to insist on a period which would make undue difficulty for him . I will increase the period to DATE ...", "( CARDINAL ) I have taken account of all the other matters raised , including the possibility of your client putting up a large steel - clad building under permitted development rights , but find they do not affect my decision . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant appealed against this decision under LAW TCPA ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In his Notice of Motion , the applicant first alleged that the inspector had \" erred in law in applying the wrong test in deciding whether the buildings were permitted development under the provisions of the ... ORG \" and \" in considering that the said buildings were not requisite or reasonably necessary for the purposes of agriculture when there was no evidence upon which any reasonable inspector could so find \" . The subsequent grounds of appeal dealt expressly with grounds ( a ) and ( g ) of the appeal to the Secretary of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE , the judge , Mr PERSON , ORG , finding inter alia as follows :", "\" A principal argument on behalf of the applicant at the inquiry under [ ground ] ( b ) was that the erection of the CARDINAL buildings was permitted development under LAW ...", "...", "The applicant does not challenge the inspector \u2019s decision under ground ( b ) . Nevertheless paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the decision letter , where he is still dealing with that ground , are relevant to the court \u2019s consideration of his decision on grounds ( a ) and ( g ) ...", "...", "In my judgment ... it can not be said that the inspector failed to take into account the fact that the applicant might , within his ORG rights , erect buildings of a broadly similar nature . He addressed that very consideration in terms at paragraph CARDINAL of his decision letter . Because the applicant had those rights and wanted more time to erect a replacement or replacements , the inspector extended the applicant \u2019s time for complying with the enforcement notice under ground ( h ) .", "Whether the existence of these General Development Order rights provided sufficient reason for the inspector to grant planning permission for the buildings in fact erected , whether or not conditioned as suggested by the applicant , was a matter for judgment - the inspector \u2019s judgment . Whether another decision - maker would have reached the same conclusion as did this inspector is not to the point . Nor is the view of this court , which does not sit on appeal from the judgment of inspectors , relevant . I am unable to say that there was anything irrational in the inspector \u2019s decision . In particular , the question whether the alterations proposed to a building were , as he evidently thought , a \u2018 matter of ORG and would not meet the main objections was entirely a matter of planning judgment for him . It is to be remembered that , in order to stay within his ORG rights , the applicant must erect replacement buildings which , by their appearance and layout , could be considered as designed for the purposes of agriculture . If they are , their effect on the green belt , the countryside and the conservation area is irrelevant to the exercise of that right . That does not , however , in my judgment mean that the inspector acted irrationally in concluding that the buildings in fact erected without permission under LAW were objectionable and should be demolished .", "In the result , I find no error of law and I dismiss the application . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG At the hearing held before ORG on DATE , the applicant \u2019s representatives stated that , although they had not represented the applicant before ORG , they surmised that the challenge to the inspector \u2019s ground ( b ) reasoning had been raised in LAW and then abandoned at the hearing because of the limited jurisdiction of ORG .
