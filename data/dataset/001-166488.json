This judgment was reversed by ORG on DATE . The applicants were also ordered to pay the ORG HRK CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL ) in costs , comprising the fees chargeable for the ORG \u2019s representation by ORG . The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The plaintiffs in the first - instance proceedings based their claim for damages on the provisions of the DATE LAW .... It is necessary to point to the content of section CARDINAL of that Act , which provides that the obligation to compensate for damage exists irrespective of whether the person responsible has been identified , criminally prosecuted or found guilty . However , having regard to the correct establishment of the facts by the first - instance court , which found that the events at issue had occurred on DATE in the village of J , in the then occupied territory of GPE which at that time was under the control of illegal formations of the \u201c GPE and outside the control of GPE and its lawful bodies , the appellant \u2019s submission that [ the killing of the plaintiffs\u2019 parents ] ... amounted to war - related damage is well - founded .", "Section CARDINAL of the Act on the Assessment of War - related Damage ... provides that war - related damage is damage caused by enemy or illegal groups , or legal bodies of GPE , as well as accomplices of these groups and bodies , where that damage occurred directly or indirectly at the time specified in CARDINAL of that LAW ( from DATE until the end of hostilities and war operations conducted against GPE ) . Therefore , given the nature , place and time of the events at issue ( the killing of innocent civilians in the occupied territory of GPE during the Homeland war ) , it is to be concluded that the events at issue are to be legally classified as war - related damage and that the appellant is not responsible for them or for the damage thus caused .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . This judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . The court endorsed ORG finding that the killing of the applicants\u2019 parents amounted to war - related damage and added , in so far as relevant , the following :", "\u201c Even though the act giving rise to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages presents certain similarities with a terrorist act since [ both ] imply [ an act of ] violence , the act of damage [ in the present case ] differs significantly from terrorist acts in its features since it contains additional elements and amounts to war - related damage for which the defendant is not liable . This is because the damage did not occur in the territory under the de facto sovereignty of GPE but in the then occupied territory , where there was no possibility for lawful action by the bodies of GPE ; this circumstance excludes the otherwise objective liability of the defendant . Furthermore , the act of damage in the present case was not carried out with the sole aim of seriously disturbing public order ( this being the aim characteristic of an act of terror ) but also involved the use of force , killing and expulsion of the civilian population on that territory with the aim of destroying the internal security and stability of GPE and preventing its lawful bodies from functioning .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint . They argued , inter alia , that in a number of its previous judgments ORG had recognised the plaintiffs\u2019 right to compensation for damage caused by death during the Homeland War in GPE , and cited CARDINAL judgments of that court adopted DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .
