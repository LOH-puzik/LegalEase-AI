Unlike some other NORP countries , where the GPE often have an itinerant way of life , in GPE , at least since DATE , the great majority of the GPE live a settled life . Typically , NORP towns feature CARDINAL or more predominantly GPE neighbourhoods in non - central areas .", "CARDINAL . Some of the applicants or their parents and in some cases their grandparents moved to PERSON at DATE and in DATE . Others are more recent arrivals who settled there in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE land in the neighbourhood in question was expropriated by the ORG and cleared in the context of the authorities\u2019 housing construction policy . A number of blocks of flats were constructed there , but the plots currently inhabited by the applicants remained vacant , having been earmarked for a green area , which was never landscaped .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 families built their homes on State land without any authorisation . The area thus gradually developed into a small GPE settlement . It appears that CARDINAL persons live there .", "CARDINAL . Most of the buildings are single - storey houses . There is no sewage or plumbing . The inhabitants use water from CARDINAL public fountains .", "CARDINAL . NORP Most applicants\u2019 registered addresses are at their homes in FAC . Many of them are registered at CARDINAL and the same address although they live in separate buildings which do not figure on any official area plan . Most of the applicants live in their houses with their families , including young children or grandchildren .", "CARDINAL . The applicants never sought to regularise the buildings they had constructed . This was in principle possible through applications for building permits and planning approval . According to the applicants , making such applications was difficult for them as they are poor and live their lives in the GPE community , isolated from the rest of society .", "CARDINAL . It is undisputed by the parties that the applicants\u2019 homes do not meet the basic requirements of the relevant construction and safety regulations and can not be legalised without substantial reconstruction .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the local building plan was amended and the construction of dwellings was envisaged on the plots in question . The plan was never implemented .", "CARDINAL . Following a legislative reform , in DATE the land occupied by the applicants became the property of the GPE municipality .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , the ORG and municipal authorities never took steps to remove the applicants and their families .", "CARDINAL . Under the relevant law the applicants can not obtain ownership of the land they occupy . Until DATE the provisions on acquisitive prescription did not apply in respect of ORG and municipal land . Since DATE , these provisions , under which a DATE period of possession may suffice for the acquisition of real property , apply to most categories of municipal land . However , in DATE , shortly before the expiry of DATE after the DATE amendment , ORG suspended the running of prescription periods in respect of ORG and municipal land . The suspension has been extended several times and is currently in force until DATE ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and the transitional provisions thereto ) .", "CARDINAL . According to a statement by a Mr PERSON , a GPE resident of ORG , his parents are the lawful owners of their house there and possess a notarial deed . A copy of the notarial deed has not been submitted by the applicants . Neither Mr PERSON nor his parents were among the addressees of the removal order of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . From DATE tension grew in several regions of GPE between the inhabitants of GPE settlements and their non - Roma neighbours . The issue of GPE settlements , often referred to as \u201c ghettos \u201d , was widely debated in the media . Many commentators urged the emptying of all \u201c GPE ghettos \u201d in GPE . This line was supported by a number of leading politicians . Occasionally , the views of GPE organisations were also published .", "CARDINAL . DATE several demonstrations were held by non - GPE residents of different areas in GPE seeking the eviction of their GPE neighbours . Other demonstrations were held by non - Roma persons protesting at news of plans by the authorities to resettle in their neighbourhoods GPE families to be removed from other parts of the city .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on an unspecified date non - GPE residents of ORG formed an association with the aim to bring pressure to bear on the authorities in relation to the ORG unlawful settlement .", "CARDINAL . Most complaints against the GPE inhabitants of ORG concerned sanitary risks and repulsive odours caused by the absence of sewage and the fact that the inhabitants kept animals ( allegedly including sheep , pigs , hens and horses ) . Also , many non - GPE residents of the area believed that the GPE inhabitants were responsible for numerous offences , including physical assault , theft and damage to public and private property . The protesters also resented on aesthetic grounds the presence of unsightly shanty houses in the area .", "CARDINAL . NORP The municipal authorities in GPE perceived as a serious problem the fact that since DATE many GPE had moved to GPE and settled in illegal GPE settlements , thus increasing their overpopulation and generating more illegal construction and sanitary problems .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an unspecified number of individuals , apparently persons who had obtained decisions restoring their property rights over expropriated land in the PERSON area , complained to the GPE municipal council that \u201c persons of GPE origin \u201d were unlawfully occupying land in the area . Having examined the matter , on DATE the municipal council decided to offer the restored owners other municipal land in exchange for their land . It also invited the mayor of GPE to develop a plan for the resolution of the \u201c problem as a whole \u201d . No such plan appears to have been adopted .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the local building plan in PERSON was modified by the municipal authorities , who planned to develop the area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE municipal council approved in principle the transfer of title to plots of land in PERSON to PERSON , a private investor . The transfer was effected on DATE . The plots of land in question were adjacent to the land occupied by the applicants . It is unclear whether PERSON realised any development project .", "CARDINAL . On DATE municipal officials visited the ORG neighbourhood and issued a document certifying that the applicants and other persons occupied the land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON , the district mayor , invited all or almost all residents DATE approximately CARDINAL GPE , including the applicants DATE to leave their homes within DATE as they were occupying municipal land unlawfully . The text referred to section CARDINAL of LAW and contained a list of the names of its addressees and also a warning that failure to comply would result in removal by the police .", "CARDINAL . The applicants filed an appeal . On DATE municipal officials issued a document certifying that the residents concerned had not left the area .", "CARDINAL . As a result , on DATE the mayor ordered their forcible removal on DATE . The order listed individually the names of all those concerned . The mayor also stated her intention to secure a decision for the demolition of the applicants\u2019 houses in accordance with LAW ( ORG \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants asked ORG to stay their removal pending the examination of their appeal against the removal order . The court granted their request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a committee representing the GPE residents of the area signed an agreement with the municipal authorities in GPE according to which the municipality would offer alternative housing to the persons registered as PERSON residents , whereupon they would be removed . No action was taken by the municipality in execution of this agreement .", "CARDINAL . The agreement also provided that the committee of representatives would take measures to improve hygiene in the GPE settlement . They also undertook to organise the removal of unauthorised domestic animals kept by residents and keep better order . According to the Government , the situation did not improve .", "CARDINAL . In the judicial proceedings against the mayor \u2019s order , on DATE the ORG ruled that the removal order was lawful . The applicants appealed . On DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The courts found that the fact that the applicants had not shown a valid legal ground for occupying the land was sufficient to establish that the removal order was lawful . If the applicants considered that they had property rights , it was for them to seek notarial deeds or bring civil proceedings to establish those alleged rights . They had not done so . In these circumstances and having regard to section CARDINAL of LAW , their houses were owned by the municipality .", "CARDINAL . The courts also stated that the ORG allegations about violations of the LAW and discrimination were groundless .", "CARDINAL . The courts ignored as irrelevant under domestic law the ORG argument that they should not be removed because they had lived in the area for DATE with the authorities\u2019 acquiescence , and their arguments based on the principle of proportionality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the municipal authorities announced their intention to evict the unlawful residents of PERSON , including the applicants , by DATE and to demolish their homes . On DATE the district mayor was reported in the press as having stated that the removal order had been issued as a result of numerous complaints by neighbours in relation to the unlawful settlement .", "CARDINAL . As a result of political pressure , mainly from members of ORG , the authorities did not proceed with the eviction .", "CARDINAL . In their public declarations the municipal authorities apparently took the stand that the removal of the Batalova Vodenitsa residents was overdue but could not be done immediately because of pressure \u201c from LOC \u201d . Divergent opinions were expressed as to whether the municipality should try to find alternative housing for the residents of PERSON . In public declarations the mayor of the district stated that this was not possible because the residents concerned had not been registered as persons in need of housing and the municipality could not give them priority over other people who had been on the waiting list for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date shortly after DATE , PERSON , the mayor of the relevant district , participated in a televised debate concerning the fate of the GPE settlement in ORG . She stated , inter alia , that the GPE inhabitants there did not have the right to be registered as persons in need of housing because they were occupying municipal land unlawfully . For that reason , she would not offer them the tenancy of municipal dwellings , there being many other families on the waiting list . The district mayor further stated that the agreement of DATE between the mayor of GPE and a committee of representatives of the GPE families \u201c had been concluded in a pre - electoral period \u201d and that she did not consider herself bound by it . She also stated that the removal order had been upheld by the courts and must be enforced ; the fact that the persons concerned had nowhere to go was irrelevant . The mayor further stated that she had received complaints by non - GPE inhabitants of the area and was under a duty to act .", "CARDINAL . Most of the applicants have not tried to make arrangements to find new homes for their families . DATE CARDINAL of the applicants registered at addresses in other areas of GPE . In DATE CARDINAL of the applicants declared an address in the town of PERSON as her official address . According to these CARDINAL applicants , although for short periods they lived outside PERSON , in dwellings occupied by relatives , their only real home had remained PERSON .", "CARDINAL . It appears that after DATE negotiations continued between the GPE inhabitants and the municipal authorities regarding possible relocation in temporary municipal housing of those persons in the applicants\u2019 position who had been registered as resident in ORG before DATE . Non - governmental organisations defending the rights of the ORG representatives also took part .", "CARDINAL . Information about intentions to resettle the ORG unlawful residents have met with strong opposition from inhabitants of neighbourhoods where such relocation was envisaged . It appears that no viable resettlement plan has ever been elaborated .", "CARDINAL . In interviews and statements , local officials supported the non - Roma population . In a radio interview in DATE , the mayor of ORG in GPE stated that \u201c the nuisance that a GPE settlement would create [ if GPE families were to move into his district ] would surpass by far the inconvenience that a refuse tip would create \u201d . He also stated that \u201c GPE families could not expect to live among the citizens as they did not have the necessary culture \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipal authorities served a notice on the inhabitants of the area , including the applicants , requiring them to leave their houses by DATE , failing which they would be evicted forcibly on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The notice was issued in execution of the removal order of DATE , which was final and enforceable .", "DATE . On DATE the ORG indicated to the Government of GPE , under LAW , that the applicants should not be evicted from their houses until DATE , pending receipt by ORG detailed information about any arrangements made by the authorities to secure housing for the children , elderly , disabled or otherwise vulnerable individuals to be evicted .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted a copy of a statement by PERSON , the district mayor , who indicated that CARDINAL local social homes could provide CARDINAL rooms each and that several elderly persons could be housed in a third home . There was no information about any possibility to house families together .", "CARDINAL . Also , it appears that none of the applicants was willing to be separated from the community and housed in such conditions , not least because it was impossible , according to them , to earn a living outside the community .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , the district mayor , stated that she had suspended the enforcement of the removal order \u201c pending the resolution of the housing problems of the PERSON residents \u201d . The order was not quashed .", "CARDINAL . In the light of this information , the President of the ORG \u2019s ORG decided on DATE to lift the interim measure of DATE , specifying that the decision was taken on the assumption that the ORG and the applicants would be given sufficient notice of any change in the authorities\u2019 position for consideration to be given to a further measure under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which includes representatives of non - governmental organisations and is presided over by the Director of the NORP and ORG at ORG , discussed the issue . Representatives of the GPE municipality were advised to refrain from measures seeking to resolve the problem in PERSON at the expense of creating tension in other areas . The majority view was that the GPE families living in PERSON should not be evicted and their homes should not be demolished before a lasting solution was found .", "CARDINAL . According to a letter from the Director of NORP and ORG , sent in DATE in connection with the present application , the GPE municipality was working on a programme for the revitalisation of ORG . It was envisaged to construct temporary housing on several municipal plots of land . Partial initial financing of the construction work could be provided by the ORG but other sources were needed as well . It was envisaged to encourage the GPE applying for housing to take jobs in the construction work under the relevant social employment schemes . The project \u2019s elaboration , including architectural plans , was allegedly under way . The project concerned GPE families who moved to ORG before DATE . Those who settled there more recently had \u201c to return to their previous homes \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to a letter from residents protesting against the authorities\u2019 failure to evict their GPE neighbours from ORG , PERSON , the district mayor , stated that the enforcement of the DATE eviction order had been postponed under pressure from members of ORG and that the applicants had started proceedings in ORG . The letter did not mention plans to secure alternative housing for the persons to be evicted .", "CARDINAL . According to media reports , in DATE plans to resettle the inhabitants of GPE vodenitsa on other ORG or municipal property were discussed by the municipal authorities .", "CARDINAL . In their latest submissions of DATE the parties have not reported any progress in the realisation of such projects .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , the resettlement plans mentioned by the authorities are nothing more than empty promises .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a DATE ORG ( DATE ) for ORG in GPE was adopted by ORG in the context of the international initiative entitled DATE of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the GPE municipal council adopted a plan for the implementation of the DATE national programme in GPE for the period DATE . The document includes an analysis of the existing situation in respect of housing .", "CARDINAL . According to this analysis , overpopulated GPE settlements had formed over DATE in GPE and nothing had been done by the authorities in the past to address the ensuing problems . Having always been a marginalised group with minimal resources , the GPE can not in practice acquire real property . Traditionally they occupy vacant land and construct makeshift huts . Although most of them , being persons in need of housing , meet the relevant criteria for tenancy of municipal housing , this option does not work in practice owing to several factors , including the limited number of available municipal dwellings and unwillingness on the part of many GPE families to resettle in municipal flats . Their unwillingness could be explained partly by the lack of the necessary resources to cover the related expenses , such as utility bills , and partly by the animosities which often erupt between non - GPE residents of blocks of flats and GPE families moving in .", "CARDINAL . The DATE ORG and the DATE PERSON plan provide for the following actions , among others : elaborating municipal housing programmes , legalising buildings if they meet the relevant construction standards , constructing sewage and water - supply facilities in NORP neighbourhoods and providing information and assistance to those who apply for municipal housing .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Monitoring report on the implementation of the Decade of Roma Inclusion CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL programme does not mention any progress having been made in respect of GPE housing . The concluding text of the report contains a recommendation to the relevant institutions and stakeholders to make timely use of the possibilities under LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Regulation ( ORG ) No . DATE on ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to media reports , in several regions in GPE construction works are under way for the building of dwellings intended to house GPE who have been removed or are to be removed from land which they occupy unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Municipal Property Act empowers the mayor to order the repossession of real property belonging to the municipality and occupied by others if they have no legal right to occupy it . The mayor \u2019s order is amenable to judicial appeal . Its enforcement is effected by the police .", "CARDINAL . The new paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL , added in DATE , provides that persons occupying municipal real property without a legal basis can not avail themselves of sections CARDINAL of LAW , which bestow certain rights on holders of property belonging to another ( under certain conditions , the right to reimbursement for improvements , and to withhold the property pending such reimbursement ) .", "DATE . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with its other provisions , buildings belong to the owner of the land except where the right to construct a building has been lawfully conveyed by the owner to another person . DATE it was not possible under NORP law to acquire ORG or municipal property through adverse possession . Since DATE , state and municipal property , if it is of the category of \u201c private state property \u201d , may in principle be acquired by private persons through adverse possession , under a number of conditions . Through a transitory provision introduced in DATE , the running of the DATE prescription period was suspended and the suspension is still in force .", "CARDINAL . The categorisation of persons in need of housing and the possibility of applying for municipal housing are governed by municipal regulations issued by each municipality in accordance with section DATE of LAW . These regulations , which differ from city to city , usually require candidates to have had their registered address in the town for DATE , to have no real property of their own , and to have resources that do not exceed a certain maximum . Typically the application must be made in writing on a form and be accompanied by a number of documents . The decision whether to recognise the need is taken by a municipal commission and is amenable to judicial appeal . Among the candidates recognised as being in need of housing , homeless persons and those living in dangerous and unhealthy conditions have priority .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , an emergency stock of municipal flats may be used to house for DATE persons whose dwellings are unsafe as being in danger of collapsing and persons with severe social or health problems .", "CARDINAL . Under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG , in force since DATE , racially offensive statements may be considered discriminatory . The victim may file a complaint with ORG ( see , for example , Decision no . CARDINAL of DATE , where that commission established that the anti - GPE language used in a television broadcast of CARDINAL DATE amounted to prohibited discrimination ) or bring an action in court . Racially offensive statements may be criminally punishable under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The proceedings must be initiated by the victim . Separately , incitement to racial hatred is an offence punishable under LAW .", "CARDINAL . At the time when the removal order of CARDINAL DATE was issued and reviewed by the domestic courts , NORP administrative procedure law did not enshrine the principle of proportionality . Since DATE , when LAW entered into force , this principle is set out in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a decision on the merits of a complaint against GPE brought by ORG centre , a non - governmental organisation . The ORG found , inter alia , that \u201c the lack of legal security of tenure and the non - respect of the conditions accompanying eviction of GPE families from dwellings unlawfully occupied by them PERSON ] a violation of LAW , taken together with LAW . LAW concerns the right of families to \u201c appropriate social , legal and economic protection \u201d and LAW prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights set forth in the LAW .", "CARDINAL . To reach its conclusion , the ORG found that the NORP legislation allowing the legalisation of illegal constructions set conditions \u201c too stringent to be useful in redressing the particularly urgent situation of the housing of GPE families \u201d , a situation recognised by ORG . ORG also considered that the authorities had tolerated the unlawful GPE settlements for long periods and were accordingly obliged to carefully balance town planning measures against \u201c the right to housing and its corollary of not making individual[s ] homeless \u201d . ORG further found that by failing to take into consideration the specificity of the living conditions of GPE and strictly applying the rules on legalisation of buildings to them , GPE had discriminated against GPE families , whose situation differed not least as a consequence of ORG non - intervention over a certain period . Similarly , there was discrimination on account of the authorities\u2019 failure to take into account that GPE families ran a higher risk of eviction , and the authorities\u2019 failure systematically to find alternative accommodation for the evicted families .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a resolution in the case in which it noted , inter alia , the NORP delegation \u2019s statement before it that GPE intended to amend LAW to allow for easier legalising of existing buildings and construction of social housing .", "DATE . In its DATE Recommendation on improving the housing conditions of ORG called upon member GPE , inter alia , to use proportionate response to illegal GPE settlements and seek , where possible , solutions acceptable for all parties . Also , eviction measures should include consultation with the community or individual concerned , reasonable notice , provision of information , a guarantee that the eviction will be carried out in a reasonable manner and alternative housing measures . As to daily life in existing settlements , the authorities should provide the same level of services as to other groups of the population and should , beyond that , promote better management including adequate management of neighbourhood conflicts . Housing policies should be tailored to the specific situations of the GPE communities .", "CARDINAL . In its DATE Recommendation on policies for ORG in LOC , ORG called upon Member States , inter alia , to ensure that decisions adopted by local authorities in the relevant area would not have a discriminatory effect on GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its Resolution CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) on the situation of GPE in LOC and relevant activities of ORG , ORG of ORG noted with concern that the process of GPE integration in LOC had not reached its objectives over DATE , that GPE people were still regularly victims of intolerance , discrimination and rejection based on deep - seated prejudices and that the situation of GPE with regard to education , employment , housing , health care and political participation was far from satisfactory . The ORG stated that adopting national strategies was insufficient in the absence of implementation measures at local and regional levels . It urged member GPE , inter alia , to promote a positive image of diversity , address stereotypes and prejudices , react strongly to racist discourse by public officials and tackle hate speech vis - \u00e0 - vis GPE , be it in the media , politics or in civil society . As regards housing , the ORG urged member ORG to take urgent measures to prevent forced evictions of GPE camps and settlements and \u2013 in cases of unavoidable evictions \u2013 ensure that such evictions were carried out only when all procedural protections required under international human rights law were in place , including the provision of adequate alternative housing and compensation for expropriation and losses of moveable possessions damaged in the process of eviction and , in the absence of such procedural protections in the existing domestic law , introduce legislation on evictions providing safeguards and remedies in accordance with international standards .", "CARDINAL . ORG Commissioner for Human Rights , in his DATE Recommendation on the implementation of the right to housing stated , inter alia , that GPE should specify in legislation that positive measures are justified in order to promote full and effective equality provided that there was an objective and reasonable justification for such measures .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG for Fundamental Rights issued a comparative report on the housing conditions of GPE and travellers in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the report , significant numbers of GPE in LOC live in unauthorised settlements . For example , in DATE PERCENT of houses in urban NORP developments in GPE were illegally built , in DATE in GPE CARDINAL GPE lived in unregulated encampments and in DATE in GPE most GPE groups lived in squalid shantytowns .", "CARDINAL . The report also mentioned cases of forced evictions of such encampments , in particular in GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in its General Comment no . CARDINAL concerning forced evictions and the right to adequate housing under LAW , stated , inter alia , that evictions should not render persons homeless or more vulnerable to human rights violations . Also , evictions must meet a number of conditions , such as prior consultation with the persons to be evicted , the giving of adequate and reasonable notice as to when the eviction will take place and the availability of judicial remedies . If those evicted can not provide for themselves , GPE should take all reasonable measures , utilising all available resources , to ensure the provision of adequate alternative housing ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
