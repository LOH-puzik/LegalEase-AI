Part of the case file and the written reasons for the bill were classified as it contained information covered by professional secrecy ( tajemnica s\u0142u\u017cbowa ) . The prosecutor asked the court for the defendants and their counsel to be allowed to consult the reasons for the bill of indictment , in accordance with the rules laid down in ORG . Furthermore , invoking LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the prosecutor requested that the entire hearing be conducted in camera on account of the important ORG interests involved .", "CARDINAL .

At that hearing the court allowed the prosecutor \u2019s request to conduct the trial in camera , having regard to the important ORG interests involved as provided for in LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG .

On DATE the trial court received a copy of the decision of ORG of DATE authorising the Chief Police Commissioner of CARDINAL DATE to order the secret recordings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court provided the applicants with the transcript of secret recordings , on which they refused to comment . At the hearing held on DATE the trial court heard the secret recordings made by the ORG . According to the applicants , the recordings were of very poor quality .

At the hearings held on DATE and DATE the court heard ORG officers involved in the investigation , including those who had opened the parcel on DATE . The court authorised them to testify in respect of the facts covered by the duty of professional secrecy .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE the first applicant requested the trial court to reverse its earlier decision to conduct the proceedings in camera . She submitted that as a consequence of that decision her defence rights had been limited because she had not been allowed to make notes from the file . Her counsel did not take a stand on the request , stating that it was the first applicant \u2019s personal view . The prosecutor objected to the request , claiming that the grounds for the decision to exclude the public remained relevant . He also argued that the first applicant \u2019s defence rights were duly respected as she could personally consult the classified part of the case file . ORG dismissed the request to reverse the earlier decision to conduct the proceedings in camera as the grounds originally invoked for that decision remained fully valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave judgment . It found the applicants guilty of having participated in the transit of cocaine through GPE in concert with other persons , and sentenced them to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It further ordered them to make a payment of CARDINAL ORG to a local association fighting drug addiction and to reimburse the ORG \u2019s costs incurred in the proceedings . The written reasons for the judgment were classified as confidential and deposited in the secret registry of the court . The ORG counsel were informed accordingly and notified of their right to consult the written reasons . They filed an appeal without consulting the written reasons for the judgment .", "CARDINAL . When establishing the facts , ORG excluded the evidence obtained by means of the secret recordings ordered by the Chief Police Commissioner on DATE . ORG observed that the Police Commissioner \u2019s order had not been endorsed by a court within DATE as required by section QUANTITY of LAW . Accordingly , the evidence obtained on the basis of that order was unlawful and could not be used in the criminal proceedings against the applicants . On the other hand , ORG confirmed that the secret surveillance of the parcel and the replacement of the cocaine with an unspecified powder substance had been effected in accordance with LAW and the relevant Ordinance of the Minister of the Interior .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the available evidence , in particular , various statements made by the applicants during the investigation and during the trial , ORG found that at the time when the parcel had been at their disposal the applicants had known that it contained drugs . The court found that the applicants had acted intentionally with a view to transferring the drugs through GPE to the GPE . Thus , their guilt had been sufficiently established .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal , the applicants alleged breaches of several provisions of criminal procedure committed by the prosecution and the court , arbitrary assessment of evidence and disregard for the in dubio pro reo principle . They argued that the excluded evidence should have been omitted as the \u201c fruit of the poisonous tree \u201d , whereas the court had actually based the conviction on that evidence . Further , they submitted that the applicants\u2019 right to defend themselves had been impaired because access to the classified evidence had been very difficult , and neither the applicants nor their lawyers had been allowed to make copies or notes of the written reasons for the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing at which the prosecutor requested the court to conduct the proceedings in camera . The applicants\u2019 counsel left the issue to the court \u2019s discretion . ORG decided pursuant to LAW ORG to allow the prosecutor \u2019s request since the examination of the appeal would not be possible without consideration of the classified evidence . ORG further decided to supplement the evidentiary material . It noted that the trial court had not determined the exact circumstances of the removal of the cocaine from the parcel and its replacement by a similar substance and decided , to this end , to hear QUANTITY police officers who had been involved in the covert interception of the parcel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing in camera . It heard evidence from CARDINAL police officers and established that the cocaine had been removed from the parcel and replaced with a similar substance by the police .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor requested ORG to hear the secret recordings and argued that ORG had erred in excluding that evidence . ORG rejected that request , noting that it could not examine the relevant decision of ORG since the first - instance judgment had not been appealed against by the prosecutor ( reformatio in peius ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after deliberations , ORG amended the judgment of ORG by changing the legal classification of the offence to CARDINAL of \u201c attempted \u201d transit of drugs ( usi\u0142owanie nieudolne ) as the police had secretly removed the drug from the parcel and replaced it with a similar substance . It accordingly reduced the applicants\u2019 sentence to DATE imprisonment . The judge rapporteur presented orally the main reasons for the judgment . The written reasons for the judgment were classified as confidential and could only be consulted in the secret registry of the court .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed that the applicants had taken part in the transit of cocaine through GPE . The first applicant had collected the parcel from the addressee and kept it in order to hand it over to a person indicated by PERSON .. She had also informed PERSON of the collection of the parcel . The second applicant had assisted the first applicant in the process .", "CARDINAL . ORG held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c The applicants\u2019 counsel are wrong to plead that the accused had no intention to take part in the transit of the drugs through GPE . This was sufficiently established by the [ admitted ] evidence , and in particular by the statements of the accused themselves . ( ... )", "The applicants\u2019 counsel are wrong to claim that the accused \u2019s right to defend themselves was restricted on account of the fact that part of the evidence was classified , or that the judgment was the result of the fact that the judges had retained in their mind the content of excluded evidence . Both those situations are a simple consequence of the application of the relevant regulations , namely the regulation regarding classified information and the [ regulation on ] judicial review of the legality of evidence . ...", "CARDINAL . The assertion that there was no equality of arms because part of the evidence was classified is incorrect . Such evidence was not withheld from the counsel , as they were able to consult it in the same manner as the prosecutor , and the restrictions on disclosure of classified material were equally applicable to both parties .", "CARDINAL . NORP ( ... ) The consultation of classified evidence meant accepting certain conditions , including the prohibition on taking notes on the contents of such evidence ; nonetheless those restrictions were not of such a nature that they could be considered to limit the rights of the defence . Counsel could memorise the content of the evidence they consulted , then use it , while respecting the requirements of confidentiality , either when pleading at the closed hearings or with due diligence in their written submissions . ( ... ) Those were then not limitations on the rights of the defence , but rather certain impediments in conducting the defence , in any case impediments of a minor degree . In ORG view , those limitations were necessary since part of the evidence was classified . If they [ those limitations ] were not applied , the interests protected by the regulation on classified information would be affected . [ Those limitations ] are present in every case concerning classified information , and thus alleging shortcomings in this respect does not concern just this particular case but relates generally to the principle of the determination of criminal charges based on evidence covered by the regulation on classified information . That would then be a claim of unconstitutionality in respect of the determination of such cases due to the limitation by that regulation of the constitutionally protected rights of the defence ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW ) , which is far - reaching , unjustified and \u2013 for ORG \u2013 unconvincing . If those arguments ( or rather groundless assertions ) of the author of such allegations were to be shared , then the determination of cases involving classified material would be ruled out . ( ... ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 claim that the trial court had based the conviction on the excluded evidence . In this respect it noted , inter alia :", "\u201c The allegation that ORG ruling was influenced by the content of the excluded evidence , i.e. the evidence obtained secretly by the police and the explanations of the accused related to that evidence , is incorrect . Firstly , it is not uncommon in criminal proceedings that some evidence is removed from the scope of evidentiary material constituting the basis for a ruling . ( ... ) Ensuring that judges did not know the evidence that was excluded would mean extinguishing those procedural acts in which such evidence was examined , removing the records of such information from the files and restarting every trial before a different panel of the court . That would not be reasonable and it is not provided for by law . ( ... ) In other words , ORG examines whether the evidence ORG took as the basis for its ruling was sufficient for it to give the ruling or whether there was insufficient evidentiary basis for it . ORG considers that there was sufficient evidence to give the judgment , and thus the judgment [ of ORG ] has adequate evidentiary basis ( with CARDINAL reservation in respect of the presence of the drug in the parcel ) . The allegation that the judges [ of ORG ] were influenced by the content of excluded evidence had no significance for the content of the judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged cassation appeals . The second applicant \u2019s lawyer submitted , inter alia , that ORG had not referred to the arguments raised in the appeals , that in its assessment of evidence the court had infringed the principles of impartiality , presumption of innocence and in dubio pro reo . They repeated their arguments , submitted to ORG , that the unlawfully obtained evidence , although eventually excluded by the first - instance court , had been presented during the trial as admissible evidence , which must have unfairly prejudiced the outcome of the proceedings . The defence also argued that since the evidence obtained by means of the secret recordings had been excluded at first instance , there had been no reason to hold the appeal proceedings in private .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera in a single judge formation , dismissed the ORG cassation appeals , finding both of them manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure sets out an exception to the principle that court hearings should be held in public . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides for the court to order that all or part of the hearing be held in camera if a public hearing might disclose matters which should remain secret in the light of the ORG interests at stake .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG stipulates that when a hearing is held in camera an accused may request that a person of trust of his choice be present at the hearing . That rule does not apply to cases where there is a risk of disclosure of a ORG secret ( LAW ) .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , which concerns the delivery of a judgment , provides :", "\u201c If the case has been heard in camera because of important ORG interests , instead of written reasons , notice will be served to the effect that the reasons have been prepared . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The DATE Protection of Classified Information Act ( ustawa o ochronie informacji niejawnych ) establishes a comprehensive set of rules concerning , inter alia , definitions and categories of classified information , the authorities responsible for protecting classified information and the rules on access to it .
