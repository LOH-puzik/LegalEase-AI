AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 10;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant company is the publisher of a newspaper ( PERSON ) with its registered office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the PERSON published several articles on a case of parents , Ms and Mr K. who had abused their daughter . In the articles it was alleged that they had homo - bisexual inclinations . Subsequently PERSON filed a compensation claim under LAW ( Mediengesetz ) with ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) against the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ordered the applicant company under Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW to publish a notice concerning the institution of the proceedings . On DATE this notice was published in the Neue Kronenzeitung .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE PERSON filed enforcement requests ( PERSON ) under LAW of LAW against the applicant company . Referring to LAW of LAW , requiring a notice of the same \u201c publishing value \u201d ( PERSON ) as the original message , she argued that the notice of CARDINAL DATE was smaller than the articles of DATE and was , thus , not published in due form .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON request . The court found that the notice of DATE , though somewhat smaller , had the same \u201c attention value \u201d ( PERSON ) and , thus , the same \u201c publishing value \u201d as the articles .", "CARDINAL . With ORG ( GPE ) decision of DATE the compensation proceedings were finally determined . The court ordered the applicant company to pay ORG CARDINAL in compensation to Ms K. for breach of the presumption of innocence in its reporting about PERSON and to publish the sentence . The applicant company complied with these orders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , upon PERSON appeal , quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the applicant company to pay a coercive indemnity ( PERSON ) of ATS CARDINAL,CARDINAL to PERSON , namely ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for each issue of the newspaper CARDINAL . The court considered that , in one of the disputed articles , PERSON had been defamed even in a subtitle , whereas the notice had no subtitle . Therefore the \u201c publishing value \u201d was diminished .", "CARDINAL . Following this decision , PERSON filed further enforcement requests for the period of DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company requested that Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW be applied by analogy . This provision allowed for an exemption from the imposition of coercive indemnity for the duration of appeal proceedings in case a first - instance court had imposed a coercive indemnity for an inappropriate publication of the notice - which , however , had been published in a manner close to the due form - and the respondent had appealed against this decision . The applicant company argued that after the first - instance court 's decision in its favour , finding that the notice had the same publishing value , it had not been required to publish another notice . Therefore the above rule of exemption from imposition of coercive indemnity during the appeal proceedings applied even more in its case . The applicant company further requested that LAW CARDINAL of LAW - which , in cases of special circumstances , allows the authority to stop or remit the imposition of coercive indemnity , once the notice has been published in due form - be applied for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant company to pay ORG CARDINAL to Ms K. , namely ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for each issue of the GPE between DATE and DATE , the date of the introduction of PERSON appeal against the decision of DATE . It dismissed the remainder of PERSON request and the applicant company 's request under LAW of LAW . The court found that LAW of LAW applied by analogy for the period of the appeal proceedings , therefore no coercive indemnity had to be paid from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on both parties ' appeal , quashed ORG decision in part . It decided that the applicant company had to pay a coercive indemnity of ORG CARDINAL to PERSON , i.e. ORG CARDINAL for each issue of the newspaper DATE and DATE . The court considered that the applicant company could not be exempted from paying the coercive indemnity for the period of the appeal proceedings , as the notice of CARDINAL DATE had not come close to a notice in due form as required by LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) lodged a plea of nullity for the preservation of the law ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde zur Wahrung des Gesetzes ) with ORG . It argued that the coercive indemnity under LAW of LAW was a coercive measure ( Beugemittel ) . According to ORG , it was unreasonable to impose a coercive indemnity for the period after the first instance court 's decision of DATE , since after that decision the applicant company was to be considered as having acted in good faith when it did not publish another notice . The coercive indemnity should therefore only be imposed for the period before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the plea of nullity . It argued that the question of good faith could not be resolved under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . Rather , the applicant company would have to commence indulgence proceedings ( PERSON ) under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . In such proceedings , its particular situation after the first instance decision of DATE could be taken into account .", "CARDINAL . In compensation proceedings under LAW , the court shall order the media company concerned to publish a short notice about the institution of the case , if it may be assumed that the compensation claim is well founded ( LAW CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . This notice has to have the same \u201c publishing value \u201d ( ORG ) as the publication to which it refers ( Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the notice was not published in due form , the plaintiff may request the court to impose a coercive indemnity on the respondent for each issue in which the notice could have been duly published , with sums of up to ATS CARDINAL per issue ( Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Once the notice has been duly published , the coercive indemnity may be stopped or remitted on request by the respondent in cases of special circumstances ( in ber\u00fccksichtigungsw\u00fcrdigen NORP ) ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The parties have a right to appeal to ORG against decisions imposing or remitting a coercive indemnity . In the event a coercive indemnity has been imposed for inappropriate publication of the notice and the respondent has appealed against this decision , no further coercive indemnity shall be imposed for the duration of the appeal proceedings , if the notice - whose proper publication is litigious - was published in a manner coming close to the due form ( Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
