THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE , GPE .", "She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising at PERSON , Solicitors , in GPE , GPE .", "A.", "The applicant is unemployed and in receipt of income support . The applicant raised an action for damages for negligence against ORG in ORG , GPE , in respect of the illness and subsequent death of her late husband . The applicant alleged that her late husband ( M ) , who smoked cigarettes from DATE to DATE manufactured by ORG ( \u201c the defenders \u201d ) , was not initially warned by the defenders that the consumption of these cigarettes would be injurious to his health . It was alleged that the defenders had a duty to warn smokers that smoking was addictive and could cause lung cancer . The defenders had failed to do so and , but for that failure , M would not have started to smoke . In DATE the defenders arranged for warnings about injury to health to be put on their cigarette packets . By that time , however , M was addicted to nicotine and , despite advice from his doctor , could not give up his smoking habit until DATE . In DATE he was diagnosed as suffering from inoperable lung cancer . The defenders denied the applicant 's claims and denied that causation had been proved , alleging inter alia contributory negligence .", "Since DATE M , and following his death , the applicant , attempted to obtain the facility of legal aid from ORG ( \u201c the Board \u201d ) in order to allow them to be represented by solicitors and counsel in their court action . Every attempt to secure legal aid to sue the defenders for negligence has been unsuccessful , but legal aid was granted to pursue a judicial review of the ORG 's decision to refuse legal aid .", "It was in DATE that M began his claim . On DATE a legal aid application was lodged on behalf of M , along with a supportive opinion from senior counsel . On CARDINAL and DATE M gave evidence on commission which was subject to cross - examination . On DATE M died , aged DATE , before the cross - examination stage of the commission had been completed .", "On DATE , M 's counsel prepared a note , following the commission , giving his opinion as to the likely success of M 's case which was to be pursued , following his death , by the applicant . In this opinion he referred to and quoted from a letter sent to the legal aid board in GPE by a respected academic on the subject of a causal link between tobacco and cancer . In this opinion counsel stated that there would be medical evidence from the applicant 's General Practitioner , his consultant and a professor . The anti - smoking campaign had also collected good statistics on the matter .", "On DATE the ORG wrote to M 's solicitors ( \u201c the solicitors \u201d ) to confirm that they believed there were difficulties with the subjects of volenti , the value of the claim , the likely cost of the case and liability .", "On DATE the ORG wrote to the solicitors refusing the application . In summary the reasons were as follows :", "CARDINAL . It was not reasonable to grant legal aid .", "CARDINAL . M continued to smoke for DATE after warnings were put on cigarette packets .", "CARDINAL . His DATE consumption of cigarettes actually increased in DATE .", "CARDINAL . M was able to stop in DATE of his life ( once he contracted lung cancer ) .", "CARDINAL . There was wide publicity of the dangers of smoking in DATE and the evidence given by M on commission before his death was at times ' rather vague ' .", "CARDINAL . There were difficult questions of volenti , causation and substantial contributory negligence . The case would be difficult , complex , lengthy and expensive .", "CARDINAL . It would not be reasonable to hazard such a large sum of money on such a limited prospect of successfully gaining any worthwhile return .", "On DATE , the applicant , M 's widow , lodged an appeal against the decision to refuse legal aid . ORG arranged a hearing to deal with the appeal which was attended by the applicant 's solicitor and her senior counsel . On DATE the ORG wrote to the applicant 's solicitors confirming that her appeal was unsuccessful .", "In DATE , the applicant was granted legal aid to proceed in ORG with a judicial review of the ORG 's decision to refuse her appeal . Counsel submitted an opinion in support of the applicant 's case in spite of some unhelpful comments made by M on commission prior to his death . On DATE , Lord PERSON in ORG refused the petition for judicial review but indicated that he may have come to a different decision if the case could have been regarded as a test case .", "On DATE , Lord PERSON ruled against a motion for caution requested by the defenders . He noted that the decision of the ORG to refuse legal aid was based on the criterion of reasonableness and not lack of probable cause . He noted that ORG was entitled , having considered the general assessment of the applicant 's prospects , to consider whether the apparent prospects justified the potential costs to public funds . The defenders claimed they wished to obtain security because of the size of their probable expenses ( MONEY on preliminary preparations alone ) and the applicant 's lack of means . Lord PERSON noted that whatever the intention behind the motion the inevitable effect of its being granted would be that the action would come to an end . The fact that the Board considered the grant of legal aid to be unreasonable from its point of view did not mean it was unreasonable from the court 's point of view that the action should be pursued . Therefore the motion was denied .", "On DATE , the applicant lodged a fresh legal aid application which detailed CARDINAL new reasons why she considered legal aid should be granted namely :", "CARDINAL . The defenders had lodged a motion for caution which in effect asked the applicant to produce MONEY to cover their expenses . Their motion was refused by PERSON whose judgement was sympathetic to the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . The case could now be regarded as a test case or a class action as the applicant 's solicitors had lodged CARDINAL other writs in court and received instructions from CARDINAL other clients with similar claims .", "CARDINAL . Legal aid had been granted to a limited extent in GPE .", "CARDINAL . For the first time a major tobacco company , PERSON , had conceded a case in GPE .", "CARDINAL . A refusal to grant legal aid would amount to a breach of LAW .", "On DATE , the applicant 's solicitors wrote to ORG with CARDINAL further reasons why they considered that legal aid should be granted . Firstly , there had been a recent and very similar case in GPE called PERSON which was successful . Secondly , the arguments used by the applicant were very similar to those used by the plaintiff in the PERSON case . Finally , there was a proposal in GPE for legislation banning any further law suits against tobacco companies if these companies settled all existing actions and made payment towards the medical costs of the smoking related diseases and the costs of anti - smoking campaigns .", "On DATE , ORG wrote to the applicant 's solicitors , confirming that legal aid had been refused . On DATE , following the applicant 's application for an appeal against this decision , ORG arranged a hearing at which the applicant was represented by her solicitor and her senior counsel . On DATE the Board wrote to the applicant 's solicitors confirming the refusal of the appeal . On DATE the applicant applied for legal aid to cover judicial review of the ORG 's decision to refuse her legal aid . This application was refused by the sheriff at GPE on DATE .", "The applicant 's court action is still proceeding as the applicant 's solicitors and counsel are prepared to act for her at present for no fee .", "B.
