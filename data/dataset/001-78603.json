The applicant is a broadcasting company which was established in DATE and is registered in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the applicant company broadcast on CARDINAL frequencies in GPE and had a DATE audience of CARDINAL listeners . The principles underlying its operations were democracy and independence .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time PERSON pois\u0165ov\u0148a a.s . ( \u201c SP \u201d ) was a major insurance company in GPE . It was controlled by the ORG through ORG ( PERSON n\u00e1rodn\u00e9ho majetku \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the DATE parliamentary elections , ORG \u2019s management board was appointed through a political agreement between the coalition parties then in power . The coalition included the ORG for a NORP GPE ( PERSON demokratick\u00e9 DATE \u201c HZDS \u201d ) and ORG ( PERSON n\u00e1rodn\u00e1 strana \u2013 \u201c SNS \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . At that time the majority of seats in the bodies under the ORG \u2019s control were held by ORG appointees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG \u2019s supervisory board removed the individuals appointed by the SNS from the company \u2019s board of directors and appointed a new management team . The outgoing management team did not accept this move .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the former management team took over the ORG headquarters . They were assisted by private security guards and a squad of ORG police , who had been assigned to this task by the President of ORG , an SNS appointee . They forced the newly appointed management team to leave the LOC , but DATE the new management , assisted by their own private security service , regained control of the company and its LOC .", "CARDINAL . The background to this struggle was , essentially , the wish of those involved to participate in ORG \u2019s privatisation . The removal of the ORG management team caused a serious political crisis at government level .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time PERSON was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and PERSON was ORG Secretary at ORG . The posts of ORG Secretaries within ministries were filled through appointments by political parties . They were therefore political posts and did not form part of the civil service .", "CARDINAL . After the events complained of , Mr NORP was elected as a judge to ORG .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant company broadcast the recording of a telephone conversation between PERSON and PERSON in its news programme \u201c ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The broadcast was preceded by comments by the applicant company \u2019s journalist . The names of the persons involved were mentioned in full . The commentary went as follows :", "\u201c As mentioned in TIME programme , we have managed to obtain a tape recording of a telephone conversation which suggests that [ Mr PERSON ] , the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , was involved in the events involving PERSON pois\u0165ov\u0148a a.s . Naturally , ORG disapproves of any wiretapping unless it is done under a court order . We consider [ the present recording ] unlawful and dissociate ourselves from the manner in which it was obtained . But because , in this case , a matter of general interest is involved , one which can not be concealed ... we seek to carry out our duty to inform the public . At the same time , we would like to ask the competent authorities about the security situation in our country , if wiretapping of ... senior officials is possible . The fact that senior officials are involved in activities concerning the above - mentioned case should be considered by those authorised to deal with it . And now to the tape which , due to its technical quality , is almost unintelligible . The other person speaking over the phone is probably [ Mr NORP ] , ORG Secretary at ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Immediately thereafter the recorded conversation between PERSON and PERSON NORP was played . The transcript reads as follows .", "Mr K : \u201c ... the police , with the assistance of the policemen [ and ] some other security guards have entered and seized the building , they have emptied the building ... \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c But this is peculiar , the involvement of the policemen , what could have been the grounds for their action ... \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c Certainly , this was a failure by the security guards , those that were there at that moment , but this was a layman \u2019s approach maybe , because ... It seems the policemen were rather hard according to all the circumstances . You know , the police raid was probably organised through [ Mr H. ] , you know , ORG . Well then , this was all I wanted to say , that there is that ... \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c Will you be chairing the meeting ? \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c Yes , but the boss will arrive to speak on CARDINAL items on the agenda . \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c I see . Otherwise , I have been charged with this task , because he is leaving for PERSON . \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c Good , it is clear , all I wanted to say ... \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c Nobody is going to interfere with my business ... \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c Well , of course not . \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c As he does not even know yet what I am doing ... \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c [ The first name of Mr NORP ] , it would therefore be most important ... \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c I shall go and personally inspect it in the morning , before the meeting starts ... \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c I would like to ask you to do this , as it will emphasise the fact that they have done it ... \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c That \u2019s clear . \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c I had a phone call from there TIME ... \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c Very good , I also need to know this in order to speak about it there . \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c That will be extremely important . \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c All right then , first thing in the morning I shall submit the report about how things are going ... \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c Otherwise , you have to turn to me , this lady I have arranged , simply speaking , it is all organised by me , hence ... \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c Yes , yes . \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c Even if I am not present , I shall later go directly to the government session , but through this [ PERSON ] , they know for sure , actually they are well - oriented on the subject ... \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c I have got my instructions . \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c It is clear , these instructions apply . \u201d", "Mr D : \u201c Well then , see you . \u201d", "Mr K : \u201c [ The first name of Mr NORP ] , thank you very much , see you ... bye ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The subsequent commentary by the journalist , in which the full names of those involved were again mentioned , stated .", "\u201c And let us start to clarify things for a moment . The dealings around PERSON pois\u0165ov\u0148a surfaced in public on DATE . To put it simply : the CARDINAL managers of PERSON pois\u0165ov\u0148a DATE let us call them Mr [ T. ] and Co. \u2013 were pushed out of their building after DATE by a private security service . These security guards had been summoned by the new management team of PERSON pois\u0165ov\u0148a DATE let us call them PERSON [ B. ] and Co. Mr [ T. ] and Co. were supported by the police and , as documented by the taped phone conversation , it is evident that the President of ORG , ORG ] is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of ORG . The former management team , [ T. ] and ORG , seized the building with police assistance and , as has been clear from the start , this was the building of PERSON pois\u0165ov\u0148a . This happened on DATE , and on DATE these managers were again sitting in their chairs . As follows from the taped phone conversation , it is clear that the persons spoke together DATE , DATE , and that the ORG Secretary at ORG , [ Mr NORP ] , was a somewhat easier partner for Minister [ PERSON ] than the Minister of ORG , [ Mr L. ] , who was in PERSON that DATE . We have verified this fact . Just to complete the information , it should be noted that DATE government session was chaired by Mr [ K. ] . Owing to the poor technical quality of the recording of the phone conversation between [ Mr K. ] and [ Mr D. ] , I think it would be worthwhile listening to it once again . \u201d", "...", "\u201c We asked for the opinion of ORG . [ ORG ] , the ORG \u2019s spokesman , ... did not know of the contents of the recording as it had not yet been made public in GPE . Understandably , he did not therefore want to react to it . We expect the response of the Ministry DATE . We also turned to Minister [ PERSON ] , who stated :", "\u2018 Look , I do not comment on things that are contrary to democracy . I think that journalists should perhaps choose a different approach since government officials have been tapped . So I will not comment on something that has been published without my consent . Undoubtedly , this information is about the fact that there has been certain pressure ... in PERSON pois\u0165ov\u0148a.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr NORP filed a civil action against the applicant company in ORG ( Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad ) for protection of his personal integrity .", "He argued that the company had broadcast the telephone conversation despite the fact that it had been obtained in an illegal manner . The broadcast had interfered with his personal integrity by harming his reputation , dignity and respect for his person among the public . In addition , the statements broadcast included distorted and incomplete information that was capable of discrediting him .", "The plaintiff also referred to the fact that the information had subsequently been picked up by the NORP TV station ORG , and that several articles had been published in the NORP dailies ORG , ORG and PERSON republika . As a result , the trust between the Minister of ORG and the plaintiff had been undermined .", "He acknowledged that , at the time that the recording was made , he had spoken with several persons and admitted that it was his voice on the recording . The recording and the comments as such had been taken out of context , and the telephone conversation had not been broadcast in its entirety . The plaintiff denied that the subject of the conversation had been the events as presented by the commentator , since his position did not authorise him to intervene in the case as suggested in the broadcast .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its observations in reply , the applicant company stated that the recording of the conversation had been deposited in its mailbox by unknown persons . Speculation about such a recording had been circulating in DATE prior to the broadcast , and as a result the coalition government had been threatened with a split . Prior to the broadcast the applicant company \u2019s employees had tried to contact the persons concerned , in accordance with the company \u2019s internal rules . Although the tape was almost unintelligible , as an information medium the applicant company had felt obliged to inform the public and to demonstrate what was going on in political circles at that time . In his commentary on the material broadcast , the journalist had stated that the applicant company disapproved of the manner in which the recording had been obtained .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the parties and CARDINAL witnesses and examined a transcript of the impugned broadcast and other documentary evidence .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE , ORG ordered the applicant company to offer the plaintiff a written apology and to broadcast that apology within DATE . It was to read as follows :", "\u201c We apologise to [ Mr NORP ] , the former ORG Secretary at ORG of GPE , now judge of ORG of GPE , for having broadcast an unlawfully obtained recording of a telephone conversation on DATE at TIME \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company was further ordered to pay CARDINAL NORP korunas to Mr NORP in compensation for non - pecuniary damage , and to reimburse his legal costs .", "CARDINAL . The ORG based its judgment , inter alia , on the following grounds . The applicant , as a licensed radio broadcasting company , had the right to use audio recordings for scientific and artistic purposes and for news reporting without a person \u2019s previous consent . However , under the last sentence of LAW of LAW , such use should not conflict with the justified interest of the person concerned . The applicant company had not been prevented from commenting on the situation which had arisen and from presenting its views . In order to do so , however , it had not been necessary to broadcast a tape obtained in an illegal manner .", "ORG further noted that the plaintiff \u2019s dignity as a public official had been diminished as the issue had been commented on in the press and on television . It therefore considered it appropriate to order the applicant company to compensate the plaintiff in respect of non - pecuniary damage under paragraph CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed . It maintained that the LAW did not subject the use of recordings to the prior establishment of their lawfulness and that it had not been formally shown that the recording had been unlawfully obtained . The plaintiff was a public official and the contents of the recording concerned the exercise of a public function . The recording had been discussed for DATE prior to being broadcast . By broadcasting the telephone conversation , the applicant company had fulfilled its task of informing the public about issues of public interest . Finally , the applicant pointed out that the plaintiff had become a constitutional judge in the meantime , and that it had not been shown that he had suffered any damage as a result of the broadcast .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Krajsk\u00fd s\u00fad ) upheld the judgment of ORG . ORG admitted that imparting of information by the media was an important instrument for supervising political power in a NORP society . Informing on and criticising matters of public interest were among the media \u2019s most important tasks , and constitutional protection of such interests was ensured by the guarantees of freedom of expression and of the right to information . However , in the case under consideration the freedom of communication of users of telecommunications services had been violated , and an interference with the right to respect for privacy had occurred as a result of publicly broadcasting the telephone conversation . That fact was at the heart of the applicant company \u2019s unjustified interference with the plaintiff \u2019s personal rights since , as ORG held , protection of privacy extended to the conversations of public officials .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides for protection of a person \u2019s integrity and privacy . Restrictions are permissible only in cases provided for by law .", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW , as in force at the relevant time , ORG authorities and local self - government authorities were obliged to provide information about their activities in an appropriate manner . Further details in this respect were to be laid down in a special law .", "CARDINAL .
