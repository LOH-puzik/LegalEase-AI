The applicant , who was born in DATE , is a farmer and the head of a farming company , A. He lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG . , the newly - appointed head of a private agricultural company , NORP , requested that the law - enforcement authorities investigate the suspected misappropriation of NORP \u2019s property . In particular , PERSON . stated that in DATE , PERSON , another agricultural company , had written off a debt of CARDINAL NORP hryvnyas ( ORG ) owed to his company , although the latter had not received any payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , interviewed in connection with the inquiry into the case , informed the police that in the autumn of DATE he had received QUANTITY concrete slabs from GPE in settlement of a debt to NORP , of which he was a shareholder . The applicant said he had used the slabs to construct a trench for A. , to which NORP had also owed money . NORP \u2019s former director had been aware of that fact . The transaction had not been finalised on the books as there had been disagreements between the parties over the price of the slabs and on various procedural issues .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Borznyanskiy district prosecutor ( the \u201c district prosecutor \u201d ) instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of fraudulently appropriating slabs that he had received on NORP \u2019s behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a police investigator called the applicant in for questioning as a witness in connection with the case , but rejected his request to be assisted by a lawyer during the questioning . According to the applicant , his lawyer had accompanied him to the investigator \u2019s office but had not been allowed to be present during the questioning .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the questioning the applicant again admitted to receiving the slabs and using them on his farm . He also explained that the transaction had not been finalised in the accounts because the parties had had debts to each other and had still been negotiating over how to write those debts off . In any event , the directors of PERSON and NORP had been well aware that the applicant had used the slabs on his own farm and had never objected to that use . As can be seen from the copy of the record of the questioning submitted to the ORG , it was apparently filed as pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL in the domestic case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was officially indicted for the fraudulent appropriation of CARDINAL concrete slabs transferred by the PERSON company to the NORP company in payment of a debt . On DATE , the applicant was questioned as a defendant in the presence of his lawyer but he refused to testify and relied on his right to silence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed of the completion of the pre - trial investigation and committed to stand trial in ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant presented the authorities with an agreement dated DATE and signed by the directors of PERSON , NORP and himself . According to that document , the CARDINAL parties had agreed that the value of the CARDINAL slabs received by the applicant was UAH CARDINAL and that the transfer of the slabs to the applicant covered the relevant portion of PERSON \u2019s debt to NORP and NORP \u2019s debt to the applicant \u2019s farm .", "CARDINAL . By DATE the above agreement had been reflected in all CARDINAL parties\u2019 documents relating to accounting , tax and other matters .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the trial , ORG questioned the applicant and numerous other individuals , including the directors and accountants of NORP and PERSON , and examined various documents . As can be seen in TIME of the court hearings submitted by the Government , the documents examined in the course of the trial included \u201c a letter from the farming company \u201d , included as page CARDINAL in the domestic case file .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , the applicant , represented by a lawyer of his own choice , reiterated that he had had no fraudulent intent in taking possession of the slabs and that the CARDINAL parties had decided on all the details of the transaction in DATE ( that is , before the criminal proceedings had been instituted against him ) . The transaction had also been properly accounted for in all the paperwork by DATE ( that is , before the trial had commenced ) . The delay in finalising the papers had been due to various objective circumstances , including initial disagreements between the parties concerning the scope of the transaction and a fair price for the slabs , the replacement of NORP \u2019s director in DATE , and a lengthy break in the functioning of NORP \u2019s accounts office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of the charges . It found that although the case had eventually been settled , there was sufficient evidence that the applicant \u2019s initial intent had been fraudulent . In justifying that finding , the court noted , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c As regards the arguments by the defendant ORG that ... the CARDINAL - party agreement had been concluded ... before the initiation of the criminal case , and that the managers of the CARDINAL entities had agreed on the price and procedure for the transfer of the concrete slabs , the court can not accept them , as they contradict the case file materials and the evidence examined in court . It appears from the case file materials that the above - mentioned agreement was submitted by ORG at the end of the pre - trial investigation . It can be seen from the testimony of the witnesses ... that [ ORG \u2019s debt to NORP ] , amounting to ORG CARDINAL , had been reinstated after having been written off ... According to ... order no . CARDINAL of DATE the slabs transferred were valued at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and [ K. \u2019s ] debt to NORP as of DATE remained at UAH CARDINAL .", "The aforementioned evidence shows that an understanding between the managers of [ K. ] , [ NORP ] and [ A. ] concerning the price and procedure for the transfer was reached after the criminal case had been instituted , in the course of the pre - trial investigation . These findings correspond to the declarations by the head of the farming company ORG contained on pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL of volume CARDINAL of the case , dated DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG then granted the applicant an amnesty and released him from any punishment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court issued a separate ruling ( \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 ) in which it drew the attention of the district prosecutor to various procedural shortcomings in the preparation of the case for trial . It noted , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c On DATE the [ district prosecutor ] initiated criminal proceedings against [ the applicant ] . On DATE the [ police investigator ] ... questioned [ the applicant ] as a witness , despite ... sufficient evidence ... for him to be questioned as a defendant , in compliance with all the requirements of LAW of GPE ...", "With regard to the said breaches , the testimony [ of the applicant ] given ... during his questioning as a witness on DATE was not taken into account by the court as evidence in the present case .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears from the case - file materials that on an unspecified date the applicant filed an appeal against his conviction , which was accepted for examination . No copy of this appeal has been provided to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE lawyer PERSON also filed a separate appeal in the applicant \u2019s interests . In this appeal he challenged , primarily , the substantive conclusions of the trial court and contended that the applicant \u2019s actions had not been criminal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction . Referring to statements by various witnesses and the documentary evidence on file , it concluded that the applicant had not made any reasonable and meaningful efforts to regularise his appropriation of the slabs until the criminal proceedings had been instituted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal , in which he complained , in particular , that his right to mount a defence had been breached on account of his being questioned without a lawyer on DATE . He argued that it was clear from the phrase , \u201c These findings correspond to the declarations by the head of the farming company ORG contained on pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL of volume CARDINAL of the case , dated DATE \u201d in ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , that the testimony he had given on DATE had in fact been relied on for his conviction , in spite of ORG formal decision to exclude the record of that questioning from the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE examined submissions by the applicant , in the absence of both the applicant and his lawyer . However , the prosecutor was present and advised the ORG to reject the applicant \u2019s arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal , finding that the lower courts had correctly assessed the facts and applied the law . Without addressing directly the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the breach of his right to defence , it made the following general remark concerning the procedural fairness of the proceedings :", "\u201c ... no breaches of the provisions of the criminal - procedure law in the course of pre - trial investigation as well as during the court proceedings can be identified \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A copy of ORG ruling of DATE was sent to the applicant by post on CARDINAL DATE and , according to him , was received on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At various times the applicant made unsuccessful attempts to institute criminal proceedings against the investigator who had questioned him on DATE , and to begin administrative and civil proceedings to challenge various purported procedural omissions on the part of ORG judge in his case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
