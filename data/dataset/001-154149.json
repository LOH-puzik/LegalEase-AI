The court based its decision on section QUANTITY of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In its reasoning the court took into account the statements of the applicants and the prison guards , medical findings , the video - recording , the fact that the CARDINAL prison guards had been found responsible in disciplinary proceedings for the disproportionate use of force and had been fined , and the fact that the applicants had offered resistance , thus contributing to the non - pecuniary damage . The court found that the guards had exceeded their powers but also explicitly held that such actions could not be qualified as torture or inhuman or degrading treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld this judgment . In so doing it did not disagree with the conclusion of the first - instance court as to the qualification of the impugned incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly overturned the previous decisions by awarding the applicants CARDINAL ORG each for non - pecuniary damage , together with the statutory interest .
