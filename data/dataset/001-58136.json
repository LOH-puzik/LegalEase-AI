The Deputy Minister refused to grant suspensive effect to Mr ORG \u2019s application for revision of his decision . In order to obtain an injunction against his expulsion pending the revision proceedings , the applicant instigated summary injunction proceedings ( kort geding ) before the President of ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE sitting at \u2019s - Hertogenbosch ( nevenzittingsplaats \u2019s - Hertogenbosch ) .", "CARDINAL .

At the hearing of the applicant \u2019s objection , which took place on DATE , the applicant argued that it had not been possible to submit his grounds of appeal before DATE since it had been necessary , given that the Deputy Minister of ORG had disputed the authenticity of documents submitted by him , to try and obtain further proof of his allegations from GPE and that this had taken a long time .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection on DATE , on the grounds that he had been given ample opportunity to submit his grounds of appeal , that he had been informed of the possible consequences of failure to do so and that , even if he considered it impossible to cure that failing in time , he ought to have submitted a request for an extension of the time - limit before it lapsed .", "CARDINAL .
