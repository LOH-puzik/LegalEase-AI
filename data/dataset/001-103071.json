As the applicant wished to avail himself of the opportunities created by the LAW , he asked ORG to issue him a certificate concerning his detention . He intended to use it as proof that he had been subjected to repression within the meaning of the LAW and was thus entitled to compensation . On DATE the ORG issued a certificate which said that the applicant had been detained \u201c for criminal reasons \u201d on the basis of \u201c order no . CARDINAL \u201d .

The letter further advised the applicant that , if unsatisfied by that reply , he could clear his name through the courts .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought proceedings against ORG and ORG of the Interior , seeking a declaration that his detention in DATE had been repression due to his origin and political views .

On an appeal by ORG of the Interior , on DATE ORG ( \u041f\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u043a\u0440\u044a\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434 ) set that decision aside , holding that the applicant was trying to establish a legally relevant fact , which , according to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , was possible only if specifically provided by law , which was not the case . The applicant could instead assert his rights under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant \u2019s ensuing appeal was rejected by ORG ( NORP \u0441\u044a\u0434 ) on DATE ( \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , ORG , GPE \u0433. \u043e. ) . The court noted that neither the DATE Act nor any other statute made provision for the judicial establishment of the fact of repression , as required under LAW DATE Code . That was indeed a legally relevant fact , but it could be established in special administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again asked ORG to issue him a certificate concerning his detention . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG \u2019s archive department informed him that , according to their records , the reasons why the authorities had ordered his detention in DATE were that he had been \u201c rap[ing ] women by threatening them with murder [ and ] talk[ing ] openly against the Fatherland Front \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant once again brought proceedings against ORG and ORG of the Interior , seeking declarations ( a ) that the order for his detention was incorrect inasmuch as it relied on criminal grounds and ( b ) that the official of ORG who had drawn up the order had recorded a false statement of fact in order to provide justification for the detention . In a bench ruling of CARDINAL DATE the ORG discontinued the examination of the second claim , holding that a ruling that an official of ORG had made a false document would not protect the applicant \u2019s right to good reputation and honour . The first claim , which aimed to establish that the order had been incorrect , also made it superfluous to make findings in respect of the individual who had drawn it up . The applicant did not appeal against that ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG discontinued the proceedings , finding that the applicant \u2019s first claim was inadmissible as well . It held , by reference to the established caselaw of ORG under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , that the existence of a concrete legal interest in pursuing the claim was a mandatory prerequisite for its examination . Therefore , the applicant had to show that a judicial declaration that the detention order was incorrect would have an impact on his relations with the defendant and that there was no other procedure to establish such incorrectness . The order had not been a document purporting to certify the reasons for which the applicant had been detained or to establish that the events it mentioned \u2013 \u201c rapes women by threatening them with murder \u201d \u2013 had indeed occurred , but to compel the applicant to endure a sanction . Therefore , the only thing that it proved was that the applicant had been detained on such grounds . The applicant \u2019s criminal record , which was the only legal means of establishing conviction for criminal conduct , was clean . There was therefore no dispute between the applicant and the defendants about whether he had engaged in criminal conduct . In so far as the applicant claimed that the content of the detention order had prevented him from obtaining compensation under LAW , he could have recourse to the special procedure under that LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing , inter alia , that , in as much as it mentioned the grounds for his detention , the order was purporting to certify a fact .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It conceded that the reasons for the detention order certified a fact . However , the order referred to a letter by the head of the GPE militia , and that was the only thing which it certified . Therefore , a declaration that the order was incorrect would be of no benefit to the applicant , because that letter would still prevent him from obtaining compensation under LAW . The court went on to say that a judicial declaration that the official who had drawn up the order had recorded a false statement of fact would have no direct effect on the applicant \u2019s legal sphere .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing , inter alia , that his legal interest in obtaining a declaration that the detention order was incorrect was based on his right , enshrined in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW , to protect his private life against false and defamatory information .

It held that the detention order could not presently be challenged as to the authenticity of its reasoning . Such a challenge had been possible only at the time when the order had been made , by appealing against the sanction that it had imposed . Inasmuch as the applicant sought to nullify the order \u2019s effects , he could do so in the manner prescribed by LAW . That was the proper way of vindicating his reputation and honour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the social security services supplement his pension on the basis of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine below ) .
