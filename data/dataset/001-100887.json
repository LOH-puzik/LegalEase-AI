NORP In particular , on DATE ORG examined a situation where a legal - aid lawyer had refused to represent a convicted person for the purposes of cassation proceedings , finding that a cassation appeal would offer no prospects of success . It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the timelimit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer 's refusal and not on DATE when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself . It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with a legal - aid lawyer 's refusal had the right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for effective lodging of a cassation appeal ( III KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG reiterated its position in a decision of DATE and in a number of similar decisions given in DATE . It observed that there had been certain discrepancies in the judicial practice as to the manner in which the time - limit in such situations was calculated , but the strand of the case - law launched by the decision given in DATE was both dominant and correct , and also accepted by doctrine as providing to defendants adequate procedural guarantees of access to ORG within a reasonable time frame ( II KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that the refusal of a legal - aid lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal did not constitute a valid ground for granting retrospective leave to lodge such an appeal by another lawyer out of time ( V ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of DATE . ORG observed that the court could only assign a new legal - aid lawyer to the case if it were shown that the first lawyer had been negligent in his or her task of assessing whether a cassation appeal had any prospects of success . If this were not the case , a court was not obliged to assign a new legal - aid lawyer to represent the convicted person and its refusal was not subject to appeal ( III KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG reiterated its position in a number of other decisions ( e.g. II KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
