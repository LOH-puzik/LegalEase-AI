{"ITEMID": "001-22752", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NOR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "JOHANSEN v. NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in Skive , GPE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The present proceedings concern essentially the NORP authorities\u2019 decision on DATE to authorise , without the applicant \u2019s consent , the adoption of her daughter PERSON by her foster parents and their refusal to grant the applicant a right to regular access . They are a sequel to the case which the ORG decided in its judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions PERSON ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c PERSON I \u201d ) . That case concerned in the main the compulsory taking into care by the NORP authorities of the applicant \u2019s daughter PERSON shortly after her birth in DATE , their subsequent refusal to terminate the care order and the deprivation of the mother \u2019s parental rights and access . In its judgment the ORG held , inter alia , unanimously that neither the care order nor the fact that it remained effective gave rise to a breach of LAW ; and by CARDINAL votes to one that the local ORG R\u00f8a \u2019s ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) decision of CARDINAL DATE , in so far as it deprived the applicant of her access and parental rights in respect of her daughter , constituted a violation of LAW . As regards the case now under consideration it is important to note that the finding of a violation was confined to that decision and that the ORG did not express an opinion on the question of PERSON \u2019s adoption by her foster parents , which had not yet been decided by the national authorities .", "For the background to this case the ORG refers firstly to Part I of PERSON I ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "Pending the outcome of the aforementioned proceedings before ORG in the PERSON I case , GPE ( fylkesmannen ) of GPE and ORG suspended the processing of an application for the adoption of S. that had been made by her foster parents on DATE .", "Following the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was informed in DATE that the adoption proceedings would resume . A psychologist , PERSON , was commissioned to carry out an investigation . On the basis of her report of DATE , a request for authorisation to adopt was submitted to ORG ( fylkesnemndea- hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The matter was discussed in DATE and again in DATE , before a differently composed ORG . Before the ORG the applicant recognised that PERSON was in a good foster home and that would grow up there but opposed adoption . She said that she wished to have contact with her daughter and feared that , in the event of adoption , the decision would be left to the foster parents . She was not confident that they would allow her the necessary contact and so requested access .", "On DATE ORG decided to authorise adoption of the child by her foster parents . It found no reason to take any decision on the applicant \u2019s access to S. until after the adoption , which was to be arranged as soon as possible .", "Under section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( lov om barneverntjenester ) , where a child had been taken into compulsory care and where the parents had been deprived of their parental responsibilities for it , ORG was empowered to authorise adoption if ( CARDINAL ) it was likely that the parents would be permanently unable to provide suitable care or ( CARDINAL ) the child had become so attached to persons and his or her environment that serious difficulties would result if he or she were to be removed , provided that adoption was in the child \u2019s best interests and the foster parents had shown that they were able to raise the child as their own .", "In the absence of an updated assessment of the applicant \u2019s suitability as a carer , ORG proceeded on the assumption that she was not permanently unable to provide care . It focused its consideration of the adoption issue on the criterion mentioned under item ( CARDINAL ) above , that is to say whether PERSON \u2019s attachment to persons in her current environment meant that her removal would lead to serious difficulties for her .", "ORG was satisfied that the foster parents were clearly suitable as carers for S. It emphasised that PERSON , who was then DATE , had lived in the foster home practically all her life . She was old enough to be fully conscious of her foster parents being her only parents and of her own growth ; which suggested that she should live with the foster parents until she reached maturity . While there were no social ties between PERSON and the applicant , there were clear ties between her and the foster parents whom she perceived as her psychological parents . If she were to leave the foster home , it was most uncertain that she would be able to establish basic ties with new carers , as such ties normally developed before DATE . Removing her from the foster home was likely to entail serious difficulties for her , with an acute separation crisis , and traumatic despair and insecurity . Thus ORG considered that the second ground for adoption was fulfilled and the applicant did not dispute that . Nor did she request that PERSON be returned to her . What she did not seem to accept was the definitive character of an adoption , which suggested that she might wish to seek to be reunited with the child later .", "Adoption would moreover be in PERSON \u2019s best interests . S did not consider herself a foster child and thus had a very strong attachment to her foster parents . However , the fact that she had not yet been adopted seemed to have caused a feeling of insecurity , both on her own part and on the part of the foster parents . As pointed out by the experts , the need for security was a weighty argument for preferring adoption to continued foster care . A lifelong attachment to her foster family would offer a number of advantages to S. later in life .", "ORG did not reject the applicant \u2019s wish to have access . It emphasised that the child would soon need to become familiar with and have contact with her biological mother . This was a process that needed to take place over time but should start immediately . For the time being it was not advisable to arrange for regular access . The experience of the first contact would necessarily be an important guide for determining how access should be arranged in the future . While S. would probably enjoy having contact with her biological mother and CARDINAL - siblings , that contact could in no way compensate for a loss of a sense of belonging to the foster family . ORG was confident that the foster parents would exercise appropriate discretion in facilitating access once the child was ready to meet the applicant and would seek the assistance of the child care authorities . Adoption clearly was in the child \u2019s best interests , which outweighed the mother \u2019s interest in enjoying a right of access .", "On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG ( byrett ) , requesting it to set aside ORG administrative decision as being unlawful . On DATE the County Governor authorised adoption but the matter was subsequently suspended pending the outcome of the judicial proceedings .", "The first meeting between PERSON and the applicant took place on DATE . During the meeting , the applicant did not call S. by her current NORP name but by the name she had given her at birth . The applicant told her that her brothers and sisters missed her and asked her to come to live with them in GPE . She gave PERSON a letter from her younger brothers and sisters in which they also asked her to come to live with them and which enclosed CARDINAL of a piece of jewellery that would be joined together with CARDINAL and hung up on the wall when she came home to her mother in GPE .", "Later the foster parents noted that S. experienced nightmares in which she dreamed of losing her mummy and daddy ( the foster parents ) . She frequently complained of headaches , which she had not done previously .", "In DATE S. \u2019s feelings of insecurity were reinforced when the applicant was observed in the company of another person near ORG school and home asking pupils at the school if they knew where she was . The applicant had also rung the doorbell of NORP foster father \u2019s house , but no one had been at home . The applicant had been observed by a neighbour who had recognised her from a television interview she had given DATE before in connection with questions that had been put in relation to the case during question time in the ORG ( ORG ) . Following that incident , PERSON had said that she was frightened that the applicant might come and take her away . During the school breaks she no longer dared to be outside . She refused to go to bed at TIME unless one of her foster parents sat with her , she had frequent nightmares and was afraid of falling asleep .", "During DATE , PERSON expressed the wish to meet her younger CARDINAL - siblings and her older CARDINAL - brother , D , on her mother \u2019s side . She was particularly interested in meeting NORP , but did not wish to meet her biological mother again . The meeting took place on DATE . D was not present . S. was not told beforehand that he would be absent , but the meeting with the CARDINAL - siblings was held nevertheless . S. accepted the applicant \u2019s presence on condition that a psychologist of the child care services , PERSON , accompanied her . The meeting itself took place at a preventive centre , \u201c ORG \u201d and went well , except that PERSON was still called by her former name and the CARDINAL - siblings persisted in asking her to come to their home in GPE .", "TVCARDINAL had secretly filmed the children outside afterwards , having been informed of the event by a person acting on behalf of the applicant . S. had not been aware of this and was very upset when the recording was shown on television that TIME .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG : ( CARDINAL ) upheld ORG decision of DATE to authorise adoption and to refuse access pending a final decision on adoption ; ( CARDINAL ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests for a declaratory judgment ( fastsettelsesdom ) that she had parental responsibility for PERSON and rights of access , for an order restoring parental responsibility and care to her and for the case to be transferred to another child welfare office .", "By a further decision of DATE ORG also dismissed a petition by the applicant for a provisional grant of access and for a stay of execution of ORG decision of DATE .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against the above judgment and decision to ORG . On DATE it dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG dismissal of her claims under item ( CARDINAL ) above , but allowed the remainder of the appeal to be heard , including the issue whether the applicant should have access in the event that adoption was refused .", "Subsequently , the applicant brought various proceedings , notably before ORG on DATE claiming that the parental responsibilities for S. were vested in her and that she was entitled to access . On DATE ORG dismissed the latter application but agreed to hear the former . In addition , the applicant made an unsuccessful attempt to discontinue the appeal proceedings before ORG .", "In the appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE ORG , sitting with CARDINAL professional judges , CARDINAL expert lay judges and CARDINAL other lay judges , held an oral hearing CARDINAL September CARDINAL . The applicant and PERSON \u2019s father , who were both represented by counsel , were heard , as were the social authorities . A senior child - welfare officer , PERSON , appeared as an expert witness . CARDINAL other witnesses were heard and documentary evidence was adduced , including a revised report by the psychologist PERSON of DATE . In a separate room the judges took a statement from PERSON record was made available to the parties .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG upheld by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL ORG judgment regarding adoption and unanimously decided not to take any decision on access pending a final decision on adoption .", "ORG first interpreted the ORG \u2019s PERSON I judgment and noted that the finding of violation concerned only the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE to deprive the applicant of access and parental responsibilities and did not encompass subsequent decisions by the national authorities on the subject . ORG proceeded on the assumption that the deprivation of parental responsibilities was lawful .", "It then went on to examine whether the other conditions for adoption under section CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW were fulfilled , pointing out that the assessment ought to be based on the situation obtaining at the time of the judgment and what would be in the child \u2019s best interests in the long run . In that regard , ORG , supported by expert evidence , made inter alia the following observations :", "\u201c It is not disputed that as at DATE [ the applicant ] is capable of caring for her child . Consent to adoption may however be granted if consideration of the best interests of the child so indicates .", "S. is DATE . For DATE she has lived with her foster parents . She is naturally strongly attached to them and to their family , and is fond of them . S. regards the foster parents as her parents and there can be no doubt that they are her psychological parents . PERSON states clearly that she wishes to continue living with her parents . ORG considers it completely inappropriate to move PERSON to [ the applicant ] against S. \u2019s will . [ The applicant ] also seems to accept this . ORG also finds it extremely unlikely that PERSON would wish to move from her foster parents to GPE before she reaches the age of majority . The child \u2019s attachment to her foster parents , their family and the environment she knows in GPE is too strong for that , in addition to which she currently has feelings of antagonism against her biological mother . On the basis of the extensive evidence that has been presented , ORG is in no doubt that these are PERSON \u2019s own feelings and that she has not been influenced to feel this way . ...", "The High Court finds no reason to doubt that S. \u2019s foster parents have proved well suitable to bring up S. as their own child . On the basis of the case documents and testimonies from , among others , the child welfare authorities and the expert witnesses who have had contact with the foster parents , ORG is confident that the foster parents have provided PERSON with a secure and caring upbringing . This impression was strengthened through the examination of the foster parents in court and through the ORG \u2019s conversation with S.", "The foster parents have lived in separate houses since DATE . ORG finds that they are still in frequent contact with each other , and that they see each other several times a week . The ORG finds furthermore that they sometimes stay TIME in each others\u2019 homes , have contact with each others\u2019 families and spend DATE and DATE excursions together . They both say that they are fond of each other but that , partly owing to the strain that the case has been for them , have felt a need to be alone . They are unsure about the future . They report that they have attempted to make permanent arrangement as to where PERSON is to live , but have gradually abandoned such arrangements . S. now moves freely between the houses and stays TIME where it is most convenient for everyone . Neither the foster parents nor PERSON have said that this gives rise to any problems .", "A rupture between parents usually creates problems for the children . However , the amount of strain involved is usually dependent on how the parents handle the situation in relation to the children and on whether there is a high level of conflict between the parents . ... S. reacted negatively to the situation at first . ... However , as a result of the way the parents tackled the problems and the apparent lack of conflict , as well as the close contact that the parents still have between themselves and together with PERSON , she seems no longer to regard this as a major problem DATE . She hopes , naturally enough , that the foster parents will move together again , which she demonstrates , for example , by insisting on moving out of her mother \u2019s room and leaving the double bed to her father when he stays TIME there . ORG finds that PERSON does not currently regard the fact that the parents live apart as a major problem , but that it is an arrangement she would prefer to be otherwise .", "In the assessment of ORG , the way the foster parents have tackled the care of S. in the situation to date indicates that they would also be suitable to bring up S. in the future , even if they should decide for a permanent separation possibly involving new partners .", "The foster parents are not separated . The High Court finds it to be clear that the foster parents , in the sense intended by LAW , are to be regarded as a married couple . Their formal relationship should thus , pursuant to LAW , not preclude their joint adoption of S ....", "By means of its brief conversation with PERSON , ORG has received confirmation of the impression given by the remaining evidence in the case of a girl who , during DATE or CARDINAL , has developed considerable personal problems . She expresses insecurity and fear , and begs to be listened to . She wishes to be a normal girl . She wants no more court cases . She wants to continue living with her foster parents and feels encroached upon by [ the applicant ] and her children . S. has no clear understanding of what adoption really entails . When she has stated that this is what she wants , in the High Court \u2019s assessment , this is an expression of her perception of adoption as an arrangement that would ensure that she be allowed to continue living with her foster parents without needing to fear that [ the applicant ] can demand that she move to GPE . She perceives adoption as a guarantee of peace and quiet , allowing her once to live like a normal child .", "The High Court finds that it is S. \u2019s relationship to her biological mother and the judicial proceedings which are the cause of her problems DATE . The emergence of [ the applicant ] has given S. a feeling of insecurity that she has difficulty in tackling . S. was at first curious to meet her biological mother . For some time , she had accustomed herself to the idea that her foster mother was not her biological mother . This process seems to have been supported and encouraged in a constructive way . The foster parents knew that this situation would arise and had already made contact with specialists to obtain advice about how best to handle it . Naturally enough , PERSON was motivated by her interest and curiosity to see the mother who had given birth to her . In the view of ORG , PERSON had no idea that this meeting might manifest itself as a threat to the life she lived with the people she regarded as her parents and their family , her home , school , friends , etc ....", "The [ first ] meeting [ held on DATE ] must have been difficult for both parties , and [ the applicant ] \u2019s actions can be explained by the loss she had felt for DATE and by the fact that she had been informed TIME before the meeting that the daughter [ bore a different NORP name ] . However , the ORG is in no doubt that the meeting was unfavourable for the relations between mother and daughter . PERSON was unprepared for the discovery that her mother did not want her to continue living with the foster parents and that she was apparently not accepted as ORG does not find it difficult to understand that PERSON was polite to [ the applicant ] during the meeting and said that she would like to visit her in GPE . The girl was DATE . She was alone with her mother for the first time and , in this situation , would hardly want to hurt her mother \u2019s feelings or oppose her directly .", "[ The applicant ] has explained that , in her struggle for her daughter , she has been obliged to use all means at her disposal , including the media , to promote her case . This may explain her way of acting but , in the view of ORG , also shows her lack of ability or willingness to understand that the media coverage had a negative and stressing effect on PERSON , who was recognised by fellow - pupils , neighbours etc . , and who was reminded of what she experiences as an insecure situation . The media coverage was the main reason why PERSON changed schools in DATE . Thus , [ the applicant ] \u2019s struggle for what she regards as fair treatment has caused S. to suffer . [ The applicant ] fails to acknowledge that S. reacts negatively to this .", "[ The applicant ] has clearly stated that her aim is that S. shall come to live with her in GPE and has demonstrated that she intends to employ all procedural means available in order to achieve this . In ORG assessment , PERSON will be the loser in this process . She feels that her whole identity and existence are threatened and challenged , which makes her frightened , unhappy and insecure . S. is DATE and is entering puberty . ORG is convinced that she will suffer if the proceedings around her and [ the applicant \u2019s ] struggle to get her back with her to GPE do not end .", "In the further assessment , ORG is divided into a majority [ all CARDINAL professional judges , both expert lay members and CARDINAL lay member ] and a minority [ CARDINAL lay member ] .", "The majority [ CARDINAL to CARDINAL ] holds the view that new actions must be expected from [ the applicant ] unless adoption is authorised . A typical example is the civil action that has now been brought before ORG in which [ the applicant ] claimed that she holds parental responsibility . In addition , claims for access , etc . must be expected . Consent to adoption will put a stop to this development . Orderly conditions can only be achieved by allowing the foster parents to adopt S. The legal proceedings for ORG return will then be discontinued ...", "The majority holds furthermore the view that adoption would best ensure continued contact between PERSON and [ the applicant ] and her CARDINAL - siblings . The foster parents have stated that they regard it as important for S. that such contact be maintained and developed . However , their condition is that it should take places on LOC \u2019s own terms . The majority perceives that the foster parents sincerely mean this , and that they feel it is in PERSON \u2019s best interests to have such contact . They have themselves expressed the view that any hindrance to contact them would have a negative effect on S. \u2019s relations with them in the long term . As an adoptive child , PERSON will have nothing to fear from [ the applicant ] . She will then know that it has been decided that she shall live with her adoptive parents , and that [ the applicant ] can not do anything about it . The majority of the High Court regards it as natural and probable that PERSON , within this framework , will gradually come to want more contact with her family in GPE . If , on the other hand , consent to adoption is not granted , S. would continue to regard [ the applicant ] as a threat to her own existence and life situation and would be unwilling to have further contact with her . ...", "On the basis of an overall assessment , the majority of ORG considers that it will clearly be better for PERSON to be adopted by her foster parents than to grow up as a foster child .", "On the basis of the majority \u2019s assessment , ORG judgment , in so far as it applies to consent to adoption , is upheld .", "Affirmation of ORG judgment entails that the High Court shall not decide on access .", "A unanimous ORG holds the view that access should not be decided until a legally enforceable judgment has been passed . S. does not wish access arrangements to be made with [ the applicant ] at present . She has major problems and needs to be left in peace . In the assessment of ORG , forced access with [ the applicant ] in such an interim period would have a disturbing effect on PERSON and reinforce the insecurity she feels as a result of the court cases . Access during the period until a legally enforceable judgment is passed is thus not regarded as being in PERSON \u2019s best interests . \u201d", "The applicant sought to appeal against the above judgment to ORG , requesting a declaration that ORG decision of DATE was null and void and an order granting her regular access . On DATE ORG of ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal , holding that the appeal manifestly had no prospects of success ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
