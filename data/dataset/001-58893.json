Investigations concerning the applicant 's suspected involvement in illicit foreign adoptions began on an unspecified date in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant with trading in children and incitement to give false testimony . On DATE ORG remanded the applicant in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with written grounds for the decision of DATE", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision . He argued , inter alia , that the acts which he had been charged with committing could not possibly amount to the crime of trading in children . He further argued that in view of the fact that a significant number of witnesses had already been questioned by the prosecuting authorities , there was no likelihood that his remaining at liberty would in any manner jeopardise progress in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the appeals against the detention order lodged with the court by the applicant and by his lawyers , PERSON and PERSON The applicant was not present , whereas the public prosecutor , Ms I.K .- B. , attended the court session . The court allowed the lawyers to make oral interventions and then ordered them to leave the courtroom . Subsequently , the prosecutor addressed the court , arguing that the detention should be upheld . She argued that the legal qualification of the offence concerned was correct , relying on LAW .", "CARDINAL . By decision of the same date , the court dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the decision to remand him in custody . It first acknowledged that the case was without precedent and raised difficult questions of fact and law . The court stated that in examining the decision under appeal , it had limited itself to assessing , from the point of view of provisions governing ordering and maintenance of detention on remand , in particular LAW , the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence gathered against the applicant for ordering detention on remand . However , it stressed that it had refrained from examining closely the substantive - law issues involved in the case . The court further categorically observed that the evidence gathered so far did not justify a suspicion that the applicant had tried to exert undue pressure on policemen involved in the proceedings . However , the evidence in the case file did support a reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence punishable under LAW of the transitional provisions of LAW , which covered abduction of and trading in children for any purpose and in any form , including , in the court 's opinion , situations in which offenders were motivated solely by profit . The court further considered that this provision should be interpreted in the light of LAW on the Rights of the Child , which had been ratified by GPE in DATE . The court disagreed with the applicant 's argument that he had been acting exclusively in his capacity as a lawyer , having regard to the fact that it transpired from the evidence that in his activities undertaken in connection with the adoption cases he had largely overstepped the limits of what would normally be expected from a lawyer in such cases . In particular , the applicant had been acting as a representative before the courts , but had also been actively seeking children for adoption . He had also been taking de facto and legal steps in order to create artificial situations , which would comply with the requirements of laws governing adoption . The court further agreed with the prosecutor 's conclusion that in many cases the applicant 's remuneration was improperly high , which seemed to contravene LAW . This , in the court 's view , indicated that the applicant had been motivated solely by profit .", "CARDINAL . The court further considered that the assessment of the evidence as a whole warranted a conclusion that the legal requirements for detention on remand had been complied with . Firstly , the voluminous evidence showed that the suspicions against the applicant were well - founded . Secondly , the complexity of the case and the need to take further timeconsuming measures , such as questioning further witnesses and examining numerous documents , argued in favour of the applicant 's continued detention in order to safeguard the proper conduct of the proceedings . The court finally considered that there was a risk that the applicant 's release would jeopardise the proceedings , having regard in particular to the nature of the charges against him which had included fabricating false evidence for the purposes of adoption proceedings in order to mislead the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant 's request for release submitted to the Minister of Justice on DATE and refused to allow it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked to be released , or to have his detention replaced by a more lenient preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to entertain the applicant 's request for release . The prosecutor considered that , in the light of the applicant 's medical records and those of his wife , there were not sufficient grounds to accept his argument that he should be released as there were no indications that his continued detention entailed any danger to life or limb , or any particular hardship for him or for his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that a medical expert opinion be prepared by CARDINAL psychiatrists and CARDINAL psychologist in order to establish whether the applicant 's health was compatible with his detention and whether he could be held criminally responsible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the decision of DATE of ORG . ORG considered that the assessment of the applicant 's and his wife 's medical records by ORG had been correct . He further emphasised that the question whether the facts relied on by the prosecuting authorities to justify the applicant 's detention could be considered as falling under LAW transitional provisions of LAW had already been examined by ORG in his decision of DATE and by ORG in its decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL . Although it was true that the court had regarded this legal qualification as \u201c controversial \u201d , it had accepted the prosecutor 's arguments that the applicant 's detention was justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG assigned a further expert , a neuropsychology specialist , to examine the applicant in order to complete the medical data gathered in preparing the expert report ordered by the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked to be interrogated by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG to prolong the applicant 's detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the applicant 's letter of DATE , ORG informed him on DATE that , in view of the fact that the expert report had to be prepared , he could not have been interrogated before the submission of the prosecutor 's request of CARDINAL DATE to the court for prolongation of the detention . It was further stated that the relevant legal provisions did not provide for a prosecutor 's request for prolongation of detention on remand to be served on an accused . The applicant was also informed that , in view of the fact that the evidence gathered in the investigations justified a conclusion that new developments were to be expected as regards further persons who would ultimately be charged in the case , his lawyer had been refused access to the case file in order to safeguard the proper conduct of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the applicant complained again that he had not been questioned in the investigations since DATE of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the request of ORG , prolonged the applicant 's detention for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG the applicant complained that the proceedings concerning the extension of his pre - trial detention were not adversarial , contrary to the requirements of LAW as neither he nor his lawyer had been allowed access to the case file . He also complained that he was not allowed to participate in religious services in prison and requested permission to obtain new books and newspapers from his family .", "CARDINAL . In a reply of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that the applicant had not been questioned because further evidence had to be gathered in order to ensure that his questioning be effective .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant 's appeal against the decision of DATE . The court stated that the acts with which the applicant had been charged could not reasonably be qualified as trading in children within the meaning of Article IX of the transitional provisions of LAW . This was so because , in the assessment of what could constitute an offence of \u201c trading in children \u201d , regard had necessarily to be had to the fact that adoption was in a child 's best interests , whereas the notion of trading in human beings inherently involved acts to the detriment of its victims . Whereas it was true , the court continued , that adoption did , to a certain extent , limit the liberty of the person to be adopted , its purpose was to improve the child 's living conditions and to enhance its prospects of well - being . Therefore , the adoption in itself had to be perceived as beneficial for the child . In the case under examination , it had not been established by the investigating authorities that the acts with which the applicant had been charged had caused any harm to any children or to other persons . The court attached particular importance to the fact that LAW transitional provisions of LAW , which penalised trading in human beings , was to be replaced , following a proposal of a committee charged with drafting a new code , by a separate offence of organising adoptions for commercial purposes . This indicated , the court emphasised , that it was impossible to charge the applicant with the offence laid down by LAW transitional provisions , as the offence of trading in human beings was considered by a unanimous opinion of eminent legal scholars , members of the drafting committee , to constitute an offence separate from that of organising adoptions for commercial purposes . The court concluded that the fact that the applicant had acted as a lawyer in many adoption proceedings , and had received fees for doing so , was of itself not sufficient to found a reasonable suspicion that an offence punishable under Article ORG had been committed . The applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to separate the proceedings concerning another lawyer , ORG , charged , together with the applicant , with trading in children , from the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was to be questioned by ORG . He maintained his earlier submissions and refused to testify , pleading that his defence counsel were absent . He also refused to comment on the documents collected as evidence during a search of his home on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was due to be questioned in the presence of CARDINAL of his defence counsel , PERSON The applicant refused to give evidence , invoking his professional obligation not to reveal information gathered when representing clients .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE for the western district of GPE , upon letters rogatory from ORG , ordered that certain witnesses be questioned in connection with the proceedings against the applicant . The court had regard to information submitted by the prosecutor to the effect that LAW Criminal Code forbade NORP citizens to intervene in adoption proceedings for commercial motives and for profit . The witnesses were to be heard in order to obtain information concerning how the adoptive parents had obtained knowledge of the possibility of adopting NORP children , how they had proceeded to obtain the final judicial decisions on the adoption and what had been the applicant 's role .", "CARDINAL . By letters of DATE , DATE and DATE ORG requested ORG to take steps with a view to expediting execution of letters rogatory addressed to the judicial authorities of the states of GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the Minister of ORG about the manner in which the proceedings were being conducted . He complained in particular that , despite the considerations set out in ORG decision of DATE to release him , the criminal proceedings were still being pursued . He further submitted that his private telephone was being tapped . He complained about a press campaign against him which , in his view , was inspired by PERSON , the President of ORG and at the same time a candidate in the national presidential election . He finally complained about the letters rogatory submitted to the NORP authorities on the ground that they erroneously stated that organising adoptions for commercial purposes was a criminal offence punishable under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . In reply , in a letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed the applicant that an examination of the case files , comprising CARDINAL volumes , had shown that his complaints were ill - founded . The fact that ORG had ruled that the applicant 's detention should not be continued had no bearing on the issue of his criminal responsibility . As regards the complaint that his phone was being tapped , the prosecutor 's office had not issued any authorisation to that effect . If the applicant had any information indicating that his phone was being tapped illegally , it was open to him to request the institution of criminal investigations in this respect . In so far as the applicant complained that the criminal proceedings against him had been instituted for political motives , this complaint did not call for any comment , in particular in the light of the evidence gathered in the investigations and in view of GPE 's public statements . As regards the letters rogatory , their legal basis was to be found in LAW of LAW . The complaint that in the applicant 's case they amounted to an \u201c abuse of law \u201d was unfounded .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the Minister of ORG the applicant alleged that the reply of CARDINAL DATE had failed to address his complaints adequately . He emphasised that in the light of ORG decision of DATE the legal qualification of the charges against him was untenable . He further insisted that the prosecutor was well aware of the phone - tapping and that his allegations on the subject were well - founded . He further stressed that he had in fact requested that an analysis be made , in the light of the material gathered by the police using informal methods of obtaining evidence , of the extent to which the manner of conducting his case had really been influenced by GPE , the President of ORG , who had made \u201c protection of the NORP family \u201d one of the crucial slogans of his presidential campaign . He finally reiterated that in the letters rogatory the NORP authorities had misled the NORP court as to the legal qualification of the charges against him , in that they had stated that the organising of adoptions amounted to a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed the prosecuting authorities that its request had been forwarded to the NORP embassy in GPE on DATE . On DATE ORG received the evidence collected in pursuance of letters rogatory by the judicial authorities of GPE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG transmitted certain evidence collected in GPE to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letters of DATE , DATE and DATE ORG submitted to ORG fresh requests for intervention in order to have letters rogatory carried out . The prosecutor stressed that the investigations could only be completed after collecting the necessary evidence from abroad , and asked for information as to a possible date of execution of the letters rogatory . In reply , by letters of DATE and DATE , ORG once again requested ORG in GPE to take the necessary steps to expedite their execution .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant requested the Minister of ORG to supervise the conduct of the case . He complained that his passport had been invalidated and that the relevant proceedings were pending before ORG . He further submitted that he had not had any access to the investigation files . He complained that the case had been pending since DATE without any decision on the merits having been rendered , and that , as a result of these proceedings , his reputation had suffered badly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the GPE courts to take further evidence from CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the then Deputy Minister of ORG , GPE , sent a letter to the presidents of regional courts stating that in DATE there had been a rapid growth of cases in which courts ruled on adoptions of NORP children of which the adoptive parents were foreigners . As a result , CARDINAL children had left the country for good . This data should be considered as disturbing , the more so as it had been mainly small children that had been adopted . Public opinion was alarmed by the growing numbers of foreign adoptions . It was true that NORP law laid down the same requirements for adoptions , regardless of the nationality of the future adoptive parents , and that the children 's welfare was a consideration of paramount importance for all adoption cases . However , the notion of a child 's welfare should also include protection of its national identity . Hence , foreign adoptions should take place only in exceptional cases and the courts should first examine whether the child could not find adoptive parents in GPE . The presidents of the courts were invited to consider whether in cases in which the same persons were repeatedly acting as intermediaries in connection with the adoption proceedings , it was not advisable to inform the prosecution authorities accordingly . The presidents were finally requested to supervise closely this category of cases and to take measures in order to eliminate the climate favouring foreign adoptions .", "DATE .

On DATE the journal Rzeczpospolita published an article written by a renowned specialist in criminal law , entitled \u201c Is it really trading in children ? \u201d . The author expressed strong doubts as to whether the offence punishable by LAW transitional provisions of the DATE LAW could be applied in a context other than trading in human beings for the purposes of prostitution . It was emphasised that in view of the historical background to this provision , dating back to international treaties of DATE concluded for the purposes of combating international networks deriving profits from prostitution , it could not be applied to situations concerning adoptions of children in which no allegations were made of there being any links or intentions related to organising prostitution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied in the negative to a legal question put to it by ORG , in the context of criminal proceedings concerning charges made under LAW transitional provisions of the DATE LAW ( namely , whether an intention to coerce a victim of the offence of trading in children into practising prostitution was a constituent element of this offence ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in the same criminal proceedings in which CARDINAL accused had been charged with an offence punishable under LAW transitional provisions of the DATE LAW , discontinued the proceedings against them . The court recalled that in view of the fact that this LAW had ceased to be in force , the prosecuting authorities had amended the charges by qualifying the acts which the applicants had been charged with committing as an offence punishable under LAW of LAW . The court considered that this qualification could not be upheld . There were no grounds for accepting that the notion of \u201c trading in children \u201d also included the acts in question , which could only be regarded as organising illicit adoptions . It was only under LAW , in force from DATE , that organising illicit adoptions had become a criminal offence . Consequently , the court had to discontinue the proceedings pursuant to LAW , item CARDINAL , of the new Code , which provided that criminal proceedings had to be discontinued if the charges against the accused had not been made out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following the prosecutor 's appeal against this decision , amended it in part , considering that the proceedings against the accused concerning the charges of trading in children should have been discontinued on the ground that the acts with which they had been charged had not amounted to a criminal offence punishable at the time of their commission . The court recalled that the accused had been indicted with trading in children on the basis that they had , with a view to profit , visited hospitals , orphanages and hostels for single mothers , trying to persuade the biological parents to place their children for adoption , in certain cases for money . Their actions had further been described as taking children away from their biological parents and taking further care of them , followed by taking steps to institute adoption proceedings . The accused had allegedly also arranged transfers of children to foreign citizens and made payments to the biological parents . The court considered that these acts could be qualified neither as trading in children within the meaning of the repealed LAW transitional provisions of the old LAW , nor as trading in human beings within the meaning of LAW of LAW . Such acts could only be construed , regard being had to their nature , as organising foreign adoptions , in certain cases for commercial motives . As a result , these acts at the time of their commission , that is , from DATE , had not constituted criminal offences , given that it was only under LAW , which had entered into force on DATE , that they could have been qualified as falling within the ambit of LAW of that LAW , penalising the organisation of adoptions for commercial motives . Consequently , the proceedings should have been discontinued on the ground that the acts concerned had not coincided with the constituent elements of the offence of trading in children as defined by the NORP law at the material time , and not on the ground that the charges against the accused had not been made out .", "CARDINAL .
