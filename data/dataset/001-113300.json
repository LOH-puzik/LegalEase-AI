On DATE the applicants , referring to the suspension of the operation of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG by ORG decision of DATE ( see ORG judgment of DATE at paragraphs QUANTITY below ) and arguing that their detention was an administrative penalty , requested ORG of GPE to examine their complaint against the decision of DATE under LAW of the Code on Administrative Offences ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . They complained that the President of ORG had committed a manifest miscarriage of justice by punishing them under LAW ORG , which provision clearly envisaged liability only for acts committed inside court buildings ; a video recording of the applicants\u2019 demonstration was submitted to show that it had taken place in the yard of ORG . Thus , the applicants argued that the above - mentioned provision could not be considered a foreseeable and therefore legitimate basis for their conviction and detention . They further complained that the President of ORG had violated the principles of a fair trial by delivering her decision entirely on the basis of the CARDINAL - sided account provided by the bailiffs . The applicants also complained that the President had chosen the severest sanction of those available under LAW of the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

However , acknowledging that their detention was , by its nature , an administrative penalty , he ruled that the complaint of DATE against the penalty could be examined under LAW ORG . Judge PERSON went on to criticise the applicants for abusing their right to freedom of expression . He found it established from the case materials that the applicants had truly exhibited \u201c manifest and gross contempt \u201d towards ORG by committing those acts \u201c inside the court building , namely in its central entrance hall \u201d . In any event , the aim of LAW \u00a7 DATE ) of the ORG was , in the opinion of Judge PERSON , to protect public order not only inside court - houses but also outside them , in adjacent LOC . The President of ORG had no other choice but to sanction the applicants under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG , since what was at stake in the given situation was \u201c not the judge \u2019s own interests but the authority of the court and the proper administration of justice \u201d . In reply to the complaint that the President of ORG had made her decision entirely on the basis of CARDINAL - sided submissions , Judge PERSON stated that all the evidence \u2013 the records of the applicants\u2019 arrest and the explanatory notes \u2013 had been drafted and submitted by the bailiffs for consideration by the President in accordance with a procedure envisaged by law . Judge PERSON also stated that the CARDINAL days\u2019 detention had been an appropriate punishment , given the gravity of the acts committed .", "CARDINAL .
