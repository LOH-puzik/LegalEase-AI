On DATE he married PERSON The couple had one daughter , GPE , born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the couple divorced and agreed on custody of the child and other parental rights . Their agreement , which was approved by the Szolnok ORG , placed the daughter with her mother and granted the applicant contact DATE , during DATE , GPE DATE , Whit Monday , DATE and DATE during DATE . The applicant was also to pay child allowance , amounting to PERCENT of his salary , but CARDINAL MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) per month .", "CARDINAL . PERSON moved out of the former family home and took up residence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant could exercise contact on CARDINAL and DATE and DATE . However , his daughter was reluctant to stay with him during DATE and preferred to spend her holidays with her grandparents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s further attempts to exercise contact failed , seemingly because in the mother \u2019s view it was up to the child to decide whether she wanted to see her father . The applicant applied to ORG to have the contact agreement enforced . In a decision of DATE it ordered PERSON to comply with the agreement , warning her that failure to do so could result in her being fined and ordered to reimburse the applicant \u2019s travel costs . Given the strained relationship between the parents , a notary initiated child protection proceedings ( v\u00e9delembe v\u00e9tel ) on DATE . Subsequently , on a number of occasions Ms GPE was fined for not complying with the agreement . It appears from the case file that the applicant could exercise contact between DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON brought an action seeking to change the applicant \u2019s contact rights and an increase in the amount of child allowance . In a counterclaim the applicant requested that the child be placed in his custody .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also filed a criminal complaint against ORG alleging child endangerment . The parties\u2019 attempt to stabilise the relationship between the applicant and his daughter during the suspension of the custody proceedings were unsuccessful and ORG ordered that any meetings between them take place at a child protection centre .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the NORP ORG reduced the applicant \u2019s contact with his daughter to DATE from TIME It held that the previously agreed form of contact was unlikely to be implemented and would only lead to further proceedings before the guardianship authority , which would be to the detriment of the child . The court based its judgment on an expert opinion finding that the child should have had an adaptation period to re - establish her relationship with her father . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim concerning custody , stating that the child \u2019s wishes had to be taken into account , given that she was now DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE Regional Court upheld the first - instance judgment in essence but amended the applicant \u2019s contact rights to every other DATE TIME until DATE , and all DATE - long visits DATE as of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant failed to turn up at numerous scheduled meetings for DATE , for which he was fined ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s contact rights and the amount of child allowance were subject to further litigation . On DATE the Szolnok ORG dismissed an action brought by him seeking to decrease the amount of child allowance , and a review of the way contact should be exercised . The court established that since the court decision of DATE , no contact had taken place between the applicant and his daughter and , despite a request by the applicant , the guardianship authority had taken no steps to implement the judgment on the grounds that he had made no efforts to resolve the conflict with his daughter . In particular , he had paid no heed to her request to travel by public transport instead of in his car .", "The court also found that in the absence of any significant change in circumstances , there was no reason to amend the arrangements for contact .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE the GPE Regional Court reviewed the applicant \u2019s parental rights , granting him contact DATE on the condition that the daughter , who was by now already DATE , be allowed to visit him by herself . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a decrease in the child allowance . The applicant lodged a petition for review with ORG . It was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

NORP In DATE the applicant requested that the GPE and all subordinate guardianship authorities be excluded from any further proceedings for bias . On DATE ORG appointed ORG to deal with any further proceedings concerning the enforcement of the applicant \u2019s contact rights , noting that at that point there were CARDINAL enforcement requests pending , the oldest dating back to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a number of requests seeking to end his obligation to pay child allowance , which were finally accepted by ORG and ORG on DATE and on appeal by ORG on DATE .
