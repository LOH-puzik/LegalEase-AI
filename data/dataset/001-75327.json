The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as editor of the newspaper FAC ( Everyday Work ) , the applicant published in issue number CARDINAL an article entitled \u201c Giving the conscripts a send - off , and collective memory \u201d ( Asker u\u011furlamalar ve toplumsal haf\u0131za ) signed by GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor at ORG of the General Staff ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , acting under LAW and LAW , charged the applicant with incitement , by publication of the above article , to evade military service ( askerlikten so\u011futma ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant informed ORG that the article had been written by PERSON , who had signed it with a pseudonym .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG initially sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( TRL ) . By virtue of section CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentence Act ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , which provided for prison sentences imposed on editors to be commuted to fines , the applicant was ultimately ordered to pay a \u201c heavy fine \u201d of FAC .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG referred to the following passage from the offending article :", "\u201c DATE in bus stations has been a time for sending the DATE conscripts on their way ... The novice soldiers setting off \u2013 \u201c but you \u2019ll soon be back \u201d , people tell them to console them \u2013 already seemed during these ritual send - offs to be plunging into war by donning \u201c invisible khaki \u201d . It was a time when war seemed rather attractive ; the congratulations and praises made it seem like a warm nest , almost as warm as a mother \u2019s arms , into whose embrace they would have liked to run . What we saw at each of these ceremonies shows that the thing has become a collective hysteria and that this hysteria has also spawned its own indispensable attributes : the traditional drum and clarinet , the famous CARDINAL - crescented flag , sometimes accompanied by the corn - ear flag of ORG ] or the rose - bearing flag of the BBP [ ORG ] ... Warm - up ceremonies are organised for those setting off for the war , the exaltation felt on killing a man is the exaltation of winning a match and , what is more , the killer justifies his act by speaking of the love he has for his fatherland and his nation . In short , it ca n\u2019t be said that what we \u2019re doing is right ... Those verses , written by a fallen soldier , are carved on his own tombstone . He will no longer see those who gather to give the conscripts a send - off , no longer hear the drum , the clarinet or the gunfire , not be able to read the verses written on his tombstone , on seeing which he would perhaps have felt repelled by the determinism they convey . Because from now on he is reduced to a title : a martyr ... It is because the ORG does not recognise as such the war which is etched deeply into the collective life and the collective memory that , apart from a small minority , those who return from it after losing an arm , a leg or an eye receive no allowance . These people who are no longer capable of meeting their own needs are being deceived by talk of fictitious jobs . \u2018 There is a war , but not officially ; you are war - wounded , but you count for nothing.\u2019 \u201d", "In its considerations the General Staff Court pointed out that military service was a constitutional duty and that the applicant , by denigrating military service had also denigrated the struggle against the ORG , a terrorist organisation which killed soldiers , police officers , teachers and civil servants . It held that the offending article contained terms contrary to morality and public order .", "CARDINAL . Relying on Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW , the applicant appealed on points of law to ORG . He argued that ORG had given its judgment without hearing his defence on the merits of the charge . He submitted that as a civilian he should not have been tried by that court , and alleged that it was not independent or impartial .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was allegedly not provided with a copy of the opinion of ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . It observed that the applicant \u2019s submissions on the merits had been filed by his lawyer , and that the fact that he had been tried by a military court was in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions in force at the material time provided :", "\u201c Military justice shall be dispensed by military courts and military disciplinary organs . These courts and tribunals shall be responsible for conducting proceedings concerning offences committed by military personnel which are breaches of military law or are committed against other military personnel , on military LOC or in connection with military service and the related duties .", "Military courts shall also be responsible for dealing with offences committed by civilians where these are designated by special laws as breaches of military law , or have been committed against military personnel , either during their performance of duties designated by law or on military LOC so designated .", "The jurisdiction of the military courts as regards persons and offences in time of war or state of emergency , the composition of such courts and the secondment of civilian judges and prosecutors to them where necessary shall be regulated by law", "The organisation and functions of military judicial organs , the personal status of military judges and the relations between judges acting as military prosecutors and the commanders under whom they serve shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts and the security of tenure of the judiciary and with the requirements of military service . Relations between military judges and the commanders under whom they serve as regards their non - judicial duties shall also be regulated by law in accordance with the requirements of military service . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Following the amendment introduced on DATE by LAW no . DATE , LAW of LAW now reads as follows :", "\u201c ... Military courts shall not try civilians charged with committing the crimes and lesser offences referred to in LAW in time of peace . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At international level , the position regarding the jurisdiction of military courts to try civilian defendants is as follows .", "CARDINAL . Among the member ORG is at present the only country whose LAW explicitly provides that military courts may try civilians in peacetime .", "Although there is some diversity in legislation governing the jurisdiction of military courts to try civilians , in the great majority of legal systems that jurisdiction is either non - existent or limited to certain very precise situations , such as complicity between a member of the military and a civilian in the commission of an offence punishable under the ordinary criminal code or the military penal code .", "CARDINAL . In its DATE General Comment on LAW the ORG \u2019s ORG issued the following warning to member GPE :", "\u201c The ORG notes the existence , in many countries , of military or special courts which try civilians . This could present serious problems as far as the equitable , impartial and independent administration of justice is concerned . Quite often the reason for the establishment of such courts is to enable exceptional procedures to be applied which do not comply with normal standards of justice . While the LAW does not prohibit such categories of courts , nevertheless the conditions which it lays down clearly indicate that the trying of civilians by such courts should be very exceptional and take place under conditions which genuinely afford the full guarantees stipulated in article DATE . The ORG has noted a serious lack of information in this regard in the reports of some GPE parties whose judicial institutions include such courts for the trying of civilians . In some countries such military and special courts do not afford the strict guarantees of the proper administration of justice in accordance with the requirements of article CARDINAL which are essential for the effective protection of human rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The country reports subsequently adopted enabled the ORG to clarify its position . It no longer hesitated to criticise GPE whose legislation still permitted military courts to try civilians . The ORG urged those countries to amend their legislation on the question while congratulating those among them who had implemented such a reform . In the final analysis , the ORG took the view that \u201c military courts should not have the faculty to try cases which do not refer to offences committed by members of the armed forces in the course of their duties \u201d . In its DATE report on GPE the ORG expressed its views even more incisively , stating that it was \u201c concerned at information about the extent to which military courts have jurisdiction to try civilians ; despite recent limitations on this procedure , the ORG does not accept that this practice is justified by the convenience of the military court dealing with every person who may have taken some part in an offence primarily committed by a member of the armed forces \u201d ( Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee : GPE , ORG . CCPR / C/CARDINAL/ Add . CARDINAL , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Similar criticisms were made of GPE and GPE , to mention only member ORG , with the ORG taking the line that civilians should not be tried by military courts in any circumstances ( see , in particular , Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee : GPE , Doc . CCPR / C/CARDINAL/Add . CARDINAL , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , mention should be made of the report on the issue of the administration of justice through military tribunals , submitted to ORG , which is to debate it at its CARDINALnd session in DATE ( Doc . E / CN.CARDINAL/Sub.CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "The first of the Principles set out in the report reads :", "\u201c Military tribunals , when they exist , may be established only by the constitution or the law , respecting the principle of the separation of powers . They must be an integral part of the general judicial system . \u201d", "However , the rapporteur pointed out", "\u201c ... the \u2018 constitutionalization\u2019 of military tribunals that exists in a number of countries should not place them outside the scope of ordinary law or above the law but , on the contrary , should include them in the principles of the rule of law , beginning with those concerning the separation of powers and the hierarchy of norms . \u201d", "Principle No . CARDINAL emphasises respect for the standards of international law in the following terms :", "\u201c Military tribunals must in all circumstances apply standards and procedures internationally recognized as guarantees of a fair trial , including the rules of international humanitarian law . \u201d", "Principle No . CARDINAL , which deals with the functional jurisdiction of military courts , states :", "\u201c Military courts should , in principle , have no jurisdiction to try civilians . In all circumstances , the ORG shall ensure that civilians accused of a criminal offence of any nature are tried by civilian courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The settled case - law of ORG excludes civilians from the jurisdiction of military courts in the following terms :", "\u201c In a democratic Government of Laws the penal military jurisdiction shall have a restrictive and exceptional scope and shall lead to the protection of special juridical interests , related to the functions assigned by law to the military forces .
