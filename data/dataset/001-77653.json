The applicant , ORG , is a NORP company registered in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company sued a certain PERSON before ORG ( FAC ) . It claimed that a contract concluded with the defendant should be rescinded and requested to reacquire possession of a plot of land . Its claim was based on the fact that , disregarding the obligations arising from the said contract , PERSON had not built a house or a villa on the plot in issue and had failed to pay the agreed DATE rent of MONEY ( MTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON filed submissions in reply to the applicant \u2019s claim on DATE and on DATE . The case was set down for hearing on CARDINAL DATE , on which date a number of preliminary pleas were raised . These were determined on DATE . Subsequently , the parties submitted their pleadings and the case was reserved for judgment until DATE . The parties were authorised to submit observations but failed to do so . The case was adjourned first until DATE , then until DATE . The decision was adjourned CARDINAL times .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mrs. PERSON appealed against that judgment . The applicant filed submissions in reply on DATE . On DATE the parties presented their oral pleadings and the case was reserved for judgment until DATE . However , the decision was adjourned on CARDINAL occasions .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . Considering that its case had not been decided \u201c within a reasonable time \u201d , on DATE the applicant , invoking LAW and LAW , lodged an application with ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application . It observed that it did not appear that there had been excessive delays in deciding the case at first instance . The preliminary pleas had been decided on DATE and the judgment on the merits had been delivered CARDINAL and a half years after the date on which the case was ready for decision . Moreover , ORG had waited DATE for the parties to submit their observations . It was true that the proceedings before ORG had lasted a longer time . The fixing of the date of the first sitting had taken DATE and a decision on the merits of the case had not been given until DATE . However , the reasonableness of this delay had to be examined in the context of the national judicial system , in which , unlike in other countries , the right of appeal was automatic . Every litigant who felt aggrieved by a decision given at first instance could lodge an appeal without having to apply for leave to do so . This obliged ORG to examine a large number of cases in detail , bearing in mind that its decision would be the final one , and would therefore not be subject to review by any superior authority . The expenses for bringing an appeal were also relatively low , which constituted another factor encouraging citizens to bring their cases before ORG . In ORG view , the obligation of the ORG to organise its judicial system with a view to complying with the \u201c reasonable - time \u201d principle was to be balanced against the other privileges that the NORP system provided to its citizens .", "CARDINAL . It was true that a period of DATE for deciding the applicant company \u2019s case was \u201c a bit long \u201d vis - \u00e0 - vis its complexity and the workload of ORG , and that DATE should have been in principle sufficient . However , ORG considered that this delay had not reached the extent of seriously prejudicing the rights of the parties , and was therefore not excessive .", "CARDINAL . As to the claim for damages , ORG observed that the applicant company was seeking compensation for DATE of unpaid rent ( which amounted to MTL CARDINAL ) . However , the failure to pay the rent was not due to the delay in determining the case and the applicant company could have asked , and could still ask , for the rent arrears from PERSON Moreover , it was likely that the market value of the land had increased during the judicial proceedings . The applicant company alleged that if it had regained possession of its land in DATE or DATE , it could have sold it for ORG CARDINAL . It had accordingly requested the reimbursement of the interest on this sum as compensation for pecuniary damage . ORG could not accept this argument , as the applicant company was still in possession of its land and was trying to sell it for about MTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL . In ORG view , the loss of interest had been compensated by the increase in the value of the land .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that even if a violation of the \u201c reasonable - time \u201d principle had been found , no compensation could have been awarded to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG reversed the decision of ORG and declared that there had been a violation of LAW . It also decided that the costs of the case should be borne by the Attorney General , who should moreover pay the applicant company ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court observed that ORG had rightly pointed out that the delay in delivering the judgment on appeal had been unreasonable . However , it could not be said that this delay had not infringed LAW . Before ORG , the parties had presented their oral pleadings on DATE , but no decision on the merits had been given until DATE , DATE . The case had been adjourned several times and it did not appear that there had been any special reasons for this . Moreover , the case was not particularly complex and the parties had not obstructed its course . Therefore , an overall period of inactivity of DATE could not be accepted .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considered that the applicant company had not suffered any pecuniary damage . It upheld the reasoning of ORG on this point . However , it concluded that prejudice of a non - pecuniary nature could be suffered even by a private company , and awarded ORG CARDINAL under this head ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
