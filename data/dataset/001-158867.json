The defence sought an adjournment until DATE . A limited postponement of DATE was granted until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants dismissed their legal representatives , alleging certain deficiencies in the quality of the service they provided . The applicants then sought to transfer their representation orders . This was required to enable the applicants to instruct new representation whilst continuing to benefit from publicly funded legal advice and assistance . On DATE the judge refused . Later , following a written application and oral submissions , for which the applicants were assisted by counsel , the judge indicated that he might transfer the representation order . However , CARDINAL of the requirements of new leading counsel was that the trial be pushed back again to DATE . The judge again refused as he considered that the applicants had not given a good reason for dismissing their previous representation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 trial began on DATE and lasted for DATE . At the beginning of the trial , the applicants made an outoftime application to FAC to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process arguing a breach of LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL reasonable - time requirement . In a decision dated DATE Langstaff J found that the period of unexplained delay between the beginning of proceedings , deemed to be DATE , and the date of the formal charge on DATE , had amounted to a breach of the reasonable - time requirement .", "CARDINAL . In determining the start date of proceedings , PERSON had noted that in DATE , the ORG investigation was on - going and that no decision had been made whether to bring charges against the applicants ; that at some time DATE a decision had however been made ; that in DATE it had been \u201c indicated \u201d and notified to the applicants that they would probably face charges ; and that DATE was therefore , the relevant date for LAW purposes . He explicitly rejected the ORG assertion that the relevant time period for the purposes of LAW had commenced any earlier . In particular , PERSON found that the charges on which the applicants faced trial were sufficiently different to the earlier money - laundering charges , so that the relevant time period did not extend to incorporate those charges ; that if the reasonabletime period necessarily began running the moment there had been an arrest , an investigation or a seizure of documents , such might incline the authorities to take precipitant haste in deciding whether or not to bring charges ; that the authorities should take care not to hastily charge an individual where such would be unjustified ; and that a proper distinction should be drawn between an investigation and a decision to prosecute , at which time the individual concerned would be duly informed . PERSON also concluded that there was no other period of unreasonable delay in the applicants\u2019 case , having regard to the complexity of the case and the conduct of the parties . He determined that the appropriate remedy for the identified breach was not a stay of the indictment : rather that it should be taken into account when deciding the question of costs in the event of acquittal , or by taking it into account at the time of sentence in the event of a conviction .", "CARDINAL . At the close of the prosecution case , the applicants renewed their LAW abuse - of - process submissions to PERSON In a decision promulgated on DATE , he upheld his previous decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were convicted by a jury , on a majority verdict , of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to corrupt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE both applicants were sentenced to sevenandahalf GPE imprisonment . PERSON noted that the maximum sentence available for a conviction of conspiracy to defraud was CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and that the offence committed by the applicants fell towards the top of that tariff . The maximum sentence available on the conspiracytocorrupt conviction was DATE imprisonment . Although Langstaff J found that the corruption offence had a close relationship to the defraud offence , it was not \u201c part and parcel \u201d of it . Therefore , a separate penalty was required . Considering however the period of some fifteen months\u2019 unreasonable delay in the course of the case ( during which time the applicants had been at liberty ) , the period of \u201c effective custody \u201d to which the applicants had been subjected during the length of the trial , and the fact that there was no previous involvement in like offending , a sentence of DATE in respect of the conspiracy to defraud and DATE consecutive in respect of the conspiracy to corrupt was imposed .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought leave to appeal their conviction to ORG . They argued that their conviction was unsafe because , inter alia , the trial judge had refused to transfer the representation order . The applicants\u2019 grounds of appeal did not contain any LAW abuseofprocess submissions and did not seek to challenge the trial judge \u2019s finding with regard to the commencement of proceedings for the purposes of the reasonable - time requirement . The application for permission to appeal was refused on DATE following an oral hearing , on the ground that the request for a change of representation order was not reasonable and that the judge had been entitled to find same .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , following conviction , confiscation proceedings were brought against both applicants . On DATE all parties to the proceedings agreed that the applicants had each benefited by MONEY . Contested hearings took place in DATE and DATE . Provisional judgment was given on DATE and an amended and finalised judgment was handed down on DATE . In respect of the first applicant , a confiscation order was made in the sum of GBP CARDINAL to be paid within DATE , with a sentence in default of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In respect of the second applicant , a confiscation order was made in the sum of GBP CARDINAL to be paid within an unknown period of time , with a sentence in default of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants sought leave to appeal those orders . Permission to appeal was granted to argue the specific point of the realisable value of jointly held assets and refused on all other grounds . The applicants pursued an application for leave to appeal on unparticularised additional grounds . That application and the appeal on the ground for which leave had been granted were considered at CARDINAL hearing held on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal on the additional grounds argued . Furthermore , in considering the appeal before it , the court concluded that the orders made were wrong insofar as they were based upon treating the jointly held assets as PERCENT available to each of the applicants . The appeals were allowed to the limited extent of repairing the identified error . The previous orders were quashed and substitute orders made . In respect of the first applicant , a confiscation order was made in the sum of GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL to be paid within DATE , with a sentence in default of CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment . In respect of the second applicant , a confiscation order was made in the sum of GBP CARDINAL to be paid within an unknown period of time , with a sentence in default of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In Attorney General \u2019s Reference ( No CARDINAL of CARDINAL ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. DATE , ORG , the majority in ORG considered the implications of Article CARDINAL on the question whether a prosecution should be stayed by reason of delay alone . Lord PERSON , delivering the majority judgment , stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . NORP If , through the action or inaction of a public authority , a criminal charge is not determined at a hearing within a reasonable time , there is necessarily a breach of the defendant \u2019s Convention right under article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . For such breach there must be afforded such remedy as may ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) be just and appropriate or ( in Convention terms ) effective , just and proportionate . The appropriate remedy will depend on the nature of the breach and all the circumstances , including particularly the stage of the proceedings at which the breach is established . If the breach is established before the hearing , the appropriate remedy may be a public acknowledgement of the breach , action to expedite the hearing to the greatest extent practicable and perhaps , if the defendant is in custody , his release on bail . It will not be appropriate to stay or dismiss the proceedings unless ( a ) there can no longer be a fair hearing or ( b ) it would otherwise be unfair to try the defendant . The public interest in the final determination of criminal charges requires that such a charge should not be stayed or dismissed if any lesser remedy will be just and proportionate in all the circumstances . The prosecutor and the court do not act incompatibly with the defendant \u2019s Convention right in continuing to prosecute or entertain proceedings after a breach is established in a case where neither of conditions ( a ) or ( b ) is met , since the breach consists in the delay which has accrued and not in the prospective hearing . If the breach of the reasonable time requirement is established retrospectively , after there has been a hearing , the appropriate remedy may be a public acknowledgement of the breach , a reduction in the penalty imposed on a convicted defendant or the payment of compensation to an acquitted defendant . Unless ( a ) the hearing was unfair or ( b ) it was unfair to try the defendant at all , it will not be appropriate to quash any conviction . Again , in any case where neither of conditions ( a ) or ( b ) applies , the prosecutor and the court do not act incompatibly with the defendant \u2019s Convention right in prosecuting or entertaining the proceedings but only in failing to procure a hearing within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . The category of cases in which it may be unfair to try a defendant of course includes cases of bad faith , unlawfulness and executive manipulation of the kind classically illustrated by R v ORG , Ex p Bennett [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC DATE , but Mr PERSON contended that the category should not be confined to such cases . That principle may be broadly accepted . There may well be cases ( of which ORG v The ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL is an example ) where the delay is of such an order , or where a prosecutor \u2019s breach of professional duty is such ( PERSON v ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL NZLR CARDINAL may be an example ) , as to make it unfair that the proceedings against a defendant should continue . It would be unwise to attempt to describe such cases in advance . They will be recognisable when they appear . Such cases will however be very exceptional , and a stay will never be an appropriate remedy if any lesser remedy would adequately vindicate the defendant \u2019s Convention right . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON concluded that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Criminal proceedings may be stayed on the ground that there has been a violation of the reasonable time requirement in article CARDINAL ) of the Convention only if ( a ) a fair hearing is no longer possible , or ( b ) it is for any compelling reason unfair to try the defendant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . That approach was followed by ORG in PERSON v The ORG , GPE [ DATE ] PERSON . CARDINAL , in which ORG said :", "\u201c A breach of the defendant \u2019s right to have a criminal charge determined within a reasonable time , contrary to Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG , will not necessarily require criminal proceedings to be stayed . It will only be appropriate to stay or dismiss proceedings if there can no longer be a fair hearing or it will otherwise be unfair to try the defendant ... Once there has been a conviction , this court should only quash that conviction if the hearing has proved to be unfair , or it was unfair to try the defendant at all . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Where an abuse of process is alleged , the burden of establishing that the bringing or the continuation of criminal proceedings amounts to an abuse of the court \u2019s process is on the accused : R v Telford Justices ex parte LOC [ DATE ] CARDINAL Q.B. CARDINAL ; R v ORG ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Crim . L.R. CARDINAL . As a general principle of domestic GPE law , it will normally be necessary to prove not only that an abuse has taken place but that the accused has been prejudiced in the presentation of his or her case as a result , so that a fair trial is no longer possible . As Lord PERSON said in ORG hearing in Attorney General \u2019s Reference ( No CARDINAL of CARDINAL ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. DATE , ORG :", "\u201c ... if there has been prejudice caused to a defendant which interferes with his right to a fair trial in a way which can not otherwise be remedied , then of course a stay is an appropriate remedy . But in the absence of prejudice of that sort , there is normally no justification for granting a stay . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the context of confiscation proceedings , in R v PERSON [ DATE ] PERSON DATE ORG held that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Once the ORG decides to invoke the confiscation process , the making of an order is mandatory , and its amount is arithmetically determined but can be moderated by judicial decision .", "[ ... ]", "CARDINAL . The court retains the jurisdiction to stay an application for confiscation , as any other criminal process , where it amounts to an abuse of the court \u2019s process . In the present context , that power exists where it would be oppressive to seek confiscation , or to do so on a particular basis .", "[ ... ]", "CARDINAL . This jurisdiction must be exercised with considerable caution , indeed sparingly . It must be confined to cases of true oppression . In particular , it can not be exercised simply on the grounds that the Judge disagrees with the decision of the ORG to pursue confiscation , or with the way it puts its case on that topic . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of R v P [ DATE ] ORG ( ORG ) the applicant , having been convicted of criminal offending , had confiscation proceedings initiated against him . Moreover , he was subject to a restraint order which related to funds ORG believed could constitute the proceeds of criminal activity . Until a judicial determination had been made as to the source of those funds , the applicant was unable to employ them for the purposes of securing legal representation . The alternative was to rely upon state legal aid funding . HHJ Mole QC however accepted that , not least owing to the complexity of the case , if the applicant were to rely on the ORG legal aid fund , there was no prospect of him being able to engage properly qualified and competent counsel so as to ensure a fair trial . ORG Mole QC therefore stayed the confiscation proceedings as an abuse of process ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
