The first applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE . Her husband , Mr PERSON , born in DATE , and her mother , PERSON , born in DATE , are the second and third applicants . All applicants are NORP nationals and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants purchased from the ORG a CARDINAL - room apartment of QUANTITY in the centre of GPE . Until then , the applicants\u2019 family and CARDINAL other families had been sharing the apartment as tenants . The apartment had become ORG property by virtue of the nationalisations carried out by the communist regime in GPE in DATE and the following DATE . The apartment was on the third floor of a QUANTITY building constructed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . After the adoption of LAW in DATE , the former pre - nationalisation owners brought proceedings under section CARDINAL of that law against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG found that the DATE transaction was null and void on several grounds , including abuse of office , since at the relevant time the second applicant \u2019s father had been an employee of the municipal real estate service . The applicants appealed .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment while it modified its reasoning . The court found that the allegation about abuse had remained unproven , the very fact that a relative of the applicants had worked in the municipal real estate service being insufficient .", "CARDINAL . The court found , however , that a relevant document concerning the DATE transaction had been signed by the deputy to the official in whom the relevant power had been vested .

It found , however , that according to the relevant law the twomonth period for the submission of a petition for review ( cassation ) ran from the date on which the impugned judgment had been made available in the court \u2019s register .", "CARDINAL .
