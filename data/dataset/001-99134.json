On DATE the applicant was seriously injured in an explosion caused by a bomb placed in a house located in the municipality of Aracinovo ( \u201c the municipality \u201d ) . The incident happened after the DATE armed conflict in the former GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively the applicant , represented by counsel , brought CARDINAL separate actions seeking compensation from the municipality and the ORG . They were subsequently joined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the first - instance court \u201d ) accepted the applicant 's claim in respect of the ORG and ordered the latter to pay MONEY ( ORG ) ( CARDINAL ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage , plus interest .

On DATE ORG allowed the appeal and overturned the lower court 's decision in part related to the ORG . It confirmed the remainder , because no appeal had been lodged in that respect .
