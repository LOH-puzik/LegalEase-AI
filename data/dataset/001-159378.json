NORP The investigator also noted that in response to his questions , police officer S. had denied any involvement in ill - treatment of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , the investigator noted the statements made by ORG , to the effect that :", "\u2013 TIME on CARDINAL September CARDINAL he and PERSON had been in the city centre when police officers approached , introduced themselves and asked him [ and PERSON ] them to accompany them to the police station . They had agreed ;", "\u2013 at the police station , he and PERSON had been separated and placed in different offices . Shortly afterwards , when passing in the corridor , he had seen PERSON sitting at a table writing something . He had not seen PERSON being struck , had not heard him crying out , and had not noticed any physical injury on his person ;", "\u2013 he had heard PERSON complain of heart pains , but never refer to an intention to commit suicide .", "CARDINAL . The investigator took note of the statements by the applicant , and also of close relatives of the victim , to the effect that he had never expressed thoughts of suicide .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator noted the presence in the case file of the written confession drawn up by PERSON shortly before his death .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the information communicated by the hospital in which Mr PERSON had been treated after his fall , the investigator established that death had resulted from Mr PERSON \u2019s fall from the fifth floor . No injuries indicating kicks or punches , or the use of handcuffs , had been found on the corpse .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the investigator noted the contents of the report from the on - site inspection conducted on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision of CARDINAL DATE was set aside by a hierarchically superior civil servant , who ordered an additional investigation , noting , in particular , that it was necessary to :", "\u2013 find witnesses who could confirm that PERSON had suicidal thoughts ;", "\u2013 verify that the police officers who had taken PERSON to the police station had acted in accordance with the law ;", "\u2013 consider whether the police officers who had not ensured the victim \u2019s safety inside the police station bore any criminal liability .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE an autopsy of the body was carried out on the orders of investigator PERSON and a forensic report was drawn up . In that document , the forensic medical expert noted that death had resulted from multiple fractures to the head , chest and spine , and to the base and dome of the skull . According to the expert , the location of the injuries identified , and the preponderance of internal over external injuries , led to the conclusion that those injuries had originated in [ Mr PERSON \u2019s ] fall from the fifth floor . The expert concluded that there was no cause - and - effect relationship between the other injuries ( hematomas and scratches on the trunk and the lower and upper limbs , namely a hematoma in the fold of the right elbow measuring CARDINAL x QUANTITY ; a scratch on the right forearm measuring QUANTITY ; a QUANTITY hematoma on the right carpus ; a hematoma on the left shoulder measuring CARDINAL x QUANTITY , on which there were scratches of CARDINAL x QUANTITY ; a hematoma on the left knee measuring QUANTITY , on which there was a scratch of CARDINAL x CARDINAL cm ; and an oval - shaped scratch on the left ankle measuring CARDINAL x QUANTITY ) and the death . As to the question of whether there were traces of a struggle or self - defence , the doctor indicated that it was generally accepted in forensic medicine that injuries to the arms and wrists were to be classified in that way . Thus , he noted the presence of a bruise on the right carpus and a scratch on the right forearm . He added that he was unable to ascertain how those injuries had been sustained . Lastly , the doctor noted that the corpse had been deposited in the morgue unclothed .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , investigator PERSON . from the same department again refused to open a criminal investigation .", "In his reasoning , he quoted from the statements given by police officers T. , GPE . and PERSON , by witness PERSON , and also by the applicant and the deceased \u2019s close relatives , already cited in the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The investigator also questioned certain individuals who had got to know PERSON in a caf\u00e9 where they drank alcoholic beverages together . Those persons explained that when PERSON drank alcohol he became talkative and that , in this intoxicated state , he complained about a lack of money and difficulties with his invalid mother . He had also confided to his companions that he had committed thefts and that , were he arrested , he \u201c would harm himself \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The investigator also noted a directive , classified as secret , for the attention of police officers . According to that directive , the police were not personally responsible for the life and health of individuals who had freely consented to attend a police station for an interview , \u201c except in the event of violation of the rights and freedoms of citizens proclaimed in the NORP LAW Regard being had to that directive and the facts noted , the investigator concluded that officer PERSON could not be held responsible for the offence of negligence .", "CARDINAL . The investigator concluded that PERSON death had been the result of a voluntary act on the latter \u2019s part . In consequence , the investigator refused to open a criminal investigation against the police officers PERSON , NORP , GPE . and PERSON for an abuse of power , on the grounds , firstly , that PERSON arrest had not been illegal , and , secondly , that the police officers had not ill - treated him . He also concluded that there were no grounds for prosecuting the police officers for homicide , assault or incitement to suicide , given that PERSON death \u201c had not been violent \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a judicial appeal against that decision . She complained , inter alia , that her son had been placed in detention without this fact being properly recorded , and that , in consequence , her son had been deprived of legal assistance . Equally , she submitted that the investigation carried out had been incomplete and focused on a hypothesis that was favourable to the police officers . She criticised the investigative authorities for failing to conduct a forensic examination of the gas mask seized in the police station in order to obtain genetic material , including perhaps that of her son . According to the applicant , a handwriting expert \u2019s report should also have been commissioned in order to determine her son \u2019s psychological state when he wrote the confession . Further , referring to the autopsy report , which stated that the corpse had injuries that could be interpreted as traces of a struggle or self - defence , the applicant accused the authorities of failing to explain the origin of those injuries , and the cause of her son \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the contested decision . In its reasoning , the court reiterated the arguments set out in the investigator \u2019s decision and considered that the investigation had been complete and thorough . In response to the applicant \u2019s arguments , the court expressed the opinion that a handwriting analysis was unnecessary , since the deceased \u2019s family had confirmed the handwriting \u2019s authenticity . Equally , a DNA examination of samples from the gas mask was unnecessary , since PERSON death had not resulted from suffocation . Thus , the court concluded that there was no evidence in support of the idea that the deceased had been subjected to ill - treatment by the police officers or that he had been arrested or detained unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision , on appeal , for the same reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer sent a letter to the head of ORG , asking him to open a new criminal investigation into the death of Mr PERSON and to entrust this investigation to the department for investigations into offences committed by ORG employees of the armed forces , a department that was part of ORG in the PERSON federal constituency . The lawyer expressed the fear that if the requested investigation were to be carried out by investigators from the GPE regional department of ORG , that investigation would be ineffective . She argued that , without having available to them locally - based agents to gather the necessary information , the investigators from the latter department would have no choice but to use officers from ORG , among whom might be those involved in the victim \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE regional department of ORG dismissed that request , considering that the decision of DATE had been in accordance with the law and that there were no grounds for revoking it and opening a criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE after his arrest , P. was taken to a temporary detention centre ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . During his admission , a doctor \u2019s assistant noted the following physical injuries : a bruise on the left shoulder - blade , scratches on the elbows and knees , and a bruise on the right ear . The medical assistant drew up a report recording the injuries and noting that they were the result of a road - traffic accident that had occurred on DATE . The medical examination was carried out in the presence of police officers who had participated in the beating . According to P. , it was the police officers who provided the medical assistant with the road - accident version of events , while he himself , for fear of reprisals , had been obliged to confirm it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE P. was transferred to remand prison no . CARDINAL in GPE . On admission , he was examined by a doctor who found the same injuries as those observed in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE P. lodged a complaint about the alleged ill - treatment at the police station . According to P. , this complaint led to him being taken on DATE to the police station , where he was beating in reprisal . Then DATE again according to his submissions \u2013 , PERSON withdrew his complaint in fear for his life when investigator PERSON . came to the remand prison to question him about the circumstances of the ill - treatment . According to P. , in response to his question about possible consequences for the police officers involved in beating Mr PERSON and himself , investigator PERSON . replied that , in any event , there had been none .", "CARDINAL . On DATE inspector Ya . from the GPE regional department of ORG issued a decision refusing to open a criminal investigation . She recounted the explanation provided by police officer GPE . , who had denied any ill - treatment , and , noting PERSON \u2019s withdrawal of his complaint , concluded that no ill - treatment had occurred .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the criminal investigation against ORG continued , and resulted in an examination on the merits by the GPE regional ORG . At the public hearing on DATE PERSON made a statement . He withdrew the account given by him in the context of the investigation into the death of PERSON . P. described the events of CARDINAL DATE as they are set out in paragraphs QUANTITY of the present judgment . He added that police officer PERSON had threatened him if he were to withdraw his confession to the thefts or make statements about the events surrounding the arrest and death of Mr PERSON . He added that PERSON had beaten him again prior to the court hearing concerning his placement in pre - trial detention , in order to prevent him lodging a complaint before the judge . He also alleged that he had been subjected to unprovoked attacks by the administration of the remand prison in which he was detained . P. asked to be placed under protection in his capacity as a witness of the ill - treatment inflicted on PERSON by police officers . He also asked that criminal proceedings be brought against police officer PERSON for abuse of power and for the murder of Mr PERSON . P. suggested that the criminal investigation into the death be reopened .", "CARDINAL . The judge ordered that ORG written statement be included in the case file . With regard to P. \u2019s requests in respect of PERSON and Mr PERSON , the judge replied that the latter \u2019s death was unrelated to the ongoing trial ; as for PERSON , he was not a party to the trial proceedings . In consequence , she dismissed those requests .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL of the subsequent hearings PERSON complained that , after the above statement , the remand prison \u2019s administration threatened him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor for the NORP district of GPE set aside the decision refusing to open a criminal investigation in respect of P. \u2019s supposed torturers . The prosecutor ordered an additional investigation . The ORG has not been informed of the outcome of this investigation .", "CARDINAL . After serving his sentence , PERSON was released . He submits that he has received several threats in connection with the present case . For fear of reprisals , he moved to GPE . In his letter of DATE to ORG , sent from abroad , P. offered to act as a witness , but he was never questioned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hierarchically superior ORG employee in the GPE regional department of ORG set aside the decision of DATE , noting that the department had received new information concerning the death of PERSON from ORG . He ordered an additional investigation , in particular so that P. could be questioned and his allegations of ill - treatment verified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputy head of the GPE regional department of ORG ordered the opening of a criminal investigation within the meaning of LAW . In his reasoning , he noted that PERSON application , which was being examined by ORG , contained elements suggesting that Mr PERSON had been subjected to ill - treatment by the police officers .", "DATE . On DATE investigator PERSON from ORG ordered a second forensic medical report , to answer , inter alia , the following questions : whether Mr PERSON \u2019s body showed injuries and , if so , where ; if the body showed injuries resulting from a struggle , ill - treatment , the use of handcuffs or restraint of the upper or lower limbs using adhesive tape ; and whether there were signs of electrocution .
