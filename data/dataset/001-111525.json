The applicant gave a statement to the officers . According to the minutes of his interrogation , the applicant confessed to CARDINAL count of attempted burglary , and then signed the document using his nickname , notwithstanding a prior reference in TIME noting that he was \u201c illiterate \u201d .

On DATE , at around TIME according to his own estimate , the GPE police again brought the applicant , together with several others , to their LOC in order to question him about a criminal offence . There was no prior attempt to serve him with the summons . The Government maintained that the reason for this had been the danger that the applicant might otherwise have absconded or tampered with the evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that his lawyer , ORG , had been informed of this arrest by his relatives and had hence managed to arrive in time to briefly talk to him before the interrogation . The applicant apparently told PERSON that he had already been physically abused by the police , who had attempted to obtain his confession . V.J.\u0110. himself stated that the applicant had seemed \u201c mentally broken \u201d and had been walking with a limp .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant , however , declined to do so and noted that he had retained V.J.\u0110. as his legal counsel . TIME of the interrogation further stated that the applicant was \u201c illiterate \u201d , and bore his fingerprint instead of a signature . With reference to LAW , the minutes , lastly , noted that the applicant had read them , at his own request , and had had no objections . The minutes were also signed by V.J.\u0110.", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that he had been provided with no food whilst in police custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at around TIME according to the applicant \u2019s own estimate , he was brought , yet again , by the GPE police to their LOC , without having been previously summoned . The Government maintained that , just like before , the reason for this had been the danger that the applicant might otherwise have absconded or tampered with the evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant claimed that he had once again been beaten by the officers who had attempted to obtain his confession . The applicant apparently asked that V.J.\u0110. be informed of his arrest , but the police ignored this demand . Instead , the applicant was provided with a legal aid lawyer , GPE , who , it is claimed , appeared only briefly to sign the minutes of the interrogation and left shortly thereafter .", "CARDINAL . The minutes in question contained : ( i ) an indication that the applicant was being charged with numerous counts of burglary ; ( ii ) his detailed confession of how he had committed those offences ; ( iii ) his statement to the effect that he did not want to retain ORG as his legal counsel ; and ( iv ) his declaration that he had given his statement in the absence of \u201c any physical or mental coercion \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The minutes further noted the questions posed by GPE , including whether the applicant was trying to protect anyone with his confession . ORG had been informed of the hearing on DATE at TIME , but did not attend it . Finally , the TIME stated that the applicant was \u201c illiterate \u201d , but then went on to note , with reference to LAW , that he had read them , at his own request , and had had no objections . The applicant did not sign the minutes , having instead left his fingerprint . The interrogation lasted TIME and TIME , following which the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that he had been provided with no food whilst in the police station .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at around TIME according to his own estimate or at TIME according to official records , the police arrested the applicant once more , but , this time , ordered his detention for a period of TIME . The applicant received no prior summons . He was , however , provided with a detention order , which stated that he had been deprived of his liberty on suspicion of having committed numerous burglaries . The order relied on a number of provisions of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but did not contain any substantiation as to the factual circumstances warranting the applicant \u2019s detention or his prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police issued a report supplementing the criminal charges against the applicant , as well as another CARDINAL defendants , concerning CARDINAL separate counts of burglary . The report included , inter alia , a description of the crimes and referred to the evidence obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE lodged an appeal on behalf of the applicant . Therein , inter alia , he maintained that the impugned detention order had been merely a template devoid of any meaningful reasoning . V.J.\u0110. further informed the investigating judge that , following her son \u2019s detention , the applicant \u2019s mother had been contacted by a lawyer who had offered his services . In particular , the lawyer had said that he knew that the applicant had already retained V.J.\u0110. but explained that it would be better for him to change legal counsel as this would facilitate his release from police custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE rejected the above appeal . She recalled , inter alia , that on DATE the applicant had been heard in the presence of his legal aid lawyer , that the prosecuting authorities had obtained several witness statements incriminating the applicant , and that the applicant had both been convicted of crimes in the past and had \u201c continued committing crimes \u201d thereafter . The judge lastly specified that there were CARDINAL separate criminal cases pending concurrently against the applicant before ORG in GPE , indicating that he had \u201c committed \u201d several property - related crimes in a short period of time . This , in turn , meant that , if released , the applicant was likely to re - offend and/or abscond .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , on DATE the applicant was examined by the on - duty doctor of FAC ( GPE zatvor ) in GPE , but \u201c no disease was established , i.e. he was [ deemed ] healthy \u201d . The Government provided a certificate to this effect issued by the prison doctor on DATE , as well as copies of the relevant medical protocol dated DATE . The said protocol , however , was mostly illegible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE requested that a preliminary judicial investigation ( istraga ) be instituted against the applicant in respect of numerous counts of burglary , and proposed that his detention be extended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge instituted the proceedings sought and extended the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE . Before so doing , she invited the applicant to give a statement in the presence of ORG and ORG and informed him about the evidence put forth by the prosecution . The applicant , however , refused to respond to the charges in question . He referred , instead , to the abuse suffered at the hands of the police , as well as the alleged breach of his procedural rights up to that point . In the reasoning as regards the applicant \u2019s continued detention , inter alia , the judge stated that the applicant could , if released , re - offend , abscond or unduly influence the witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s continued detention was confirmed by the CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG , which fully accepted the reasoning of the investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG CARDINAL - judge panel confirmed the investigating judge \u2019s decision to institute a preliminary judicial investigation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the investigating judge heard many witnesses , including witnesses GPE and GPE On DATE the former stated that his head had been slammed against the wall by the police in order to elicit his statement , whilst the latter recounted that he too had been threatened by the police with a baseball bat and for the same purpose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG indicted ( optu\u017eilo ) the applicant for the crimes in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V.J.\u0110. filed a formal objection against the indictment ( podneo prigovor protiv optu\u017enice ) , but on DATE the CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG rejected this objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V.J.\u0110. informed ORG that the applicant had recently been photographed by the police in prison . He requested clarification as to what had been the legal basis for this exercise , and expressed concern that the photograph could be used to unlawfully secure his client \u2019s identification in the course of future identity parades . The Government submitted that the applicant had been photographed only once , on DATE , upon admission to the prison , and , further , that this photograph had been used solely for the purpose of supplementing his prison identity papers ( li\u010dni list ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON wrote again to ORG , stating that on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE he had visited the applicant in prison , and that each time prison staff had been present during their conversations . Indeed , they had been close enough to be able to both hear and see everything . V.J.\u0110. requested an explanation as to why the applicant had not been entitled to unsupervised communication with his counsel . As it subsequently transpired , on DATE ORG had issued a standing permit ( stalna dozvola ) to ORG , authorising him to visit the applicant in prison . The said permit stated that visits could last up to CARDINAL minutes and take place under the supervision , i.e. in the presence , of an official to be designated by the prison governor . The ORG maintained that the supervision in question meant visual observation only , not listening to the conversations between the applicant and his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE CARDINAL hearings were held or adjourned before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the presence of ORG , the applicant described the abuse which he had suffered whilst in police custody , and gave a physical description of the officer who had engaged in his ill - treatment on DATE . The applicant added that on DATE he had sustained injuries to his legs and back , and had also been temporarily unable to hear on his left ear . Upon release the applicant went to a local hospital but was denied treatment because he had forgotten to bring his medical insurance card . When the applicant returned with this card , however , the hospital staff told him \u201c to come back DATE \u201d . On DATE , having been beaten by the officers once again , the applicant asked for V.J.\u0110. to be informed of his arrest , but officer PERSON refused to do so . Officer PERSON was also present . The applicant explained that he had , ultimately , been coerced into signing a statement already prepared by the police without his participation . At CARDINAL point , GPE , his police - appointed lawyer , appeared in the interrogation room merely in order to stamp and sign the same statement . As regards the charges against him , the applicant specifically denied some of them whilst in respect of others he refused to answer questions .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON stated that TIME and DATE were accurate , that he had not personally seen the applicant being abused or even heard anything to that effect . The officer also had no recollection as to whether the applicant had been duly summoned to appear before the police , but recalled that the applicant had constantly moved around , which was why he had been difficult to find .", "CARDINAL . Officer PERSON noted that he had not taken part in the interrogation of CARDINAL DATE , and had only a vague recollection of the interrogation which had taken place DATE . In particular , he remembered that the applicant had said that he did not want to retain V.J.\u0110. as his counsel since the latter had always advised him to give no statements to the police and he had already had enough of the repeated arrests and interrogations . PERSON had no information to offer as to whether the applicant had been duly summoned to appear before the police , but recalled that the applicant \u2019s police - appointed lawyer had been present throughout the interrogation . Finally , PERSON affirmed that the applicant \u2019s statement was accurately recorded in TIME of his interrogation , and added that he had personally informed the applicant of their content before he signed them .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL witnesses were subsequently heard before ORG , some of whom confirmed that they had \u201c bought merchandise \u201d from the applicant . Witness PERSON further stated , inter alia , that in DATE he had seen several persons fleeing a crime scene in a red car .", "CARDINAL . Witness PERSON , however , stated that the police had beaten him with a baseball bat in order to force him to confess to a number of crimes , as well as to incriminate the applicant . In support of this allegation he provided ORG with a copy of a medical certificate documenting his injuries of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Witness GPE stated that he had accompanied the applicant from the police station to the hospital , on which occasion he had seen that the applicant had been injured and had been \u201c walking with a limp \u201d ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . Witness GPE stated that he had been invited by the police to act as the applicant \u2019s legal aid lawyer on DATE . Prior to the interrogation , he had had a conversation with the applicant who had informed him that he had already retained legal counsel . The applicant was nevertheless willing to accept GPE as his lawyer on that occasion only and in order to be released ( da idem odavde ) . The applicant then confessed , in some detail , to the crimes in question . N.D. admitted that he had not inspected the case - file since the applicant had refused to communicate with him as regards the substance of the charges at issue , re - affirming that he had already retained a lawyer for this purpose . GPE added that the applicant had had no visible injuries at that time , and that he had warned the applicant that the confession given to the police would be used as evidence against him . Officer PERSON interrogated the applicant . He did so by posing questions concerning specific places , burglaries and stores . GPE lastly noted that he had not seen in DATE of practice a confession such as the applicant \u2019s , and had therefore asked the applicant whether he was \u201c protecting anyone \u201d . The applicant had maintained that he was not .", "CARDINAL . Witness PERSON denied any connection to the applicant , but stated that he too had been physically abused by the police on a number of occasions . PERSON also provided a medical certificate in this regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to exclude the applicant \u2019s statement of CARDINAL DATE from the case file . It explained , inter alia , that there was indeed evidence to the effect that the applicant had been repeatedly arrested without having first been properly summoned which , in and of itself , indicated a sort of police harassment aimed at obtaining his confession . Further , there was no doubt that the applicant had chosen V.J.\u0110. as his legal counsel and had never revoked this authorisation . The police , nevertheless , questioned the applicant in his chosen counsel \u2019s absence , and appointed a legal aid lawyer for no apparent reason .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Okru\u017eni sud ) in GPE quashed this decision and declared the applicant \u2019s statement of DATE legally valid . It noted that , as indicated in TIME , the applicant had specifically said that he did not want PERSON to act as his legal counsel . The issue of whether the applicant was duly summoned was irrelevant , and the conditions for the appointment of a legal aid lawyer were clearly fulfilled . The applicant was also properly advised of his procedural rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE officer PERSON stated that on DATE he had indentified a red car , which had apparently been seen leaving the crime scene , and had arrested the CARDINAL persons whom he and his colleague had found in or around it . These persons were subsequently taken by other officers to the police station .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the parties\u2019 closing arguments , found the applicant guilty of having , effectively , committed CARDINAL burglaries , i.e. QUANTITY DATE and DATE and CARDINAL on DATE , and sentenced him to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment for a single crime of \u201c extended burglary \u201d ( jedno produ\u017eeno krivi\u010dno delo te\u0161ke kra\u0111e ) . ORG further observed that there were CARDINAL separate criminal cases pending concurrently against the applicant and considered this as an aggravating circumstance in sentencing . The applicant \u2019s detention was prolonged until the judgment in his case became final . ORG also noted that , in the meantime , it had already reviewed and extended the applicant \u2019s detention on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , and that each time its decisions had been confirmed by ORG on appeal . As regards the applicant \u2019s conviction concerning the burglaries committed DATE and DATE , ORG took note of the applicant \u2019s confession of CARDINAL DATE , recalled that he had been found in possession of stolen property , and emphasised that several witnesses had confirmed that they had bought such property from the applicant . Concerning the burglary of CARDINAL DATE ORG relied on the applicant \u2019s confession of the same date and the statements given by witnesses ORG and ORG Testimony indicating that certain witnesses had been ill - treated by the police in order to incriminate the applicant was either dismissed as irrelevant or simply ignored .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG lodged an appeal , seeking a harsher sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE V.J.\u0110. filed an appeal on behalf of the applicant , noting , inter alia , that : ( i ) his statement of CARDINAL DATE had been obtained as a result of police brutality and in the absence of his chosen counsel , there being no other evidence which could have warranted a conviction ; ( ii ) the police - appointed lawyer had never offered any genuine legal representation to the applicant and had instead been there to assist the police in their interrogation ; ( iii ) the applicant \u2019s complaints of ill - treatment had simply been ignored by ORG ; ( iv ) the prison staff had not allowed the applicant free communication with his chosen counsel ; ( v ) the CARDINAL separate criminal proceedings which had been pending concurrently against the applicant could not lawfully have been taken into account as an aggravating circumstance , but that since they were this amounted to an implied breach of the applicant \u2019s right to be presumed innocent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeals lodged by the parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V.J.\u0110. filed an appeal on points of law ( zahtev za vanredno ispitivanje zakonitosti pravosna\u017ene presude ) on behalf of the applicant , re - stating his submissions made earlier .", "CARDINAL .
