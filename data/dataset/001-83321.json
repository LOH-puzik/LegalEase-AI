SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The CARDINAL applicants are identified below . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON , their Agent , who was succeeded in that function by PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant , ORG r.o . PERSON , is a private commercial limited liability company having its head office in PERSON and a separate legal personality under NORP law , distinct from that of its owners . The second and third applicants , PERSON and ORG , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON .", "In DATE the second applicant and the third applicant acquired jointly PERCENT of the shares in the first applicant . The second applicant is the first applicant \u2019s statutory representative . The second applicant at the same time holds shares in and is one of the statutory representatives of another commercial limited liability company ( \u201c company K \u201d ) . Company K was the founder of and held shares in the first applicant .", "In DATE company K made a credit arrangement with a bank in order to pay for the lease of machinery from a private lessor . In DATE the bank entered the leasing arrangement in that it obtained an option to buy the machinery at the end of the lease term for a residual value .", "In DATE the first applicant took over the debt owed to the bank on the condition that , at the end of the lease term , the bank would exercise its option and obtain and subsequently transfer the ownership of the machinery to the first applicant .", "The bank did not exercise the option , as a result of which the lessor was free to sell and did in fact sell the machinery to a third party . Company K thus lost a substantial component of its operations .", "In DATE the bank brought several actions against the first applicant claiming that it was in default of payment of the bank credit . The bank claimed damages .", "The actions were subsequently stayed pending the outcome of insolvency proceedings in respect of the first applicant ( see below ) . The proceedings have still not been resolved .", "On DATE the bank petitioned for an insolvency order against the first applicant . It was argued that the first applicant was in default of payment of the debt owed to the bank ; that it had several creditors ; and that it would be unable to meet its obligations in the near future .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) made the order , appointed an insolvency administrator and invited creditors to register their claims within DATE . The order was upheld on the first applicant \u2019s appeal by ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) on DATE , and became final and binding on DATE .", "By virtue of the insolvency order , pursuant to LAW ( a ) and ( h ) of LAW , the capacity to make dispositions in respect of the insolvent estate and to exercise rights and duties related to the making of dispositions in respect of the estate was transferred to the insolvency administrator and all powers of attorney granted by the first applicant automatically ceased to exist .", "The bank \u2019s claims against the first applicant were contested and , as a result , the bank had to seek their judicial recognition by way of a separate action ( inciden\u010dn\u00e1 \u017ealoba ) . The action was allowed at first instance on DATE , but the judgment was quashed on appeal on DATE and is still pending .", "By decisions ( opatrenie ) of DATE and DATE ORG authorised a direct sale without a public auction by the administrator of various movable and immovable items from the assets of the first applicant . The authorisation was not subject to appeal .", "Further items from the insolvent estate of the first applicant have been sold off in the course of the proceedings . The applicants maintain that the sales were based on manifestly unfavourable terms and that they were contrary to both substantive law and procedural rules . They complained on numerous occasions to ORG that the actions of the insolvency administrator in connection with the sale were illegal and contrary to their interests . All their complaints were to no avail . The insolvency proceedings as such are still pending .", "Under LAW of LAW , an insolvency court can replace the insolvency administrator on the motion of the insolvent person or the trustee provided there are important reasons .", "On DATE the first applicant , acting through a lawyer , lodged a petition ( podnet ) under LAW of LAW with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) contesting the insolvency order of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG declared the petition inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded . The first applicant \u2019s objections were held to be of a fourth - instance nature and , as such , fell outside the scope of ORG review .", "On DATE the second applicant lodged a fresh complaint ( s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 ) under LAW with ORG . He sought to contest , in the name of the first applicant , the length of the proceedings in the bank \u2019s civil actions and asserted that those proceedings had been marked by the violation of a variety of procedural rights .", "On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible ratione personae . It observed first of all that the complaint was intended to be brought in the name of the first applicant . However , by virtue of the insolvency order , the capacity to act in the name of the first applicant had passed to the administrator ( LAW ( a ) of LAW ) , civil actions against it had been ex lege stayed ( LAW ( d ) of LAW ) and could be resumed solely on motion by the administrator ( LAW ) and any new proceedings could commence only on motion by the administrator ( LAW ( c ) of LAW ) . The present complaint had however not been brought by the administrator or her lawful agent and , therefore , could not be accepted as having been lodged in the name of the first applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
