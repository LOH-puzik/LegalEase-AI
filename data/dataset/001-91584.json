RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Ms Lidiya Aleksandrovna Podrugina and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in the town of Petrozavodsk in GPE . They were represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON PERSON , the former Representative of GPE at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants sought judicial recognition of the fact that they had been prisoners of war during World War II . Such a declaration was a precondition for claiming a statutory DATE allowance from the ORG . The ORG was represented by a local ORG in those proceedings .", "By judgment of DATE , the ORG of GPE granted the applicants\u2019 claim . The court found that at the time the applicants had been forced to work and had not been allowed to leave the territory of the village .", "On an unspecified date , the President of ORG lodged a request for supervisory review of the above judgment . On DATE the Presidium of ORG granted his request , quashed the judgment and rejected the ORG claims . The ORG court found that in the absence of documentary evidence , including archive sources , or other evidence the above circumstances were insufficient for concluding that the village had served as a concentration camp . The court concluded that the applicants could not be considered as prisoners of war . The applicants were not present at the supervisory review hearing .", "From DATE to DATE the applicants received the allowance , varying from CARDINAL to MONEY per month . After the annulment of the judgment in their favour , they were not required to reimburse the monies received during that period .", "On DATE ORG ( the \u201c Authority \u201d ) , a specialised ORG agency , took over responsibility for making allowance payments .", "In DATE the applicants brought new proceedings before ORG asking for a judicial confirmation of the fact that DATE they had been living in a village occupied by ORG and thus indeed been prisoners of war . The ORG was represented by ORG in those proceedings .", "By judgments of DATE and DATE , ORG granted the second and first ORG claims respectively . In PERSON PERSON \u2019s case , the court heard CARDINAL persons who had resided at the time in the same village , and had regard to an expert opinion .", "No appeal was lodged and the above judgments became final . On the basis of those judgments , on unspecified dates the applicants applied to ORG for a statutory allowance , which they subsequently received until DATE and DATE respectively .", "In DATE ORG applied for supervisory review of the judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , contending that it had not been aware of them in good time and thus could not request their supervisory review within the statutory period of DATE . The ORG contended that the above judgments concerned the same matter that had already been determined in DATE proceedings .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG extended the timelimit for lodging of the ORG \u2019s request for supervisory review . The court accepted the ORG \u2019s argument that it had learnt about the DATE proceedings on DATE , when ORG had provided it with the lists of persons no longer entitled to an allowance . ORG and not the ORG had been involved in the DATE proceedings .", "On DATE the Presidium of ORG of GPE quashed the judgment of DATE and discontinued the proceedings . The court found that the matter had already been examined in DATE and had been finally determined by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . Apparently , the first applicant was not present at the supervisory - instance hearing and obtained a copy of its ruling on an unspecified date . According to the Government , a copy of the supervisory review ruling was dispatched to her on DATE .", "The applicant was not required to reimburse the monies received in DATE and DATE .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG refused to extend the time - limit for bringing supervisory review proceedings . The court found that the ORG should have been aware of the judgment of DATE since it had been making regular payments to the applicant on that basis ; a copy of that judgment had been in the applicant \u2019s pension file since DATE . Hence , the ORG could have challenged the judgment by way of supervisory review within the DATE time - limit .", "On DATE ORG of GPE quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the matter to ORG . It held that the ORG had learnt about the relevant fact , namely the existence of CARDINAL contradictory judgments ( dated DATE and DATE ) , only in DATE .", "On DATE ORG extended the time - limit for lodging of the NORP request for supervisory review . The applicant did not appeal .", "On DATE the Presidium of ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and discontinued the proceedings . The court found that the matter had already been examined in DATE and had been finally determined by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant was not required to reimburse the monies received in DATE and DATE .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a judge should refuse to deal with a claim if there is a final judgment between the same parties on the same subject - matter and on the same legal grounds ( \u043f\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c ) . In such a situation , a claimant can not bring new proceedings against the same respondent in relation to the same subject - matter and on the same legal grounds .", "Under LAW , judicial decisions that have become legally binding , with the exception of judicial decisions by the Presidium of ORG of GPE , may be appealed against to a court exercising supervisory review , by parties to the case and by other persons whose rights or legal interests have been adversely affected by the judicial decisions concerned ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . ORG decisions may be appealed against to a court exercising supervisory review within DATE after they became legally binding ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . By its ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG interpreted LAW as allowing the above - mentioned persons to apply for supervisory review only after having exhausted all available ordinary appeals ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
