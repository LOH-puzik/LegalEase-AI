Although ORG established that the ticket had been in fact bought in TIME DATE , it held that this fact was \u201c of no legal significance \u201d and ruled that the applicant had not been deprived of his liberty .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that the NORP authorities had not prevented the applicant from reuniting with his son in any country other than GPE .

If such a decision has been given , the foreign national has to leave GPE or will otherwise be deported .

The concept of expulsion is used in a generic sense as meaning any measure compelling the departure of an alien from the territory but does not include extradition . Expulsion in this sense is an autonomous concept which is independent of any definition contained in domestic legislation .
