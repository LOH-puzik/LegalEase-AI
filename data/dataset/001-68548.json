The QUANTITY police officers and PERSON then withdrew to what they believed to be a safe distance from the LOC and Acting PERSON summoned assistance , including ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) . This request was timed at TIME", "CARDINAL . During the course of the incident which followed , radio traffic was monitored within ORG ( \u201c FIR \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL .

At TIME Inspector PERSON arrived and took front line charge of the situation .", "CARDINAL . Radio communication between Police PERSON and Acting PERSON on ' talk - through ' mode , so that the ORG would hear , conveyed the wrong impression that the LOC in question were confined to the ground floor . There was in fact an upper floor . This erroneous impression prevailed until it was corrected as a result of information provided by PERSON at TIME", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG had CARDINAL nominated ARVs on duty at all times . In order to provide maximum cover , they were deployed to the north and south of the county .

Officer B issued the same instruction . The occupant appeared to take no notice of the command to drop the handgun and returned to the inside of the flat .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the armed officers decided that the only way to contain the building , and also to provide armed support to their unarmed colleagues , was to deploy one of them at the front of the LOC and the other at the rear .

Following the arrival of Officer D , Officer B reviewed his position and decided that he was not ideally placed to deal with the occupant should he decide to leave the LOC . Officer B decided that it would be better to take up a position behind CARDINAL cars parked in the courtyard car park on the other side ( the premises / courtyard side ) of the rear wall .

At CARDINAL p.m. the officers at the rear of the LOC queried whether the flat LOC in fact extended to the first floor . Acting Police Sergeant Morris obtained information from PERSON that the flat did extend over CARDINAL floors : the ground floor and the first floor .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , Officer A , at the front of the LOC , was in communication with the ORG operator and said :", "\u201c Can you put on the incident scene log that he 's still coming to the front door and he is brandishing a handgun . He is not opening the door but he is making sure that it 's pointed towards us through the glass ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

According to the applicant , Inspector PERSON informed Superintendent Battle that there was a suggestion that the man in the LOC might be PERSON who owned imitation firearms , although this could not be confirmed .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL p.m. Police Constable PERSON arrived at the scene . He was the Tactical Firearms Adviser ( a functionary required on all police firearms operations ) . Both Superintendent Battle and Police Constable PERSON reviewed the plan adopted by the ORG teams , and their deployments , and were satisfied with the decisions taken .", "CARDINAL . Following his arrival Superintendent Battle telephoned the flat on his mobile telephone to establish that the telephone inside was working and that the number obtained did indeed relate to the LOC : he thought such information would be of benefit to negotiators when they arrived at the scene . This took place at QUANTITY", "CARDINAL . At first Superintendent Battle obtained the answer machine . The second time the occupant answered . Superintendent Battle ( who , according to the Government , had considerable knowledge of the principles of negotiations ) said : \u201c I 'm PERSON . I 'm a police officer . \u201d He told the occupant that the house was surrounded by armed officers and requested that he should not go to the window or doors with a weapon , but that he should put the weapon down .", "DATE .

Despite efforts to engage him in further conversation , the man put the telephone receiver down and the call was concluded .", "CARDINAL . The Government informed the ORG in a letter of DATE that when the occupant identified himself to Superintendent Battle as \u201c PERSON , this information was relayed over the police radio and the officers at the scene used this name in their various challenges to the deceased . The applicant 's legal representative , on receipt of this information , noted in the applicant 's observations that this \u201c fresh information \u201d had not been disclosed to them at the time of the inquest .", "CARDINAL . During the incident ( but unknown to the police ) CARDINAL other telephone calls were made to the LOC . The first was made by PERSON , PERSON brother . The second , at CARDINAL p.m. , was made by PERSON , a friend of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Neither PERSON nor PERSON reported their telephone conversations with PERSON to the police , even though it was clear from the conversations that PERSON realised that he was surrounded by police . According to PERSON , PERSON sounded tired and said : \u201c I think they are going to storm the house . \u201d The telephone then went dead .", "CARDINAL . Inspector PERSON was of the opinion that the incident was likely to become protracted and shortly after CARDINAL p.m. she gave instructions over the radio for night duty personnel to be called out and requested a log to be brought to the scene .", "CARDINAL . At TIME a message was received by ORG from Detective Constable ORG , who had obtained information to the effect that at CARDINAL TIME had been in the ORG public house . It was reported that he had been very drunk , wearing blue jeans , a grey shirt and no coat . This information was passed on to Inspector PERSON by ORG , but in doing so they transmitted the time of the sighting DATE This information reinforced the belief that the person within the LOC was not PERSON since PERSON had called the police at QUANTITY", "CARDINAL . At QUANTITY the occupant of the flat moved from the ground floor to the rear first floor bedroom . He opened the casement window and pointed his gun from just over the windowsill in the direction of Officer D , who was at the rear of the LOC behind a vehicle . Both Officers D and B became very concerned by this development . The occupant pushed his handgun through the open window and then withdrew it after shouts from the officers .", "CARDINAL . Within TIME of this first incident the occupant reappeared at the window , but this time stood up in full view of the officers . He was naked from the waist up .", "CARDINAL . The occupant adopted a CARDINAL - handed stance through the open window with his arms outstretched . He was holding what appeared to be a gun . He aimed the gun at the officers at the rear of the LOC . Police PERSON thought that he was going to be shot and dived to the ground . In his statement made after the event , he stated :", "\u201c ... the man held his arms and pistol in front of him and as he deliberately brought the gun up to his eyes ( ... ) I looked and could see that I was looking down the bore of the barrel his eyes were on the sights and he appeared to be pointing the weapon directly at me . I instinctively ducked as I was convinced the man was aiming directly at me and I was convinced I was going to be shot . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Officer B observed through his gun sight that the barrel of the handgun appeared to be pointing directly at him . He was afraid for his own safety and shouted : \u201c Armed police . Drop the gun or you will be shot . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The occupant remained in his threatening stance . Officer B then squeezed the trigger of his carbine and fired CARDINAL shot which hit the occupant in the chest .", "CARDINAL . Officer B was interviewed on DATE at ORG . He said :", "\u201c And he aims the gun , looking through the scope , I see the barrel of the gun and he 's , the best way I can describe it , just like a police target , the same we are taught to shoot , he 's got a solid base , he 's got both hands on the gun , it 's in front of his eyes , I can see the barrel of the gun , through my scope , and I can see the barrel lined up with him and it was aimed straight down my gun sight . Erm , and I say to be honest it frightened me to death ( ... ) I shouted ' ARMED POLICE DROP THE GUN OR YOU WILL BE SHOT ' I shouted that very loudly and clearly at him . Erm he just continued staying in the same position , rock steady , erm , and then I took the decision to squeeze the trigger and shoot and I shot him . ( ... )", "I thought if that gun goes off I 'm gon na be seriously injured or killed PERSON you could see the size of the barrel , it was a large calibre weapon , hand gun , that was all I could see . Erm and I thought was gon na be shot , if I did n't do something . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant draws attention to the fact that Officer B 's statement was never disclosed and was never subjected to forensic scrutiny or comment in any public forum .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL civilian witness , PERSON , a local resident , heard the police command : \u201c Drop your gun or we will shoot \u201d , followed by a single shot . The shot was fired at CARDINAL p.m.", "CARDINAL . Officer D , who was with Officer B , was on the verge of shooting at the time the shot was fired . In a statement made after the event he stated :", "\u201c I then saw that the gun was still in his hand and he was holding it with both hands with arms straight out , this conveyed to me that he was going to take aim to fire the weapon at [ Officer B ] . I took the safety off my weapon and took sight on him and put pressure on the trigger and was going to fire when I heard a bang . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The officers , together with paramedics already at the scene , entered the building at CARDINAL p.m. They found PERSON lying face down on the bed in the rear bedroom . They rendered first aid , but at CARDINAL p.m. Michael Fitzgerald was pronounced dead .", "CARDINAL . The scene was preserved as a major crime scene .", "CARDINAL . The armed officers went to the Police Headquarters firearms range where they separately compiled their pocket book notes and gave their firearms for forensic examination . The examination revealed that a bullet had been discharged from the weapon belonging to Officer B. No other weapons had been fired .", "CARDINAL . The Home Office pathologist confirmed that the cause of death was a single gun shot wound to the chest and that the pattern of injuries was consistent with having been shot in the manner described by Officer PERSON sample of PERSON blood revealed QUANTITY of alcohol per QUANTITY of blood . This would have made an individual of moderate drinking habits either extremely drunk or comatose .", "CARDINAL . PERSON handgun was a replica Colt .CARDINAL calibre self - loading pistol . It had the appearance of an authentic weapon and only very close examination reveals it to be a replica .", "CARDINAL . Following the shooting it was discovered that PERSON had spent TIME drinking . He had left his jacket with the keys to his home in a public house . He was seen walking in the direction of his home by a taxi driver , at TIME , who described him as very drunk .", "CARDINAL . On being informed of the fatal shooting of PERSON , the Deputy Chief Constable of GPE Police , PERSON , voluntarily referred the matter to ORG in order that it might supervise the investigation into the killing .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , Assistant Chief Constable of FAC , was appointed as ORG . The essential purpose of the investigation was to inquire into the facts of the incident and to establish whether or not there had been a breach of the criminal law or police discipline . At the outset of the investigation ORG appointed a family liaison officer to assist PERSON next - of - kin . During the investigation , a senior member of the investigation team visited the family on several occasions to keep them up - to - date on the progress in the investigation .", "CARDINAL . Officers B and PERSON as well as Superintendent Battle were interviewed in the course of the investigation . The other officers who attended the scene or had a part to play in the incident made witness statements outlining their roles and responsibilities . The civilian employees of ORG also made witness statements , as did members of the public including the family of PERSON . Radio traffic within the ORG , which is tape - recorded , was transcribed , as was the control room tape . A crime analyst from ORG was employed to scrutinise all the witness statements , the interviews taken under caution and the tape recording transcriptions .", "CARDINAL . The report prepared by Mr PERSON was submitted to ORG on DATE . A copy of the report and evidence was sent to the Deputy Chief Constable of GPE Police and to ORG . The latter later concluded that there was no evidence to justify any criminal proceedings against any police officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent a copy of an Interim Statement on the investigation to PERSON brother . This Interim Statement had been issued shortly after the submission of the report by Mr PERSON . The Interim Statement recorded that Mr PERSON ' final report had been received on DATE and was supported by CARDINAL statements , CARDINAL documents and CARDINAL appendices including photographic evidence and plans of the scene of the incident . The Interim Statement concluded that \u201c the investigation into the death of Mr PERSON [ had ] been undertaken to the satisfaction of ORG \u201d . Also in DATE , ORG notified PERSON brother that a review of the case would be carried out by CARDINAL of its members at the conclusion of the inquest .", "CARDINAL . In his report , Mr PERSON concluded that Officer B had not committed a criminal offence and stated :", "\u201c I have examined the circumstances of this incident in detail and made CARDINAL visits to the scene . I have read all the accounts of the officers present and other relevant witness statements including the forensic analysis . I have examined the transcription of the Information Room tape recording and other relevant documents . I am satisfied that [ Officer B ] genuinely believed he was facing an intruder armed with a firearm and that his life was in imminent danger . He did not know that the weapon was incapable of being discharged and he gave the man the chance to withdraw in a pressurised situation . \u201d", "DATE . Mr PERSON investigated the reason why a negotiator had not been present at the scene and stated :", "\u201c Difficulty was experienced during the early stages in obtaining a trained negotiator . ORG have a cadre of CARDINAL ' Tier One ' negotiators trained to a national standard ... and CARDINAL ' Tier Two ' negotiators , who have been selected as being suitable to attend the National Negotiator 's Course but who are , as yet , untrained . The ORG policy is that one ' Tier One ' and one ' Tier Two ' negotiator will be available at all times including ' call out ' times . Unfortunately on DATE there was a Negotiator 's Conference being held at GPE . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL ' Tier One ' negotiators were at the Conference . The remaining Tier One negotiator PERSON was , according to the log , uncontactable . The Information Room log indicates that he was playing CARDINAL - a - side football ... The frustration of the situation is all too evident when the log is scrutinised . At TIME the log reads : ' No tier CARDINAL negotiator available they all are at a conference according to info . from other . There is no tier CARDINAL call out at all . ' At TIME the log reads : ' Unable to raise the negotiator other than by going through list CARDINAL by CARDINAL until finding someone willing to attend \u2013 call out totally useless or most recent update inaccurate . No response from any of the pager messages sent . ' ORG at DATE TIME the log reads : ' ORG . PERSON and PERSON . PERSON , both tier CARDINAL negotiators , on route to GPS . ' The Information Room Inspector states that an attempt was made to contact PERSON both on his home number and on his pager . ORG states that he had both his mobile phone and his pager with him , that they were both switched on , and that he did not receive a call on either of them . I have been unable to resolve this issue ... The difficulty experienced in contacting a ' Tier One ' negotiator is a serious example of how poor co - ordination and planning can lead to real operational difficulty . The difference in skill levels between a Tier One and Tier CARDINAL negotiator should , in normal circumstances , be significant . The early arrival of a ' Tier One ' negotiator might have made a difference . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON concluded his report by stating :", "\u201c This was a tragic incident . PERSON had been suffering from a number of personal pressures including unemployment , rising debt and the grief of his mother 's death . He turned increasingly to drink and was an alcoholic . It is very sad that on TIME a series of unusual events came together and led to his death . First , PERSON left his jacket and keys behind in a pub ; second , unusually , he attempted to gain entry to his flat by the window ; third , his girlfriend happened to arrive just as he was disappearing into the kitchen ; fourth , his girlfriend mistook him for a burglar ; fifth , neither PERSON 's brother , PERSON , nor friend PERSON reported their telephone conversations with PERSON to the police ; sixth , no clear information emerged about PERSON 's identity prior to his death ; and seventh , PERSON , for whatever reason , we will never know , decided to aim a replica firearm to challenge armed police . \u201d", "CARDINAL . During the investigation witness statements were taken from approximately CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stresses that the radio logs / transcripts and transmissions referred to were never disclosed , despite requests for them during the subsequent inquest . Furthermore , Mr PERSON ' report and conclusions were never disclosed to the applicant or to the deceased 's family or made available for public scrutiny at the inquest . In addition , she and the deceased 's family were at all times unaware that CARDINAL witnesses had been heard . The Coroner disclosed CARDINAL witness statements to the family , and the family was therefore unable to consider whether other potential witnesses should have been called .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG confirmed the findings of the police investigation that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the GPE police officers involved in the incident . ORG was satisfied with the thoroughness of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The death was reported to Mr PERSON , the GPE and GPE , by the police .", "CARDINAL . The inquest was opened on CARDINAL DATE and then adjourned sine die to allow ORG to complete its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at a preliminary hearing to which all the interested parties including the press were invited , the Coroner ruled that the CARDINAL armed officers should remain anonymous and should not be identified by the media . They were to be known as A , B , C and D , of whom B had fired the fatal shot .", "CARDINAL . Counsel representing PERSON family firmly objected to the grant of anonymity to these officers , arguing that the inquest was meant to be a forum subject to public scrutiny and that justice should be seen to be done in an open manner , particularly where citizens die at the hands of agents of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In deciding to direct that the armed officers should be known as A , B , C and D , the Coroner accepted that there was a genuine concern on the part of each of the officers , and particularly Officer B , that he and his family could be exposed to verbal and physical abuse if his name were to be disclosed , having regard to the fact that he lived near the scene of the incident . The Coroner ( according to the Government , without objection from any party ) also used his knowledge of previous threats and abuse directed against Officer B and his family following another incident , not involving a shooting , where he had been acting in accordance with his police duties . The applicant points out that it was never raised as a ground at the hearing on DATE ( nor at the actual inquest ) that any officer had suffered any threat , and that in any event the previous threats to Officer B were not in relation to a shooting and could not be construed as serious .", "CARDINAL . The Coroner made it clear that it was open to any party , including the press , to make an application to lift the anonymity order if further information or circumstances warranted it .", "CARDINAL . The Coroner was provided with the witness statements and exhibits gathered in the course of Mr PERSON ' investigation . The Coroner decided that there should be disclosure of the statements made by CARDINAL witnesses whose evidence he considered material to establishing the relevant facts . According to the applicant , the Coroner misled the family as to the number of witnesses by informing their counsel at the preliminary hearing on DATE that there were only approximately CARDINAL witnesses to the incident of whom CARDINAL witness statements were relevant and were to be disclosed for the full inquest hearing on DATE .", "By a letter dated DATE , the family 's legal representative sought disclosure of further materials . The report prepared by Mr PERSON was not among the documents sought . The Coroner decided that the family should be provided with the witness statements of Officers C and NORP and Superintendent Battle as well as a schedule containing the times of all the important events derived from the radio logs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the inquest proper began . The Coroner made a further decision to the effect that A , B , C and D should remain anonymous . The Coroner gave his reasons for this decision in writing and included among his reasons the following :", "\u201c The predominant reasons for granting anonymity for the particular officers beyond my own local knowledge and experience are", "a ) GPE police is a small force with a handful only of armed response officers . The naming of officers ' A ' , ' C ' and ' D ' would be likely to identify by default officer B.", "b ) All CARDINAL officers have expressed fear if their names are made public in this context the privacy and safety of both themselves and their families could be at risk . Some officers live near the locus in quo .", "c ) Whilst there may be no threat emanating from the deceased 's family there are serious and violent criminals living and operating within the locality and identification of members of the armed response team would not be either in the interest of those individuals or in the public interest . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Coroner also ruled that the officers could give evidence from behind a screen . They would , however , be seen by the Coroner , the legal representatives for each of the parties and the jury .", "CARDINAL . The inquest continued for DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the course of the inquest the Coroner summoned witnesses to give evidence of the events leading to PERSON death . These witnesses , who included police officers B , C and D , were cross - examined by counsel representing the family . The jury visited the scene of the incident .", "CARDINAL . The Coroner refused to accede to the family 's request to call the police negotiator at the inquest , stating that his evidence was irrelevant since he had played no part in the incident . He further declined to allow in evidence the police radio logs on communications passing between the officers on TIME CARDINAL DATE as well as the computer printouts since these materials , like the police negotiator , \u201c would not have added to the knowledge and understanding of those matters which the jury were obliged by law to address . \u201d However , at the request of the jury and counsel for the family , Detective Sergeant Denton provided a statement setting out the times of the material events derived from the radio logs and the transcripts of the transmission .", "CARDINAL . The applicant points out that Superintendent Battle conceded at the inquest when cross - examined by the family 's legal representative that it might not have been wise of him to have identified himself to the deceased as a police officer , bearing in mind that negotiators should have the appearance of being neutral so that some trust is built up between the person under siege and the negotiator .", "CARDINAL . At the conclusion of the evidence the Coroner summed up the case to the jury and , after hearing submissions from counsel representing the parties , the ORG 's direction on the law included the following :", "\u201c I find , as a matter of law , for reasons which I do not need to explain to you , that the only verdict that you can come to in this inquest \u2013 and I so direct \u2013 is a verdict that PERSON was lawfully killed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Coroner went on to explain that any explanation of the verdict was a matter for the jury to decide .", "CARDINAL . The jury returned a verdict of lawful killing and added a recommendation to their verdict that the ORG Secretary should ban replica firearms of the type found in PERSON possession .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an article entitled \u201c Cops knew that gun was replica \u201d was published in the ' GPE on DATE ' newspaper . It was reported that a laboratory technician , PERSON , a neighbour of PERSON , had informed the police at TIME of the incident that PERSON had CARDINAL replica guns at his home . The Coroner was in possession of a statement made by PERSON , dated DATE . This statement , made DATE after the incident , had been provided to the GPE investigation . PERSON did not mention in her statement that she had told the police at the relevant time that PERSON possessed replica firearms . She stated that she had heard and seen an incident developing outside PERSON flat . She had been in her premises with PERSON and :", "\u201c ... both of us decided to go down and see if we could help . When we went out onto the street , PERSON [ Joy ] was still crying . We were asked by an officer if we could look after PERSON which we agreed and we were advised not to go into my flat and keep away from the windows . Due to this PERSON , PERSON and myself went into PERSON 's flat ... after this we all began ringing the local pubs of PERSON 's to try and locate him . The only positive reply we got was from the ORG pub who said he 'd been in there and left with CARDINAL blokes from the PERSON pub . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In relation to her knowledge of PERSON , she stated :", "\u201c I personally have been into PERSON 's flat on numerous occasions , but not so much recently due to his increasing drinking , the last time I was in there was DATE . I was aware that PERSON possessed CARDINAL imitation firearms which were displayed on the wall of his lounge above the stairway recess ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON had provided a statement to the police investigation , also dated DATE . This statement was consistent with PERSON and it also contained no suggestion that PERSON had told the police officers at the time of the incident that the guns in PERSON home were replicas or that the occupant of the premises possessed a replica firearm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , the proprietor and publisher of \u201c GPE On DATE \u201d , which is a DATE newspaper circulating in the GPE area , applied for judicial review of the Coroner 's decision to grant anonymity to Officers A , B , C and NORP", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the application for judicial review was dismissed by Mr Justice PERSON , who stated :", "\u201c ... in relation to officer B the Coroner was taking into account ... the fact that there was a public interest and also a special need for care and a potential risk of injury and danger in relation to B as a member of the armed response group , in addition to the other ground ... namely his fear in relation to the previous incident amounting to a reasonably objective , attested ground for fear in relation to his particular safety and that of his family .", "Once there were CARDINAL such grounds that in my view enabled the Coroner to say that there was sufficient reason for anonymity provided that he then carried out ... a balancing exercise . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON concluded that the Coroner had correctly carried out the balancing exercise and that there had been evidence which entitled the Coroner to conclude that anonymity was necessary in the interests of justice and in order to avoid any risk of injury .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought legal aid to pursue proceedings for judicial review of the inquest verdict . This request and a subsequent appeal were refused by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the inquest , in a letter dated DATE , ORG informed the applicant that the investigation had been thorough and had addressed the family 's concerns that the police had acted too quickly and had not explored all the options . The letter continued :", "\u201c ( ... ) neither the investigation nor the subsequent inquest has disclosed evidence on which to seriously challenge any of the police actions . At the time PERSON died , police operations were being managed by a senior officer with considerable experience in firearms incidents who described the attention and planning which he gave to the various decisions needed .", "There was clear evidence that the situation could not have been effectively contained if officers were placed behind the brick wall at the rear of the house . This view was supported by ORG own firearms experts and is consistent with national guidelines and training . The repeated giving of warnings is required under the manual and I have to say the police would be at risk of very serious criticism if none or fewer warnings had been given .", "There was no evidence that the presence of a top level trained negotiator would have caused a different outcome to what actually happened . The evidence suggests the contrary - that even if one had been present at the time of the shooting , he or she would not have been prevented the train of events which led to your brother 's death .", "GPE Police accept that there was confusion on TIME as to which officers with level CARDINAL negotiating training were available to go to the scene . I am told that call - out rotas are now entered on the force command and control computer , which should reduce the chances of delays in the future due to difficulties in contacting the necessary staff . The problems arose due to a poor information system which has now attracted the required management response . I do not consider that this is a matter which justifies any disciplinary action .", "( ... ) \u201d", "CARDINAL . Inquests are governed by LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) and Coroners Rules DATE ( \u201c the Rules \u201d ) .

It is the function of an inquest , as defined by LAW ( CARDINAL)(b ) of LAW CARDINAL of the Rules , that a coroner and a jury shall look into and determine CARDINAL essential matters : who the deceased was , and where , when and how the deceased came by his / her death .", "CARDINAL . There is no legal aid for representation at inquests . Prior to DATE , there was no right to disclosure of documents . In NORP v. GPE ex parte PERSON ( [ DATE ] QB CARDINAL ) , ORG held that as no allegation was made against the family natural justice did not require disclosure of documents to the family and the Coroner had no power to hand over material against the wishes of those who supplied him with it . Since DATE , and as regards inquests into deaths occurring in police custody , there is a presumption in favour of disclosure of information held by authorities in advance of the inquest hearing . According to paragraph CARDINAL of the new voluntary protocol on disclosure , disclosure of the investigating officer 's report as part of a supervised ORG investigation will not normally be expected to form part of the pre - inquest disclosure . That does not mean , however , that it is impossible for such a report to be disclosed where a chief officer considers it would be right to do so . Pursuant to the protocol \u201c he or she should seek the views of ORG and others with an interest in the report . \u201d If disclosure of the report is ordered \u201c the views and expressions of opinion of the investigating officer should be redacted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It has been consistently emphasised in the domestic case - law that an inquest is an inquisitorial fact - finding exercise , and not a method of apportioning guilt .

This principle is expressed in Rule CARDINAL of the DATE Rules . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In LOC , ex parte PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ALL E R ] ) , ORG clarified the extent of the discretion of a Coroner not to leave to the jury what is , on the evidence , a possible verdict .

He , for example , need not leave all possible verdicts just because there is technically evidence to support them . It is sufficient if he leaves those verdicts which realistically reflect the thrust of the evidence as a whole . To leave all possible verdicts could in some situations merely confuse and overburden the jury and if that is the coroner 's conclusion he can not be criticised if he does not leave a particular verdict . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

No public inquest was ever carried out into the circumstances of the killing . An investigation was conducted by a serving official of ORG as well as by ORG . Both investigations were conducted in private with minimal or no participation by the family of the deceased . Having reviewed the case - law of ORG CARDINAL , Lord PERSON of PERSON concluded that the minimum standards laid down by the ORG had not been complied with . The form of the investigation was deficient , regard being had in particular to the absence of public scrutiny of the investigation , the lack of involvement of the deceased 's family and , as regards the official investigation , the lack of independence of the official in charge of the inquiry .", "CARDINAL .

ORG ( Lord Justice PERSON ) found that neither of the investigations conducted satisfied the minimum procedural obligations under LAW .

The jury recorded an open verdict . Following an application for judicial review by the deceased 's family , ORG ordered that the verdict be quashed and that a new inquest be held before a different Coroner . ORG ( Mr Justice PERSON ) found a number of deficiencies in the way in which the proceedings had been conducted ; firstly , the Coroner had allowed evidence of the deceased 's criminal convictions , although irrelevant , to be heard by the jury ; secondly , the Coroner had allowed the jury to be apprised of ORG conclusion following a police investigation into the killing to the effect there was insufficient evidence to justify the bringing of criminal proceedings against the officers involved ; thirdly , the Coroner should have heard independent expert evidence on whether the use by the police officers of their firearms had been justified in the circumstances ; fourthly , in the light of the credible accusation of at least manslaughter by the officers involved , the Coroner failed to justify his decisions by explaining , even briefly , why he was not prepared to leave to the jury the verdicts which the family wished the jury to consider . On this point , Mr Justice PERSON held that \u201c it will be exceptional for a coroner not to explain , albeit briefly , why he is not prepared to allow the jury to consider a verdict sought by the deceased family 's and in relation to which there has been some relevant evidence \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
