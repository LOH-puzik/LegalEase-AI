In a letter of DATE , the ORG notified her that , in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of LAW , only periods of work in GPE could be taken into account in calculating the pensions of foreign nationals or stateless persons who had been resident in GPE on DATE .

Before DATE , persons resident in NORP territory were covered by the same social security scheme as the rest of the population of the GPE . In particular , the pension system at the time was based not on the contribution principle but on the solidarity principle . All pensions were paid from ORG funds , a portion of the ORG \u2019s revenue being set aside for pensions . More specifically , employees themselves were not subject to social tax , which was paid by their employers . The social - insurance contributions paid by the various employers were transferred via trade unions to ORG , managed by ORG . Those funds were then redistributed among the SSRs for very different purposes , including the payment of retirement pensions , and the amount of a pension did not depend directly on the amount of tax previously paid to the tax authorities . There was also a personal income tax , part of which was paid to the GPE central tax authorities and the rest to the local tax authorities of the relevant SSR . However , personal income - tax revenues were practically never used for pension payments .", "CARDINAL .

This shall fully apply to citizens of the GPE who wish to live in GPE without acquiring NORP nationality\u2019 .", "On DATE , DATE after adopting the LAW , ORG ... passed LAW . Entitlement to a State pension was granted to all persons residing in GPE whose place of residence at the time of the LAW \u2019s entry into force on DATE was in GPE . The Act provided for the right to social cover in old age . It referred to QUANTITY types of State pension : employment pensions ( [ including ] retirement pensions ... ) and social welfare pensions . Anyone covered by the social - insurance scheme of GPE was entitled to an employment pension . Anyone not entitled to an employment pension was guaranteed the right to a social welfare pension under LAW . Accordingly , for the purposes of the LAW , the terms \u2018 State pension\u2019 and \u2018 social cover in old age\u2019 were identical . By DATE of the LAW , ... stateless persons who had arrived in GPE from another country and had not been employed by enterprises or institutions of GPE received their pensions in accordance with agreements signed with the ORG concerned ; in the absence of such an agreement , they were to be granted a social welfare pension . Thus , pensions were calculated according to the same rules for both of the above - mentioned categories ...", "The pension system established by the LAW was based on ... the principle of redistribution ( solidarity ) , which did not encourage any interest on the workers\u2019 part in ensuring their own old - age cover . As GPE strengthened its independence as a ORG , it soon became necessary to develop a new pension system complying with the principles of ORG .", "Having assessed the country \u2019s economic and demographic situation , the available resources and other circumstances , on DATE ORG passed a new LAW with the same title ... which came into force on DATE . Paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the LAW provides that the period to be taken into account in calculating the ORG pensions of foreign nationals and stateless persons who were resident in GPE on DATE comprises their aggregate periods of employment in GPE or periods treated as such . Periods of employment outside GPE before DATE and periods treated as such are not taken into account in determining the relevant period for pension calculations ...", "The pension scheme introduced in GPE has been favourably received at international level . There has been a positive assessment of the radical change in relation to the traditional principle of solidarity between generations : money earned by the working generation is paid to current pensioners , but at the same time the insurance principle is applied , whereby people build up their own funds towards their pension . ... International experts acknowledge that it is not possible to resolve all social issues by means of the pension system , as any effort to do so will only create problems endangering the system \u2019s long - term stability ...", "In passing LAW , GPE has adopted principles based on insurance premium payments in respect of ... State pensions , including the rule that the amount of the pension depends on the period of employment ... [ This ] consists of periods of employment as defined by the LAW and periods treated as such , irrespective of the person \u2019s nationality .", "( CARDINAL ) ... In its case - law ORG determines the compatibility of any claim with [ LAW ] , defining new criteria in each case . Not all claims automatically come under the concept of a \u2018 LOC within the meaning of the LAW . To determine this issue , it is necessary to assess the correlation between the entitlement to the pension or benefit in question and the obligation to pay taxes and other contributions . [ The existence of a ] right or legitimate expectation must be duly demonstrated . A person complaining of interference with the exercise of the right of property must show that he or she has such a right .", "In addition , ORG makes a distinction between a system involving individual contributions to a [ pension ] fund , where the amount to be paid [ from the fund ] can also be determined in each particular case , and a system in which there is only an indirect link between the contributions paid and the amount received . The latter system can not be regarded as sufficiently tangible ; yet the right of property , as such , must be tangible ...", "To establish whether the legislative provision in issue concerns the right of property , the nature of the pension system should be examined . The new pension scheme is a system that creates a \u2018 ORG . It is based on the principle that a person belonging to it has paid contributions into specific [ pension ] funds and that the contributions form a share of the funds\u2019 overall capital . Furthermore , the amount [ of this share of the capital ] can be determined at any time . In such circumstances , the person acquires a \u2018 ORG within the meaning of the LAW . In the PERSON v. GPE case , cited by the applicants , ORG found a link between the type of benefit in question , to which the applicant was not entitled under NORP law , and the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund . The ORG therefore found that the claim fell within the scope of LAW No . CARDINAL ...", "However , the pension system which existed in GPE until DATE was based on the solidarity principle , entailing the responsibility of the community as a whole and not creating a direct link between contributions and the amount of the pension . Where the solidarity principle is applied , it is impossible to determine what share of the fund belongs to each of the participants . Accordingly , the right of property protected by LAW ... does not arise in this case . This system does not confer on each individual any entitlement to an identifiable share of the fund , but rather the expectation of receiving material assistance according to the circumstances prevailing at the time the pension is to be paid . Pensions under this system are based on the so - called principle of collective security and can not be granted on the basis of [ each person \u2019s ] individual contribution . It is true that an entitlement to the payment of a certain amount of benefit arises where the system remains continuously in force and the individual satisfies the relevant conditions . However , even in those circumstances there is no entitlement to a specific amount , since the amount is subject to fluctuations and to legal regulation ...", "Accordingly , the provision in issue does not concern the right of property and is not at variance with LAW No . CARDINAL ... The applicants\u2019 submission that the provision in issue infringes LAW is therefore likewise unfounded .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) ... Welfare legislation , to which the impugned provision relates , is a specific field of human rights and , in constitutional laws of GPE and international human - rights instruments , is regarded as a general obligation of the ORG . The regulatory mechanism is left to the discretion of each ORG \u2019s legislature . The exercise of social rights depends on the country \u2019s economic situation and the resources available .", "Since the entry into force of LAW , all persons residing in GPE , regardless of nationality , are entitled to a State pension [ in respect of ] social insurance , provided that they are socially insured and have paid insurance contributions for the requisite number of DATE . LAW of the transitional provisions of LAW in its current wording was introduced in order to settle the issue of the reckoning ... of periods of employment prior to DATE and periods treated as such in the new pension system .
