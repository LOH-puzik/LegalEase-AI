{"ITEMID": "001-82080", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "ALFES v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicant is a practising lawyer . Together with several other persons who were shareholders and managing director of a private limited company , the applicant learned in DATE about the existence of several plots of land on the territory of the former GPE ( GPE ) for which no restitution claim had yet been made . Pursuant to ORG DATE , whose aim was to resolve disputes over property in the territory of the GPE in a way that was socially acceptable , the deadline for the registration of such restitution claims was DATE . The applicant applied for restitution of the above plots of land without revealing that he did not have the authority of the persons who were entitled to restitution and whose names he did not know at the time . He later obtained such authority , predated the forms to a date prior to DATE and intended to arrange the assignment of the restitution claim to the private limited company for a price that was considerably below the market value of the plots of land .", "ORG commenced investigations for fraud against the applicant in DATE and filed the indictment on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of abetting attempted fraud in CARDINAL instances and sentenced him to a fine of CARDINAL DEM . The main proceedings had been conducted during the period DATE and DATE and concerned the applicant and CARDINAL other accused persons ; the judgment contained CARDINAL pages .", "On the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , ORG on DATE quashed the judgment of ORG of CARDINAL DATE and referred the case back to another division of ORG . ORG found that ORG had not provided sufficient reasoning as to the accuseds\u2019 intent with regard to the unlawfulness of the pecuniary benefit , an element of fraud under NORP law . Since the NORP administrative courts at the time had been divided over the issue whether or not the registration for restitution by a representative without authority could be retroactively authorised , ORG had erroneously inferred from the predated authority forms that the applicant and his co - accused had had the requisite intent . ORG referred the case back to ORG in order to establish whether the applicant had acted with contingent intent . Lastly , it found that in case of a subsequent conviction , ORG when sentencing would have to take into account fact that the proceedings against the applicant had lasted for a considerable time . The length of time would also have to be considered by ORG in the context of LAW .", "On DATE , ORG , after having obtained the consent of ORG and the applicant , provisionally stayed the proceedings in accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL read in conjunction with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law , below ) on condition that the applicant paid the amount of CARDINAL \u20ac to the ORG treasury . The applicant paid the sum , and on DATE , ORG formally discontinued the proceedings .", "Section CARDINALa of the Code of Criminal Procedure governs the discontinuance of criminal proceedings after the fulfilment of certain conditions by the applicant .", "According to section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , ORG may discontinue criminal proceedings if they concern an offence for which it is not mandatory to impose a sentence of DATE imprisonment ( PERSON ) , if the defendant \u2019s guilt would be of a minor nature and if the fulfilment of certain conditions or orders by the defendant is suitable to remove the public interest in criminal prosecution . Such conditions notably entail the payment of a sum of money to a non - profit - making organisation or to a treasury . The defendant must consent to discontinuation . Moreover , the court which has jurisdiction to open the main proceedings must also consent unless the case concerns offences which are not subject to an increased minimum penalty and the consequences ensuing from the offence were minor .", "After the filing of the indictment , the court which has jurisdiction may , according to section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , decide to discontinue the proceedings under the conditions set out in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL with the consent of both ORG and the defendant . Once the proceedings have been discontinued , it is not longer open to the parties to take any further steps in the procedure unless the proceedings are resumed , which is only possible if the accused is charged with an offence for which it is mandatory to impose a sentence of DATE imprisonment ( PERSON ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
