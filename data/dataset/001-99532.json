THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , who has both NORP and NORP nationality , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant was placed in pre - trial detention on charges of participating in a criminal organisation with intent to commit acts of terrorism ( lidmaatschap van een criminele organisatie met terroristisch oogmerk ) , namely the so - called \u201c ORG group \u201d ( GPE ) , from its being based in the town of GPE which is the place of residence of the Queen ( Hofstad , town where the royal residence is located ) .", "During a hearing held on DATE the pre - trial detention was lifted , ORG ( rechtbank ) considering there were no grounds for it to be continued .", "On DATE the public prosecution service ( Openbaar Ministerie ) demanded a sentence of DATE imprisonment based on the charges as described above with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention .", "On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of all charges brought against him , finding that he could not be considered an active participant in the ORG group . In a number of cases of the applicant 's co - defendants similar acquittals were pronounced . The public prosecution service did not appeal against that judgment and on DATE ORG judgment became final .", "Claiming that he had incurred damage as a consequence of DATE he had spent in pre - trial detention , the applicant filed a request for compensation on DATE pursuant to the provisions of LAW of LAW ( Wetboek van Strafvordering \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) which provides for the possibility of such compensation . LAW provides , in the relevant part and as regards the compensation described in LAW ORG , that \u201c compensation shall be awarded in each case if and to the extent that the court , taking all circumstances into account , is of the opinion that there are reasons in equity ( gronden van billijkheid ) to do so . \u201d", "The applicant claimed CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) in damages to cover both pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage .", "By decision of DATE ORG granted the applicant 's claim in part , to the amount of EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "On DATE the public prosecution service appealed against that decision , arguing that there were no grounds in equity to award any damages . In the alternative , the public prosecution service asserted that the applicant should be awarded less .", "On DATE ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE quashed ORG decision .", "ORG noted that the applicant was one of the acquitted suspects in the criminal case against members of the ORG group , and that the members of this group were known to frequent circles close to PERSON , the murderer of film director PERSON : the members of the ORG group and PERSON would gather in what has come to be called the \u201c living - room meetings \u201d ( huiskamerbijeenkomsten ) . As regards those meetings , it had been established that they had taken place in a group setting and that all suspects could be counted as members of that group .", "Paraphrasing ORG acquittal of DATE referred to above , ORG observed that ORG had found that all persons suspected of membership of the ORG group had in fact belonged to a structured and durable joint co - operation which had had the intent to commit crimes , to incite ( violence ) and to threaten ( with the commission of acts of terrorism ) and had established that the group 's individual members generally could not have been unaware that the objectives of the group to which they belonged was to commit crimes of this nature .", "It then went on to consider that the reason for the applicant 's acquittal of criminal participation in the group 's activities , despite the above - mentioned finding of fact by ORG , was to be found in the circumstance that ORG had not considered the applicant to have been an \u201c active \u201d participant in the organisation . In this connection , ORG quoted parts of ORG judgment of DATE :", "\u201c Although all suspects are to be deemed members of the [ ORG ] group , not all of them behaved in such a manner that the group in fact benefited from their membership . Some of them merely tagged along . Those members did , for instance , attend meetings where hatred was incited and which were of an incendiary nature , but they did not contribute to any of that themselves . They also received texts and files of a threatening nature , but did not put them to any use . By behaving in such a manner , these members neither directly nor indirectly aided the realisation of the group 's criminal intent . It follows that activities such as attending aforementioned meetings and receiving aforesaid texts can not be deemed as [ criminal ] acts of participation [ in the ORG group 's activities ] ( deelnemingshandelingen ) .", "ORG went on to hold that this admitted of no other conclusion than that the applicant had taken part in the organisation in the above - mentioned passive manner , in full knowledge of the group 's aims , not merely on an incidental basis but moreover without distancing himself from those aims . \u201d", "Having taken these circumstances into consideration , ORG found that there were no reasons in equity to award the applicant the damages he sought .", "No further appeal lay against this decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
