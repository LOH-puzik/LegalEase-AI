SWEDEN (No. 1)", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of P1-1;No violation of Art. 14+P1-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , an agricultural engineer , and his wife PERSON own several parcels of land in the municipality of PERSON . On the land there is a farm and a gravel pit . The parcel where the gravel pit is located consists of QUANTITY and is called ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL . It was specifically created in DATE from parts of the other properties with a view to the exploitation of the pit .", "CARDINAL . When PERSON mother bought the land in DATE the commercial exploitation of the gravel pit had been at a standstill since DATE . In the meantime , gravel had been taken only for use on the farm . The PERSON were eager for exploitation to resume and , on DATE , they signed a licence agreement with CARDINAL companies ( \" the Jehanders \" ) , granting them , for an DATE fee , the exclusive right to extract gravel from the pit for DATE . The PERSON subsequently acquired several other gravel pits in the vicinity and thus obtained , so the applicants allege , a quasi - monopoly on gravel production in the region .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a prohibition on the extraction of gravel without a permit was introduced through an amendment to LAW ( naturskyddslagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . On DATE ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) of GPE granted PERSON parents the necessary permit . This provided , inter alia , that exploitation had to be in conformity with a plan drawn up in DATE ; in particular , it had to be carried out in CARDINAL stages , each of which should not exceed DATE . In addition , restoration works had to be carried out continuously during each stage and financial security lodged to cover the costs thereof .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Fredin acquired CARDINAL of the property by way of a gift from his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an amendment to LAW DATE ( naturv\u00e5rdslagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL - \" LAW \" ) - which had left unaffected the need for a permit - empowered ORG to revoke permits that were DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants bought the remainder of the property , which thenceforth belonged as to CARDINAL to Mr Fredin and as to CARDINAL to his wife . ORG was informed of the change in ownership .", "CARDINAL . Despite a number of requests over DATE , the PERSON had , at the time of the ORG purchase , still not put the gravel pit to commercial use . The PERSON accordingly instituted court proceedings for breach of contract , but the dispute was resolved by a friendly settlement according to which the licence agreement was deemed to have terminated with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested that the permit to take gravel should be formally transferred to them . With the consent of PERSON parents they began to exploit the pit in DATE , partly through a new licensee . At about this time ORG offered to redeem the exploitation permit from the applicants for a sum , according to them , of MONEY . However , the applicants did not accept the offer . As from DATE they conducted part of the business themselves through ORG , a limited liability company they owned .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicants an exemption from the general prohibition in the DATE Act against building near the seashore and allowed them to build a quay with shiploading equipment . The exemption was valid until further notice , but not for longer than the permit to exploit gravel . The ORG stated that the \" decision [ did ] not imply that any position [ had ] been taken as to the possibility of a future reconsideration of the gravel exploitation activities on the property \" . The applicants built the quay at a cost of MONEY and also invested MONEY in the gravel exploitation business over the period from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the applicants to lodge a financial security of MONEY to cover restoration costs , this amount being subsequently increased to MONEY .", "CARDINAL . After the applicants had provided the security required , ORG , by \" partial decision \" of DATE , amended its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) by transferring the permit to them . ORG added that it planned to issue new directives concerning restoration work and that , in view of the DATE amendment of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it intended to re - examine the permit question in DATE with a view to a possible termination of the activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG notified the applicants that , in the interest of nature conservation , it was contemplating amending the permit so as to provide that exploitation of the gravel pit should cease by DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a memorandum dated DATE , ORG indicated CARDINAL possible ways of discontinuing the exploitation . CARDINAL was to stop extraction as soon as possible because the environment was being damaged and there was already a satisfactory supply of gravel in the region . The other was to allow the exploitation to continue for DATE , thereby making it possible to give the area a natural shape .", "The memorandum was submitted to ORG ( naturv\u00e5rdsverket ) and to the municipality of PERSON . On DATE the ORG replied that it favoured the first alternative and that it considered that a reasonable exploitation - time had been afforded as the permit had been valid for DATE . On DATE the municipality expressed the opinion that a certain closing - down period was preferable as it would facilitate the restoration of the landscape .", "CARDINAL . In a new \" partial decision \" of DATE , ORG ordered , inter alia , that :", "( a ) the exploitation of gravel should cease within DATE , i.e. by DATE , by which time the area should also be restored ;", "( b ) as from DATE of the decision further extraction from certain parts of the pit be prohibited ;", "( c ) before DATE the applicants should increase the security to MONEY , to cover possible restoration costs resulting from the growing activity in the pit ; they should also draw up a new work plan , so that the ORG could fix the final conditions for the extraction and restoration works .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to the Government , claiming that :", "( a ) ORG decision was in part based on insufficient scientific material ;", "( b ) it should not have followed the opinion expressed by the municipality of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in view of that opinion \u2019s limited scope ;", "( c ) its decision , and also the opinion of ORG , should have been based on the views of a geological expert ;", "( d ) it had not given the applicants\u2019 interests sufficient consideration and had not granted a reasonable closing - down period ;", "( e ) the order to submit a new extraction plan and to lodge security of MONEY constituted a financial penalty ;", "( f ) the prohibition on extraction from parts of the pit was unlawful as it amounted to a closing - down of the activities ;", "( g ) pursuant to LAW , as interpreted in the light of LAW DATE ( milj\u00f6skyddslagen CARDINAL ) and LAW ( vattenlagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , they had a protected right to exploit gravel for DATE from the transfer of the permit on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted an opinion on the appeal , stating amongst other things that it had known , from its contacts with the PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , that no exploitation of gravel was imminent .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ) dismissed the appeal , stating that they concurred with ORG assessment . They ordered , however , that the validity of the permit should be extended to DATE and that the security should be lodged on CARDINAL March CARDINAL at the latest .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG adopted a restoration plan for the pit .", "CARDINAL . Before the expiry of the permit the applicants twice requested new permits , but to no avail . The last request was rejected by ORG on CARDINAL DATE . The ORG appeal to the ORG was dismissed on DATE , although the validity of the permit was extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE extraction of gravel from the pit ceased . The applicants had by then almost terminated the first of the CARDINAL exploitation stages provided for in the plan attached to the permit of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the public prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings against PERSON for non - compliance with LAW , in that he had not restored the gravel pit as provided for in the permit . These proceedings are still pending and the restoration work has not yet been carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected a request by the applicants for a special extraction permit in order to enable them to comply with the DATE restoration plan ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Their appeal to the Government was dismissed on DATE , and their application for judicial review under LAW ( lag om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut GPE ) , which entered into force on DATE , was rejected by ORG on DATE . These proceedings are not the object of the present complaint .", "CARDINAL . As regards the impact of the revocation of the permit on the value of their property and of their wholly - owned licensee , ORG , the applicants have referred to CARDINAL certificates .", "According to the first , issued by Mr PERSON , a consultant , on CARDINAL DATE , it appears from the accounts of the applicants\u2019 company that it would become insolvent without the income from the pit .", "The second certificate , drawn up on DATE by Mr PERSON , an economist , states that the ORG company would have had an estimated market value of MONEY in DATE , had the applicants been able to extract gravel from DATE onwards without any interference by the authorities . Mr NORP points out that this is not the company \u2019s liquidation value .", "In the third certificate , dated DATE , Mr PERSON , a land - surveyor at ORG ( \u00f6verlantm\u00e4terimyndigheten ) , notes that , as a result of the revocation of the permit , the gravel pit was considered in DATE to be worth MONEY for general property - taxation purposes . Mr PERSON \u2019s own assessment , made on the assumption , inter alia , that the extraction of gravel would have continued according to the DATE permit , concludes that the estate \u2019s market value decreased by MONEY as a consequence of the revocation . Taking into account Mr ORG \u2019s valuation , the total loss suffered by the applicants is estimated at MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The applicants have also submitted a report by Mr PERSON , a consultant , according to which , in a large number of revocation cases concerning businesses that had been carried on for DATE , ORG had not ordered the restoration of the gravel pits at issue . The ORG was also said to have given the holders of the permits in question the opportunity of obtaining new ones , should the supply of gravel on the market decrease . Mr PERSON noted that in these cases the permits had been held by CARDINAL companies , including CARDINAL of the Jehanders ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He concluded that the ORG \u2019s decision concerning the applicants\u2019 permit was exceptional , in that it terminated an ongoing profitable business .", "CARDINAL . The basic regulations on the protection of nature are laid down in the DATE Act .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the Act , everyone must show respect and circumspection in his or her dealings with nature . In addition , all necessary measures have to be taken to limit or counteract any damage to nature which is bound to result from any works undertaken or otherwise .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides that , in decisions on questions relating to nature conservation , other public and private interests must be duly considered .", "CARDINAL . LAW prohibits , inter alia , extraction of gravel for purposes other than the domestic needs of the landowner without a permit from ORG . The section also specifies that :", "\" ORG may require a party applying for an exploitation permit to submit , on pain of the application being rejected , material showing the need for the extraction and a sufficiently detailed plan for the activities . The permit shall be made subject to such conditions as are necessary to limit or counteract the harmful effects of the enterprise on the natural environment . In the absence of special reasons to the contrary , a permit shall be valid only if sufficient financial security is lodged to ensure that the conditions prescribed are actually fulfilled . If the security given proves to be inadequate , ORG may order that the permit shall not become effective until additional security has been lodged .", "If a prescribed measure is to be taken by someone other than the landowner , the latter must allow it to be carried out .", "If DATE have elapsed since an exploitation permit acquired legal force , ORG may revoke the permit completely or in part or may make its renewal subject to revised conditions . If it becomes apparent that the conditions laid down do not sufficiently limit or counteract the damaging effects that the activities may have on the natural environment , ORG may , before the expiry of the stated period , make the permit subject to such additional conditions as may be necessary . \"", "The last sub - paragraph was added on DATE . Previously an exploitation permit could not be revoked without compensation being paid to the landowner if the prescribed conditions had been complied with . According to the transitional provisions , the DATE period was , as regards permits valid on DATE , to be calculated as from that date . The amendment also repealed certain provisions whereby a landowner could be granted compensation if he was refused a permit .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that an appeal lies to the ORG against a decision taken by ORG . At the time of the final decision regarding the revocation question ( DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Government \u2019s decisions were not subject to any judicial review . However , since the entry into force , on DATE , of the Act on Judicial Review of ORG , the lawfulness of some decisions by the ORG may be challenged before ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
