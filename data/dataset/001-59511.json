Since then she has been PERCENT disabled ; she is hemiplegic , has difficulty coordinating her upper limbs , can speak only with difficulty and suffers from double vision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made an urgent application to the President of ORG seeking the appointment of an expert . In an order of CARDINAL DATE the President appointed an expert , who filed a report on DATE in which he concluded that there had not been any medical error .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( after a preliminary claim of CARDINAL DATE had been refused ) the applicant brought an action for damages against ORG in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant criticised the findings set out in the report of DATE and applied for a detailed , thorough expert opinion .", "CARDINAL . NORP In letters of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers sought to have the case set down for hearing . The clerk of ORG replied ( in letters of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) that on account of the backlog of work , it was not currently possible to foresee the date on which the case might be set down for hearing .", "CARDINAL . The hearing was eventually listed for DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the experts filed the following findings :", "\u201c As regards the cerebral arterial thromboses that occurred on DATE and DATE , nothing in PERSON clinical condition or in the results of the tests made them foreseeable . The treatment of this complication was appropriate to the patient \u2019s state of health and in accordance with the current state of scientific knowledge . As regards the scald on the left shoulder , the experts attribute it to a lack of assistance and organisation in the department . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant criticised that expert report and in reasoned submissions of CARDINAL DATE quantified the damage she had sustained .", "CARDINAL . At the request of ORG the hearing set down for DATE was postponed to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on CARDINAL DATE ORG assessed the amount of damage sustained by the applicant as a result of her scalded shoulder at MONEY and dismissed the rest of the claim for damages .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment to ORG . In a judgment of DATE that court dismissed the appeal on the ground that whatever the seriousness of the consequences of the surgical operation , the circumstances of the hospitalisation had not disclosed any failure to provide information about the nature of the operation and its foreseeable consequences or any negligence or presumption of negligence in the organisation or running of the relevant department .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by a member of ORG and PERSON d\u2019Etat Bar , appealed on points of law against that judgment to the ORG d\u2019Etat and filed full pleadings on DATE . She referred to a judgment of ORG of the ORG d\u2019Etat of DATE that had been delivered in the meantime ( the PERSON judgment of DATE , Revue fran\u00e7aise de droit administratif DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , in which no - fault liability in hospital cases had been extended to cover the risks of treatment , and in her sole ground of appeal relied on the fact that the hospital should in her case have been found liable without fault . She submitted that there had been a causal link between the operation and the damage , that the existence of the risk had been known , even if it was statistically only a very slight one , and that she had , within the meaning of the PERSON judgment , sustained extremely serious special damage .", "CARDINAL . ORG filed a defence on DATE and the applicant replied on DATE . The hospital lodged a rejoinder on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The case was heard in public on DATE by the CARDINALth and CARDINALrd sections sitting together and considered on the basis of a report by the CARDINALth section . After hearing the observations of the reporting judge , those of the parties\u2019 lawyers and , last , the Government Commissioner \u2019s submissions , the ORG d\u2019Etat reserved judgment . Counsel for the applicant then produced a memorandum for the deliberations ( note en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ) in which it was argued that the Government Commissioner had wrongly expressed doubts as to the extreme seriousness of the applicant \u2019s afflictions since the operation of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c It appears from the evidence submitted to the courts below that PERSON underwent a hysterectomy on DATE at ORG . Following that operation , which took place normally , post - operative complications , which supervened twice , caused serious , disabling after - effects and damage for which PERSON and PERSON sought compensation , relying in the courts below on mistakes that they alleged had been made by the hospital . Before this Court PERSON and PERSON have maintained for the first time that the hospital should have been held liable without fault .", "On the basis of the unappealable assessment it made of the facts , ORG inevitably held that no - fault liability on the part of ORG for the damage relied on by PERSON had not been made out . In so doing , that court did not make any error of law , seeing that it is apparent from the evidence submitted to the courts below that the circumstances in which such liability could be incurred did not obtain . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The history of GPE \u2019s administrative courts is essentially that of the ORG d\u2019Etat . In DATE ORG implemented the theory of the separation of powers and organised matters so that the executive would not be subject to the judiciary . It preserved the ancien r\u00e9gime principle that administrative authorities should be tried by a special court , in accordance with the idea that judging the administrative authorities was \u201c also an administrative act \u201d . Such a special court was set up by the ORG in DATE . This was the ORG d\u2019Etat , which was instituted by LAW ( DATE ) . It was given responsibilities in CARDINAL areas : administrative ( contributing to the drafting of major enactments ) and judicial ( settling disputes connected with the administrative authorities ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an Act vested it with the administration of \u201c delegated \u201d justice ( la justice d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e ) , and thereafter it accordingly gave its rulings \u201c in the name of the NORP people \u201d . During GPE the ORG d\u2019Etat acquired an organisational pattern that it still largely has DATE . Its function was laid down in the Act of DATE , which amended the CARDINAL Act and established delegated justice permanently .", "CARDINAL . The main feature of the post - war period was the organisation of the administrative jurisdiction . In DATE the administrative courts ( of first instance ) succeeded the prefectural councils , which had existed since DATE . LAW , which contains CARDINAL ORG \u2013 CARDINAL , DATE and DATE relating to the judiciary , in particular , to provide that judges ( but not members of ORG offices ) are irremovable , does not mention the ORG d\u2019Etat or the other administrative courts under this head . LAW of DATE , which came into force in DATE , added to the courts vested with administrative jurisdiction the administrative courts of appeal , to which the bulk of the appellate jurisdiction was transferred . From these new courts and various specialised courts , such as ORG , an appeal on points of law lies to the ORG d\u2019Etat as the supreme administrative court .", "CARDINAL . The judges of the administrative courts have a special status different from that of the judges of the ordinary courts and the members of ORG at those courts . They are governed by the general rules on the civil service ; however , they are in practice both independent and irremovable ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In DATE a decision of ORG ( DATE , ORG of DATE , p. DATE ) established the existence and independence of the administrative jurisdiction as being among the fundamental principles recognised in the laws of the LOC having constitutional rank .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON d\u2019Etat has CARDINAL members , CARDINAL of whom work within the PERSON and CARDINAL outside it . Its nominal President is the Prime Minister and in practice the Vice - President of the PERSON d\u2019Etat presides . By DATE paragraph , of the LAW , concerning the powers of appointment of the President of the Republic , all the senior members of the ORG d\u2019Etat ( conseillers d\u2019Etat ) are appointed by decree of the President of the Republic adopted in ORG , while the junior legal assistants ( auditeurs ) and the middle - ranking ma\u00eetres des requ\u00eates are appointed by an ordinary presidential decree , under LAW CARDINAL DATE on civil and military appointments .", "CARDINAL . The members of the ORG d\u2019Etat are recruited in CARDINAL of CARDINAL ways : through competitive examination or directly from other parts of the civil service . Legal assistants , recruited through competitive examination , are promoted to the rank of ma\u00eetre des requ\u00eates after about three years\u2019 service and become conseillers d\u2019Etat DATE . ORG appointments are subject to approval by the Vice - President of the ORG d\u2019Etat .", "CARDINAL . The status of the members of the ORG d\u2019Etat is not so much laid down in writing as guaranteed in practice . As regards written rules , mention must be made of the decree of CARDINAL DATE laying down the rights and duties of members of the ORG d\u2019Etat . These rights and duties are very similar to those applying to the civil service ( and , in particular , no provision is made for irremovability ) , with a number of exceptions : no provision is made for assessment , no promotions table is drawn up and an advisory committee replaces both ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . It is thus , rather , practice which provides the guarantees enjoyed by the members of the ORG d\u2019Etat . CARDINAL traditional practices are both very long - standing and decisive : firstly , the PERSON d\u2019Etat and its members are managed internally by ORG ( bureau ) of the ORG d\u2019Etat , consisting of the Vice - President , the CARDINAL division presidents and the Secretary - General of the ORG d\u2019Etat , without any outside interference . In particular , there is no distinction in the ORG d\u2019Etat between judges and members of ORG as there is in the ordinary courts , where the members of ORG are subordinated to the Minister of ORG .", "Secondly , even though there is no written provision guaranteeing the irremovability of members of the PERSON , that guarantee exists in practice . Lastly , while promotion is theoretically by selection , it is in DATE by a custom which goes back to DATE strictly by seniority , and this guarantees the members of the PERSON d\u2019Etat great independence , vis - \u00e0 - vis both the political authorities and the authorities of the ORG d\u2019Etat themselves .", "CARDINAL . Most duties within the ORG d\u2019Etat can be performed by members of any grade . Thus the duties of Government Commissioner , although generally given to ma\u00eetres des requ\u00eates , can also be carried out by auditeurs or conseillers d\u2019Etat .", "CARDINAL . The Act of DATE instituted a ORG , whose membership ensures that it is independent and representative . The ORG has a general advisory role in relation to matters concerning the staff of all the administrative courts ( individual measures affecting judges\u2019 careers , promotion and discipline ) .", "CARDINAL . Procedure in the administrative courts has developed essentially under the influence of the courts themselves . It attempts to achieve a compromise between the public interest \u2013 represented in the proceedings by the administrative authorities DATE and the interests of individuals , who must be effectively protected from misuse of public authority . The procedure is inquisitorial , written and inexpensive , and its distinctive feature is that CARDINAL of the parties is a public body .", "CARDINAL . The ORG d\u2019Etat consists of CARDINAL administrative divisions ( ORG , ORG , ORG , Social , and ORG ) and a ORG , itself subdivided into CARDINAL sections ( sous - sections ) .", "CARDINAL . Where a case has been assigned to a section , the president of the section appoints one of its members as reporting judge to examine the case . After careful study of the file the reporting judge draws up a draft decision . The draft is accompanied by a memorandum whose purpose is to set out the reasoning leading from the application to the draft . The memorandum includes a consideration of admissibility issues ( including jurisdiction and verification that there is no defect rendering the application inadmissible as a matter of public policy ) and must answer each ground raised in the application , with reference either to the evidence or to legal provisions or to case - law . The reporting judge appends to the memorandum a copy of the provisions and case - law relied on in the draft decision .", "The file subsequently goes to the reviser , an office assumed in each section by the president or CARDINAL of the other CARDINAL assesseurs constituting the bench . The reviser re - examines the evidence and forms a view as to how the case should be decided . He may himself prepare another draft decision in the event of disagreement with the reporting judge . Once the draft decision has been revised , the case is listed for consideration at a preparatory sitting of the section , at which it will be discussed in the presence of the Government Commissioner , who does not , however , take part in the vote on the draft . Only when the draft decision has been adopted by the section will the file be forwarded to the Government Commissioner to enable him either to prepare his submissions or to ask for a fresh preparatory sitting to be convened or for the case to be transferred to a differently constituted court .", "CARDINAL . The institution of Government Commissioner dates from an ordinance of CARDINAL DATE . Originally , as its name indicates , it was designed to represent the government \u2019s point of view , but that function very rapidly disappeared ( at the latest in DATE ) . The title has remained but is now a misnomer . Since then the institution has become , to the outside observer , CARDINAL of the most distinctive features of NORP administrative justice , in particular because ORG rapidly established themselves as judicial officers totally independent of the parties .", "The Government Commissioner plays a traditionally very important role in the creation of administrative case - law and most of the major judicial innovations have come about as a result of celebrated submissions by the Government Commissioner . Furthermore , given that the judgments of the PERSON d\u2019Etat are always drafted very elliptically , it is often only by reading the submissions of the Government Commissioner , where published , that one can discern the ratio decidendi of the judgments .", "CARDINAL . By the terms of Decree no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE on the organisation and functioning of the ORG d\u2019Etat , ORG are taken from among the ma\u00eetres des requ\u00eates and auditeurs at the ORG d\u2019Etat or , exceptionally , from among the conseillers . By Article R CARDINAL - CARDINAL of FAC , they are appointed by a decree of the Prime Minister , adopted on a proposal by the Minister of Justice , after being put forward by the Vice - President of the ORG d\u2019Etat in consultation with the division presidents . In practice , the PERSON d\u2019Etat \u2019s proposals are always endorsed . Appointment as Government Commissioner DATE which is not a rank \u2013 is for an unlimited duration but a Government Commissioner can not remain in post for DATE and in practice does not generally do so for CARDINAL or three years .", "There are CARDINAL Government Commissioners for each of the CARDINAL sections that make up ORG but there is no hierarchy of ORG , who do not constitute a separate \u201c corps \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government Commissioner is a member of the ORG d\u2019Etat who is attached to the section from which the bench designated to hear a case is constituted and he attends \u2013 without voting and generally without speaking \u2013 the sitting at which the cases are prepared for trial , when the cases are presented by the reporting judges , and he receives a copy of the draft judgment adopted by the section and revised by the reviser . When his view of a case differs from that of the section , he can come and discuss it with the section at another preparatory sitting . If the disagreement remains and he considers that the case is of sufficient importance , he has the right ( rarely exercised in practice ) to request that the case should be referred to ORG or to ORG ( Article CARDINAL of the decree of DATE on the organisation and functioning of the ORG d\u2019Etat ) . Only after that will he prepare his submissions for the actual trial , which is open to the public . These submissions , which are generally exclusively oral ones , are not communicated either to the parties or to the reporting judge or to the members of the trial bench .", "CARDINAL . It has become an established practice to communicate to lawyers who so request , before the hearing , the general tenor of the submissions which the Government Commissioner will make at the hearing . In view of the number of cases to be tried ( CARDINAL a year for each Government Commissioner ) , the Government Commissioner \u2019s submissions , which remain his exclusive property , are often solely oral . He has complete freedom as to whether or not to place those he has decided to put in writing in the ORG d\u2019Etat \u2019s archives or to publish them in important cases as an annex to ORG d\u2019Etat judgments reported in the official reports or in legal periodicals .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing the Government Commissioner is under an obligation to make his submissions , which must be reasoned , since he is not allowed to say that he wishes to leave matters to the court \u2019s discretion .", "CARDINAL . The Government Commissioner \u2019s role at the hearing was described as follows by a former member of the ORG d\u2019Etat , PERSON , in DATE :", "\u201c Once the case has reached the public hearing , and the reporting judge has read his report , which is merely a summary of the evidence and makes no mention of the section \u2019s opinion , and the lawyers have made oral submissions if they considered it appropriate , the Commissioner stands up and is the one who speaks last , even after counsel for the defence . He sets out the whole case , making a critical analysis of all the grounds and of all the case - law that could be relied on ; often he will indicate how the case - law has developed , highlighting the stages it has already gone through and hinting at possible future developments . Lastly , he will submit that the application should be dismissed or allowed . He does so in his own name , without any obligation to share the section \u2019s opinion or to take instructions either from ORG ( for there is none ) or from any superior , presiding judge or minister . He is answerable only to his own conscience . He is a vital cog in the machinery of administrative procedure , which perhaps owes its real distinctiveness to him . The submissions in many cases go far beyond the bounds of the individual case and amount to legal treatises , to which litigants and commentators will long refer . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the terms used by the ORG d\u2019Etat itself ( DATE , Gervaise , PERSON , p. CARDINAL , reiterated on DATE in ORG ) the Government Commissioner \u2019s function is", "\u201c to set out for the PERSON the issues which each application raises for decision and to make known , by making his submissions completely independently , his own assessment , which must be impartial , of the facts of the case and the applicable rules of law , together with his opinion as to whether the manner in which , according to his conscience , the case submitted to the ORG to which he belongs should be disposed of . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the hearing , therefore , the parties to the case can not speak after the Government Commissioner , since he speaks after counsel for the opposing parties have addressed the court . Even if they are not represented by a lawyer , they do , however , have the possibility , hallowed by usage , of sending the trial bench a \u201c memorandum for the deliberations \u201d to supplement the observations they have made orally or to reply to the Government Commissioner \u2019s submissions . This memorandum for the deliberations is read out by the reporting judge before he reads out the draft judgment and before the discussion begins .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , it is settled case - law of the ORG d\u2019Etat that if the Government Commissioner were to raise a ground DATE even CARDINAL involving an issue of public policy DATE that had not been relied on by the parties during the proceedings , the presiding judge would stay the proceedings , communicate the ground to the parties so that they could present argument on it , and relist the case for a fresh hearing DATE , since grounds raised of the court \u2019s own motion have to be notified to the parties .", "CARDINAL . After the public hearing it is customary for the Government Commissioner to attend the deliberations but he has no vote . As a general rule , he intervenes orally only to answer any specific questions that are put to him . He is , after all , the member of the ORG who has seen the case file most recently and is therefore supposed to have the most detailed knowledge of it .", "CARDINAL . Cases in the ORG d\u2019Etat may be tried either by a single section ( and in that event all the members of the trial bench already know the case ) or by combined sections ( in that event , CARDINAL members , representing the section which prepared the case for trial , out of the CARDINAL judges who have to deliberate on it know the case ) or by ORG or ORG ( so - called solemn constitutions of the court for hearing the most important cases ) , in which only the President and the reporting judge , out of the CARDINAL judges who will have to deliberate on it , know the case .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , it should be pointed out that there are Government Commissioners not only at the ORG d\u2019Etat but also at the other administrative courts ( of first instance and appeal ) and at ORG . Furthermore , the function of Advocate General at ORG of ORG was closely modelled on the institution of Government Commissioner , with the difference that under LAW , only the judges who sat at the hearing may take part in the deliberations \u2013 to the exclusion , therefore , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the hearing of a reference for a preliminary ruling made to ORG at ORG by a NORP court ( the Arrondissementsrechtbank te \u2018 s - Gravenhage ) , Emesa Sugar ( Free Zone ) GPE ( a company ) , relying on LAW , applied on DATE to submit written observations after the Advocate General had delivered his opinion at the hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused that application on the following grounds :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . In accordance with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , ORG consists of ORG and is assisted by Advocates General . LAW lays down identical conditions and the same procedure for appointing both Judges and Advocates General . In addition , it is clear from Title I of LAW of ORG , which , in law , is equal in rank to the LAW itself , that the Advocates General have the same status as the ORG , particularly so far as concerns immunity and the grounds on which they may be deprived of their office , which guarantees their full impartiality and total independence .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the Advocates General , none of whom is subordinate to any other , are not public prosecutors nor are they subject to any authority , in contrast to the manner in which the administration of justice is organised in certain Member GPE . They are not entrusted with the defence of any particular interest in the exercise of their duties .", "CARDINAL . The role of the Advocate General must be viewed in that context . In accordance with LAW , his duty is to make , in open court , acting with complete impartiality and independence , reasoned submissions on cases brought before ORG , in order to assist ORG in the performance of the task assigned to it , which is to ensure that in the interpretation and application of the LAW , the law is observed .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW of ORG and LAW , the Opinion of the Advocate General brings the oral procedure to an end . It does not form part of the proceedings between the parties , but rather opens the stage of deliberation by ORG . It is not therefore an opinion addressed to the judges or to the parties which stems from an authority outside the ORG or which \u2018 derives its authority from that of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2019s department ... \u2019 ( judgment in GPE v. GPE , cited above , paragraph CARDINAL ) . Rather , it constitutes the individual reasoned opinion , expressed in open court , of a Member of ORG itself .", "CARDINAL . The Advocate General thus takes part , publicly and individually , in the process by which the ORG reaches its judgment , and therefore in carrying out the judicial function entrusted to it . Furthermore , the ORG is published together with the ORG \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to both the organic and the functional link between the Advocate General and the ORG ... , the aforesaid case - law of ORG does not appear to be transposable to the Opinion of the Court \u2019s Advocates General .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , given the special constraints inherent in Community judicial procedure , connected in particular with its language regime , to confer on the parties the right to submit observations in response to the Opinion of the Advocate General , with a corresponding right for the other parties ( and , in preliminary ruling proceedings , which constitute the majority of cases brought before the Court , all the Member States , the Commission and the other institutions concerned ) to reply to those observations , would cause serious difficulties and considerably extend the length of the procedure .", "CARDINAL . Admittedly , constraints inherent in the manner in which the administration of justice is organised within the ORG can not justify infringing a fundamental right to adversarial procedure . However , no such situation arises in that , with a view to the very purpose of adversarial procedure , which is to prevent the ORG from being influenced by arguments which the parties have been unable to discuss , the ORG may of its own motion , on a proposal from the Advocate General or at the request of the parties , reopen the oral procedure , in accordance with LAW , if it considers that it lacks sufficient information , or that the case must be dealt with on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties ...", "CARDINAL . In the instant case , however , ORG \u2019s application does not relate to the reopening of the oral procedure , nor does it rely on any specific factor indicating that it would be either useful or necessary to do so . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
