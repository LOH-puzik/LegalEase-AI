NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is currently in prison . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was convicted of the murder of CARDINAL men and of the attempted murder of CARDINAL others . The bodies of the deceased had been variously dismembered , buried , burned , boiled and/or disposed of otherwise . He was arrested when a drain cleaning company , called to his building to investigate a blocked drain , found human flesh . The applicant had confessed to numerous additional killings , but identification of all of the victims was not possible at that point . The applicant is subject to a whole life tariff and has always been a Category A security prisoner . ORG ( see below ) later described his offences as \u201c as grave and depraved as it is possible to imagine \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a journalist published a book about the murders entitled \u201c Killing for Company \u201d : it drew extensively on the applicant \u2019s notes written whilst on remand and it contained graphic descriptions of the applicant \u2019s crimes .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant began to write his autobiography . By DATE his work amounted to CARDINAL closely typed pages . He handed the manuscript to his then solicitor , with a view to publication , who took it with him when he left the prison . The prison authorities did not know about , or consent to , the manuscript leaving the prison . A number of copies were made and these are still , unpublished , outside the prison . ORG later described the manuscript as falling into CARDINAL parts . The first concerned aspects of the applicant \u2019s life before he committed the offences and contained explicit details of sexual encounters with various men . The second concerned the offences and included considerable detail of the killings and the ways in which the bodies of the victims were abused , dismembered and disposed of . The third \u2013 the longest part \u2013 was essentially a diary of prison experiences with reflections on the criminal justice system . On DATE the applicant \u2019s then solicitor wrote to the prison stating that the applicant intended to publish the manuscript \u201c at DATE \u201d and offering the Governor the opportunity to read it \u201c in case it should be thought that any abuse of the legal visit has occurred \u201d . However , in a subsequent letter that solicitor informed the Governor that he no longer had instructions to permit the prison authorities to read the manuscript .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new solicitor sent a copy of the manuscript in a sealed package to the prison with a cover letter stating that it was legally privileged material to be handed to the applicant unopened but disclosing the nature of the material . The Governor returned it to the solicitor on the basis that it was not legal correspondence . On DATE the solicitor wrote to the prison claiming the right to send the manuscript to the applicant and on CARDINAL DATE the Governor replied noting that it was clear that manuscript was intended for publication , that correspondence in and out of the prison which contained material intended for publication was restricted under paragraph ORG ) of Standing Order No . CARDINAL ( \u201c SOCARDINALB \u201d ) and that it was necessary for the prison service to examine the material in order to determine if SOCARDINALB applied .", "CARDINAL . The applicant began judicial review proceedings . On DATE the High Court found that the prison authorities had the right to examine the manuscript to see whether it would be in accordance with the rules for it to be passed to the applicant and dismissed the application . The judgment noted that it was not in dispute that the applicant \u2019s objective was to rework the manuscript for publication .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prison authorities then read the manuscript . By letter dated DATE the applicant was informed by the Governor of the decision of the prison service that the manuscript would not be passed on to him :", "\u201c ORG has now read the manuscript ... It has decided not to allow the manuscript to be passed to [ the applicant ] and because of this I am returning the manuscript to you .", "ORG considers that the manuscript is material intended for publication , that it is about [ the applicant \u2019s ] offences and that it does not consist of serious representations about a conviction or sentence and does not form part of serious comment about crime , the processes of justice or the penal system . [ The applicant ] is not permitted to send such material out of prison : [ SOCARDINALB ] paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) ; Standing Order CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL . Because the manuscript has been out of prison for DATE , it is likely that copies have been made by third parties . However , to date [ the applicant ] has not caused the manuscript to be published and has indicated that he wishes to do further work on it . The Secretary of ORG has no reason to believe that any such further work would alter the character of the manuscript .", "The only way in which the Secretary of ORG can in practice realistically seek to prevent [ the applicant ] from publishing such material is by withholding the manuscript from [ the applicant pursuant to rules CARDINAL and/or CARDINAL of FAC ... and/or paragraph CARDINAL of SOCARDINALB [ see relevant domestic law below ] .", "The reasons why the Secretary of ORG has concluded that publication of the manuscript , or of a revised version of it , would be contrary to paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) ... are as follows .", "The manuscript is about [ the applicant ] . But it is also about his offences : the offences themselves , how [ the applicant ] came to commit them , and how he is now being punished for them . The offences are an integral part of the manuscript .", "The manuscript does not consist of serious representations about conviction or sentence or form part of serious comment about crime , the processes of justice or the penal system . Rather it is a platform for [ the applicant ] to seek to justify his conduct and denigrate people he dislikes . The Secretary of ORG believes that his decision is in accordance with LAW . He accepts that withholding the manuscript is an interference with [ the applicant \u2019s ] freedom of expression . But he considers that this is justified in the circumstances .", "The withholding of the manuscript is prescribed by law , for the reasons set out above .", "The withholding of the manuscript pursues a legitimate aim , namely the protection of morals , the protection of the reputation or the rights of others and the protection of information received in confidence . The manuscript contains several lurid and pornographic passages . It contains highly personal details of a number of [ the applicant \u2019s ] offences . It seeks to portray [ the applicant ] as a morally and intellectually superior being who justifiably holds others in contempt . Its publication would be likely to cause great distress to [ the applicant \u2019s ] surviving victims and to the families of all his victims , and would be likely to cause a justifiable sense of outrage among the general public .", "The withholding of the manuscript is a proportionate response in the circumstances . There is a pressing social need to avoid the harm described above . No lesser measure will avoid that harm . [ the applicant ] is free to send out writings that comply with the terms of ORG and the Standing Orders .", "In reaching his decision , the Secretary of ORG has borne in mind that [ the applicant ] is serving a whole life tariff . The Secretary of ORG \u2019s present view is that for as long as [ the applicant ] remains in prison , preventing the publication of the material in the manuscript is justified , no matter how long that may be . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to challenge by judicial review the decision of DATE and on DATE ORG refused his application . The applicant relied on CARDINAL grounds .", "CARDINAL . In the first place , the applicant submitted that paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of SOCARDINALB was unlawful given Article CARDINAL of the Convention . He argued that ORG had neither expressly not impliedly conferred upon the prison Governor or service the power to regulate matters beyond the prison walls , any implied power was limited to matters concerning good order and discipline and prison security so that the prevention of harm to the families of victims and the prevention of public outrage were not matters for a prison Governor . ORG found it abundantly clear that section CARDINAL of LAW enabled the Secretary of ORG to promulgate LAW of the DATE Rules which conferred upon him a discretion to impose \u201c any restriction or condition , either generally or in a particular case , upon the communications to be permitted between a prisoner and other persons \u201d , provided that he considered that it was Convention compliant . Paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) was the result of such an exercise of discretion . Once it was accepted that the paragraph allowed the Secretary of ORG to concern himself with consequential effects outside the prison , and not just matters such as internal prison security , it followed that he could restrict a prisoner \u2019s freedom of expression in pursuance of the legitimate aim of , inter alia , the prevention of disorder or crime , the protection of morals and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . This case was , in the High Court \u2019s view , \u201c an object lesson in why private feelings and public outrage may be matters of highly relevant concern \u201d . Paragraph CARDINAL struck a balance which , in principle , complied with LAW acknowledging as it did the prisoner \u2019s right to expression as regards serious representations but restricting it in relation to other matters .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the applicant maintained that paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) could not apply to autobiographical writings . ORG found that LAW did not confer special status on autobiographical work , whatever its nature or content , and the solution was to be found in the general principles of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , the applicant argued that the application of that paragraph was disproportionate or irrational : it was a futile exercise since copies of the manuscript existed already outside the prison and since the material was already in the public domain given the book \u201c Killing for Company \u201d ; the applicant wished to work on it to make it less offensive and its later dissemination could be controlled ; and what was at issue was the return of the manuscript which had been in the prison for DATE without objection . ORG found :", "\u201c The decision letter ... unquestionably carried out a proportionality assessment . ... I am entirely satisfied that his decision satisfies the demands of proportionality and the test of rationality . ... The Secretary of ORG is entitled , and in my view right , to take the view that , notwithstanding the risk of publication of material which is already in hands outside his control , it is not futile to prevent [ the applicant ] from doing what he wishes to do \u2013 that is , publish his material in a revised form . The history of the original movement of the material out of prison , putting it at its lowest , justifies the Secretary of ORG \u2019s view that there is a significant risk that , if the material is entrusted to [ the applicant ] , it may later leave the prison in a revised form without the knowledge or consent of the prison authorities . I am wholly unpersuaded that what is already in the public domain , in particular in ORG , is such as to render any further restriction pointless . There is an appreciable difference between the publication of material which is all the prisoner \u2019s own work and the publication of his account by another person over whom the prisoner had no control . The difference is highlighted by the fact that [ the applicant ] intends to dispute significant parts of [ the previously published book ] .", "I have already explained ... that ... the Secretary of ORG is entitled to have regard to the likely effect of publication on members of the public , including survivors and the families of victims of [ the applicant \u2019s ] serial offences . I am unimpressed by the suggestion that anyone can choose not to read whatever may be published .", "... I have not read the entirety of [ the applicant \u2019s ] material . To do so would take DATE . However , from what I have seen of it and from what I have learned from the witness statements of PERSON ( filed on behalf of [ the applicant ] ) and Professor PERSON ( filed on behalf of the Secretary of ORG ) , I am satisfied that the Secretary of ORG reached unimpeachable conclusions about it \u2013 both as regards proportionality and as regards its falling outside the \u201c serious representations \u201d and \u201c serious comment \u201d exceptions in paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) .", "... although the majority of [ the applicant \u2019s ] submissions on proportionality were made in the context of LAW , [ he ] also sought to rely on LAW ... The arguments on behalf of [ the applicant ] which failed to relation to LAW produce no more favourable an analysis in relation to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . He again argued that paragraph CARDINAL of SOCARDINALB fell outside the powers conferred on the Secretary of ORG by LAW . Having reviewed relevant domestic law , ORG confirmed that paragraph CARDINAL did not exceed LAW in that section CARDINAL of the DATE Act spoke not only of the regulation and management of prisons but about control of prisoners . The applicant further argued that paragraph CARDINAL of SOCARDINALB itself conflicted with LAW . ORG , in the first place , found the limitation in paragraph CARDINAL of SOCARDINALB to be consistent with relevant domestic jurisprudence as regards LAW and prisoners :", "\u201c Criminals who are deprived of their liberty by a sentence of imprisonment are deprived of enjoyment of their possessions and of communication with the outside world , save in so far as the prison authorities permit this . Prison rules must necessarily make provision for the use prisoners may make of their possessions and for what may be sent from the outside world in to prisoners and what prisoners may send out . [ The applicant ] does not challenge this . The issue is the matters to which the Secretary of ORG can properly have regard when making rules in relation to these matters .", "... GPE legislation is not required to spell out those aspects of a prison regime that properly constitute an incident of the punishment of deprivation of liberty . The powers conferred on the Secretary of ORG under the [ CARDINAL Act ] include , at least , the power to have regard , when regulating what a prisoner can and can not do , to the natural incidents of penal imprisonment .", "It is not so easy to define the test of what are the natural incidents of penal imprisonment , and these are certainly susceptible to change as a result of changes in attitude to punishment . In [ R(Mellor ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) ] at paragraph CARDINAL the Master of the Rolls expressed the view that :", "\u2018 GPE sanctions are imposed , in part , to exact retribution for wrongdoing . If there were no system of penal sanctions , members of the public would be likely to take the law into their own hands . In my judgment it is legitimate to have regard to public perception when considering the characteristic of a penal system.\u2019", "We endorse that statement . In considering what restrictions can properly be placed on prisoners as natural incidents of imprisonment regard can be had to the expectations of right thinking members of the democracy whose laws have deprived the prisoners of their liberty .", "In his decision letter , the Governor made the point that publication of [ the applicant \u2019s ] typescript would be likely to cause great distress to families of his victims and a justifiable sense of outrage among the general public . There is ample authority that freedom of expression includes the freedom to publish outrageous matter . But the outrage referred to by the Governor was not outrage at the subject matter , but outrage that a prisoner should be permitted to publish such material from his prison cell . ...", "[ In the present case , we ] are concerned with a tightly drawn restriction on a prisoner writing about his crimes , which is subject to an exception for \u2018 serious representations about conviction or DATE or \u2018 part of serious comment about crime , the processes of justice or the penal system\u2019 .", "We do not believe that any penal system could readily contemplate a regime in which a rapist or a murderer would be permitted to publish an article glorifying in the pleasure that his crime had caused him . NORP jurisprudence suggests that to restrict prisoners from publishing such matter is a legitimate exercise of the power conferred on the Secretary of ORG by FAC . We have concluded that , from the viewpoint of that [ domestic ] jurisprudence , the wording of LAW ( CARDINAL)(c ) draws the line appropriately between what is and what is not acceptable conduct on behalf of a prisoner and falls within the powers conferred on the Secretary of ORG by FAC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that this ORG \u2019s jurisprudence did not mean that paragraph CARDINAL of SOCARDINALB was in conflict with LAW . That court also rejected the proposition that the wording of paragraph CARDINAL was too vague to indicate to an inmate what would fall foul of the law , finding that the wording of the exception was \u201c clear and readily capable of application by a prison Governor \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to review this ORG \u2019s case - law . While ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX ) found that a blanket ban on voting was disproportionate , it accepted that it was open to the legislative to tailor disenfranchisement to particular offences . In PERSON v. the GPE ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) the ORG accepted that some measure of control over the content of ORG communications ( the scope of which was not in issue in that case ) was not in itself incompatible with the LAW . The significance of ORG ( Silver and Others v. GPE ( DATE ) , application nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL et seq . , ORG DATE ) was not so much that it was a decision endorsing a restriction that had much in common with that under consideration in the appeal ( Silver was decided DATE previously and standards could change ) . It was rather that it exemplified the approach of considering what restrictions on freedom of expression are normal incidents of imprisonment . That approach was more clearly demonstrated by the ORG \u2019s approval of the prohibition of letters in connection with business matters without the prior leave of the Secretary of ORG : in this respect , the Commission commented that it was , in principle , a normal consequence of imprisonment , necessary \u2018 for the prevention of disorder\u2019 that convicted prisoners cease their professional activities during their term of imprisonment . ORG noted that this ORG had not found it necessary to comment on this conclusion of the ORG and affirmed both decisions on narrower grounds than that adopted by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that this ORG \u2019s jurisprudence did not support the applicant \u2019s arguments that it was disproportionate for imprisonment to carry with it some restrictions on freedom of expression or for those restrictions to have regard to the effect of the exercise of that freedom in the world outside the prison walls . Paragraph CARDINAL was not therefore in conflict with the requirements of LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to whether the restriction was disproportionate on the facts of his case , the applicant argued , in the first place , that it was futile . A book had been already published containing graphic descriptions of his crimes which he had provided to its author and there were copies of the manuscript outside the prison the publication of which the Secretary of ORG was powerless to prevent . ORG found these submissions paradoxical : the applicant \u2019s primary argument was that the Governor \u2019s conduct was illegal in preventing him from publishing his typescript and yet he was also submitting that the Governor \u2019s conduct could not pose any significant impediment to that . It continued :", "\u201c We do not consider that there is any merit in this part of [ the applicant \u2019s ] case . The fact that , DATE , PERSON published an account of [ the applicant \u2019s ] crimes is not likely to do much to diminish the public outrage that will be felt if the prison service permits [ the applicant ] himself to publish his own account . [ The applicant ] has not caused or permitted the typescript to be published in its present form . He has made it plain that he wants to work on it before publication . We do not consider that the prison service can be expected to waive prison rules in order to assist him to achieve a goal which is contrary to the Secretary of ORG \u2019s policy . [ The applicant ] has argued that he should be given the opportunity to transform his typescript into a work which makes serious representations about his conviction or sentence or serious comment about crime , the processes of justice or the penal system . There is no evidence that [ the applicant ] has any such intention . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG arguing that ORG erred in law and invoking LAW : the prison service did not have the power to regulate his LAW outside the prisons ; that refusing to return the manuscript was disproportionate since it was futile to prevent publication since the material was in the public domain ; that paragraph CARDINAL of SOCARDINALB was too vague ( he also invoked LAW in this respect ) ; that the application of paragraph CARDINAL was disproportionate in that it would never be possible for the applicant to publish his writing in his lifetime ( he was serving a life sentence ) ; and that ORG applied an insufficiently intrusive form of review by placing itself in the shoes of the decision maker , the latter of whom was not qualified to make the decision he did ( Article CARDINAL was also invoked in this context ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was refused , by summary decision , leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL .
