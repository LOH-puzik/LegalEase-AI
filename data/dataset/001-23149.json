However , her marriage breaking down in DATE thwarted these plans . As she was no longer residing with her husband , she applied for an independent residence permit which was granted in DATE .", "The marriage was officially dissolved in DATE . The applicant acquired GPE nationality on DATE . She experienced difficulties obtaining proper accommodation , but this problem was solved in DATE . In DATE the applicant \u2019s father fell seriously ill in LOC due to which , the applicant submitted , the grandparents were no longer capable of taking care of S.", "In DATE the applicant addressed a letter to ORG , stating that she wished for her daughter to grow up within her family , consisting of herself and her son PERSON , in the GPE and that she would be able to take care of her daughter \u2019s upbringing .

The applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) against this refusal was rejected on DATE . Her subsequent appeal to ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State ) was rejected on DATE by the latter as unsubstantiated since the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between the applicant and her daughter were considered to have ceased to exist .", "On DATE the applicant filed a new request for a provisional residence visa for S.

On DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) rejected this request , by concluding that the applicant relied on the same facts as those submitted in respect of her earlier requests for a provisional residence visa and that the reasons to reject those requests remained pertinent . The decision underlined that the applicant \u2019s daughter had entered the country on a short stay visa whereas the aim and the intended duration of her stay were not in compliance with the purposes of such a visa . The Deputy Minister held that this breached a rule of general interest .", "Referring to the need for a restrictive immigration policy , the decision further stated that , unless international law obliged the GPE to grant admission , aliens could be allowed residence only if this served \u201c essential interests of the GPE \u201d ( wezenlijk Nederlands belang ) or in case of compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature ( klemmende PERSON aard ) .

ORG rejected the request for a provisional measure .", "ORG decision was final and not subject to appeal .", "As a rule , anyone wishing to apply for a residence permit in the GPE must first apply from his or her country of origin to the GPE Minister of ORG for a provisional residence visa . Only once such a visa has been issued abroad may a residence permit for the GPE be granted . An application for a provisional residence visa is evaluated on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit .", "In general , the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON ) decides on requests lodged by aliens for residence in the GPE ( LAW ( DATE ) ) . The Minister of ORG can refuse entry and residence on general interest grounds ( gronden aan het algemeen belang ontleend ) .", "In view of the situation in the GPE as regards population size and employment , Government immigration policy DATE defined at the time in the DATE Aliens Circular ( Vreemdelingencirculaire DATE ) DATE is aimed at restricting the number of aliens admitted to the GPE . In general , an application for a residence permit in the GPE is granted only if the individual \u2019s presence serves an essential national interest or if there are compelling humanitarian grounds to do so ( LAW of the DATE Aliens Circular ) .", "The policy for admission for family reunion purposes was laid down in LAW of the DATE Aliens Circular . It provided that the following persons , where relevant , may qualify for family reunion if certain conditions ( relating to matters such as public policy and means of subsistence ) are met :", "\u2013 a person \u2019s spouse ,", "\u2013 a minor child born into the marriage who actually belongs to the family unit ( gezin ) , and", "\u2013 a minor child born outside the marriage who actually belongs to the family unit ( e.g. a child of CARDINAL of the spouses from a previous marriage or a foster child ) .", "The phrase \u201c actually belonging to the family unit \u201d ( \u201c feitelijk behoren QUANTITY \u201d ) used in GPE law overlaps only partly with the term \u201c family life \u201d in LAW . The former is understood to mean , for instance , that the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between the child and its parents whom it wishes to join in the GPE already existed in another country and have been maintained . For the rest , the question of whether the close family ties should be deemed to have been severed is answered on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each specific case . Factors taken into consideration include the length of time during which parent and child have been separated and the reasons for the separation , the way in which the relationship between parent and child has been developed during the separation , the parent \u2019s involvement in the child \u2019s care and upbringing , custody arrangements , the amount and frequency of the parent \u2019s financial contributions to the child \u2019s care and upbringing , the parent \u2019s intention to send for the child from the GPE as soon as possible and his / her efforts to do so , and the length of time that the child has lived in a family other than with the parent . Living together in the GPE without a permanent residence permit is not seen as restoring severed family ties ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
