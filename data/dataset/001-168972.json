In DATE the tax authorities started a tax audit on ORG and looked into the owners behind PERSON .

DATE p. DATE , with reference to ORG . DATE p. CARDINAL , summarised at paragraph CARDINAL below .", "A summary of the particular circumstances pertaining to the first and second applicants is given below .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was interviewed first as a witness on DATE ; on DATE he was arrested and gave evidence as a person charged ( \u201c siktet \u201d ) . He admitted the factual circumstances but did not accept criminal liability . He was released after DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was indicted for violations of sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) , cf . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , of LAW DATE ( ligningsloven ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below for the text of these provisions ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( skattekontoret ) amended his tax assessment for DATE , after issuing a warning to that effect on DATE , with reference inter alia to the tax audit , to the criminal investigation , to the evidence given by him , as mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above , and to documents seized by ORG in the investigation . For DATE the amendment was made on the ground that the first applicant had omitted to declare a general income of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , having instead declared a loss of ORG CARDINAL . Moreover , with reference to sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below for the text of these provisions ) , ORG ordered him to pay a tax penalty of PERCENT , to be calculated on the basis of the tax that he owed in respect of the undeclared amount . The decision had regard inter alia to evidence given by the first and second applicants during their interviews in the criminal investigation . The first applicant did not lodge an appeal against that decision and paid the outstanding tax due , with the penalty , before the expiry of the DATE time - limit for lodging an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( tingrett ) convicted the first applicant on charges of aggravated tax fraud and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment on account of his having failed to declare , in his tax return for DATE , the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL in earnings obtained abroad . In determining the sentence ORG had regard to the fact that the first applicant had already been significantly sanctioned by the imposition of the tax penalty .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed , complaining that , in breach of LAW No . CARDINAL to ORG , he had been both prosecuted and punished twice : in respect of the same offence under section CARDINAL he had been charged and indicted by the public prosecutor , had then had a tax penalty imposed on him by the tax authorities , which he had paid , and had thereafter been convicted and sentenced .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG ( lagmannsrett ) unanimously rejected his appeal ; similar reasoning was subsequently given by ORG ( PERSON ) in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( summarised below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE ORG first considered whether the CARDINAL sets of proceedings in question had concerned the same factual circumstances ( samme forhold ) . In this connection it noted the developments in the Convention case - law expounded in the ORG judgment of PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 MONEY , DATE , DATE , ECHR DATE ) and the attempt in that judgment to harmonise through the following conclusion :", "\u201c ... LAW CARDINAL must be understood as prohibiting the prosecution or trial of a second \u2018 offence\u2019 in so far as it arises from identical facts or facts which are substantially the same . ... The ORG \u2019s inquiry should therefore focus on those facts which constitute a set of concrete factual circumstances involving the same defendant and [ are ] inextricably linked together in time and space ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the present instance , ORG observed , there was no doubt that the factual circumstances underlying the decision to impose tax penalties and the criminal prosecution had sufficient common features to meet these criteria . In both instances , the factual basis was the omission to declare income on the tax return . The requirement that the proceedings relate to the same matter had accordingly been met .", "CARDINAL . ORG next examined whether both sets of proceedings concerned an \u201c offence \u201d within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL . In this regard ORG reiterated its ruling as reported in PERSON ( \u201c GPE . \u201d ) DATE p. CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that tax penalties at the ordinary level ( PERCENT ) were consistent with the notion of \u201c criminal charge \u201d in LAW . That earlier assessment had relied on the CARDINAL socalled \u201c PERSON criteria \u201d ( the legal classification of the offence under national law ; the nature of the offence ; and the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risked incurring ) as spelled out in the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and Others v. the GPE ( DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . Of importance for ORG assessment was the general preventive purpose of the tax penalty and the fact that , because PERCENT was a high rate , considerable sums could be involved . ORG further had regard to its judgment as reported in GPE . DATE p. CARDINAL , where it had held in the light of the GPE case - law ( to the effect that the notion of \u201c penalty \u201d should not have different meanings under different provisions of the Convention ) that a PERCENT tax penalty was also a criminal matter for the purposes of LAW No . DATE a stance adopted without further discussion in GPE . DATE p. CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that both ORG ( ORG ) and ORG ) were of the view that it was unlikely that a tax penalty at the ordinary level would not be deemed criminal punishment for the purposes of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG further had regard to the ORG \u2019s more recent case - law ( PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , with references to PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINALVII ; and PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALXIII ) to the effect that a wider range of criteria than merely the PERSON criteria applied to the assessment under LAW . It found confirmation in PERSON ( cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) \u2013 later followed in GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) DATE that the CARDINAL PERSON criteria for establishing the existence of a \u201c criminal charge \u201d for the purposes of Article CARDINAL applied equally to the notion of criminal punishment in LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Against this background , ORG found no ground on which to depart from its above - mentioned rulings of DATE and DATE , holding that tax penalties at the ordinary level were to be regarded as \u201c criminal punishment \u201d ( straff ) for the purposes of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . It went on to observe that a condition for protection under the abovementioned provision was that the decision which barred further prosecution \u2013 in this case the decision of DATE to impose ordinary tax penalties DATE had to be final . That decision had not been appealed against to the highest administrative body within the DATE time - limit , which had expired on DATE , and was in this sense final . If , on the other hand , the expiry of the sixmonth time - limit for lodging a judicial appeal under LAW ) of LAW were to be material , the decision had not yet become final when ORG delivered its judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The words \u201c finally acquitted or convicted \u201d in LAW No . CARDINAL had been formulated with a view to situations where the barring decision was a judgment in a criminal case . ORG had established that a decision was final when it was res judicata , when no further ordinary remedies were available . In this regard , the time when a decision became res judicata according to the rules of national law would be decisive . Neither the wording of the provision , nor its drafting history , nor the case - law provided any guidance for situations where the barring decision was an administrative one . It was pointed out that , in GPE . DATE p. CARDINAL , ORG had expressed an authoritative view to the effect that a tax assessment decision , including a decision on tax penalties , ought to be regarded as final when the taxpayer was precluded from challenging it ( p. CARDINAL ) , without specifying , however , whether it was the time - limit for an administrative appeal , or rather for a judicial appeal , which was decisive . In the present case , ORG observed that the best solution would be to consider that the DATE time - limit for an administrative appeal was decisive in relation to LAW . Otherwise , there would be clarity DATE in cases where the taxpayer did not institute proceedings before the courts and , where he or she did so , only after a legally enforceable judgment DATE that would vary and could be lengthy . The decision of DATE was therefore to be considered as final for the purposes of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the first applicant had been charged on DATE and that the warning about the amendment of his tax assessment had been sent on DATE . Thereafter the case concerning the tax penalties and the criminal case had been conducted in parallel until they had been decided respectively by a decision of DATE and a judgment of CARDINAL DATE . A central question in this case was whether there had been successive prosecutions , which would be contrary to LAW , or parallel treatment , which was permissible to some extent . In this connection ORG had regard to CARDINAL inadmissibility decisions , GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; and PERSON v. GPE , cited above , in particular the following passage from the latter :", "\u201c However , the ORG is unable to agree with the applicant that the decision to withdraw his driving licence amounted to new criminal proceedings being brought against him . While the different sanctions were imposed by CARDINAL different authorities in different proceedings , there was nevertheless a sufficiently close connection between them , in substance and in time , to consider the withdrawal to be part of the sanctions under NORP law for the offences of aggravated drunken driving and unlawful driving ( see PERSON v. GPE , cited above , and , mutatis mutandis , PERSON v. the GPE , no . FAC , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VII ) . In other words , the withdrawal did not imply that the applicant was \u2018 tried or punished again ... for an offence for which he had already been finally ... convicted\u2019 , in breach of LAW No . CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the present case , ORG held that there could be no doubt that there was a sufficient connection in substance and time . The CARDINAL cases had their basis in the same factual circumstances \u2013 the lack of information on the tax return which had led to a deficient tax assessment . The criminal proceedings and the administrative proceedings had been conducted in parallel . After the first applicant had been charged on DATE , a warning had followed on DATE about an amendment to his tax assessment , then an indictment on DATE , the tax authorities\u2019 decision of DATE to amend the assessment , and ORG judgment of DATE . To a great extent the administrative - law and criminal - law processing had been interconnected .", "CARDINAL . The purpose behind LAW , to provide protection against the burden of being subjected to a new procedure , had applied to a lesser degree here , in as much as the first applicant had had no legitimate expectation of being subjected to CARDINAL procedure . In such a situation the interest in ensuring effective prosecution was preponderant .", "CARDINAL . Following the tax audit in DATE referred to in paragraph CARDINAL above , during the autumn of DATE the tax authorities reported to ORG that the second applicant had failed to declare on his tax return for DATE income of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) earned from his sale of certain shares .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG put the second applicant on notice that it was considering amending his tax assessment and imposing a tax penalty , referring inter alia to the tax audit , the criminal investigation and the evidence given by him , mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above , and to documents seized by ORG in the investigation . On DATE ORG amended his tax assessment to the effect that he owed ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in tax in respect of the undeclared income . In addition , with reference to sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW , it decided to impose a tax penalty of PERCENT . The decision had regard inter alia to evidence given by the first and second applicants during interviews in the criminal investigation . The second applicant paid the tax due , with the penalty , and did not appeal against the decision , which became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the public prosecutor indicted the second applicant for a violation of section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) , cf . LAW CARDINAL - CARDINAL , of LAW on the ground that for the tax year(s ) DATE and/or DATE he had omitted to declare income of ORG CARDINAL on his tax return , which represented a tax liability of ORG CARDINAL . The public prosecutor requested ORG ( tingrett ) to pass a summary judgment based on his confession ( tilst\u00e5elsesdom ) . In addition , Mr GPE , Mr GPE and Mr G.A. pleaded guilty and consented to summary trials on a guilty plea .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant ( unlike GPE , ORG ) withdrew his confession , as a result of which the public prosecutor issued a revised indictment on CARDINAL DATE , including the same charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after holding an adversarial hearing , convicted the second applicant on the charges of aggravated tax fraud and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , account being taken of the fact that he had already had a tax penalty imposed on him .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed against the ORG procedure to ORG , arguing in particular that by reason of the prohibition against double jeopardy in LAW No . CARDINAL , the fact that he had had a tax penalty imposed on him constituted a bar against criminal conviction . Thus he requested that ORG judgment be quashed ( opphevet ) and that the prosecution case be dismissed ( avvist ) from the courts .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the second applicant \u2019s appeal , relying essentially on its reasoning in the case of the first applicant , which was similar to that of ORG summarised above ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Thus , ORG found that the tax authorities\u2019 decision of DATE ordering him to pay a tax penalty of PERCENT did constitute a criminal punishment ( straff ) ; that the decision had become \u201c final \u201d upon the expiry of the time - limit for lodging an appeal on DATE ; and that the decision on the tax penalty and the subsequent criminal conviction concerned the same matter .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , as in the case of the first applicant , ORG considered that parallel proceedings \u2013 both administrative and criminal DATE were to some extent permissible under LAW , provided that the second proceedings had commenced before the first had become final . Where that minimum requirement had been fulfilled , an assessment had to be made of the state of progress of the second set and , not least , as to whether there was a sufficient connection in substance and in time between the first and second decisions .", "CARDINAL . As to the concrete assessment of the second applicant \u2019s case , ORG observed that the criminal proceedings and the tax proceedings had in fact been conducted in parallel since as far back as the tax authorities\u2019 complaint to the police in DATE and until the decision to impose the tax penalty had been taken in DATE . This state of affairs was similar to the case of the first applicant . The second applicant had been indicted and the case referred to ORG with a request for a summary judgment on the basis of his confession on DATE , before the decision on the tax penalty . The criminal proceedings had thus reached a relatively advanced stage by the time the decision to impose the tax penalty had been taken . The DATE period DATE from when the tax authorities\u2019 decision of DATE had become final until the second applicant \u2019s conviction of DATE by ORG had been somewhat longer than the CARDINAL - and - a - half - month period in the case of the first applicant . However , this could be explained by the fact that the second applicant had withdrawn his confession in DATE , with the consequence that he had had to be indicted anew on CARDINAL DATE and an ordinary trial hearing had had to be scheduled . Against this background , ORG ( like ORG ) concluded that there was undoubtedly a sufficient connection in substance and time between the decision on the tax penalties and the subsequent criminal conviction .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG refused the second applicant leave to appeal , finding that such leave was warranted neither by the general importance of the case nor by any other reason ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P7"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P7-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
