THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 14+P1-1", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant turned DATE . Prior to that date she was in receipt of long - term incapacity benefit ( ORG ) , a benefit payable to people incapable of work who satisfy the eligibility criteria . She had qualified for the rate of MONEY ( GBP ) DATE . She was also paid GBP CARDINAL per week in disability living allowance ( ORG ) and GBP CARDINAL in ORG care . At DATE , which is the date of entitlement to the State pension for women , she ceased to be eligible for ORG . In its place she became entitled to draw her state retirement pension which , based upon her contribution record , entitled her to ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL per week ( PERCENT of the maximum rate as she had only contributed for DATE out of CARDINAL ) . She continued to draw ORG . As a result , the applicant claimed that she was some GBP CARDINAL.CARDINAL per week worse off as a result of her transition from ORG to the State pension .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to ORG concerning the differential treatment but was informed that nothing could be done .", "CARDINAL . The National Insurance Act DATE , which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in GPE , set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population , whether employed or self - employed , are liable to pay compulsory national insurance ( \u201c NI \u201d ) contributions into ORG ( ORG ) . This legislation has since been replaced , most recently , by the consolidating provisions of ORG DATE ( \u201c SSCBA DATE \u201d ) and ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the SSCBA sets out the various classes of NI contribution . Of these , the largest category is Class CARDINAL contributions which consist of earnings - related contributions paid by employers and employees . Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee \u2019s earnings band . The ORG scheme is financed on a \u201c pay as you go \u201d basis , that is , current NI contributions fund current benefits : thus an individual \u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others ( NORP ( PERSON ) v. Secretary of ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER paras . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Primary Class CARDINAL contributions to NI cease to be payable on attainment of the ORG retirement age ( section PERSON ) of the SSCBA ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is currently the sole source of funding for payment of state retirement pensions as well as a number of other benefits , including ORG . Topping up into the fund by way of ORG Grant is possible in times of shortfall but has not occurred since DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Social Security ( Incapacity for work ) Act DATE amended LAW so as to include provision for the payment of ORG from DATE . LAW provides , as relevant :", "\u201c ... ( CARDINAL ) Subject to the following provisions of this section , a person who satisfies either of the following conditions is entitled to short - term incapacity benefit in respect of DATE of incapacity for work which forms part of a period of incapacity for work .", "( CARDINAL ) The conditions are that -", "( a ) he is under pensionable age on DATE in question and satisfies the contribution conditions specified for short - term incapacity benefit in Schedule CARDINAL , Part CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ;", "...", "( CARDINAL ) In any period of incapacity for work a person is not entitled to short - term incapacity benefit for DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) Where a person ceases by virtue of subsection ( CARDINAL ) above to be entitled to short - term incapacity benefit , he is entitled to long - term incapacity benefit in respect of any subsequent day of incapacity for work in the same period of incapacity for work on which he is not over pensionable age . \u201d", "CARDINAL . IB is a contributory benefit funded out of NI contributions , designed to compensate a person for financial loss as a result of their inability to work due to ill - health or disability . It is therefore available throughout the assumed working life . As a result the period of entitlement is directly linked , for men and women , to the period of entitlement ( if any ) to receive the ORG retirement pension . When an individual reaches State pension age any entitlement to such a pension takes the place of ORG . A full basic retirement pension pays ORG per week , while the standard rate of ORG is GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , section CARDINAL of ORG DATE defined \u201c pensionable age \u201d as :", "\u201c ( a ) DATE , in the case of a man ; and", "( b ) DATE , in the case of a woman \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Women in GPE therefore become eligible for a State pension at DATE , whereas men are not eligible until CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Pensions Act DATE provides for the equalisation of State pension ages for men and women to DATE . GPE pension age for women will increase gradually from DATE and the equalisation will be complete in DATE . At the same time , the age until which women are liable to pay national insurance contributions will gradually increase in line with the increase in GPE pension age .", "CARDINAL . Council Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security . However , in LAW provides for derogation in the matter of \u201c the determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old - age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences thereof for other benefits \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment in Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL PERSON and Others [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , ORG ( ECJ ) ruled that where , pursuant to LAW , a Member State prescribed different pensionable ages for men and women for the purpose of granting old - age and retirement pensions the scope of the permitted derogation defined by the words \u201c possible consequences thereof for other benefits \u201d was limited to the forms of discrimination existing under other benefits schemes which were necessarily and objectively linked to the difference in pensionable age . That was the position where such forms of discrimination were objectively necessary to avoid disturbing the financial equilibrium of the social security system or to ensure coherence between the retirement pension scheme and other benefit schemes .", "CARDINAL . In Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Secretary of ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , the ECJ considered the predecessor of ORG , namely invalidity allowance and invalidity pension ( both contributory benefits paid from NI contributions until pensionable age or until the cessation of any deferment in pension ) . It found that the measures were justified by both considerations of financial equilibrium and overall coherence and that the discrimination was necessarily linked to the difference in pensionable age for men and women , inter alia as invalidity benefit was designed to replace income from occupational activity and was replaced by a retirement pension at the age at which the recipients would in any event stop working .", "CARDINAL . The derogation was not however held to justify pension - aged linked discrimination in a number of benefits e.g. in NORP v. Secretary of ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] ORG , the ECJ held that the provision of DATE fuel allowances for the elderly was not necessarily linked to the difference in the statutory age of retirement for men and women and in NORP v. Secretary of ORG ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] PERSON , the ECJ found that the discrimination in age entitlement to free prescriptions was not objectively justified to ensure coherence between the retirement pension system and the regulations concerning prescriptions and was not necessarily linked to the difference DATE for men and women .", "CARDINAL . In Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL The Queen v. Secretary of ORG , ex parte ORG [ DATE ] ECRCARDINAL - CARDINAL ( \u201c the ORG case \u201d concerning a reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court relating to the differing contribution periods applicable to men and women determined according to pensionable age ) , the ECJ found that :", "LAW had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old - age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference ;", "Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where , having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears , it can not be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age ;", "In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems , in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods , and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from DATE to the next in respect of those periods , the ORG legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by LAW and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by LAW were to be interpreted restrictively ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
