POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objections dismissed (ratione temporis, ratione materiae, non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant owns a plot of land with a surface area of QUANTITY , located in the municipality of GPE , near GPE . It is listed in the local land register under entry No . DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his neighbours lodged their objections to a proposed new land development plan to be adopted by the municipality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipal council of PERSON adopted the local land development plan . The applicant 's objections were not taken into consideration . Under the plan , the applicant 's land was designated for agricultural purposes . A road and a hospital were to be constructed on his land after expropriation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his neighbours complained of this decision to the GPE Governor , arguing inter alia that the plan breached their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions . They submitted that the local land development plan had been prepared in a manner which failed to take properly into consideration and reconcile the various interests of the municipality and the local owners . As a result , the plan was unreasonable and did not comply with the standards of good land administration .", "CARDINAL . They transferred the complaint to ORG , after being informed that it alone was competent to examine the matter .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the complaint , considering that there were no indications that the municipal authorities had failed to take into consideration and properly weigh the various competing interests involved in the preparation of the local land development plan . It noted that the restrictions on ownership imposed by land development measures were not per se incompatible with the nature of ownership guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and CARDINAL other inhabitants of PERSON requested the Mayor to amend the DATE plan in order to avoid the loss of various investments they had made in their land after the implementation of the plan 's projects . This request apparently remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG , in reply to a query submitted by the applicant and other persons , stated that the municipal authorities were under no obligation to provide any compensation for owners whose property was to be expropriated in the future . They were also informed that the validity of the DATE plan had been prolonged for DATE under the amendment to LAW DATE adopted in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor of PERSON refused the applicant 's request for an initial approval of a development project on his land ( decyzja o warunkach zabudowy ) , considering that the project would be incompatible with the local land development plan . The applicant wished to have a house built on his land while , under the plan , it was designated for the construction of a road and a hospital .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision to the Mazowiecki Governor . In a reply of DATE , he was informed that the appeal should be lodged with ORG and that the construction of the road in PERSON would not be budgeted before DATE at the earliest . The applicant addressed ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal on the ground that his construction project was incompatible with the land development plan . It was further reiterated that , under LAW DATE , he had no right to compensation for the fact that his land had been \u201c frozen \u201d or for the restrictions on its use .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the plan had been amended in that the construction of the hospital was no longer foreseen . However , the project to build a road remained valid , but no timeframe was specified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the Municipality to acquire his property . ORG refused to do so by a letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that the decisions it had given in respect of the land development in his neighbourhood were incompatible with the land development plan adopted in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the ORG informed the applicant that , under domestic law , the owners of property to be expropriated in the future had no right to compensation for the fact that their land could not be developed . They would be entitled to compensation only after the final expropriation decisions in respect of their property had been taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal against the decision of DATE . The court observed that its jurisdiction was limited to the examination of the lawfulness of the impugned decision . It found that the decision was lawful as it was common ground between the parties that the applicant 's construction project was incompatible with the local land development plan .", "It further noted that the applicant had complained that his situation could not be seen as being compatible with the LAW , given that owners affected by plans adopted prior to the LAW 's entry into force could not benefit from compensation claims provided for by section CARDINAL of LAW DATE . The court referred to the judgment of ORG given in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which had examined the compatibility with LAW of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . That provision had excluded the application of the owners ' right to compensation under section CARDINAL to land development plans adopted before DATE . It had found the provision to be compatible with the LAW .", "ORG observed that it was not its task to amend or criticise existing laws and that it was bound by this provision . Otherwise , there were no grounds on which to consider that the decision challenged by the applicant had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE the applicant petitioned the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed him that the legal framework for \u201c frozen land \u201d was governed by LAW DATE . Under section CARDINAL of this Act , owners of such plots were entitled to various forms of compensation , but only insofar as their plots were affected by land development plans adopted after DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the validity of the DATE land development plan expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted an initial planning permit ( decyzja o warunkach zabudowy ) in respect of his land .", "CARDINAL . DATE to DATE questions of land development were governed by LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW was enacted . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG passed a law amending LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW was enacted which repealed LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of DATE owners of properties to be expropriated in the future were not entitled to any form of compensation for damage resulting from restrictions on the use of their property or the reduction in its value originating in expropriations to be carried out at an undetermined future date .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW enacted in DATE created for local authorities a number of obligations towards owners whose properties were designated for expropriation at an undetermined future date under land development plans adopted by the competent municipal authorities . The municipalities were obliged to buy such property , replace it with other land within DATE of an owner 's request , or provide compensation for the damage caused by the designation .", "CARDINAL . However , pursuant to LAW , these obligations and the corresponding claims of the owners applied only to plans adopted after LAW had entered into force , i.e. to plans adopted by local municipalities after DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the DATE Act , plans adopted before its entry into force were to expire on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an amendment to LAW was adopted under which the validity of such plans was extended for DATE until DATE . Again , on DATE , ORG passed a law amending LAW DATE which extended until DATE the validity of the land development plans adopted before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , all local plans adopted before DATE remained valid , but not beyond DATE .", "CARDINAL . Compensation entitlements for owners , provided for by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , were in essence maintained by LAW . Pursuant to LAW , when , following the adoption of a new local land development plan , the use of property in the manner provided for by a previous plan has become impossible or has been restricted , it is open to the owner to claim compensation from the municipality , or to request the municipality to buy the plot . Any litigation which may arise in this respect between municipalities and owners can be pursued before the civil courts . It would appear that the operation of LAW is not retroactive , thus limiting the scope of any such claims to the period after the adoption of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Other relevant legislative provisions are extensively set out in the ORG 's judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG examined the request submitted to it by the ORG to determine the compatibility with LAW of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW DATE insofar as it excluded the application of section CARDINAL of that Act to land development plans adopted before DATE . The court referred to its established case - law to the effect that ownership could not be regarded as ius infinitivum . Consequently , its exercise was normally restrained by many legal and practical considerations , including the necessity of balancing the owners ' interests against those of other persons . Local land development plans were to be regarded only as a practical expression of restraints originating in numerous statutes regulating the lawful exercise of ownership . In particular , owners of properties \u201c frozen \u201d for the purpose of future expropriations as a result of the adoption of such plans could normally continue to use their properties as they had been using them prior to the adoption of such plans . This did not amount to such an interference with ownership that it could be regarded as being incompatible with the constitutional protection of ownership ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
