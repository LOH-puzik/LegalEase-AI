The doctors preferred a birth by Caesarean section on account of the baby \u2019s position . The birth had initially been scheduled for DATE , but during TIME DATE I had pains , and the baby was born by Caesarean section DATE . I do n\u2019t know what happened after that . I was told that the baby had been transferred to another hospital on account of a respiratory problem , but that he had not been admitted because there were no available places , and that he died in an ambulance , in the garden of a hospital , without a doctor taking the trouble to care for him . I want those responsible for my son \u2019s death to be punished . \u201d", "Mr Gen\u00e7 : \u201c My son was born prematurely at the LOC public hospital . The doctors decided to transfer him to another hospital with better equipment . The KT\u00dc PERSON hospital did not admit him owing to a lack of places . He was also refused admission to ORG , for the same reasons . Instead of caring for my son , the doctors wasted time with administrative formalities . They did not even take the trouble to examine him , although it was an emergency situation . They ought to have diagnosed and treated him . We fought for TIME for my son to be seen by a doctor , but no hospital would agree to admit him . After several trips back and forth between hospitals , he died in an ambulance , in a hospital garden . Had my son been admitted to hospital in time , he would not have died . The persons responsible must be punished . \u201d", "\u00d6.B. : \u201c Mr Gen\u00e7 is a friend . I accompanied him on TIME of the incident . We followed behind the ambulance in a car . At the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital , the duty paediatrician , PERSON , was annoyed that the transfer had been carried out without any prior checks that there was indeed a place available at the hospital . She paid no attention to the baby . She was busy with the administrative side of things and asked for documents proving that there were in fact no places in the other hospitals . She first called ORG , then the GPE public hospital , to check . She told us that there were indeed places at ORG , but that the duty doctor had simply not wished to be disturbed . She advised us to request an official signed document stating that there were no places available in the hospital . She added that if the doctors at ORG were confronted with such a request , they would certainly change their attitude , find a place and agree to admit the child . When we went to ORG , doctor PERSON told us that there were no places available and that they could not take the child into their care . Instead of looking after the child , who needed urgent medical assistance , he preferred to spend time drawing up a document stating that there were no places in the hospital . TIME were lost in this way . After numerous back - and - forth trips between hospitals , the child ended up having a heart attack . Treatment by the emergency doctor was not enough to save him . Nobody wanted to take charge of the child . No emergency doctor examined him . They all refused to admit him and tried at any cost to transfer him to another hospital . This indifference towards a child who required emergency medical killed him . \u201d", "The medical staff :", "ORG : \u201c I work as a gynaecologist and obstetrician at the LOC public hospital . PERSON Caesarean section proceeded normally . We handed over the child to the paediatrician after the birth . He was crying . I do n\u2019t know what happened after that , since I continued with the operation . \u201d", "ORG : \u201c I work as a midwife in the LOC public hospital . PERSON gave birth to a boy . The child was showing no anomalies when I took him in my arms . Suddenly , for a reason I do n\u2019t understand , he had difficulty breathing . Doctor N.A. stepped in right away . The child was intubated . He was transferred to another hospital by ambulance . \u201d", "N.A. : \u201c I work as a paediatrician at the G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane public hospital . I saw the child TIME after his birth . I intervened as a matter of urgency , since he was not breathing correctly and his pulse was weak . Once his condition had stabilised , we organised his transfer to a better equipped hospital . I had been told that there was a place available at the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital . The child was transferred by ambulance and he was intubated during the transfer . \u201d", "GPE : \u201c I work as an anaesthetist at the LOC public hospital . PERSON gave birth by Caesarean section to a QUANTITY - old premature baby . Shortly afterwards , the midwife told us that the child had breathing difficulties . The paediatrician intervened immediately to provide the necessary treatment . It was decided to transfer him to another hospital , since there was no appropriate medical unit on site . I was in the ambulance with ORG The child was intubated . The transfer was carried out in an incubator . At the KT\u00dc PERSON hospital , the duty paediatrician , PERSON , did not examine the child . She simply said that we should go to ORG . Once there , doctor PERSON also refused to admit the child on the grounds that there were no available places . He took this decision without even examining the child . We went back and forth between hospitals , but no one would accept him . He died in the ambulance outside ORG . \u201d", "E.\u0130. : \u201c I work as a nurse at the NORP public hospital . I was on duty on DATE of the incident . The child had been brought to us in an incubator so that we would take him to the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital . Once there , doctor PERSON told us that it was impossible to take charge of the child and that he ought to be looked after by a specialised paediatrician . He told us to go and see doctor PERSON That is what we did . Ms DATE , without even examining the child , told us that there were no places in the hospital and that he should be transferred to ORG . We went there immediately . Doctor PERSON did not examine the child . He simply told us that there were no places in the hospital . We insisted for TIME that he take the child in for treatment . He refused . We then set off again for the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital . Doctor PERSON again refused to admit the child and insisted that he be transferred to the GPE public hospital . The child \u2019s father and I protested strongly against this decision . Doctor PERSON then asked us to provide her with an official document stating that there were no places at ORG . As no one had thought to give us such a document , we were unable to give it to her . She then asked us to return once more to ORG . Faced with her categorical refusal , we set off once again for ORG . Once there , the doctors again refused to admit the child . The child died in the ambulance at TIME \u201d", "PERSON : \u201c On TIME of the incident , I was on duty at the adult emergency department at the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital . I spoke to the father on the telephone . I told him that paediatrics was not my field , but that I could help him with the transfer to the emergency paediatrics department . \u201d", "T.\u00d6. : \u201c I was on duty at the paediatrics department in the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital on TIME of the incident . The G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane public hospital did not contact us to find out whether or not there were free beds . The child was transferred directly to our hospital . I immediately addressed myself to his care . Other than the presence of meconium on his body , the child was fine . His vital functions were normal . I tested his oxygen saturation level , and it was CARDINAL . As there was a risk that the child would inhale meconium , I preferred to keep him [ at the hospital ] in order to ensure closer monitoring . However , I discovered that there were no beds in the department . The child \u2019s father told me that doctor PERSON had stated that there were places available in the hospital . I then called doctor PERSON , who was in the adult emergency department . He told me that he had thought that there were still places in the neonatal unit , but that he had not thought it necessary to call and check . I then expressed my displeasure to him . The child \u2019s father , who was accompanied by a friend , protested strongly against my decision to refuse to admit [ the child ] for lack of a bed . But I had only followed the procedure . The head of department had expressly asked us not to accept patients if there were no places available and to organise for their immediate transfer . That is what I attempted to do . Someone from ORG told me on the telephone that there was one place available . After completing the administrative formalities , I ordered an ambulance journey . However , the ambulance came back to our hospital TIME , since ORG had refused to admit him . As there was no official document to that effect , I again transferred the patient to the same hospital . As it was impossible to take the child into our care , I did not go ahead with his administrative registration or open a treatment file . \u201d", "Doctor PERSON : \u201c I saw doctor PERSON looking after the child . He was doing well and was not intubated . The oxygen saturation level was PERCENT . \u201d", "Nurse PERSON : \u201c I do not recall having seen any intubated child in the paediatric unit of the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital on TIME of the incident . \u201d", "GPE : \u201c I am a doctor at the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital . The child was taken care of by doctor PERSON From what I saw , his general state was entirely satisfactory . The oxygen saturation level was PERCENT . \u201d", "Y.A. : \u201c I am the head of the paediatric department at KT\u00dc PERSON hospital . My assistant , doctor PERSON , was right to refuse to admit the child , because we can not admit patients when the department is full . On the other hand , she ought to have opened an administrative file . \u201d", "K.B. : \u201c I was on duty at ORG . At TIME on DATE , an ambulance carrying an intubated newborn baby arrived at our hospital . I did not want to take the child out of the incubator , since there is a risk of hypothermia with premature babies . I called doctor PERSON to ask for his advice , since the child needed to be put on a respirator , but there were no available places in the department . I called the other hospitals to try to find a place , but without success . I then told them to return to the KT\u00dc Farabi hospital . TIME , they came back asking for an official document stating that there were no available places in our hospital . I did not give them a document of this sort , but I told them they could visit the department if they did n\u2019t believe me . While I was in the middle of explaining all this , I was suddenly informed that the child had had a heart attack . I immediately went into the ambulance to carry out resuscitation , but in spite of all my efforts I was unable to save the child . I do not think that I was negligent . If we had admitted the child , we would have had to care for him in an ordinary bed . We would have been unable to control his temperature and guarantee artificial ventilation in those conditions , which in fact would probably have caused an even quicker death . \u201d", "PERSON : \u201c PERSON called me to ask for advice . As we had no places , I told him to organise a transfer to the nearest university hospital . The patient was in an incubator in the ambulance . Yet we did n\u2019t even have an incubator available in the hospital . We would have lost the patient much more quickly had we admitted him . We could n\u2019t really do anything else .
