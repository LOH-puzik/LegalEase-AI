The applicant was born in DATE and is currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and DATE he requested ORG ( Migrationsverket ) to grant him asylum and a residence permit in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Board held a first interview with the applicant on DATE during which he stated that he was NORP ' NORP and came from a city in the south of GPE where his wife and CARDINAL minor sons remained . A smuggler had arranged for his travel to GPE and he had travelled all the way hidden in a lorry . He claimed that he had criticised the NORP government on several occasions and , the last time he had participated in a student demonstration to show his sympathy , he had been arrested . He had spent DATE in GPE prison and then been transferred to a prison in his home town where he had spent DATE . He had never been formally tried in court but DATE there had been a sort of religious trial where he had been put before a priest who had decided on his continued imprisonment . While imprisoned , he had been subjected to torture and still suffered from headaches because of it . He knew others who had participated in the demonstration and who were still imprisoned without trial .", "CARDINAL . A complete asylum investigation was conducted by ORG on DATE where the applicant maintained his initial statements and essentially added the following . In DATE he had quit his job and returned to his village to work as a farmer . He had discussed with other villagers about the lack of human rights and freedom in GPE . TIME ORG ( a \u201c people 's militia \u201d , loyal to the Supreme Leader ) had come and destroyed his fields with a tractor . When he had tried to report the incident to the police , they had advised him not to , since it would lead nowhere . He had also expressed his opinion of the government when he had watched television in public places . ORG had later destroyed his car , thrown stones at his house and sent messages that he should stop his activities and \u201c information evenings \u201d . He had received the threats through a relative of his wife who worked for the regime . The threats had commenced in DATE but had become more serious after he had participated in his first demonstration in DATE . It had been a student demonstration and he had escaped when the police intervened . On DATE he had participated in his second student demonstration where he had been arrested because police had closed off all escape routes and had been filming the protesters as evidence . Many others had also been arrested . During the demonstration they had shouted slogans against the president and the government and demanded the release of student prisoners . In GPE prison he had been tortured . He had been stabbed twice in the thigh , boiling water had been poured over his chest and his captors had hit him with their fists . However , on DATE , he had been transferred to the prison in his home town . He had been planning to escape for DATE by being very co - operative with the prison guards so that he had earned their trust . The \u201c religious trials \u201d had taken place at a court outside the prison and the applicant had spoken with CARDINAL of his friends , who had visited him in prison to help him . On DATE he had been taken to the court and his friends had been there . He had worn his normal clothes under his prison outfit and he had not had any handcuffs as the guards trusted him . He had told the guard that he had to go to the bathroom , where he had taken off his prison outfit . In the meantime one of his friends had gone to start the car and another friend had spoken to the guard to distract his attention from the applicant . The applicant had then walked straight out of the court , got into the car and they had driven off . It had been a revolution court and there had been a lot of people . He had then remained hidden at a friend 's home for DATE while his friend had found a smuggler to help him out of the country . While he had been in hiding , his wife had been taken to the police twice for questioning about his whereabouts . His father had also been questioned . The applicant underlined that he was not , and never had been , a member of a political party or any organisation and that he had never been formally convicted of any crime . He was convinced that he would be executed if returned to GPE since he had escaped from prison and because he would be accused of having co - operated with those who are against ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further stated that he continuously suffered from headaches and sleeplessness and had problems with his legs . He submitted a medical certificate , dated DATE and issued by PERSON , a physician at a local health care centre . The certificate stated that the applicant had scars around both ankles , scars on the outside of both kneecaps and CARDINAL lateral scars on his left thigh . He also had a reddish area stretching from his neck down to his chest and when he yawned there was a loud clicking sound from the left side of his jaw . In the physician 's opinion , these injuries could very well originate from the torture to which the applicant claimed that he had been subjected in GPE , namely , that he had been chained around his ankles and suspended upside down for TIME , that boiling water had been thrown at his chest , that he had received blows to his head , jaw , abdomen and legs , and that he had been stabbed twice in the left thigh with a bayonet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request . It first noted that the applicant had not claimed to have been a member either of an organisation or of a political party or to have had a leading role in the organisation of demonstrations . Moreover , the proceedings before the revolutionary courts were in general not open to the public . The ORG found that the applicant had not substantiated his story in any way and that he had thus failed to show that he had been , or would be , of interest to the NORP authorities . It therefore considered that the applicant would not attract special attention from the NORP authorities if he were to be returned to his home country . As concerned the ill - treatment and torture of which the applicant claimed to have been the victim , the ORG found that the medical certificate did not prove that he had been tortured even if the injuries documented could very well originate from the torture described . In its view , there was no reason to believe that the applicant would be subjected to ill - treatment or torture upon return to GPE . Thus , it concluded that the applicant could neither be granted asylum in GPE nor a residence permit based on humanitarian grounds .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , maintaining his claims and adding that CARDINAL of the inhabitants in his home town knew him since he used to be a football player . Moreover , he had been CARDINAL of CARDINAL organisers of the demonstration held in DATE . They had written the banners and decided which slogans to use . The other organisers , who were students and previously imprisoned critics of the regime , had also been punished . Following his escape , his wife had been taken in for questioning about his whereabouts on CARDINAL occasions and had been kept in detention on QUANTITY occasions . His father had been questioned on QUANTITY occasions and their home had also been searched on QUANTITY occasions . The applicant further claimed that he had been kept in an isolation cell for DATE of his detention . Furthermore , the public had access to hearings before the revolutionary courts and it had been relatively easy for him to escape since his friends had distracted the guards and he had thus been able to leave the building . Lastly , submitting CARDINAL medical certificates , the applicant invoked his deteriorating health as he suffered , inter alia , from depression and panic attacks .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was informed that the case would be transferred to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) for further proceedings , following the entry into force of a new LAW ( see below under LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing . In response to his lawyer 's questions the applicant stated , inter alia , that he had participated in demonstrations critical against the regime since DATE and that , in DATE or CARDINAL , he had started to notice that his criticism was not appreciated . He had participated in yearly demonstrations , such as on women 's day and on labour day . Mostly he had participated in meetings on various LOC . A relative of his wife had been an official at the intelligence agency and thus he had been assured that nothing would happen to him . He had been CARDINAL of CARDINAL participants in the demonstration in DATE and he had played no special role , but it had been monitored by the authorities . He had been arrested and accused of being against ORG and the regime . In connection with a visit by his wife to PERSON prison while he was there , she had been detained for DATE and questioned about him . However , no other relatives had been summoned or questioned by the authorities . He had escaped when his friends had come to the revolutionary court for his hearing and had pretended to have a fight with each other so that he could go to the toilets to change . It had then taken him TIME to leave the building since there were no exit controls . In response to questions by ORG , the applicant claimed that he had organised demonstrations and that he had been CARDINAL of the leaders at the demonstration in DATE . He had been arrested because he had been in the front row and had shouted slogans .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG , by CARDINAL votes to one , rejected the appeal . It first noted that the applicant appeared to have expanded his grounds for asylum by claiming that he had not just participated in demonstrations but had actually been involved in organising them . However , since he had not been a member of a party or an organisation which was critical of the regime , the court found it unlikely that he would be of any interest to the authorities in his home country if he returned . It further considered that the applicant 's account of how he had escaped from the revolutionary court was not credible , having regard , inter alia , to international sources which stated that insights into the functioning of the revolutionary courts were very limited . The court also noted that he had remained in GPE for DATE following his escape before leaving the country . Moreover , it found that the applicant had failed to show that he had been tortured in ORG and that his health problems were not of such a serious nature that he could be granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL lay judges dissented as he considered that the applicant had given a credible account of events and should be granted asylum as a refugee in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) , maintaining his claims and stating that he was only telling the truth . He was also of the opinion that ORG had failed to take into account the medical certificate testifying to his torture injuries . He further requested some extra time in order to submit certain documents that his family had sent to him from GPE . The court granted an extension of the time - limit and , on DATE , the applicant submitted , among other things , CARDINAL summonses , CARDINAL to his wife and CARDINAL to his father , to appear before the revolutionary court in his home town on DATE to answer questions concerning the applicant and his escape from prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was called to a meeting with ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a request by the applicant , the President of the ORG to which the case had been allocated decided , under LAW , to indicate to ORG that it was desirable in the interest of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG not to deport the applicant to GPE until further notice .", "CARDINAL . Following the request by the ORG , on DATE ORG stayed the enforcement of the deportation order until further notice .", "CARDINAL . Upon request by ORG , the applicant submitted a forensic medical report dated DATE and issued by PERSON , specialist in forensic medicine at the Crisis and Trauma Centre at FAC . The report was drawn up on the basis of the protocols from the interviews with the applicant before ORG , the medical certificate by PERSON , a letter from the applicant 's representative dated DATE and the applicant 's own story as told to PERSON during his examination on DATE . The report contained photos of the scars together with a written protocol of all the scars and the medical record from the examination as well as Dr PERSON 's opinion .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report noted that the applicant had claimed that he had been tortured in prison in DATE and that the torture had consisted of beating with fists , kicks , being hit on his kneecaps with rifle butts , having a bayonet stuck twice in his thigh , as well as being flogged , suspended upside down for prolonged period of times and having hot water poured over him . He further stated that , as a result of the torture , he suffered from chronic headaches , reduced feeling in his right thigh , reduced mobility of his jaw , reduced eye sight , an ulcer , pain in his knees when walking and medical problems with his thyroid gland and diabetes . Dr GPE examined the applicant and found numerous scars on his body .", "CARDINAL . In Dr PERSON 's opinion , the injuries invoked by the applicant could very well have occurred in DATE as claimed and the scars observed on his body had the appearance and localisation which corresponded well with his statements of how they had appeared . For example , the scars on his kneecaps could well correspond to blows with rifle butts , the marks on the front of his shins from having been kicked with boots , the marks on his left ankle could have appeared as a consequence of having been suspended upside down by his ankles and the pigmentation on his neck corresponded well with a burn injury . In conclusion , PERSON noted that , in cases like this , alternative causes for the origins of the scars could not be completely excluded but that experience showed that self - inflicted injuries and injuries resulting from accidents normally had a different distribution to those showed by the applicant . The findings in the present case favoured the conclusion that the injuries had been inflicted on the applicant completely or to a large extent by other persons and in the manner claimed by him . Thus , the findings strongly indicated that the applicant had been tortured .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced , on DATE , the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . Both the old Aliens Act and the DATE Act define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , LAW , of the DATE Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . Hence , upon entry into force on DATE of the DATE Act , ORG ceased to exist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG PACE ) adopted a resolution on the situation in GPE in which it urged the NORP authorities to refrain from using force and violence against peaceful demonstrators and to release the CARDINAL demonstrators arrested since the elections on DATE as well as the CARDINAL politicians , members of their families and journalists detained . At its subsequent session in GPE , on DATE , ORG of the PACE , adopted a declaration in which it considered the violent reactions of the NORP authorities to peaceful protests to be a serious breach of NORP citizens ' human rights . It also called upon governments of other countries not to expel NORP citizens to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a report ( A/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of ORG Secretary - General on The situation of human rights in GPE , dated DATE , and presented to ORG at its CARDINALth session , it was noted that DATE had seen an increase in human rights violations targeting women , university students , teachers , workers and other activist groups , particularly in the aftermath of the elections in DATE . Hence , during DATE and DATE , several independent ORG experts as well as the Secretary - General had voiced grave concerns about the use of excessive police force , arbitrary arrests , killings , ill - treatment of detainees and the use of torture to obtain confessions . Moreover , a variety of cases suggested a widespread lack of due process , access to lawyers and the failure to respect the rights of detainees , including allegations that individuals had been placed in detention without charge and had been kept \u201c incommunicado \u201d . It was noted that no visits by any special procedure mandate holders had taken place since DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its ORG DATE , ORG noted that respect for basic human rights in GPE continued to deteriorate and that the government showed no tolerance for peaceful protests or gatherings , routinely detaining participants and subjecting them to torture . The ORG and ORG continued to be responsible for many serious human rights violations . ORG , in its ORG DATE , made the same findings , also noting that demonstrations frequently led to mass arrests and unfair trials . Some were also detained without trial for long periods beyond control of the judiciary and were reported to have been tortured and denied access to lawyers and their families . ORG has repeatedly observed that trials before the revolutionary courts are not public . For instance , on CARDINAL August DATE , in its article \u201c Over CARDINAL NORP face grossly unfair trials \u201d , ORG noted that CARDINAL persons had gone on trial in GPE accused of organising widespread civil protests . The trial was held before ORG in GPE and it was closed to the public and even to the defendants ' lawyers .", "CARDINAL . According to Sections CARDINAL.CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG on GPE , dated DATE , the pressure for democratic reform in GPE changed dramatically after the student protests at ORG in DATE . DATE on DATE event , students have gathered at ORG and other major campuses throughout the country and the date has been a flashpoint for violence and tension ( Section CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . Thus , in DATE , CARDINAL of NORP took to the streets and CARDINAL people were arrested all over the country before and after the protests . Although many of them had since been released , there were still scores of students behind bars . Some of these had been in prison since they were arrested as a result of similar disturbances in DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the U.K. Report further noted that in \u201c Evaluation of the DATE Country of ORG on GPE \u201d by PERSON PERSON GPE and Dr PERSON of ORG at ORG , dated DATE , it appeared that , if an NORP arrived in the country without a passport or any valid travel documents , they would be arrested and taken to a special court at FAC in GPE where the background of the individual , the date of their departure from the country , the reason for their illegal departure , their connection with any organisations or groups and any other circumstances would be assessed . This procedure also applied to people who were deported back to GPE , not in the possession of a passport containing an exit visa ; in this case ORG would issue them with a document confirming their nationality . Illegal departure was often prosecuted in conjunction with other , unrelated offences since the investigation into the facts surrounding the offence of illegal departure could result in the discovery of an underlying offence .", "CARDINAL . ORG report FAC , Women and NORP , and ORG , ORG , ORG and Reporting , etc . , released in DATE , following a fact finding mission to GPE from DATE to DATE , stated that some of its sources had claimed that the granting of travel documents at an NORP embassy did not necessarily mean that the person would not face problems with the NORP authorities upon return to GPE . The person in charge of passport border control at the NORP FAC in GPE ( a newly built airport which had replaced GPE airport ) had explained that an NORP travelling on a laissez - passer was likely to be interviewed upon arrival in GPE and questioned about how he or she had lost the previous passport . However , if a person arrived in GPE on a travel document issued by an NORP representation and the security check had been completed at the embassy , the airport authorities would not check his or her identity . The authorities at the airport would , however , ask the person how he or she had left GPE , since there was no exit stamp in his or her new travel document . A source in GPE claimed that , if a person had left GPE illegally , he or she had not been registered in the computer system as having left GPE and therefore would be questioned upon return . It was added that a person who had left the country illegally could also be arrested if he or she had committed an illegal act before leaving GPE . It was further observed that a person on a laissez - passer , issued by an NORP representation abroad , might be fined for illegal exit or subjected to TIME interrogation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
