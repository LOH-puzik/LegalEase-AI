SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national born in DATE . At present she resides at GPE , GPE . She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising at GPE , GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant entered GPE on DATE with her husband , a first secretary at ORG in GPE , and their CARDINAL children , born in DATE and DATE . The applicant 's CARDINAL children from a previous marriage , born in DATE and DATE , remained in GPE . The applicant was granted a work permit for DATE as from DATE . On DATE she applied for an extended work permit . She stated , inter alia , that she and her husband did not have a good marriage and that he assaulted her , that she had rented an apartment in GPE , and that she could not return to GPE since she was afraid of her husband 's relatives . In DATE the applicant 's CARDINAL children who had remained in GPE were brought to GPE .", "The applicant remained in GPE until DATE when it appears she returned to GPE in connection with her husband 's end of work at the ORG .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG invandrarverk ) rejected her above application for a work permit . ORG found that she had no connection to GPE and that she had left the country .", "On DATE the applicant , having returned to GPE , applied for a work permit and a residence permit for DATE as from DATE . The investigations made by ORG disclosed that she and her husband , together with the CARDINAL children , had returned to GPE in DATE and that they had intended to divorce . However , her husband died before the divorce became final . The applicant stated that she had returned to GPE in DATE in order to pay her debts and because she had been employed at a hotel in GPE . She also stated that she stayed in GPE for economical reasons and that she wanted a residence and work permit limited to DATE , after which time she intended to return to GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application and ordered the applicant 's deportation to GPE . ORG found that neither the applicant 's previous stay in GPE \u2013 as the wife of a diplomat \u2013 nor the alleged threats against her by her husband 's relatives constituted grounds for granting her a residence permit . ORG also took into account that the applicant 's children lived in GPE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) . She now stated that she was infected with HIV and that she should be granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds as the necessary medical care was not available in GPE . She submitted CARDINAL medical certificates issued on DATE and DATE according to which the applicant 's HIV infection had been detected in DATE . She made regular visits to the hospital . It was planned to commence an anti - HIV treatment during DATE . As such treatment was complicated and required strict adherence it was further indicated that treatment could only commence if the applicant was given a long - term permit to reside in GPE .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision . Referring to a decision taken by ORG on DATE ( see below ) , ORG considered that the applicant 's health status did not give reason to grant her a residence permit .", "The applicant made a new application for a residence permit . She submitted a medical certificate issued on DATE , according to which her state of health had deteriorated . As a consequence , the anti - HIV treatment previously envisaged had been initiated . She also submitted a certificate issued on DATE maintaining that a deportation of the applicant would result in the termination of her HIV treatment , the consequences of which would be a faster process towards the AIDS stage and her supposed death .", "By a decision of DATE ORG rejected the application stating , inter alia , that a new application has to be based on circumstances which have not previously been examined in the matter .", "The applicant lodged a new application with ORG on DATE . In addition to what she had previously stated , she now claimed that she lived with GPE , a NORP citizen who had been given a permit to reside in GPE in DATE . He had been suffering from an HIV infection for DATE . Allegedly , they had met in DATE and had been cohabiting since DATE . The applicant claimed that she had not previously referred to this relationship , since she was afraid that it would be held against her . She further stated that she did not intend to bring her children to GPE in case she was granted a residence permit . Her brother , who allegedly had taken over the responsibility for her children , planned to send them to school in GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application . ORG noted , inter alia , that the applicant had not previously referred to her relationship with GPE and considered that there were thus reasons to question the seriousness of the relationship . ORG did not find it obvious that the applicant would have been granted a residence permit on the ground of the alleged relationship , had she applied for it according to the main rule laid down in LAW , LAW ( see below ) . Furthermore , the ORG found that it would not be contrary to requirements of humanity to execute the expulsion decision .", "On DATE , following the ORG 's indication to ORG that it was desirable that the applicant not be expelled to GPE before DATE ( see below ) , ORG stayed the applicant 's deportation . The ORG 's decision is still in force .", "PERSON Relevant domestic law and practice", "The basic provisions concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE are laid down in the CARDINAL LAW ( utl\u00e4nningslagen , CARDINAL ) . The LAW also defines the conditions under which an alien can be expelled from the country , as well as procedures related to the enforcement of decisions under LAW . There are normally CARDINAL instances that deal with matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE ; ORG and ORG . In exceptional cases , the ORG may determine whether or not an alien shall be allowed to remain in GPE following a referral to the Government , by either ORG , of an application for residence permit ( LAW ) .", "LAW , LAW provides that an alien staying in GPE for DATE shall have a residence permit . Such a permit may be issued , inter alia , to an alien who is married to or cohabiting with a person domiciled in GPE or who has been granted a residence permit to settle in GPE . A permit may also be issued to an alien who , for humanitarian reasons , should be allowed to settle in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) . A permit to reside in GPE shall , according to LAW , LAW , have been granted before entering the country . As a principal rule all applications made after the alien has entered the country shall be rejected . This does not apply , however , if , inter alia , the alien on humanitarian grounds should be allowed to settle in GPE .", "With regard to diplomatic officials employed by foreign powers in GPE , together with their families , the LAW only applies to the extent prescribed by the Government ( cf . LAW , LAW ) . It follows from LAW ( utl\u00e4nningsf\u00f6rordningen , PERSON ) that diplomatic officials and their families are exempted from the requirement to hold a residence permit .", "As regards serious illness , this may in exceptional cases constitute humanitarian reasons for a residence permit on condition that it is a life - threatening illness for which no treatment can be provided in the alien 's home country . Further , care or treatment in GPE should lead to an improvement in the alien 's condition or be life saving . Thus , the alien 's condition should be so serious that he or she would be likely to die or his or her health would deteriorate considerably if he or she was to be sent home . These principles have been expressed and applied by the Government in a number of precedent rulings of CARDINAL DATE concerning medical humanitarian reasons in general and in rulings of CARDINAL DATE and DATE concerning HIV infection as a reason for a residence permit . The ORG also stated that the mere fact that treatment in GPE is of a higher quality than in the alien 's home country does not constitute grounds for granting a residence permit , nor are financial difficulties in getting the appropriate treatment in the receiving country a reason for granting such a permit .", "ORG ) stated in an opinion of DATE , enclosed in the ORG 's decisions of DATE and referred to in the decision of CARDINAL DATE , that the fact that a person is diagnosed with HIV or AIDS should not alone and generally be decisive of the question of humanitarian grounds . Instead , the assessment should be founded on the alien 's general state of health taking serious clinical symptoms into consideration . ORG concluded that it found no reason , in this respect , to make a difference between HIV infection and other diseases with a serious prognosis .", "Further , according to LAW , an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to residence in GPE ( LAW , LAW ) .", "An alien who is to be refused entry or expelled in accordance with a decision that has gained legal force may be granted a residence permit if he or she files a so - called new application based on circumstances which have not previously been examined in the case of refusal of entry or expulsion and if ( i ) the alien is entitled to a residence permit under LAW , LAW , or ( ii ) it would be contrary to requirements of humanity to execute the refusal - of - entry or expulsion decision ( LAW , LAW b ) .", "Also when it comes to enforcing a decision on refusal of entry or expulsion , regard is taken to the risk of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
