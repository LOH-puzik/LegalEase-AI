The CARDINAL civilians were walking together along FAC and passed PERSON station at TIME . They noticed QUANTITY unmarked police cars parked with their headlights dimmed , each containing CARDINAL ORG officers : CARDINAL car was red and the second dark blue / green .", "As they proceeded along the road , they heard a crash behind them and turned to see on the opposite side of the road the red police car pulling alongside a car ( PERSON ) and ramming it up onto the footpath . The red police car came to a halt in front of the car while the dark blue / green police car pulled up behind hitting it in the rear . The CARDINAL civilians stopped and had an unobstructed view across the road . PERSON emerged from the immobilised car , and appeared shaken . He staggered across the road towards the QUANTITY men followed by QUANTITY police officers . As PERSON reached the white line in the centre of the road , an officer QUANTITY away fired a number of shots . The civilians heard no warning shout or challenge given by any of the officers and saw nothing in PERSON hands or anything threatening in his actions . Some of the shots struck PERSON . He staggered a little further then turned to face the police who , when they caught up with him , verbally abused him and pushed his face into the ground where he was kicked and searched . The police carried out a search of the car .", "The CARDINAL witnesses followed the ambulance which took PERSON to hospital where they stated that they were subjected to hostile and threatening remarks by members of the security forces .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , prior to the release of the official ORG statement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , there were a number of unofficial reports widely circulated in the media to the effect that gloves , masks , guns and bombs had been found in the car , and CARDINAL report to the effect that PERSON was a former NORP prisoner who had been charged in DATE with possession of explosives . This information was not correct . PERSON did however receive an IRA funeral and , in ORG , he was described as a Volunteer of ORG of the IRA and it was said that he had died on active service .", "CARDINAL . An official ORG statement stated that a deputy superintendent of the ORG from outside GPE would investigate the shooting . In a later statement , it was announced that ORG ( the ORG ) would supervise the ORG investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , a detective chief inspector of the ORG criminal investigation department interviewed ORG , in the presence of his solicitor and a representative of the ORG . Sergeant A , member of an HMSU unit , stated as follows .", "He had been at a briefing at TIME DATE before concerning reports of a planned distribution of kit and munitions , including weapons , explosives and mortars , by ORG in GPE . A surveillance operation was to be mounted and he was in charge of the teams on the ground which were going to intervene if possible to intercept the munitions . He was carrying a FAC and Wesson CARDINAL pistol and a MPCARDINAL ORG . At CARDINAL - CARDINAL.CARDINAL p.m. , following reports of a car acting suspiciously at FAC leisure centre , he and his teams left GPE police station to wait at NORP police station . They heard reports there of a build up of activity at the back of QUANTITY houses in GPE street , which were under surveillance . The red car from the leisure centre arrived in GPE street . Sergeant A thought that this was possibly the re - supply of terrorist equipment taking place . He was told by radio to gather his people together \u2013 car crews with call signs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . When the red Orion left GPE street , he and his crews left the police station but were called back almost immediately to allow the red Orion to make its run . A red ORG left GPE street and they were told to allow that to run . News arrived that the red Orion had come back to GPE street . Sergeant A was told on the radio that the next time the red Orion came out they were to intercept it . He split his crews in CARDINAL , his own team ( call signs CARDINAL and DATE ) to approach from the city side and the crews with call signs CARDINAL and DATE to approach from the country side .", "When the red Orion came past the QUANTITY police cars , Sergeant A saw that there was one driver . They pulled out behind it . His driver flashed his lights at it . They switched on their police klaxon but had no blue flashing light on the car and none of them were wearing their police caps . Sergeant A \u2019s car drew level with the Orion and he signalled for it to pull over . The Orion slowed falling behind and then shot past on the passenger side , accelerating down FAC in the direction of the city . Sergeant A told his driver to pursue him and force him off the road . The car possibly reached the speed of CARDINAL , QUANTITY at the fastest . They were in a built up area , in traffic so it was difficult to judge . Their klaxon was going throughout . They drew parallel with the red Orion and nudged it once . The impact was hard enough to force the Orion partly up on the pavement and stop it . Sergeant A \u2019s own car stopped partly on the pavement in front of the Orion . The lock of his door had broken on the impact . He burst out of the door onto the pavement moving towards the Orion . He saw the driver running across the road from left to right at an angle away from him . He was looking over his right shoulder in Sergeant A \u2019s direction as he ran . Sergeant A said that he called out \u201c Police . Halt . \u201d or \u201c Halt . Police . \u201d", "The driver of the ORG turned around towards him . He could not see the man \u2019s hands which were below his waist . His vision was either obscured by the roof of the police car in front of him or the arrival of the other black car ( crew CARDINAL ) on the scene . As he could not see the man \u2019s hands , he thought that his own life or the life of his own driver might be at risk . He feared the man was armed as he had spun round so quickly . He fired a short burst from his MPCARDINAL at the trunk of the man . When he made the split second decision to fire , the man was facing him but he could not say whether he had turned or moved in some other way . He was aware of other police officers shouting . He ran towards the driver who ran towards the footpath on the far side of the road . Constable F was shouting at him to get down on his knees . The driver fell flat , toppling over . It was realised at that stage that he was seriously injured .", "Sergeant A quickly searched the car , while other security force personnel administered first aid to the driver . Either base , or he himself , suggested that the police officers move to GPE street . The military took over the first aid . He had directed most of the police officers to leave the scene as soon as they had arrived , including crew CARDINAL in their car . He did not know that car CARDINAL had come into contact with the Orion or the deceased . He arrived back at the station at CARDINAL to TIME There was a TIME debriefing in which he participated . He also discussed the matter casually with the others who were there . He was instructed to hand in his weapon at about that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a detective inspector carried out a second interview of ORG , in the presence of his solicitor . Further questions were put about his position and actions at the time of the shooting . He recalled that he had had a clear view of the deceased from the waist up . When the deceased turned to face him , he did not make any movements towards him . His arms remained down though . When asked to explain precisely why he had considered that his life was in danger , given that he could not confirm that the deceased was armed , PERSON replied that it had been a prolonged operation lasting TIME involving serious terrorist activity . The red Orion had reacted in a very aggressive manner in driving at excessive speed on a busy road . When the Orion was stopped , the driver ran away and when he was ordered to stop , he turned towards the Sergeant in what the Sergeant interpreted as an aggressive manner . His arms were down and his hands out of sight . In that short space of time , he formed the opinion that the deceased was a threat to his life . The man \u2019s actions had not been of someone about to surrender . He was certain that there were no viable alternatives to discharging his own weapon .", "CARDINAL . Forensic examinations of the cars involved in the incident were carried out . ORG were conducted with the other police officers and army personnel involved in the incident .", "According to the statements of police officers D , E and F in the car call sign CARDINAL , they had been pursuing the red Orion car close behind the red police ORG in which ORG was driving . When the Orion stopped , their car pulled up behind . As they were stopping , the driver was running from the car and either he ran into them or their car struck him , clipping him on the right thigh . The driver span round towards call sign CARDINAL . At that point , there was a short burst of gunfire . Their car had also at some point made contact with the red Orion in the rear . Only officer D heard shouting coming from the call sign CARDINAL direction before the shooting . Shortly after moving their car to facilitate the flow of traffic , they had been directed to GPE street .", "In his statement of DATE , ORG , from the car call sign DATE , stated that on arrival at the scene he had instructed car CARDINAL to be moved to facilitate the movement of a bus which had stopped very close to the injured man .

Decisions of the ORG not to prosecute have been subject to applications for judicial review in ORG .", "In R v. ORG ex parte C ( DATE ) CARDINAL CAR , p. CARDINAL , Lord Justice PERSON held , concerning a decision of the ORG not to prosecute in an alleged case of buggery :", "\u201c From all of those decisions it seems to me that in the context of the present case this court can be persuaded to act if and only if it is demonstrated to us that the Director of Public Prosecutions acting through ORG arrived at the decision not to prosecute :", "( CARDINAL ) because of some unlawful policy ( such as the hypothetical decision in GPE not to prosecute where the value of goods stolen was below \u00a3 CARDINAL ) ;", "( CARDINAL ) NORP because ORG failed to act in accordance with his own settled policy as set out in the code ; or", "( CARDINAL ) because the decision was perverse . It was a decision at which no reasonable prosecutor could have arrived . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of NORP v. the ORG and Others ex parte PERSON the ORG on DATE quashed a decision not to prosecute for alleged gross negligence causing a death in dock unloading on the basis that the reasons given by the ORG \u2013 that the evidence was not sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of satisfying a jury DATE required further explanation .", "CARDINAL . R v. ORG ex parte PERSON and PERSON ( decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ) concerned the ORG \u2019s decision not to prosecute any prison officer for manslaughter in respect of the death of a prisoner , although the inquest jury had reached a verdict of unlawful death - there was evidence that prison officers had used a neck lock which was forbidden and dangerous . The ORG reviewing the case still concluded that the ORG would be unable to establish manslaughter from gross negligence . The Lord Chief Justice noted :", "\u201c ORG makes clear that a decision by the Director not to prosecute is susceptible to judicial review : see , for example , NORP v. Director of Public Prosecutions , ex parte C [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON . But , as the decided cases also make clear , the power of review is one to be sparingly exercised . The reasons for this are clear . The primary decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is entrusted by ORG to the Director as head of an independent , professional prosecuting service , answerable to the Attorney General in his role as guardian of the public interest , and to CARDINAL else . It makes no difference that in practice the decision will ordinarily be taken by a senior member of the ORG , as it was here , and not by the Director personally . In any borderline case the decision may be CARDINAL of acute difficulty , since while a defendant whom a jury would be likely to convict should properly be brought to justice and tried , a defendant whom a jury would be likely to acquit should not be subjected to the trauma inherent in a criminal trial . If , in a case such as the present , the Director \u2019s provisional decision is not to prosecute , that decision will be subject to review by Senior ORG Counsel who will exercise an independent professional judgment . The Director and his officials ( and Senior ORG Counsel when consulted ) will bring to their task of deciding whether to prosecute an experience and expertise which most courts called upon to review their decisions could not match . In most cases the decision will turn not on an analysis of the relevant legal principles but on the exercise of an informed judgment of how a case against a particular defendant , if brought , would be likely to fare in the context of a criminal trial before ( in a serious case such as this ) a jury . This exercise of judgment involves an assessment of the strength , by the end of the trial , of the evidence against the defendant and of the likely defences . It will often be impossible to stigmatise a judgment on such matters as wrong even if one disagrees with it . So the courts will not easily find that a decision not to prosecute is bad in law , on which basis alone the court is entitled to interfere . At the same time , the standard of review should not be set too high , since judicial review is the only means by which the citizen can seek redress against a decision not to prosecute and if the test were too exacting an effective remedy would be denied . \u201d", "As regards whether the ORG had a duty to give reasons , the Lord Chief Justice said :", "\u201c It is not contended that the Director is subject to an obligation to give reasons in every case in which he decides not to prosecute . Even in the small and very narrowly defined cases which meet PERSON conditions set out above , we do not understand domestic law or the jurisprudence of ORG to impose an absolute and unqualified obligation to give reasons for a decision not to prosecute . But the right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights . It is put at the forefront of the LAW . The power to derogate from it is very limited . The death of a person in the custody of the ORG must always arouse concern , as recognised by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) , ( CARDINAL)(b ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Coroner \u2019s Act DATE , and if the death resulted from violence inflicted by agents of the ORG that concern must be profound . The holding of an inquest in public by an independent judicial official , the coroner , in which interested parties are able to participate must in our view be regarded as a full and effective inquiry ( see ORG v. GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . Where such an inquest following a proper direction to the jury culminates in a lawful verdict of unlawful killing implicating a person who , although not named in the verdict , is clearly identified , who is living and whose whereabouts are known , the ordinary expectation would naturally be that a prosecution would follow . In the absence of compelling grounds for not giving reasons , we would expect the Director to give reasons in such a case : to meet the reasonable expectation of interested parties that either a prosecution would follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given , to vindicate the Director \u2019s decision by showing that solid grounds exist for what might otherwise appear to be a surprising or even inexplicable decision and to meet ORG expectation that if a prosecution is not to follow a plausible explanation will be given . We would be very surprised if such a general practice were not welcome to Members of ORG whose constituents have died in such circumstances . We readily accept that such reasons would have to be drawn with care and skill so as to respect third party and public interests and avoid undue prejudice to those who would have no opportunity to defend themselves . We also accept that time and skill would be needed to prepare a summary which was reasonably brief but did not distort the true basis of the decision . But the number of cases which meet PERSON conditions is very small ( we were told that since DATE , including deaths in police custody , there have been CARDINAL such cases ) , and the time and expense involved could scarcely be greater than that involved in resisting an application for judicial review . In any event it would seem to be wrong in principle to require the citizen to make a complaint of unlawfulness against the Director in order to obtain a response which good administrative practice would in the ordinary course require . \u201d", "On this basis , the court reviewed whether the reasons given by the ORG in that case were in accordance with the Code for ORG Prosecutors and capable of supporting a decision not to prosecute . It found that the decision had failed to take relevant matters into account and that this vitiated the decision not to prosecute . The decision was quashed and the ORG was required to reconsider his decision whether or not to prosecute .", "CARDINAL . In the Matter of an Application by PERSON for ORG , ORG in GPE on DATE considered the applicant \u2019s claim that the ORG had failed to give adequate and intelligible reasons for his decision not to prosecute any police officer concerned in the arrest during which he had suffered serious injuries and for which in civil proceedings he had obtained an award of damages against the police . It noted that there was no statutory obligation on the ORG under the DATE Order to give reasons and considered that no duty to give reasons could be implied . The fact that the ORG in GPE and GPE had in a number of cases furnished detailed reasons , whether from increasing concern for transparency or in the interests of the victim \u2019s families , was a matter for his discretion . It concluded on the basis of authorities that only in exceptional cases such as the PERSON case ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) would the ORG be required to furnish reasons to a victim for failing to prosecute and that review should be limited to where the principles identified by Lord Justice PERSON ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) were infringed . Notwithstanding the findings in the civil case , they were not persuaded that the ORG had acted in such an aberrant , inexplicable or irrational manner that the case cried out for reasons to be furnished as to why he had so acted .", "CARDINAL .

In the report on its visit to GPE and GPE from DATE , published on DATE , ORG for the Prevention of Torture ( the ORG ) reviewed the system of preferring criminal and disciplinary charges against police officers accused of ill - treating persons .

In the view of the ORG , the creation of a fully - fledged independent investigating agency would be a most welcome development . Such a body should certainly , like the ORG , have the power to direct that disciplinary proceedings be instigated against police officers . Further , in the interests of bolstering public confidence , it might also be thought appropriate that such a body be invested with the power to remit a case directly to the ORG for consideration of whether or not criminal proceedings should be brought .", "In any event , the ORG recommends that the role of the \u2018 chief officer\u2019 within the existing system be reviewed . To take the example of CARDINAL ORG officer to whom certain of the chief officer \u2019s functions have been delegated ( the Director of the FAC [ Criminal Investigations Bureau ] ) , he is currently expected to : seek dispensations from the ORG ; appoint investigating police officers and assume managerial responsibility for their work ; determine whether an investigating officer \u2019s report indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed ; decide whether to bring disciplinary proceedings against a police officer on the basis of an investigating officer \u2019s report , and liase with the ORG on this question ; determine which disciplinary charges should be brought against an officer who is to face charges ; in civil cases , negotiate settlement strategies and authorise payments into court . It is doubtful whether it is realistic to expect any single official to be able to perform all of these functions in an entirely independent and impartial way .", "CARDINAL . ...
