GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . DATE he was a public prosecutor ( FAC ) , working under the authority of ORG ( PERSON ) of GPE ( GDR ) . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the NORP dissident PERSON published a book inspired by the events of the GPE Spring of DATE entitled \u201c The Alternative \u2013 A Critique of Socialism as it Actually Exists \u201d ( Die Alternative \u2013 PERSON des real existierenden PERSON ) , in which he advocated a number of reforms with a view to setting up an ideal communist system and criticised the GPE \u2019s party apparatus . In DATE the book was published in GPE ( FRG ) .", "In DATE he had written a thesis on \u201c Employment conditions of scientifically trained management staff in the industry of the GPE \u201d ( ORG wissenschaftlich ausgebildeter ORG in der ORG der DDR ) , for which he had collected comments from CARDINAL graduates on their conditions of employment in industry . In DATE the technical university he was attending rejected Mr PERSON \u2019s thesis and so he attempted to publish it in the FRG .", "On DATE Mr PERSON was arrested and DATE he was remanded in custody .", "On DATE the trial opened before ORG ( Stadtgericht ) , which had jurisdiction over political offences . In his submissions as prosecutor the applicant recommended , on behalf of ORG , that PERSON be sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for \u201c repeated offences or attempted offences of intelligence gathering \u201d ( mehrfacher , teils versuchter PERSON ) , pursuant to LAW former GPE \u2019s FAC , and betrayal of secrets ( NORP ) , pursuant to LAW .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG convicted PERSON of \u201c gathering , imparting and attempting to impart intelligence \u201d ( GPE , GPE versuchter ORG ) and \u201c betrayal of secrets \u201d ( PERSON ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in accordance with Articles QUANTITY and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s FAC ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) .", "On DATE PERSON lawyer , PERSON , appealed against that judgment .", "In his submissions , the applicant asked ORG ) to dismiss PERSON appeal .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared Mr PERSON \u2019s appeal manifestly ill - founded ( offensichtlich unbegr\u00fcndet ) and upheld the judgment at first instance .", "PERSON was granted an amnesty on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the GPE and released on DATE . The applicant had recommended that he should be released .", "On DATE , in anticipation of the approaching reunification of the two GPE , ORG ( Pr\u00e4sidium ) of ORG set aside ORG judgment of DATE and ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and acquitted Mr PERSON because his conviction for \u201c intelligence gathering \u201d and \u201c betrayal of secrets \u201d had been unjustified .", "On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) sentenced the applicant to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended , for aiding and abetting a deliberate perversion of the course of justice ( Beihilfe PERSON ) , pursuant to LAW , taken together with LAW , and aiding and abetting a deprivation of liberty ( Beihilfe zur Freiheitsberaubung ) , pursuant to LAW , taken together with LAW . It also convicted CARDINAL of the judges of the GPE \u2019s ORG who had taken part in drawing up the decision of DATE .", "ORG began by reiterating the general principles that are applicable to prosecutions of former members of the GPE \u2019s national legal service . Both judges and prosecutors are liable to prosecution since the offences of deliberate perversion of the course of justice ( GPE ) and deprivation of liberty ( GPE ) are expressly defined both by ORG and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the FRG \u2019s Criminal Code and by Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s FAC ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) . In accordance with the principles on the application of criminal law in GPE after the reunification for offences committed in the GPE before the reunification ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) , ORG applied the relevant provisions of the GPE \u2019s FAC at the material time .", "In respect of the first offence of which the applicant was accused , namely aiding and abetting a deliberate perversion of the course of justice , ORG , having regard to the principle that the criminal law is not to be applied retrospectively , pointed out that the only acts which were reprehensible were those which , while taking account of the relevant legal provisions applicable in the GPE and the values on which that ORG was based , were found to be manifestly arbitrary ( offensichtliche ORG ) and in breach of human rights . According to the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) , CARDINAL types of case might arise \u2013 those in which the elements constituting the offence ( PERSON ) were exaggerated ( \u00fcberdehnt ) , those in which the sentence was intolerably disproportionate ( in einem unertr\u00e4glichen Missverh\u00e4ltnis ) to the offence committed and finally those in which the proceedings had flagrantly infringed human rights .", "In the instant case , ORG considered that , in the light of the methods of interpretation ( Auslegungsmethoden ) that had existed in the GPE , the offences of which Mr PERSON had been accused could just conceivably be regarded as \u201c intelligence gathering \u201d and \u201c betrayal of secrets \u201d as defined in ORG and CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s FAC . On the other hand , it found that the sentence imposed on PERSON by ORG of the GPE had been totally at variance with the principle of proportionality which had also formed part of the GPE \u2019s law . Even though the sentence had still been formally within the limits set by statute ( innerhalb des gesetzlichen PERSON ) , the judgment of CARDINAL DATE flagrantly infringed the sentencing rules ( ORG ) laid down in LAW of the GPE \u2019s FAC ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) .", "In its judgment ORG had found PERSON guilty of supporting those who had sought to overthrow the socialist system for over DATE through his offences , whereas it had previously found that Mr PERSON \u2019s conduct prior to DATE had not been criminal and it could not therefore legitimately argue that his conduct before that date had increased his guilt . ORG had also held that PERSON had taken advantage of his position and industrial workers\u2019 trust in him to extort information from them . However , when taking evidence , ORG had failed to establish what kind of information Mr PERSON had extorted in this way .", "ORG also pointed out , with reference to a commentary on the GPE \u2019s Criminal Code published by its ORG in DATE , that the consequences and adverse effects of the offence should be decisive for the fixing of the sentence . But ORG had declared that the book published by PERSON contained information that could be used with the assistance of enemy intelligence services to promote measures that would damage the economy ( ORG , die geeignet seien , wirtschaftsch\u00e4digende LOC gegnerischen Nachtrichtendienste zu unterst\u00fctzen ) and that the information contained in his thesis could have been used for \u201c ideological diversion \u201d ( ideologische Diversion ) , whereas it was not at all clear how PERSON book could have led to such consequences or that it had done so , and the same was true where so - called \u201c ideological diversion \u201d was concerned .", "ORG also criticised ORG for having failed to take any account of the many extenuating circumstances which weighed in Mr PERSON \u2019s favour . It had taken absolutely no account of the fact that Mr PERSON had acknowledged the objective facts , that he had been acting in a noble cause , namely to propose reforms to the socialist system , not to support its enemies , that until that date his conduct in the GPE had been irreproachable and above all that he had never been prosecuted before .", "ORG accordingly held that the sentence imposed on PERSON had been patently disproportionate and an intolerable arbitrary act ( unertr\u00e4glicher Willk\u00fcrakt ) . Its aim had not been to achieve justice ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW of the GPE ) but to silence a brave critic of the regime maintained by ORG ( PERSON \u201c the SED \u201d ) under the guise of a criminal trial . Consequently , Mr PERSON \u2019s imprisonment had also been a breach of the law because it had been based on a judgment obtained by a deliberate perversion of the course of justice .", "As to the applicant \u2019s role , ORG pointed out in the first place that it was not the indictment ( ORG ) itself that was at issue , since the legal classification of the offences of which PERSON had been accused had still been just within the bounds of acceptability ; it was in fact the sentence recommended by the applicant ( PERSON ) in his submissions of DATE against PERSON during the hearing before ORG , which had amounted to the offences of aiding and abetting a deliberate perversion of the course of justice and deprivation of liberty . While acknowledging that it was not the applicant , via his submissions , who had given the judges the idea ( auf die Idee gebracht ) of convicting PERSON , ORG held that he had considerably assisted them in that task because the judges were bound to reply to his submissions under the relevant provisions of the GPE \u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure and their findings in the instant case had been largely based on those submissions .", "Consequently , ORG considered that in sentencing Mr PERSON to eight years\u2019 imprisonment DATE a sentence that was flagrantly disproportionate to his guilt , as ORG judges knew \u2013 the judges had been guilty of a deliberate perversion of the course of justice and deprivation of liberty . Because of the harshness of the sentence he had asked the court to impose on PERSON , the applicant , who knew the law of the GPE very well by virtue of his function , had deliberately and knowingly assisted the judges in making the decision that had perverted the course of justice and resulted in the deprivation of Mr LOC \u2019s liberty . By recommending before ORG that Mr PERSON \u2019s appeal be dismissed , the applicant had also assisted the judges of ORG in their task .", "Lastly , ORG found that the defendant \u2019s conviction was ruled out neither by the amnesties granted by the GPE at the material time nor because it was time - barred .", "ORG applied Article CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s FAC , which set a limitation period of DATE for a deliberate perversion of the course of justice since that offence carried a maximum penalty of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ( under LAW , the extent of a person \u2019s criminal responsibility for aiding and abetting ( Beihilfe ) depends on the offence committed ) . It also applied LAW the GPE \u2019s FAC , under which there is a suspension ( Ruhen ) of the running of time where , \u201c for another legal reason \u201d ( aus einem anderen gesetzlichen GPE ) , criminal proceedings can not be brought ; in so doing , it referred to ORG established case - law on the subject ( see Relevant domestic law and practice below ) .", "To determine the length of the sentence to be imposed on the applicant , ORG also applied the criminal law of the GPE that had been applicable at the material time ( because it was more lenient than that of the ORG ) and took account of a number of extenuating circumstances in the applicant \u2019s favour .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed an appeal by the applicant .", "On DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) , sitting as a CARDINAL - member panel , refused to examine an appeal by the applicant .", "Under LAW to the FRG \u2019s LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz ins Strafgesetzbuch ) , taken together with LAW itself , offences committed inside the territory of the GPE prior to the entry into force of LAW ( on DATE ) are in principle judged under the more lenient criminal law applicable at the material time if there were equivalent criminal provisions in the ORG and the GPE .", "The relevant provisions of the GPE \u2019s FAC at the material time provided as follows .", "LAW the GPE \u2019s Criminal Code provided , inter alia , that anyone who allowed himself to be recruited by a foreign power , secret services or a foreign organisation for the purposes of gathering , disclosing or imparting secret information prejudicial to the GPE \u2019s interests should also be convicted of espionage under LAW , which stated that the penalty for espionage was at least five years\u2019 imprisonment .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s Criminal Code provided , inter alia , that anyone divulging secret documents or intelligence to unauthorised third parties was liable to a term of imprisonment of DATE .", "Article CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s LAW defined the offence of deliberate perversion of the course of justice ( GPE ) . It stated , inter alia , that judges or prosecutors who deliberately showed bias for or against a defendant during a trial or investigation were liable to a maximum of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s LAW defined the offence of deprivation of liberty ( GPE ) .", "In its judgment of DATE ORG also referred to LAW , which laid down the rules on sentencing ( NORP ) . LAW provided among other things , in paragraph CARDINAL , that when deciding on the severity of the sentence , regard should be had both to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence and to its consequences . Account also had to be taken of the offender \u2019s character , his social conduct before and after the offence and the causes and circumstances of the offence . It was particularly important to ascertain whether the offender had learnt the lessons of any previous conviction . Lastly , courts were also under an obligation to have regard to any extenuating or aggravating circumstances for the offender .", "The relevant provisions of LAW provided :", "\u201c The generally recognised rules of international law intended to promote peace and peaceful cooperation between peoples are binding ( sind verbindlich ) on the ORG and every citizen . \u201d", "\u201c Respect for and protection of the dignity and liberty of the person ( PERSON ) are required of all ORG bodies , all forces in society and every citizen . \u201d", "The first chapter of the Special Part ( GPE PERSON ) of LAW , entitled \u201c Crimes against the national sovereignty of GPE , peace , humanity and human rights \u201d , included the following introduction :", "\u201c The merciless punishment of crimes against the national sovereignty of GPE , peace , humanity and human rights , and of war crimes , is an indispensable prerequisite for stable peace in the world , for the restoration of faith in fundamental human rights ( Wiederherstellung des Glaubens an grundlegende Menschenrechte ) and the dignity and worth of human beings , and for the preservation of the rights of all . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of LAW was worded as follows :", "\u201c Any person whose conduct violates human or fundamental rights , international obligations or the national sovereignty of GPE may not plead ( kann sich nicht berufen auf ) statute law , an order or written instructions in justification ; he shall be held criminally responsible . \u201d", "LAW provided :", "\u201c Crimes against peace , humanity or human rights , and war crimes shall not be subject to the rules on limitation set out in this law [ laying down the limitation periods for the various categories of offences ] . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of the GPE \u2019s FAC made provision for the suspension ( Ruhen ) of the running of time for the purposes of the limitation of prosecution in the following cases :", "\u201c CARDINAL . as long as the offender remains outside the territory of the GPE ;", "CARDINAL .
