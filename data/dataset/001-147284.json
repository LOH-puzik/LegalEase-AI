The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In TIME of CARDINAL DATE the applicant went to a primary school in the town of NORP and poured paint on a statue of PERSON which was situated in the school \u2019s garden . On TIME , he poured paint on a statue of PERSON in the garden of another primary school .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he did the same thing in the same CARDINAL primary schools .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant poured paint on a statue of GPE in NORP town centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to the same statue in NORP town centre equipped with a tin of paint , paint thinner and a ladder . As he was about to open the tin of paint he was arrested by police officers and taken to a police station where he was questioned . In a statement taken from him on DATE the applicant was reported as having told the police officers that he had carried out the above - mentioned actions because he resented PERSON and had expressed his resentment by pouring paint on the statues .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was brought before a prosecutor and then a judge , who ordered his detention on remand pending the opening of criminal proceedings against him . In his statement to the prosecutor the applicant maintained that he had carried out his actions to express his \u201c lack of affection \u201d for GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his indictment of DATE , lodged with ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the trial court \u201d ) , the NORP prosecutor charged the applicant with the offence of contravening LAW Against PERSON ( PERSON no . CARDINAL ; see \u201c Relevant Domestic Law and Practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the trial the applicant admitted that he had poured paint on the statues . He told the trial court that he had completed his university studies and qualified as a teacher . However , he had been unemployed for a long time because his application to work as a teacher had not been accepted by ORG . He had carried out his offences in order to protest against the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court found the applicant guilty as charged . Having regard to the fact that the offence was committed in a public place and on a number of occasions , the trial court sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment instead of the minimum term of imprisonment applicable under PERSON no . DATE , which is DATE . The fact that the offence had been committed in a public place also led the trial court to increase the sentence by CARDINAL in accordance with section CARDINAL of Law no . DATE . The trial court also considered that the applicant had committed the offence on CARDINAL separate occasions , and decided to multiply the sentence by CARDINAL . The applicant was thus sentenced to a total prison term of DATE and DATE for his above - mentioned actions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . In his appeal he argued that , according to the provisions of LAW , CARDINAL sentence should have been imposed on him because , regardless of the fact that he had poured paint on the statues on CARDINAL occasions , he had in fact only committed one offence and not multiple offences . In support of his argument , he submitted that his CARDINAL actions had been carried out within a short span of time .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also pointed out that , instead of imposing on him the minimum DATE prison sentence provided for in PERSON no . DATE in respect of each offence , the trial court had handed down a DATE sentence because it had had regard to the number of times he had poured paint on the statues . The trial court had then gone on to rely on the frequency of his actions when multiplying the sentence by CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also challenged the trial court \u2019s reliance on section CARDINAL of Law no . DATE when increasing his sentence by CARDINAL because the offence had been committed in a public place . He drew ORG attention to the fact that , by their nature , statues are placed in public places .", "CARDINAL . The applicant added that he had carried out his actions in order to express his \u201c lack of affection \u201d for PERSON . As such , he had remained within the boundaries of his right to freedom of expression , which was guaranteed by LAW . Thus , although it would have been reasonable to prosecute and punish him for damaging property , he had in fact been punished for expressing his opinions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that he had been expressing his opinion , but quashed the trial court \u2019s judgment on the ground of , inter alia , that court \u2019s failure to give adequate consideration to the possibility that the CARDINAL separate incidents could form CARDINAL offence and not multiple offences . ORG considered that the applicant had carried out his actions in order to protest against ORG decision not to appoint him as a teacher . The case file was sent back to the trial court .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision of DATE the trial court agreed with ORG conclusion , and held that the applicant \u2019s actions had amounted to a single offence and not CARDINAL offences . However , having regard , inter alia , to the \u201c contradictory reasons \u201d put forward by the applicant as justification for his actions , as well as \u201c the effects of his actions on the public \u201d , the trial court concluded that the applicant \u2019s actions had amounted to \u201c insults \u201d , and deemed it fit to sentence him to DATE imprisonment , which is the maximum allowed under PERSON no . DATE . The sentence was then increased by CARDINAL because the acts had been committed in a public place . Furthermore , pursuant to LAW ( see \u201c Relevant Domestic Law and Practice \u201d below ) , the sentence was further increased by DATE . The applicant was thus sentenced to a total of DATE , DATE and CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in its decision the trial court set out the restrictions under section CARDINAL of LAW which were to be placed on the applicant on account of his conviction . Accordingly , until the execution of his sentence , the applicant was banned from , among other things , voting and taking part in elections , as well as from running associations , parties , trade unions and cooperatives ( see \u201c Relevant Domestic Law and Practice \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed and repeated his arguments under various provisions of the Convention . He maintained , in particular , that he had carried out his actions in order to express his \u201c lack of affection \u201d for PERSON and had thus exercised his freedom of expression guaranteed in LAW .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . No mention was made in ORG decision of the arguments raised by the applicant about his freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . According to a document drawn up by the prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE setting out the details of the applicant \u2019s prison sentence , the date of the applicant \u2019s release from prison was set as CARDINAL DATE , with a possibility of release on DATE for good behaviour .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the PERSON on the Execution of Prison Sentences and Other Security Measures ( PERSON no . CARDINAL ) entered into force . This law sets out the circumstances in which prisoners can benefit from early release .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the prosecutor responsible for the prison the applicant was serving his sentence in wrote to the trial court and asked for guidance in calculating the date of the applicant \u2019s possible early release . The prosecutor stated that , for offences committed DATE , PERSON no . CARDINAL was applicable and , for offences committed after that date , the new Law no . DATE would be applicable . The applicant had carried out his actions both before and after that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court considered that the critical date was the date of the commission of the final act and thus the new law was applicable .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection against that decision and argued that most of his actions had been carried out DATE and that therefore , when calculating his prison sentence , the old law should be taken into account . If his prison sentence were calculated in accordance with the new law , he would spend DATE in prison . That objection was rejected by the trial court on DATE and the date of the applicant \u2019s possible release from prison was calculated in accordance with the document drawn up by the prosecutor on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . A request made by the applicant to ORG for his conviction to be quashed and another request to ORG to rectify the judgment were rejected on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released conditionally ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "P1-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
