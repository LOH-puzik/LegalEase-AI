GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lived in NORP , GPE , before moving to GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who was born in GPE , entered GPE in DATE and applied for asylum . His asylum request was dismissed , a decision which became final in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Starting in DATE the applicant had a relationship with PERSON who was married to PERSON ; the spouses have CARDINAL children born in DATE , DATE and DATE . Although she initially considered a divorce , PERSON , who never lived with the applicant , left the applicant in DATE and lived with her husband , PERSON , and the children again .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON gave birth to twins . The applicant is the biological father of the twins . PERSON and PERSON are bringing up the twins together . According to LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , PERSON is their legal father . PERSON and PERSON repeatedly refused requests made by the applicant , both before and after the GPE birth , to be allowed contact with the twins .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Baden - Baden District Court , having heard the applicant and Mr and PERSON in CARDINAL hearings , granted the applicant contact with the twins once per month for TIME , initially in the presence of a third person and of either Mr or PERSON if they wished to be present .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant was entitled to access under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as he was a person with whom the children had close ties . The fact that he had not yet borne any responsibility for the children did not hinder that entitlement , as the applicant had had no possibility to take such responsibility since the twins had been born in DATE . Hence his access rights could not be denied .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that contact between the applicant and the twins was in the children \u2019s best interest . It agreed with the findings of the psychological expert it had consulted , who , having heard Mr and PERSON and the applicant , had concluded that contact with the applicant was beneficial for the children \u2019s welfare . Particularly in view of their NORP origins , a relationship with the applicant , their natural father , would be essential for them to get to know their roots , to build up their identity , to understand why they were different and to develop normal self - esteem . ORG also found that the applicant \u2019s access rights could not be delayed any further as they were being increasingly contested by PERSON and PERSON The applicant \u2019s access to the twins would not adversely affect PERSON and PERSON other CARDINAL children because , as the psychologist had convincingly argued , dealing frankly with the realities would be in the best interest of all concerned .", "CARDINAL . NORP In coming to its decision , ORG took into consideration that when PERSON and the applicant had separated in DATE , the applicant had agreed that the twins could stay with the PERSON family but had stated that \u201c he wanted to have a chance in the asylum proceedings \u201d . He had subsequently asked to be granted access to the twins after their birth , which PERSON and PERSON had refused . He had argued that if he did not stay in GPE , it would be impossible in practice for him to have any contact with his children and build up a relationship with them . In PERSON and PERSON submission , the applicant wanted access to his children only in order to obtain a residence permit in GPE . The psychological expert , for her part , stated that it appeared that PERSON and PERSON were now interpreting the applicant \u2019s relationship with PERSON wrongly and in accordance with common prejudices \u2013 as a mere attempt to obtain a residence permit , in order to blame him for their own difficult situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed an appeal lodged by PERSON and PERSON , quashed the decision of ORG and dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for access to the twins .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant was not entitled to access to the children under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) because the provision only referred to the entitlement of the legal father ( as opposed to the biological father ) , who in the present case was PERSON ( LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As the children were living with their legal father , the applicant was also not entitled to acknowledge paternity ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) nor could he contest PERSON paternity ( LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further found that the applicant was not entitled to access under LAW . Being the biological father of the twins , he was , in principle , considered a person with whom the children had close ties ( enge Bezugsperson ) within the meaning of that provision . He nevertheless had not fulfilled the remaining requirements of LAW , as he had not borne any responsibility for the children in the past and thus had no social and family relationship with them .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant was therefore not entitled to claim access , it was irrelevant whether contact between him and the twins was in the children \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . The fundamental right to respect for one \u2019s family life and one \u2019s parental rights under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and LAW did not require a different interpretation of the provisions of LAW . With regard to LAW , ORG found that the applicant , being the biological , but not the legal father of the twins , was not a \u201c parent \u201d within the meaning of paragraph CARDINAL of that provision , in particular because the coexistence of CARDINAL fathers was not consistent with the notion of parental responsibility . Moreover , LAW protected the access of the biological father to his child only where a social and family relationship between them had already existed in the past ; it did not protect the wish to build up a relationship with the child in the future . The reasons why there was no relationship between the biological father and the child were irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the refusal to grant the applicant access to the children would mean that he would be unable to build up a relationship with them and would be expelled to GPE . Therefore , the children would most probably never be able to get to know their biological father . However , that was because the twins lived in a family together with their legal father who was actually assuming the father \u2019s role . It was the legislator \u2019s evaluation , expressed in LAW , that the existing relationship between legal father and child took precedence over the relationship between biological father and child .", "CARDINAL . With regard to LAW , ORG observed that there had never been a family bond between the applicant and the twins . It also distinguished the present case from the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) inasmuch as the applicant in that case had also been the legal father of his child and had obtained the right to custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , without giving reasons , ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , in which he had claimed that the refusal to grant him access to the twins had violated his right to respect for his family life ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for an interim order suspending his expulsion until ORG had decided upon his application . The applicant did not appeal against that decision . The main proceedings before ORG , in which the applicant again applied for a residence permit , are apparently still pending . The applicant moved to GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as relevant , provides :", "( CARDINAL ) Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection of the state .", "( CARDINAL ) The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them . The state shall watch over them in the performance of this duty .", "CARDINAL . Parental custody includes the right to determine access to the child ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a child has a right of access to each parent , and each parent in turn has the right and the duty to have contact with the child . The family courts can determine the scope of the right of access and prescribe more specific rules for its exercise , also with regard to third parties ( LAW ) . They may restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare . A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if the child \u2019s well - being would otherwise be endangered . The family courts may order that the right of access be exercised in the presence of a third party , such as a ORG or an association ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Article DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in its version applicable at the relevant time , provides for persons with whom the child has close ties ( enge PERSON ) to have a right of access to the child if this serves the child \u2019s best interest and if they are bearing actual responsibility for the child or have done so in the past ( social and family relationship ) . It is to be assumed , as a rule , that a person who lived with the child in domestic community for a lengthy period of time has borne such actual responsibility . LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL apply mutatis mutandis .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a child \u2019s father is either the man who at the date of the child \u2019s birth was married to the child \u2019s mother ( no . CARDINAL ) , or the man who acknowledged paternity ( no . CARDINAL ) or whose paternity is judicially established under LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An acknowledgement of paternity is not valid as long as the paternity of another man exists ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Paternity may be challenged . Under LAW , entitlement to challenge paternity lies with the man whose paternity exists under LAW . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , with the mother and with the child , and also with the man who makes a statutory declaration that he had sexual intercourse with the child \u2019s mother during the period of conception . However , pursuant to LAW , this last man has a right to challenge the paternity of the man who is the child \u2019s legal father under LAW . CARDINAL or CARDINAL only if he is the child \u2019s biological father and if there is no social and family relationship between the legal father and the child .", "CARDINAL . If there is no paternity under LAW . CARDINAL or CARDINAL of LAW , it is to be established by the family court ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Research undertaken by ORG in relation to CARDINAL ORG GPE shows that there is no uniform approach in GPE to the question whether , and if so , under what circumstances , a biological father ( who is not only a sperm donor ) has a right to contact with his child where a different father exists in law .", "CARDINAL . In a considerable number of GPE ( comprising , in particular , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , where a child is born to a woman who is living with her husband , a biological father can ensure his contact rights by challenging , first , the paternity presumption in place , partly within a fixed time - limit . In these GPE , as indeed in all of the countries surveyed , a presumption exists in law to the effect that a child born of a married woman during the subsistence of the marriage is presumed also to be the child of her husband . Having been recognised as the ( legal ) father of the child concerned , the biological father then has a right to contact with his child like any other non - custodial parent , subject to the child \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . According to an expert report drawn up in DATE by ORG Family Law ( Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr PERSON . ORG , a registered association and non - governmental organisation ) , which has been submitted by the Government , the same applies in GPE . That report , however , interprets differently the provisions applicable in GPE and GPE . Research undertaken by the applicant confirms the ORG \u2019s research notably in respect of the legal situation in GPE and GPE . The applicant submits that a biological father may also challenge the legal father \u2019s paternity in circumstances similar to those in the present application in several further countries , inter alia , in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a considerable number of ORG , according to the ORG \u2019s research , the biological father of a child would , on the contrary , not be able to challenge the said paternity presumption in circumstances similar to those in the present application ( see , in particular , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) . Biological fathers in those countries lack standing to bring an action to challenge that presumption either in all circumstances or at least in cases in which the mother is still living with her husband ( see in this latter respect the law in force in GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the expert report drawn up by ORG and Family Law submitted by the Government , the same applies in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . The applicant interprets differently the provisions applicable in GPE and GPE ; the report submitted by the Government , however , confirms the ORG \u2019s findings in respect of the legal situation in these countries .", "CARDINAL . In those latter Member GPE , it is thus only open to the biological father to apply for contact as a third party , not as a parent . However , in some of GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) the biological father does not have standing to apply for contact as a third party either as the law provides a right of contact only to legal parents and ( partly ) to other relatives .", "CARDINAL . According to the expert report of ORG Family PERSON submitted by the Government , the biological father would also not have standing to apply for contact in GPE and in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the remaining Member GPE surveyed by ORG in which the paternity presumption may not be challenged by a biological father ( GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE ) , different pre - conditions apply for that father to be granted contact if such contact is in the child \u2019s best interests . According to LAW , there has to be \u201c proof of a tie of special affection with the child \u201d ; according to LAW of LAW , the father must have lived together with the child for a long time in the same household . In GPE a third person can be granted contact by a judge where that would be in the best interests of the child , without additional pre - conditions having to be met ( compare LAW ) . In the GPE , third persons ( including mere sperm donors ) may be granted contact under Articles DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of the GPE if they have a close personal relationship with the child unless contacts run counter to the child \u2019s best interests . According to LAW of LAW , the biological father may be granted access if he is to be regarded as a \u201c close person \u201d to the child ( according to the expert report submitted by the Government , a similar provision applies in GPE ) and according to Article CARDINALa of the Swiss Civil Code , he has a right to contact in exceptional circumstances ( according to the expert report submitted by the Government , the same precondition applies in GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the report submitted by ORG , LAW of LAW on ORG provides that access may only be granted to close relatives having close personal ties with the child concerned if the parents have no or hardly any contact with the child . That report further states that under LAW of LAW , a biological father may be granted access to his child if the child \u2019s welfare is endangered otherwise ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
