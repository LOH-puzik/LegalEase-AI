This position was supported by the prosecutor , who also submitted that it was necessary to gather evidence on the applicant bank \u2019s real financial situation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG granted the ORG \u2019s petition , declared the applicant bank insolvent , made an order for it to be wound up , divested its decision - making bodies of their powers and the bank of the right to administer its property , ordered the sale of its assets , and appointed liquidators . It found that the conditions for making a winding - up order DATE namely , that an order revoking the bank \u2019s licence had been made and a copy of that order produced to the court DATE were satisfied . LAW of DATE gave the court limited jurisdiction in proceedings to wind up an insolvent bank . The only fact the court had to verify in such proceedings was whether the above CARDINAL conditions were met . The judgment continued :", "\u201c ... in view of the new procedure introduced by LAW [ of DATE ] , ... the objection ... that the ORG \u2019s averment of [ the applicant bank \u2019s ] insolvency is not supported by evidence is unfounded . Unlike the repealed ORG [ of DATE ] , which provided that the ORG had to ... prove ... the bank \u2019s insolvency , the new LAW [ of DATE ] does not contain such a requirement . Moreover , in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW the legislature has exhaustively specified the conditions for making a winding - up order [ in respect of a bank ] and the requirements that the ORG \u2019s petition has to conform to . These boil down solely to indicating the grounds on which the bank \u2019s licence has been revoked under section CARDINAL ) of the LAW .", "The logical and comparativelaw construction of the above provisions ... leads to the categorical conclusion that the changes in the statutory regime of bank insolvency are aimed , on the one hand , at a significant reduction in the court \u2019s jurisdiction , [ and even ] at taking away its power to determine whether the bank is insolvent , and , on the other hand , at empowering [ the BNB ] to determine that issue without being required to substantiate or prove its finding before the court ...", "An argument in favour of the above conclusion is section CARDINAL ) of the LAW , which expressly provides that the decision of [ the BNB ] to revoke a banking licence is not subject to judicial review . ... Gathering evidence relating to the ... insolvency of a bank would run counter to the abovecited prohibition against judicial review .", "In view of all this the court finds that all [ the applicant bank \u2019s ] requests and objections ... contesting the ORG \u2019s averments about its insolvency are inadmissible and can not be examined . The same goes for the evidence presented by [ the applicant bank ] : even if it is admissible , it should not be taken into account , as it is absolutely irrelevant to the dispute at hand . The CARDINAL abovecited prerequisites \u2013 the order ... revoking the banking licence of [ the applicant bank ] and the production of a copy of that order to the court ... \u2013 are sufficient for the resolution of this dispute . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As the judgment was immediately enforceable ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it was considered that from TIME the persons entitled in law to act on the applicant bank \u2019s behalf were the courtappointed liquidators . Accordingly , the liquidators represented the applicant bank in the ensuing stages of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The liquidators did not appeal against the judgment , but ORG did . It argued that GPE had erred in not examining whether the applicant bank was in fact insolvent . It had thus turned the proceedings into a mere rubber - stamping of the ORG \u2019s petition for an order winding up the applicant bank . Had the court taken the trouble to look at the actual circumstances , it would have found that the applicant bank had MONEY in cash , as evidenced by a report drawn up by the BNBappointed special administrators . That fact raised the question whether the ORG \u2019s finding that the value of the applicant bank \u2019s liabilities exceeded the value of its assets was indeed true . Also , the ORG had not specified the amount or the date of maturity of the overdue debt the applicant bank was alleged to have failed to pay for DATE . It was thus impossible to carry out an independent assessment of the veracity of its allegation . ORG presented an expert report according to which the applicant bank \u2019s assets adequately covered its liabilities .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply the BNB and the applicant bank \u2019s liquidators argued that the appeal was unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a threemember panel of ORG upheld the Sofia City Court \u2019s judgment . Although it held that it could independently establish the facts , without deferring to the ORG \u2019s findings , it was of the view that the applicant bank was indeed insolvent . An analysis of the evidence showed that , according to the ORG \u2019s deputygovernor , the value of the applicant bank \u2019s assets was ORG CARDINAL , and the value of its liabilities BGL CARDINAL . The difference between those figures was exactly the amount mentioned in the ORG \u2019s decision and its ensuing winding - up petition . Turning to the other factual evidence of insolvency \u2013 the nonpayment of a due debt for DATE the court held that the applicant bank did in fact owe another bank MONEY under a debt rescheduling agreement of DATE . No payments had been made in satisfaction of that debt . The applicant bank \u2019s objection that it had not been able to make any payments because of the prohibition on noncash operations imposed on it by the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was unfounded . In any event , the reasons for non - payment were irrelevant , since inability , however caused , to pay a debt for DATE was of itself sufficient for the court to find insolvency .", "CARDINAL . The Chief Prosecutor \u2019s ORG filed a petition for review of the judgment of the threemember panel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a fivemember panel of ORG dismissed that petition in the following terms :", "\u201c The first - instance court \u2019s construction of DATE LAW [ of DATE ] \u2013 is correct . The regime of bank insolvency is a lex specialis in relation to general commercial insolvency law ... In this context it has to be considered that the ... prerequisites for ... an order winding up a bank are governed not by the general rules of LAW [ of DATE ] , but by the special rules of LAW [ of DATE ] ... This is necessary because of the specific character of the banking business ... [ Banks operate ] predominantly with other people \u2019s money , which necessitates compliance with strict requirements for capital adequacy , formation of provisions and ... liquidity . [ The BNB monitors compliance with these requirements ] as part of its function of banking supervision , with a view to preserving the stability of the banking system and achieving effective and enhanced protection of depositors . Because of this specificity proceedings to wind up banks are expedited , with a view to protecting the interests of the creditors of the insolvent bank .", "...", "ORG correctly held that the soundness and the expediency of the ORG \u2019s decision to revoke [ the applicant bank \u2019s ] licence could not be reviewed by the court , because [ the ORG has special powers ] in discharging its banking supervisory duties . By virtue of LAW of LAW [ of DATE ] the court is bound by [ the ORG \u2019s ] winding - up petition , if it meets the requirements of section CARDINAL ) in conjunction with section CARDINAL ) . [ T]he court does not carry out an additional examination of circumstances evidencing the insolvency of a bank . ... The BNB alone ... has the competence to determine extra - judicially whether the CARDINAL grounds for [ declaring a bank insolvent ] exist . [ This determination ] is not subject to review by the court , which has no latitude in such proceedings . Once the ORG has established the insolvency of a bank before the winding - up procedure begins , the court may not reconsider the issue . It must only carry out a formal , ex facie verification of [ the FAC ] \u2019s winding - up petition , without venturing into the substantive issues ... , because it is the revocation of the licence itself that constitutes the ground for making a winding - up order . The court may only verify whether [ the FAC ] \u2019s decision is void , but may not examine whether [ the ORG \u2019s ] finding of insolvency is borne out by the facts ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Thereafter winding - up proceedings unfolded in respect of the applicant bank .", "CARDINAL . In the course of those proceedings the applicant bank \u2019s creditors , which included its CARDINAL shareholders , submitted their proofs of debt to the bank \u2019s liquidators . The liquidators examined the proofs and drew up a list of agreed claims . CARDINAL of the bank \u2019s shareholders , TOO Royal Flash and ORG , and CARDINAL other creditors made objections to the list , which the liquidators examined . The liquidators then transmitted the list to ORG for approval . No objections to the list were made to the court , which approved it in a final judgment of DATE . On DATE the liquidators tried to obtain a ruling that a debt to the Commercial and Savings Bank AD did not exist and that the underlying claim should accordingly be disallowed , but ORG declared their request inadmissible in a decision of DATE , holding that no objections had been made to that claim at the appropriate time , and that the existence of the debt had therefore been conclusively established in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was binding on the bank , its creditors and liquidators .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant bank \u2019s liquidators applied to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) for permission to start negotiations with potential buyers for the purchase of the applicant bank \u2019s entire undertaking . Permission was granted on DATE and on DATE the liquidators entered into a contract for the sale of the undertaking to ORG , with the latter agreeing to pay a purchase price of ORG and the applicant bank \u2019s creditors ORG CARDINAL in satisfaction of their claims . The contract was approved by ORG in a final judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE the same court , on an application by the applicant bank \u2019s liquidators , brought the winding up to an end and ordered that the applicant bank be struck off the register of companies .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE CARDINAL of the applicant bank \u2019s shareholders , ORG , lodged with ORG an application for judicial review of the ORG \u2019s decision to revoke the bank \u2019s licence . It argued that the decision was null and void . Later the chairman and vicechairman of the applicant bank \u2019s board of directors , purporting to act on the bank \u2019s behalf , requested leave to intervene in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE a threemember panel of ORG held that the applicant bank \u2019s request to be allowed to intervene in the proceedings was inadmissible because it had been lodged by persons who no longer represented it . Following the winding - up order and by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE , read in conjunction with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE , the only persons with power to act on its behalf were the liquidators . The court went on to hold that ORG application for judicial review of the ORG \u2019s decision was inadmissible . Section CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE excluded decisions by the ORG to revoke a bank \u2019s licence from the scope of judicial review . That provision was to be construed according to its plain meaning and was applicable regardless of whether the request was to annul the decision or to declare it null and void . Furthermore , ORG had no standing to lodge an application for judicial review , because the ORG \u2019s decision was addressed to the applicant bank , not to its shareholders .", "CARDINAL . NORP The chairman and the vicechairman of the applicant bank \u2019s board of directors and ORG appealed .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE a fivemember panel of ORG declared the appeal by the chairman and vicechairman of the applicant bank \u2019s board of directors inadmissible and ORG appeal illfounded . It held that no appeal lay against the refusal to allow the applicant bank to intervene in the proceedings . It also held that the decision not to examine ORG application for judicial review on the merits was correct . The prohibition of section CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE applied regardless of whether the request was to annul the ORG \u2019s decision or to declare it null and void .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the chairman and the vicechairman of the applicant bank \u2019s board of directors complained to the prosecution authorities about the actions of the ORG \u2019s deputygovernor in charge of banking supervision who had made the order of CARDINAL DATE and the recommendation to the governor of ORG to revoke the applicant bank \u2019s licence ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . They argued that she had acted in excess of her powers with a view to causing damage to the applicant bank . On DATE ORG ordered a criminal investigation into the deputygovernor \u2019s actions . On DATE she was charged with abuse of office . In the course of the investigation the prosecution authorities ordered expert reports on , inter alia , the issue of whether the applicant bank had been insolvent as of DATE . CARDINAL of the experts answered that question in the affirmative , another answered it in the negative .", "CARDINAL . One of the expert reports , drawn up on DATE , noted that a confidential agreement concluded in DATE between ORG ( \u201c the IMF \u201d ) and GPE for the establishment of a currency board in the country stipulated that the right to appeal against the BNB \u2019s decisions should be preserved , but should not hamper it in the performance of its banking supervisory functions . According to an opinion expressed by the GPE \u2019s mission in GPE , any successful appeal should only lead to an award of compensation , not to the invalidation of the BNB \u2019s decision to close the bank . It appears to have been the view of the GPE \u2019s mission in GPE that the protracted process of judicial review of the BNB \u2019s decisions and their possible invalidation would not be consistent with the effective process of banking supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from ORG discontinued the proceedings , considering that the ORG \u2019s deputygovernor had acted lawfully and had not acted in abuse of office .

ORG dismissed the complaint in the following terms :", "\u201c [ This ] court has already clearly and categorically expressed the view that \u2018 judicial review of administrative decisions is a constitutive element of the rule of law\u2019 ...", "The court is of the view that the question of the judicial review of administrative decisions may be resolved only in accordance with the express wording of LAW . According to that provision , judicial review of administrative decisions may be limited only by statute . In the case at hand this means LAW [ of DATE ] .", "In view of the wording of LAW in fine of LAW , the court may not come up with an interpretation providing exceptions to the exception . Only the legislature has the power , by statute , to exclude certain administrative decisions from judicial review . [ LAW ] does not lay down any criteria limiting the legislature \u2019s powers in this respect . This is a question falling within the legislature \u2019s competence ...", "At the same time the court deems it necessary to point out that the legislature \u2019s right to exclude certain categories of administrative decisions from judicial review is not absolute . In exercising that right ORG must have regard to the main constitutional principles relating to the rule of law and the protection of the fundamental human rights . The power granted to ORG by Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL in fine is an exception and has to be construed and applied restrictively . The character of this exception requires ORG to use its powers in this respect only when it has good and compelling reasons to do so . To hold otherwise would render the principle of judicial review meaningless . For this reason [ this court ] has jurisdiction to assess in each specific case whether the legislature \u2019s discretion has been exercised within the limits laid down in the LAW ...", "An analysis of the decisions excluded from judicial review by LAW [ of DATE ] indicates that the legislature has remained within the bounds of its constitutional discretion in protecting the public interest and the interests of depositors . These are mainly acts of banking supervision , an area in which the competence of the supervisory body can not be supplanted by judicial decision . ... In all cases where the administrative decisions that are not subject to review affect the rights and legal interests of individual citizens , there are no obstacles to their seeking redress in a civil action and claiming compensation for the alleged damage .", "In addition , the ORG considers it necessary to emphasise that the rule set out in LAW in fine of the LAW does not preclude the courts from ruling incidentally on the nullity of administrative decisions . To hold otherwise would mean that vitiated administrative decisions , such as decisions issued ultra vires , would be less easy to challenge than a statute , whose unconstitutionality can be established in proceedings before ORG . In this sense the restriction on reviewing administrative decisions is not absolute . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Before DATE bank insolvency was regulated by ORG of DATE .
