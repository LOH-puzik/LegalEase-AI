The investigation of the abovementioned incident was completed when the criminal investigation was discontinued by a PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office order of DATE . The actions of officers GPE and ORG were investigated on accusations of the crimes of murder and causing physical injuries , as were the actions of Mr Gelu Ciubotaru , Mr PERSON , Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru and Mr PERSON for the crime of insulting behaviour towards a ORG agent . The investigating prosecutor held that the use of force by the CARDINAL policemen against Mr Gelu Ciubotaru , Mr PERSON , Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru and Mr PERSON was justified because of the behaviour of the victims , which resulted in the policemen having to resort to legitimate self - defence . The investigating prosecutor , although he referred to PERSON PERSON case , did not identify the person responsible for shooting him and did not state whether or not the proceedings would be discontinued in respect of his injury . The investigation in respect of Mr Gelu Ciubotaru and Mr PERSON was terminated because of their deaths , and that in respect of the applicants Mr PERSON and PERSON Ovidiu Ciubotaru was terminated because it was held that their behaviour did not constitute a crime . The prosecutor \u2019s decision quotes the results of the forensic reports conducted in respect of all the victims of the incident but did not mention the evidence which led to the non - indictment conclusion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , the father of the deceased PERSON , lodged a complaint with ORG concerning unreasonable length of the criminal investigation launched in respect of the events of DATE , and challenged the outcome of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed PERSON PERSON complaint by an order of DATE . The prosecutor \u2019s office held that the proceedings had not been excessively lengthy , given the number of ballistic and forensic reports carried out and the large number of witnesses heard , and that his son had been killed by the police officers in self defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON challenged ORG Office decision of DATE in so far as the decision regarding the investigated policemen was concerned on behalf of Mr PERSON , PERSON ORG Ciubotaru , PERSON PERSON , Ms PERSON , and PERSON Eva Ciubotaru .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE ORG dismissed the challenge on the ground that the police officers had acted in legitimate selfdefence . Also , in respect of PERSON PERSON the unlawful act lacked a physicalinjury element . ORG acknowledged the challenge lodged by PERSON , to be introduced only on behalf of PERSON PERSON , Ms PERSON and Ms PERSON . ORG held that according to the available evidence Mr PERSON and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru were shot by GPE and ORG while they were preparing to hit GPE with an axe . At the same time , Mr PERSON could not be seen by the policemen because he was hidden behind a wall made of sawdust when he was shot in the thorax . The wound did not endanger his life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON appealed against ORG before the domestic courts . The appeal was also lodged on behalf of PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , but it had not been signed by those CARDINAL individuals . The applicant organisation argued that according to the witness statements and the evidence available to the file the domestic authorities tried to protect the police officers , who on DATE acted in an uncoordinated manner , misused their firearms and breached the applicable legal provisions in force at the time protecting the applicants\u2019 right to life and their right not to be subject to inhuman and degrading treatment in a discriminatory way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively Ms PERSON and PERSON PERSON died .", "CARDINAL . By a judgement of DATE PERSON of Appeal allowed an appeal by the applicants against the prosecutor \u2019s orders . The court dismissed the preliminary objection raised by ORG and the CARDINAL accused , namely that PERSON did not have standing to bring proceedings before the domestic courts concerning the events of DATE . The court held that because PERSON considered that GPE persons had been victims of discrimination they decided to represent them before the domestic courts in accordance with the authorisations signed by some of the parties concerned on DATE . The organisation also lodged a complaint before the domestic courts on its own behalf . Taking into account the organisation \u2019s object of activity and the provisions of section CARDINAL of Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL , the court considered that it could not deny in principle the organisation \u2019s legitimate interest and its standing to bring proceedings against state bodies in order to establish whether ethnic discrimination had occurred and whether the rights of its citizens had been protected . In respect of the merits of the case the court held , inter alia , that the operation of DATE had been a work mission and all the police officers involved had been ordered to take part in it . However , the investigation into the events had not been carried out correctly . In particular , the wounding of the police officers GPE and GPE was not directly relevant to the claim of selfdefence , as the QUANTITY police officers previously mentioned had been wounded in the final stages of the operation , when the police were retreating from the town , while the firearms had been used by the policemen at an earlier stage of the events . Moreover , the forensic expert report carried out over the course of the investigation did not establish with certainty if the rubber bullet Mr PERSON had been shot with by officer GPE could have been the only cause of death in the absence of the rest of the shots . The court considered that this was an important factor in determining the identity of the perpetrator of the killing , considering that the same person had been shot almost simultaneously by police officer PERSON , using live ammunition . Furthermore , the CARDINAL axes allegedly used by Mr PERSON and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru had not been forensically checked for their fingerprints . The court held that such evidence was important to determine whether the use of firearms by the officers had been justified . In addition , the investigation failed to determine the exact position of the other members of the police force and whether they could have stopped Mr PERSON attack against GPE At the same time , the investigation had failed to establish the distance and the angle from which Mr ORG had been shot . The circumstances of Mr PERSON shooting had also not been clarified by the investigation in view of the parties\u2019 statements , in particular there was no lawful explanation concerning why he had been shot through a wall or precisely when he had been shot during the operation . Lastly , the file did not contain sufficient evidence concerning the reasons for the police operation to capture the applicants : in particular , the court considered that the orders to seek and capture the applicants , the documents containing the charges against them and the arrest warrants issued in their names were missing from the file . Consequently , the court decided to send the case back to the prosecutor \u2019s office in order to supplement the criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . GPE , GPE and ORG lodged an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) against the judgment of DATE . They argued , inter alia , that the complaints lodged by PERSON before the domestic courts on behalf of the applicants contesting the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s order to discontinue the criminal investigation was not valid . In particular the authorisations signed by some of the applicants allowing PERSON to represent them before the courts did not comply with the formal requirements for powers of attorney provided by the applicable rules of criminal procedure . In addition , they submitted that the evidence in the file proved that the police officers had acted in selfdefence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG attached to ORG of the Interior informed the investigating authorities that the axes allegedly used by PERSON PERSON and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru to attack the police officers had wooden handles which were uneven and pitted . Consequently , ORG did not have substances or a method allowing them to examine fingerprints on such surfaces .", "CARDINAL . At the hearings of CARDINAL May , DATE , DATE and DATE ORG adjourned the proceedings on account of procedural errors in summoning the parties and in order to allow them to read the written submissions attached to the file .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE ORG heard oral submissions from the parties and , because it needed time to deliberate , adjourned the proceedings to CARDINAL DATE , DATE and to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of DATE ORG allowed the appeals on points of law by GPE , ORG and ORG , quashed the judgment of DATE and declared inadmissible the applicants\u2019 and PERSON \u2019s complaints against ORG order of DATE . It held that none of the natural persons had contested the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s order to discontinue the criminal investigation before the domestic courts . Only Mr PERSON lodged a complaint against the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s order of DATE , which was dismissed on DATE . He did not challenge the latter decision before the domestic courts . Moreover , none of the applicants had personally signed the challenge lodged by PERSON on their behalf . In addition , the appeal lodged by PERSON on behalf of the applicants against the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s order for the investigation to be discontinued was invalid . The nongovernmental organisation had not been empowered by the applicants to represent them before domestic courts on the form required by the applicable rules of criminal procedure , in particular Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , and therefore the organisation could not be considered to be the applicants\u2019 representative . The applicants had not provided PERSON with a special and certified power of attorney as required by law . In so far as PERSON argument was concerned , that on the basis of section CARDINAL of Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL it had legal standing to bring proceedings before domestic courts , the court noted that the organisation had not sustained any prejudice as a result of the incident complained of , and the police action of DATE concerned the taking into custody of wanted individuals , and did not represent acts of discrimination as required by section CARDINAL of Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL . Consequently , it held that PERSON did not have legal standing to bring proceedings before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged their application before the ORG with a letter dated DATE . The initial application form attached to the letter contained the names of Mr PERSON and PERSON Ovidiu Ciubotaru , Ms PERSON with the note that she was representing PERSON PERSON , Mr PERSON , Ms PERSON and the organisation PERSON . The application form was signed by PERSON PERSON , as the applicants\u2019 representative . No powers of attorney were attached to the application . The applicants complained that some of them had sustained bullet wounds and some of their relatives had been killed , but none of them referred , either expressly or in substance , to any other complaints as a result of other types of injury sustained .", "CARDINAL . Following the ORG \u2019s request on DATE the ORG representative submitted powers of attorney signed on DATE by all the initial applicants , including Mr PERSON and Ms Ana Ciubotaru . In respect of Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON submitted CARDINAL powers of attorney bearing his name , CARDINAL of them signed however by Ms PERSON , whose name does not appear on any of the other powers of attorney . Moreover , PERSON PERSON name and/or signature were not present on any of the powers of attorney submitted before the Court . In addition , one of the powers of attorney had been filled in and signed by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG received CARDINAL sets of application forms which contained complaints identical to the ones mentioned in the first application form submitted by the applicants . Each application form bears the name of a different applicant , as follows : PERSON PERSON , PERSON Ovidiu Ciubotaru , Ms PERSON , Mr PERSON , Ms PERSON and the organisation PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The name of PERSON PERSON does not appear on any of the application forms or the powers of attorney submitted by the applicants at any stage of the proceedings before the Court .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provides , inter alia , that the breach of the rules concerning the lodging of a complaint before the court renders the complaint null and void . The nullity can not be corrected and can be examined at any stage of the proceedings as well as by the court of its own motion .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that a complaint can be lodged by a person , either on their own behalf or through a representative authorised by a certified mandate attached to the complaint .", "CARDINAL . The relevant legal provisions , in particular a description of the development of the law concerning complaints against decisions of the prosecutor ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW introduced by PERSON no .
