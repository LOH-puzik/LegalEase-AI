The Government maintained that ORG had violated the ceasefire line and had entered the territory of the \u201c GPE \u201d ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) . He was warned verbally and by hand gestures . However , he did not stop and continued to run towards the boundary . CARDINAL of the soldiers approached him and fired warning shots in the air . ORG took no notice of this shot and consequently a second shot was fired at the ground in order to stop him . As he continued to run away , a third round was fired at him below his waist , which apparently caused the fatal wound . The Government referred to the ORG Secretary - General \u2019s report , which stated : \u201c in a serious incident that occurred on DATE , a NORP was shot CARDINAL times and killed by a NORP - Cypriot soldier after crossing the NORP force \u2019s ceasefire line \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

The Government emphasised the fact that ORG had crossed the NORP - Cypriot ceasefire line into the territory of the \u201c GPE \u201d , in the same area where the CARDINAL NORP soldiers had been shot . There were strong reasons to believe that Mr Kakoulli , who was a retired fireman , would not have crossed into the \u201c GPE \u201d territory by mistake , particularly at a location where there were signs in NORP and NORP indicating the border . Mr PERSON had been in possession of a garrotte and a bayonet at the material time , which constituted a strong presumption that he had a sinister motive . His act of carrying a bucket apparently to collect snails was a cover for his real motive .", "CARDINAL . NORP The death of Mr Kakoulli had not been a deliberate act , the Government asserted , but an attempt to maintain security in a highly tense environment . The incident had occurred during a period when tension at the border between the north and south of GPE was extremely high . Given the circumstances of the dangerous situation created by the NORP - Cypriot authorities , the NORP soldiers had been fully justified in taking all necessary precautions and using the necessary force in order to remove the danger and threats of the ceasefire being broken and to protect the lives of others .", "CARDINAL .

Mr Panikos Hadjiathanasiou is the fianc\u00e9 of Mr ORG daughter . He accompanied Mr Kakoulli to collect snails on DATE of the impugned incident . In his statements he claimed , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c ... After the rainfall at my village , I agreed with my father - in - law to go together TIME ( DATE ) to collect snails . So , DATE in the morning I set off with my father - in - law in my car , which I was driving . We took a bucket each in which to put snails ... At TIME we went to a point on the main ORG - Dhekelia road near a bridge . I stopped my car under some eucalyptus trees , on the left side of the main ORG - Dhekelia road , by the former PERSON police station . We alighted from the vehicle , we each took our buckets and we proceeded south , towards the PERSON side to collect snails . Because there were no snails to find , my father - in - law said that we should separate . He proceeded towards the lower side of the hill from the right , while I proceeded towards the left , intending to cover the whole lower side of the hill , and then to meet at the opposite side . The area in question is situated south of the main PERSON road . We started walking and I saw my father - in - law following a route in parallel to the main road and passing the bridge that is at the bottom of the hill by the PERSON roundabout . As soon he had proceeded CARDINAL after the bridge , I lost sight of him as I had proceeded further and the hill was in between us ... Before separating , my father - in - law told me that he was intending to go by the ORG observation post , which is opposite the former PERSON police station . The main PERSON - Dhekelia road is controlled by ORG . CARDINAL and TIME , as we had agreed to return to the village , I started calling him , \u201c Father ! Father ! \u201d , but did not receive any reply . Whilst doing so I was walking towards the hill so I could have a better view and be able to see him . Whilst walking , I heard shouting in the NORP language coming from the direction of the former PERSON police station , which is in the NORP - occupied area . On hearing the shouting , I ran towards the hill , I climbed it and I could see the surrounding area and the former PERSON police station . I saw my father - in - law standing by an acacia tree at the rear of the PERSON police station , facing towards the NORP - occupied area ... The distance between myself and my father - in - law was QUANTITY ... He was holding his bucket with his left hand , but nothing in his right ... I heard someone shouting at him something like a military command , which consisted of CARDINAL words that were short and sharp in tone , and I understood the first word to be \u2018 DUR\u2019 . The other CARDINAL words which I heard had a short interval between them but I did not understand them . On hearing those words , my father - in - law remained still ; he left the bucket on the ground , and raised his hands up to the level of his head . Simultaneously , I saw in front of my father - in - law , at a distance of QUANTITY , CARDINAL men dressed in camouflage combat uniform . They were wearing helmets and were carrying \u2018 GCARDINAL\u2019-type rifles . They fell to the ground in front of him and , taking up battle position , aimed their rifles towards his chest and abdominal area . As soon as they fell to the ground , I heard a shot and saw my father - in - law kneeling on the ground and then falling down ... Once he fell to the ground , I lost sight of him because of the presence of the acacia tree . Immediately afterwards I heard a second shot . TIME , while my father - in - law was still on the ground , I saw CARDINAL of the CARDINAL NORP soldiers standing up and , pointing his rifle forwards , proceeding towards the point where my father - in - law was , with his back arched . He approached within a distance of QUANTITY of him , straightened up , aimed his rifle towards the point where my father - in - law was and fired another shot ... At the time of the shootings , I saw that on the road between myself and the place where my father - in - law was shot , there were CARDINAL NORP Cypriots . CARDINAL of them was Georghios Mishis from GPE ... The NORP soldier , having fired the third shot , retreated to the point where the other soldier was lying on the ground and afterwards , both of them started walking backwards aiming their rifles towards the main road , and disappeared behind the slope at the rear of the PERSON police station ...

DATE , on GPE , PERSON and I were on guard duty at FAC CARDINAL ... After TIME from the time we started our shift , we \u2013 I and PERSON ORG saw , CARDINAL metres from our guard post , a person walking inside our territory . This person was walking in a south - north direction , in other words in the direction of a trail we describe as the patrolling trail . We did not know who this person was . As soon as I saw this person I informed Duty Officer PERSON via the wireless ( radio ) . He told us over the wireless to continue to keep the person under observation . Then I told my companion , Infantry Private PERSON : \u2018 You stay here ; I will go and look at this person.\u2019 And , holding my rifle with a loaded magazine attached to it , I came down from FAC guard post and joined the trail , advancing towards the border fence ... After approaching to QUANTITY from the person , I shouted and asked him what he was doing there . Without saying anything the person continued walking on the slope in the direction of the patrolling trail . Until that moment I could not firmly determine whether this person was a NORP or a NORP . So I moved closer to him . The distance between us was QUANTITY . This person was high on the slope . At that moment , I sensed that the person could well be a NORP . The look of the person was one of bad intent and unease . After that , through hand signals I asked him where he was coming from . Initially the person gave no verbal reply , but he signalled with his right hand and indicated the NORP side and said something in NORP . But I did not understand what he said . When I was sure that the person was a NORP , I removed the safety catch of my weapon and aimed at him . At that moment , the person , while speaking in NORP and making hand signals , started coming towards me . Faced with this situation I shouted in NORP , telling him to stop , and with my left arm I signalled to him to stop . The person did not stop and continued walking towards me . I , for my part , stepped back QUANTITY and shouted at my colleague PERSON and told him to inform the exchange about the situation ...", "The guard PERSON heard me . Then I again turned my head towards the person . I shouted and warned the person to stop . After that he stopped walking towards me and started walking towards the border fence . I again shouted and warned him to stop . But this person continued walking away in the direction of the fence while moving his arms and hands saying something in NORP . The distance between this person and the border fence was QUANTITY . Following that , I went up to the slope to have a better view of him . The person was still walking towards the border fence . I shouted again and asked him to stop . But he went on walking , waving his hands at the same time . After that the distance between the person and me was QUANTITY . At that point I fired a shot into the air . After hearing the firing of the gun the person quickened his steps . After that I turned my weapon in his direction and fired another shot towards the ground . He again failed to stop and further increased his speed . The distance between us at that moment was QUANTITY . When I realised that the person would not heed my warnings and would cross over to the NORP - Cypriot side , that is I would not be able to catch him , I decided to stop the person by shooting and wounding him . Therefore , while he was walking I aimed my gun roughly at his legs and fired . After that the person stopped momentarily . Until that moment I was not sure if my shot had found its target . Following that , and while he was in a walking position , I fired CARDINAL rounds , aiming at the person . And the person was shot and fell to the ground . Naturally , the person fell on his right side . I realised that the person was shot . But I did not go near him . I thought there could be others hiding in the area . Therefore , I went up to the hilltop and , hiding behind the rock , began observing and monitoring the area . After that I did not hear any sound coming from the said person .", "The shooting incident took place at TIME After TIME Company Duty Officer PERSON arrived at the scene of the incident along with a team of soldiers .

No one is allowed to enter the area where we saw the person without permission ... When we first arrived at our post no information was given to us about the presence of a person there .

PERSON left the post holding the G-CARDINAL infantry rifle , registered in his name , with CARDINAL magazine attached to it and another one inside his belt , and directly joined the patrolling trail from the top and crossed the trail in a southerly direction and started walking in the field as if he wanted to get away from the person , but he was going to approach the person from behind . The way he was moving he would prevent the person from escaping or getting closer to the border fence . What I saw from the guard post was this : PERSON got closer to the person and the distance between them was QUANTITY . First I saw that person on the slope and PERSON was in the field .

Then I saw PERSON raise his gun into the air and fire a single shot . But that man was still walking away . This time PERSON lowered his gun and aimed at the man , and in a very short period he fired CARDINAL single shots , and as the man was walking he fell down . Naturally , it was not possible for me to discern how many shots PERSON fired at the man and how many shots at the ground . But when the man fell down I realised that he had been shot ...
