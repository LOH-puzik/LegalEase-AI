When the relationship broke up around DATE , he had a nagging doubt . He did not tell M about this . He has had access to the daughter A every second DATE . In DATE they had DATE during which M accused him of being a poor father . This caused him to order a paternity test on the Internet which has been submitted to GPE . Through his job as a policeman he knew how to provide a saliva sample , which he did for the purpose of this test . He took a saliva sample with a cotton swab from both his own cheeks and A \u2019s . The samples were sent to the GPE laboratory , which concluded that he could not be the father . He received the reply in DATE . He has no name of any other possible father . However , with his present knowledge he believes that he can not be the father of A. M has confirmed [ the applicant \u2019s ] statement about the course of events . She is also unable to give the name of any other possible father .", "Findings of the Court :", "M and [ the applicant ] were cohabiting lovers when A was born . Since the termination of their cohabitation in DATE [ DATE ] , [ the applicant ] has had access to A. The request for reopening of the proceedings was made by him . M did not object to the reopening of the proceedings , but stated in a letter of DATE to GPE : \u201c Of course , an official test should be made as I have no clue as to who the father could otherwise be \u201d . [ The applicant ] has submitted a privately performed DNA test according to which he can not be the father of A. The conditions for reopening paternity proceedings are stated in section CARDINAL of LAW . According to this provision , it must be considered of importance whether the paternity of the child is likely to be established if the proceedings are reopened . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , paternity proceedings may be reopened if the father and mother so request in agreement , and only if it is proved on a balance of probabilities that another man can become the child \u2019s father . As the request for reopening of the proceedings was made by [ the applicant ] alone , the ORG finds that the request should be assessed under section CARDINAL of LAW . Although , according to the DNA test produced by [ the applicant ] it is precluded that he is the father , the ORG finds that the paternity proceedings should not be reopened as it must be considered of decisive importance that the request for reopening was made DATE after the child \u2019s birth , that [ the applicant ] has had ordinary weekend access to A also since the termination of cohabitation , and that it must be considered a fact on the basis of [ the applicant \u2019s ] and M \u2019s statements that A can not be expected to be acknowledged by another father if the proceedings were reopened . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG of Eastern Denmark ( Vestre Landsret ) , hereafter ORG , which on DATE passed judgment , which included the following :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] has additionally stated that M had been out partying and came home TIME just before they went on holiday . He and M did not use contraception around the time of the conception , but their sexual practice was such that he found it improbable that he had made M pregnant . M did not say at the termination of their cohabitation that he was not the father . He said during the pregnancy that he wanted a DNA test , but M opposed that . He has not cohabited with A since she was DATE . He has seen A CARDINAL times a month . It was only in DATE during a row that he became aware of the incidents when M could have been together with somebody else . They were on DATE from DATE until DATE . He received the test results in DATE . For reasons of anonymity , the declaration from the NORP firm does not bear any names . He last saw A in DATE . A has not had any contact with his parents since then . He acknowledged the paternity after A \u2019s birth and did not question it then . A was born at the due time .", "M has explained that they became lovers in DATE after having met in DATE . They had a normal sex life also at the time around the conception . She did not remember having been out partying before DATE . She was not together with other men during the period of their cohabitation . They had not fallen out TIME on DATE , but she was unable to return to the hotel room as she had no key . She had something to drink with young people , and she was probably rather intoxicated . They were NORP , including a girl . She woke up at CARDINAL a.m .. She had not had intercourse with others that night . However , due to her intoxication she can not rule out that it may have happened . But she was wearing her clothes when she woke up , and she felt no sign of having had intercourse . The first time that [ the applicant ] questioned his paternity was on DATE . A has asked for her father and his parents since the connection was broken off . M has no current plans to marry her boyfriend , who has , however , been playing with the idea of adopting A. She expects to marry her boyfriend eventually . Her boyfriend is fond of A. She still thinks that a DNA test should be performed , also because A is entitled to know . However , she is in no doubt that [ the applicant ] is the father .", "Reasoning and decision of ORG :", "It must be considered a fact that , prior to acknowledging paternity , [ the applicant ] had knowledge of the circumstances that made him obtain a DNA test and cast doubts about the paternity DATE after A \u2019s birth . For this reason and for the reasons stated by ORG , ORG upholds the judgment . \u201d", "Leave to appeal to ORG was refused by ORG ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) on DATE .", "The purpose of the NORP paternity rules laid down in LAW , ( B\u00f8rneloven ) , Act no . CARDINAL of DATE , as amended , is to ensure the mutual rights of the child and the father . The most important legal effects of paternity are that the father has a duty to maintain the child according to specific rules , that the father and the child have a right to inherit from each other , that the child may take the father \u2019s surname , and that the child may have the same nationality as the father if the relevant conditions are met . In addition , paternity is generally a condition for allowing the father to have a share in the custody of the child and a condition for the right to access of a man who does not have the child living with him . LAW is based on Report No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the legal rights of children issued by ORG of ORG . ORG was appointed by ORG in DATE and was to make proposals for a revision of LAW , including considering new paternity rules . In DATE , ORG issued an interim report on paternity . According to the interim report , ORG had worked on the basis of the fundamental assumption that a child should be entitled to have both a mother and a legal father to the widest extent possible . The report also states that the ORG found that an attempt should be made to design the rules on reopening paternity proceedings so that permanent stability concerning the child \u2019s situation could be provided as rapidly as possible . The ORG also found that it should generally not be possible to revoke paternity unless the child was acknowledged by another father . ORG also proposed enactment of the non - statutory doctrine of acknowledgement on which case - law had been based prior to LAW . The doctrine of acknowledgement implies that a party can be barred from instituting paternity proceedings even when the statutory time - limits have not expired . This is the case if the father or mother has treated the child as being the father \u2019s even though they know or suspect that the father is not the genetic father of the child . Application of the doctrine is based on a specific assessment of the individual case . The relevant provisions on institution and reopening of paternity proceedings are laid down in DATE and CARDINAL of LAW , which read as follows :", "Where paternity has been recorded by or acknowledged before ORG , proceedings may be instituted by the mother , the father or the child \u2019s guardian within DATE of the child \u2019s birth .", "The preparatory notes set out that the reason behind section CARDINAL was to give the mother and the father a \u201c cooling - off \u201d possibility . Recordings and acknowledgements covered by the provision are therefore not final until DATE after the child \u2019s birth . The fairly short period was laid down in order to provide stability concerning the child \u2019s situation . The right to institute paternity proceedings within DATE is free and is thus not conditional upon proof on a balance of probabilities that another man is the child \u2019s father , and the doctrine of acknowledgement is not applied either .", "If the DATE time - limit set out in section CARDINAL has expired , the proceedings can only be re - opened if the following conditions , set out in section CARDINAL of LAW , are met :", "CARDINAL . If the fatherhood of a child is registered , or established by acknowledgment or by judgment ; the mother or her estate , the guardian or the child \u2019s estate , the father or his estate ; may within DATE after the child \u2019s birth request that the paternity case be reopened , provided that facts have come to light which may result in another outcome , or in other respects there is a special reason to believe that the paternity case may turn out differently .", "CARDINAL . When deciding under subsection CARDINAL , importance should be attached in particular to the following :", "i ) the length of time elapsed since the child \u2019s birth ;", "ii ) whether the father , with actual or presumed knowledge of the circumstances which raise doubts as to his fatherhood , has [ nevertheless ] acknowledged the child by treating it as his own ;", "iii ) whether the mother , with actual or presumed knowledge of the circumstances mentioned under ii ) has let the father treat the child as his own ;", "iv ) whether a party , with actual or presumed knowledge of the circumstances which raise doubts as to who is the child \u2019s father , failed within a reasonable time to request a reopening of the case ; and", "v ) whether in case of a reopening , it can be expected that fatherhood of the child will be established .", "It appears from the preparatory notes that it is a condition for reopening the proceedings under section CARDINAL that information has come to light about circumstances that will presumably result in another outcome to the proceedings , or that there is otherwise a special reason to assume that the proceedings will now have another outcome . This is particularly aimed at cases where another potential father turns up . Moreover , the provision does not confer a right of reopening even though the said conditions have been met . The decision to reopen the proceedings thus depends on an overall assessment , particularly including the circumstances listed in subsection CARDINAL .", "If the DATE time - limit set out in section CARDINAL has expired , the proceedings can only be reopened if exceptional reasons exist , see section QUANTITY of LAW :", "Reopening of proceedings under sections CARDINAL and DATE may be permitted after the expiry of the time - limit stipulated by those provisions if exceptional reasons for not making the request earlier can be given , if the circumstances otherwise make reopening of the proceedings appropriate to a high degree , and if a renewed review of the proceedings will presumably not imply material nuisance to the child ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
