PERSON was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE she complained to ORG that the school teacher of her son , then aged DATE , had on several occasions ill - treated and humiliated him . In particular , she alleged that the teacher had hit the child DATE and had since then often insulted him , had made remarks about his parents in front of other pupils , and had belittled his performance at school . PERSON argued that this had amounted to harassment , and said that her son had become demotivated . The ORG examined the complaint , heard the teacher , PERSON son and other witnesses , and concluded that the allegation of ill - treatment had not been made out . It found that relations between PERSON and the teacher had been strained since DATE , when the father of her son had threatened the teacher in front of other pupils . The teacher had brought a private criminal prosecution against the father in relation to that , and the proceedings were pending .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON complained to the school \u2019s headmaster and the police that the teacher had taken her son \u2019s mobile telephone in class and had later refused to give it back .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecuting authorities opened criminal proceedings against an unknown perpetrator in connection with this allegation and in DATE suspended them on the ground that the perpetrator had not been identified .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the teacher brought a private criminal prosecution against PERSON in connection with these CARDINAL complaints . She submitted that she had not read them because the authorities dealing with them had not shown them to her . However , she had been asked to give explanations and from the questions put to her she had inferred that PERSON had accused her of having stolen a mobile telephone and described her as a biased and incompetent teacher using inappropriate disciplinary methods . At the first hearing of the case in DATE , the teacher brought a civil claim against PERSON , seeking MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) , plus interest , in non - pecuniary damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found PERSON ORG guilty of defaming a public official , contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) . The court replaced Mr LOC criminal liability with an administrative fine of BGN CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . It partly allowed the teacher \u2019s claim for damages , ordering PERSON to pay her BGN MONEY ( ORG MONEY ) , plus interest . It also ordered PERSON to pay the teacher \u2019s costs , amounting to ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , and part of the court fee paid by the teacher , amounting to ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The court noted that relations between the teacher and PERSON had for a long time been bad . Having examined the findings of ORG and the prosecuting authorities in relation to PERSON complaints , the court concluded that her allegations , the first of which had become known to the school \u2019s headmaster and a pedagogical counsellor in the school , had been false and therefore defamatory . The court also held , without specifying the basis for its conclusion on this point , that PERSON had acted with direct intent . In fixing the amount of the fine , the court noted , inter alia , her poor financial situation .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed , arguing , inter alia , that complaining about a public official to the authorities did not amount to \u201c dissemination \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . Such complaints could , in some cases , be seen as false accusation contrary to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . PERSON ORG also emphasised that she had not made her allegations publicly .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a final judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It found that PERSON allegations that the teacher had ill - treated her son were not supported by the findings of ORG or her son \u2019s or the headmaster \u2019s testimony , and held that information was \u201c disseminated \u201d within the meaning of LAW even if CARDINAL person had become privy to it . The court found that the allegations in relation to the mobile telephone were false as well . It agreed that the statements in this respect in PERSON complaint to the police had amounted to a false accusation , and that the lower court had been wrong to characterise them as defamation . However , it stated that in the absence of an appeal by the teacher , it could not quash this part of the lower court \u2019s judgment . It upheld , without giving any details , the lower court \u2019s finding that PERSON had acted with direct intent .", "CARDINAL . To obtain payment of the award of damages and costs , the teacher brought enforcement proceedings against PERSON . It is unclear how these ended .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was stopped by CARDINAL road traffic police officers . CARDINAL of them recorded that Mr GPE had failed to obey a stop sign . Mr GPE objected , noting down in the record that the officer had refused to present himself , smelled of alcohol and staggered . In written explanations which he filed with ORG on DATE , Mr PERSON reiterated his allegations and said that the officer had behaved aggressively .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE \u2019s allegations triggered an internal inquiry which exonerated the officer of any wrongdoing .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the officer brought a private criminal prosecution against Mr GPE in relation to these allegations . He also claimed ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) in non - pecuniary damages .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG found Mr GPE guilty of defaming a public official , contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) . The court replaced his criminal liability with an administrative fine of BGN CARDINAL ( FAC ) . It partly allowed the officer \u2019s claim for damages , ordering Mr GPE to pay him BGN CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) , plus interest . It also ordered Mr GPE to pay BGN MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) in court fees . The court examined in detail the results of the internal inquiry carried out pursuant to Mr GPE \u2019s allegations , tests carried out TIME after the incident on DATE and showing that the officer had not consumed alcohol , and the oral evidence of the other officer present at the scene and the ORG superior . It concluded that Mr GPE \u2019s allegations did not correspond to the truth . It went on to find that Mr PERSON had not been certain of the truthfulness of his allegations , but had nevertheless chosen to make them , both in the record drawn up by the officer in the course of the incident on DATE and in his subsequent written explanations .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE appealed . He argued , inter alia , that his statements , made in the exercise of his constitutional rights and only addressed to the officer \u2019s superior , had not amounted to \u201c dissemination \u201d within the meaning of the LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . He also relied , inter alia , on LAW and this ORG \u2019s caselaw under this provision .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It found it established that the officer had not displayed any signs of inebriation , which in the court \u2019s view meant that Mr PERSON had been fully aware that the officer had not been drunk but had nevertheless chosen to make his allegations , thus acting with a direct intent to discredit the officer . Those allegations , whose purpose had been to smear the officer and at the same time exonerate Mr GPE from liability for the road traffic offence recorded by the officer , could not be justified by the right to defend oneself against administrative - penal charges or the right to freedom of expression . The court ordered Mr GPE to pay the officer \u2019s costs for the appellate proceedings , amounting to ORG ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE , who was driving his lorry , was stopped by CARDINAL road traffic police officers . CARDINAL of them allegedly requested a bribe . PERSON promised to bring him the money in TIME and left his identity card and the vehicle \u2019s documents with the officers . He then called the police and informed the officer on duty of the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL and DATE Mr Findulov made complaints to ORG , ORG and the Minister of ORG , alleging that one of the officers who had stopped him , whose identity was not known to him , had requested a bribe and had withheld his documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG replied to PERSON that his complaint was illfounded .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON , on DATE he found his identity card in his mail box . The vehicle \u2019s documents were never recovered .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG of ORG of ORG found , on the basis of a report by the CARDINAL traffic police officers issued in PERSON Findulov \u2019s absence , that he had not used a seatbelt , that one of the tyres of his lorry had been worn out , that he had refused a breathalyser test , and that he had driven away in an unknown direction . It gave Mr Findulov CARDINAL administrative fines of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL administrative fine of BGN CARDINAL , stripped him of CARDINAL control points from his driving licence , and barred him from driving a motor vehicle for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE sought judicial review of that decision . On DATE the ORG found that no appeal lay against the ORG CARDINAL fines and discontinued the proceedings in that part . It quashed the remainder of the decision of CARDINAL DATE , finding that the report of the traffic police officers had not been communicated to Mr GPE . In a final judgment of DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE , the officer accused by Mr Findulov of soliciting a bribe brought a private criminal prosecution against him in relation to that allegation . He also sought ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in nonpecuniary damages .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found Mr GPE guilty of defaming a public official , contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) . It sentenced him to a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and a public reprimand . It partly allowed the officer \u2019s claim for damages , ordering Mr GPE to pay him BGN CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) . It also ordered PERSON GPE to pay ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in court fees . The court noted that in his complaints PERSON had not named the officer , but found that he had been identifiable from the complaints , which clearly alleged that he had requested a bribe , thus accusing him of an offence before third parties . The offence of defamation did not require that those third parties \u2013 the officer \u2019s hierarchy \u2013 had actually believed the allegations or taken any action in relation to them . PERSON , who under LAW ( see paragraph DATE above ) bore the burden of proof in this respect , had failed to establish that the officer had in fact solicited a bribe . The court went on to say , without explaining the reasons for this conclusion , that Mr Findulov had acted with direct intent . When fixing the sentence , the court noted that it could not replace Mr GPE \u2019s criminal liability with an administrative punishment as this was a CARDINAL - off possibility and PERSON had previously benefited from a waiver of his criminal liability in relation to a road traffic offence . In fixing the award of non - pecuniary damages to the officer , the court noted that ORG allegations had been particularly damning .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE appealed .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It entirely agreed with the reasons given by that court , adding that Mr Findulov had been fully aware that his allegations against the officer were false but had nevertheless chosen to defame him . The court also ordered PERSON to pay BGN MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) incurred by the officer in costs for the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The public reprimand was executed , as ordered by the court , by announcing Mr GPE \u2019s conviction and sentence on the local radio station . To obtain payment of the award of damages and costs , the officer brought enforcement proceedings against ORG . It is unclear how these ended .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE was born in DATE . PERSON was born in DATE . Both of them live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL of them had a long - running conflict with neighbours of theirs . On DATE tensions escalated and PERSON and PERSON called the police , complaining that they had been assaulted by the neighbours . CARDINAL officers came and warned CARDINAL of the neighbours not to harass the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr and PERSON complained to the head of LOC against the officers , alleging that they had shown no interest in the incident and had failed to protect them , instead inviting the aggressors in the patrol car and \u201c muttering with them \u201d . PERSON and PERSON sent copies of the complaint to ORG , the head of ORG , and the Minister of ORG . On DATE the head of LOC informed PERSON and PERSON that an internal inquiry had established that their complaint was ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the officers brought a private criminal prosecution and claims for damages against Mr and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , LOC found PERSON and PERSON guilty of defaming public officials , contrary to ORG and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) . It sentenced each of them to a fine of ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) and a public reprimand . The reprimand was to be executed by announcing the conviction and sentence on the local radio station . The court also partly allowed the ORG claims for damages , ordering the applicants to pay each of them LAW ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , in a final judgment of DATE ORG upheld the conviction with similar reasoning but reduced the fine imposed on each applicant to ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . After the Government were given notice of the application ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , they brought PERSON and PERSON case to the attention of ORG . In DATE the Chief Prosecutor ad interim asked ORG to reopen the proceedings , set aside the judgments against PERSON and PERSON , and acquit them . He submitted that the statements in their complaint against the officers had not been defamatory but simply an expression of their disapproval of the way in which the officers had carried out their duties . Under the case - law of this ORG and the case - law of ORG , public officials could legitimately be subjected to heightened criticism . Accepting , as the GPE courts had , that critical statements in complaints against such officials were defamatory would mean that the vast majority of claims and complaints filed with the courts and the prosecuting authorities by nonlawyers could lead to penal sanctions .", "CARDINAL .

It held that their actions had not amounted to an offence . The statements in their complaints had been an expression of their disapproval of the way in which the officers had carried out their duties , and an exercise of their constitutional rights to make complaints to the authorities , express their opinion , and defend their rights . The statements had been value judgments which could not be proved or disproved , and could not be regarded as defamatory . Defamation could only consist in the imputation of concrete negative facts .
