When did the applicant arrive in GPE and on what basis did he request protection ( asylum , subsidiary protection or other ) there ?

The applicant requested asylum on the basis that he claimed that he was next in kin to become the king in his village but this was not accepted by his uncle who had poisoned his father and brother and had , therefore , instilled fear for personal safety in the applicant . In the applicant \u2019s preliminary questionnaire which was conducted on DATE , the applicant declared that he was born on DATE .

Appended to the applicant \u2019s reply were :", "( a ) a report by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe , Mr PERSON , following his visit to GPE from DATE ( FAC , DATE ) . On the subject of open centres , this report stated the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Material conditions in the open centres visited by the Commissioner were clearly sub - standard , with the PERSON - Far tent village offering totally inadequate conditions of accommodation even for short periods of time . The village , which at the time of the visit hosted approximately CARDINAL migrants , mainly from LOC , consists of tents , some of which had been damaged due to bad weather conditions , and containers , as well as offices , a classroom , sanitary facilities , a mosque , and a restaurant . Each tent is shared CARDINAL men who sleep in bunk beds . The tents were clearly overcrowded and offered no privacy . Residents have complained to the Commissioner about bad sanitary conditions , including having to share the same space with persons who are sick , and about the very cold temperatures in the facilities in the winter and hot temperatures during DATE . The presence of rats was also reported by migrants . The tent village has a building with toilets , showers and basins for laundry . However , hot water is reportedly not always available . A female migrant stated that she avoided using the toilets at TIME as she felt unsafe covering the considerable distance between them and the container where she was accommodated . Reportedly the tent village was served by CARDINAL social worker and CARDINAL nurse . For medical services migrants were referred to centres outside of the tent village .", "CARDINAL . At walking distance from the tent village another complex , the Hangar Open Centre in ORG , which includes CARDINAL containers and a dilapidated hangar , accommodated CARDINAL migrants , mainly from LOC . At the time of the visit , the Commissioner noted that certain women and families with children were accommodated in containers separately from the male migrants . In the centre there was a recent building that included toilets and showers . The hangar was closed and not in use . However , the Commissioner was informed that following the new arrivals from GPE since his visit , the hangar has been re - opened and that tents have been placed inside of it to accommodate migrants . Material conditions in the hangar are reported to be seriously sub - standard , with lack of adequate bedding , dirty floors , toilets ( which are shared by men , women and children ) , and kitchen , insufficient lighting , and the presence of rats . These conditions are all the more worrying as the Commissioner understands that a number of family units with young children are accommodated there , as mentioned below .", "CARDINAL . Conditions were somewhat better at the open centre in GPE with CARDINAL male residents mostly from GPE and GPE . Unlike the tent village and hangar complex in LOC , which are run directly by ORG ) the running of the centre in GPE is subcontracted by the authorities to a non - governmental organisation ( the ORG for Shelter and Support to Migrants ) . The Commissioner notes that extensive refurbishment work , which would allow for better conditions and a more functional distribution of space , were underway during his visit . At the time of the visit however , serious overcrowding was still very obvious . Toilets visited by the Commissioner , although they had been cleaned , appeared to be run down , while the whole area of the open centre in GPE , situated near a port , was covered by a smell which appeared to be caused by stagnating water in a neighbouring canal . \u201d", "( b ) CARDINAL reports by ORG , a NORP NGO engaged in providing assistance to asylum - seekers and refugees , the first dated DATE , the second dated DATE . Both describe the open centres as squalid and overcrowded and basic facilities , including for vulnerable groups , as insufficient .", "( c ) CARDINAL letters from a child and juvenile psychiatrist who was treating the applicant , dated DATE and DATE , describing the applicant as psychotic and potentially suicidal and expressing concern that conditions for the applicant \u2019s reception in GPE should be appropriate to his mental state .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Minister for ORG and ORG published a paper entitled \u201c Strategy for the reception of asylum seekers and irregular migrants \u201d . The following is taken from this document :", "\u201c GPE \u2019s ratio of asylum seekers in proportion to population has consistently been among the highest , and very often the highest , among all ORG Member GPE . In fact , GPE received a total of CARDINAL asylum applications per CARDINAL inhabitants DATE , compared to an ORG average of CARDINAL . It is also to be stated that ORG does not only receive international protection applications from irregular migrants ; for during DATE up to CARDINAL asylum applications were also received from migrants who applied directly at ORG . All this goes a long way to show that even though asylum applications may be generally constant , the number is at the same time elevated when compared to the country \u2019s geo - physical and social circumstances and realities . Matters are further complicated by the fact that a majority of those who seek international protection in GPE are actually found to be deserving of such protection . This means that these people do not only require immediate reception arrangements , but also long - term solutions .", "In view of the abovementioned circumstances , conditions in reception centres have been rendered difficult during certain periods ; however over DATE several initiatives were carried out in order to improve the living conditions of irregular migrants and asylum seekers residing in such centres , including by means of ORG funding mechanisms . DATE , apposite NORP funding mechanisms and national funds will be utilised for the provision of adequate food supplies , bedding , clothing and medical support among other initiatives . Investment will also continue being made in reception facilities , where the required refurbishment initiatives in open and closed centres will be undertaken . Furthermore , GPE \u2019s Open Reception capacity will be enhanced by means of a new ORG , with the utilisation of ORG funds , in order to better address current and future needs .", "The present document seeks to build upon the existing reception system , introducing improvements at several stages with a view to ensuring compliance with new ORG obligations , as well as to improve the system from the perspective of national security on the one hand and humanitarian and human rights considerations on the other . \u201d ( page CARDINAL )", "and", "\u201c Asylum seekers and beneficiaries of international protection released from ORG or from Detention shall , if no alternative accommodation arrangements are available to them , be offered accommodation at ORG managed by ORG , or an entity or NGO working in partnership with the ORG .
