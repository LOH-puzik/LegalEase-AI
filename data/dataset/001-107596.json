The applicant was born in DATE and lives in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police arrested the applicant . He was accused of planning a robbery and remanded in custody from that date .", "CARDINAL . Several decisions extending the applicant \u2019s detention were made . In particular , on DATE ORG extended his detention in the context of the preliminary proceedings until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor indicted the applicant and several other persons before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested to be released , arguing that ORG had not extended his detention after the expiry of the period indicated in the ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release . Upon a complaint lodged by the public prosecutor ORG decided on DATE that the applicant should remain remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that his detention in the period after DATE and ORG refusal to release him were both unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the applicant \u2019s right under LAW had been violated in that there had been no judicial decision extending his detention after DATE ( judgment ORG ) . There existed no justification for that situation . Reference was made to ORG judgments ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL and I. \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered ORG to reimburse the applicant \u2019s costs in the constitutional proceedings . It dismissed his claim for just satisfaction , holding that ( i ) its finding as such provided appropriate redress to the applicant and ( ii ) ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE was based on that court \u2019s practice , which , however , was not in accordance with practice under the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The following provisions of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , in force until DATE ) are relevant in the present case .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a person \u2019s detention in the context of both pre - trial proceedings and during proceedings before a trial court can only last as long as necessary . Where detention in the context of pre - trial proceedings is to exceed DATE , it can be extended at a public prosecutor \u2019s request up to DATE by a judge or to a maximum of DATE by a court \u2019s chamber .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that a person \u2019s detention in the context of both pre - trial proceedings and during a trial must not exceed DATE . In justified cases ORG may extend its duration to a maximum of DATE and , in cases of particularly serious offences , DATE . Under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , a proposal for extension of a person \u2019s detention is to be submitted by a public prosecutor in the pre - trial proceedings and by the president of the court \u2019s chamber during the trial .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL obliges investigators , prosecutors and judges to examine , at each stage of criminal proceedings , whether reasons for the accused person \u2019s detention persist . In pre - trial proceedings a judge is obliged to do so only when deciding on a public prosecutor \u2019s proposal to extend detention or to modify the reasons for it or when deciding on the accused person \u2019s application for release . Where a reason for an accused person \u2019s detention no longer exists , the accused must be released immediately .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL entitles the accused to apply for release at any time . When the public prosecutor dismisses such an application in the course of pre - trial proceedings , he or she must submit it immediately to the court . The decision on an application for release must be taken without delay . If an application is dismissed , the accused may only renew it DATE after the decision has become final , unless he or she gives other reasons justifying his or her release .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , where the court carries out a preliminary examination of the indictment of a person who is detained , it shall also decide whether that person is to remain in custody .", "CARDINAL . NORP In accordance with ORG practice , the time - limits mentioned in LAW exclusively concerned situations where a decision on a public prosecutor \u2019s proposal was to be made in the context of pre - trial proceedings . However , where an indictment had been filed within a shorter time than the DATE period mentioned in LAW , the law did not require that a request for continued detention of the accused persons be made or that a separate decision should be made on their continued detention , with the exception of cases where the indictment had been filed DATE before the expiry of the DATE maximum period of detention .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to a DATE ORG ruling ( Rt CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , LAW requires a court to decide on further detention of an accused where it has carried out a preliminary examination of the indictment . Accordingly , where the presiding judge concludes , on the basis of the file , that a preliminary examination of the indictment is not required and considers the detention of the accused to be lawful , there is no need for a separate decision of the court chamber on continued detention of the accused . However , where the accused applies for release , the application must be decided upon without delay in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . In judgment ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG noted that LAW did not explicitly require that a decision on extension of an accused person \u2019s detention be given in cases where an indictment had been filed and where the detention , both at the pre - trial stage and during the trial , had not exceeded DATE .", "CARDINAL . It held , however , that the filing of an indictment alone did not as such justify a person \u2019s continued detention . The court dealing with the case was required to decide explicitly on further detention of the accused prior to the expiry of the period for which the detention had been extended in the context of pre - trial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG referred in particular to the guarantees laid down in LAW and the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In that case ORG found no breach of LAW as the ordinary court involved , both in the context of a preliminary examination of the indictment and in reaction to the accused person \u2019s request for release , decided that the reasons for the latter \u2019s detention persisted . That decision had the same effect as a decision to extend the accused person \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . In the above case , which concerned CARDINAL of the present applicant \u2019s co - accused , the detention in the context of pre - trial proceedings had been extended until DATE . Prior to its expiry , on DATE , the accused was indicted . In its judgment ORG found that ORG had breached the plaintiff \u2019s right under LAW , in that there had been no judicial decision extending his detention after DATE and there existed no justification for that situation . It was irrelevant that courts at CARDINAL levels had dismissed the accused person \u2019s application for release as those decisions related to detention in the context of pre - trial proceedings , that is prior to the filing of an indictment . In those circumstances , any relevant decision on further detention of the accused could have been taken only by the criminal court before which the accused had been indicted .", "CARDINAL . With reference to its judgment ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ORG held that for a detention to be lawful , it must always rely on a court decision .", "CARDINAL . In the above CARDINAL judgments given in the case of a different co - accused of the applicant , ORG found a breach of LAW , in that there had been no judicial decision extending the accused person \u2019s detention after the filing of the indictment . In the latter judgment it held , in particular :", "\u201c In ORG view , the jurisdiction of the court involved at the pre - trial stage ended with the filing of the indictment on DATE . The indictment as such is not a ground for continued detention of a person as it does not explicitly follow from the law , and it is inadmissible to extend the possibilities of restricting a person \u2019s liberty by extensive interpretation of several provisions of LAW .", "However , a court \u2019s decision on detention of a person at the pre - trial stage can constitute a ground for that person \u2019s detention during a short period following the indictment . Otherwise it would be practically impossible to ensure continued detention of a person after an indictment has been filed . In the circumstances , a ground for the plaintiff \u2019s detention existed until DATE . The detention should have been extended by a decision not later than on DATE if it was to last after that date . In the absence of any such decision , the restriction of the plaintiff \u2019s liberty after DATE was unlawful .", "The unlawfulness of the plaintiff \u2019s deprivation of liberty after DATE can not be justified retrospectively , not even by a judicial decision . Subsequent judicial decisions could not have extended the plaintiff \u2019s detention , as it had ended on DATE . The only existing possibility was to remand the plaintiff in custody again . As this had not happened , his subsequent deprivation of liberty had no legal ground . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In judgment PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL the Constitutional Court confirmed that the filing of an indictment alone does not suffice for continued detention of the accused to be lawful . It is required that the court dealing with the criminal case following the indictment should take a decision on the accused person \u2019s detention prior to the expiry of the period for which the latter had been remanded in the context of pre - trial proceedings . ORG found a breach of the accused person \u2019s right under LAW and ordered his immediate release .", "CARDINAL . The new Code of Criminal Procedure ( Law no . PERSON . ) entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that a court is obliged to decide on further detention of an accused within DATE of his or her indictment ( or submission for its approval of an agreement between the prosecution and the accused on guilt and punishment ) unless it has already decided on detention of the accused under provisions which govern the examination of indictments .", "CARDINAL . The explanatory report to the draft Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE indicates that the above provision accentuates the judicial control of a person \u2019s detention following his or her indictment and that the amendment is also in reaction to ORG judgment ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
