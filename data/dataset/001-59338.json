The principal detention facilities at ORG were situated on the CARDINALth floor of the ORG building . They consisted of CARDINAL cells divided into CARDINAL sections . The cells measured CARDINAL mCARDINAL , and were equipped with fixed benches for rest / sleeping purposes ; the lighting was adequate , as would be the ventilation in the absence of overcrowding .
