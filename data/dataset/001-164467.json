On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office rejected the applicant \u2019s request for criminal proceedings to be instituted against CARDINAL KECU officers who had taken part in the search of his office , car and garage and had seized his property . It was noted in the relevant decision , in particular , that the police officers had not \u201c searched \u201d but \u201c inspected \u201d the applicant \u2019s office and other sites . The inspection had been lawful , as it had been carried out in the police ORG competence to carry out investigative and operational activities for the purpose of crime detection within the meaning of GPE On operational and investigative activities \u201d and with the applicant \u2019s and his wife \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against ORG of the Kyiv Police with ORG . Initially referring to LAW DATE in force at the material time , he alleged , in particular , that the inspection of his office and search and seizure of his property in DATE , as well as the institution of criminal proceedings on DATE had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In court the applicant reformulated his claims . Referring to Article CARDINAL of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) he contended that there had been no lawful grounds for instituting the criminal proceedings concerning the suspected breach of copyright . He requested that the investigator \u2019s decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) be set aside . In this respect the applicant submitted , in particular , that on DATE KECU officers had conducted an arbitrary search and seizure of his property without a court warrant or any other lawful grounds for taking such actions . The applicant argued that there was no reason to suspect that a crime had been committed justifying the search and seizure of his belongings ; that , in breach of the applicable law , the measures had been taken at TIME - time ; that the same people had been appointed as lay witnesses for all CARDINAL sites , which had been inspected all at the same time ; and that following the institution of the criminal proceedings he had not been summoned to participate in any investigative activities . The proceedings at issue had been instituted in bad faith , to prevent him from recovering his seized property and to cover up the unlawful conduct of the KECU .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that LAW of the ORG ( not Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure DATE ) was the appropriate provision for examining the applicant \u2019s allegations . It rejected them , finding that the applicant lacked standing to bring the proceedings . In particular , the disputed criminal case had been instituted \u201c into the matter \u201d rather than \u201c against the applicant \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below quoting LAW of LAW ) , who had neither been a formal suspect nor a defendant in the proceedings at issue . He could not therefore claim that his rights had been breached by the institution of the proceedings . As regards his complaints concerning the allegedly unlawful actions of the police , in accordance with LAW of LAW , these complaints could be brought only within the framework of the above - mentioned criminal case and fell to be examined by the court which would try that case , during either the preliminary hearing or trial .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , stating in particular that he had been a de facto suspect in the proceedings at issue . As he had been denied formal status as a suspect , he could not defend himself properly . In addition , as the proceedings had been artificially protracted , he had been deprived of the opportunity to reclaim his seized property pending resolution of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision and decided to discontinue the proceedings . Like the lower court , it considered that the applicant had no standing to bring the proceedings at issue and , more generally , that the actions of the police authority complained of could only be challenged before the court examining the criminal case , after the relevant investigation had been completed and the case transferred to the court for examination . In these circumstances , rather than rejecting the applicant \u2019s complaints on the merits , the proceedings had to be discontinued .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE quashed the previous decisions and remitted the case to the lower courts for fresh consideration . It noted , in particular , that on DATE ORG had found that the provisions of LAW of the ORG , which had made it impossible to appeal separately against decisions of investigative authorities concerning the institution of criminal proceedings , were unconstitutional ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The foregoing ruling also meant that courts should likewise admit for consideration complaints about other procedural actions , decisions or inaction on the part of investigative authorities , which could result in irreparable or grave damage to an individual \u2019s constitutional rights if their judicial review were to be delayed . ORG further noted that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that the applicant had been substantially affected by the criminal proceedings at issue \u2013 in particular , with regard to the search of his LOC and the seizure and retention of his belongings . It stated that the proceedings appeared to be protracted without any justification and instructed the lower courts to verify whether the conduct of the investigative authorities could indicate ulterior motives aimed at concealing unlawful actions on their part .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s complaint and revoked the decision of DATE . Regard being had to the grounds for taking that decision , the proceedings should have been instituted against the applicant , who had been a de facto suspect in relation to breach of copyright . Institution of the proceedings \u201c into the matter \u201d without indicating a specific defendant had been artificial and had restricted the applicant \u2019s procedural rights . The police ORG actions which had led to the institution of the proceedings had been tainted by procedural breaches , regard being had , in particular , to the unjustified inspection of the LOC at TIME - time in the absence of the flat owner ( the applicant \u2019s mother ) , as well as various other procedural violations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE prosecutor \u2019s office appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed ORG decision and remitted the criminal case concerning the suspected breach of copyright to it for further investigation . By assessing the lawfulness of the investigative actions , ORG had in fact touched upon the admissibility of evidence , a matter which could only be examined in the course of a criminal trial . It further found that by instituting the criminal proceedings \u201c into the matter \u201d rather than \u201c against the applicant \u201d , the police had not caused irreparable damage to the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights such as would necessitate the setting aside of their decision by way of judicial proceedings . Any irregularities in the formulation of the decision to institute criminal proceedings could be more appropriately addressed by the prosecution authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , alleging in particular that ORG had breached procedural rules in admitting the appeal of the prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Justice PERSON of ORG refused to consider the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal on points of law , stating that ORG lacked jurisdiction over the decisions taken by ORG in the relevant matters , unless they concerned the termination of proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "8", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
