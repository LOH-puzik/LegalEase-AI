They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants and their CARDINAL children entered GPE on DATE without any travel / identification papers and requested asylum in that while they were living in the village GPE in GPE in DATE NORP men subjected them to a violent assault which included rape of the women . The applicants succeeded in fleeing to GPE and thereon to GPE .", "On DATE ORG ) refused to grant the applicants asylum , a decision which was upheld on appeal by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . Both instances found it established that the applicants and their children had been subjected to serious violence in DATE , but found that the assault should be seen , not so much as a result of the applicants being NORP , but in connection with the situation at the relevant time in GPE . In this respect it was recalled that under the mandate of ORG , the ORG - led international ORG , ORG , being responsible for establishing and maintaining security in GPE , on DATE intervened in the conflict between NORP and NORP forces , and that subsequent thereto , for a short while , NORP armed groups took over specific areas .", "ORG stated in addition , that presently the general security situation as to NORP in GPE had improved according to inter alia ORG \u2019s position paper of DATE , background no . CARDINAL , and ORG \u2019s and ORG \u2019s report on ethnic minorities , background no . CARDINAL .", "Finally , although finding it established that the applicants were affected by their experiences to the detriment of their mental health , ORG did not find that a concrete danger existed that they would be subjected to assaults if returned . They were ordered to leave the country immediately .", "On DATE the applicants applied ORG ( PERSON for PERSON , ORG ) for a residence permit either on humanitarian grounds pursuant to section CARDINAL b of LAW ( PERSON ) or in the alternative due to extraordinary circumstances pursuant to section CARDINAL c of LAW . In support of their application they submitted statements by doctors from which it appeared inter alia that the first applicant had been ill for DATE , notably suffering from chronic headache ; that he was suffering from ORG ( PTSD ) ; that he had received treatment by a psychiatrist and a psychologist , and that he was taking antidepressive medication . Moreover , according to a statement of DATE by a psychologist , the first applicant had expressed thoughts of suicide in case he would be returned to GPE . With regard to the second applicant it appeared inter alia that she had received treatment by a psychologist and that she was taking tranquillizers .", "By decision of DATE ORG refused to grant the applicants a residence permit pursuant to section CARDINAL b of LAW since they did not suffer from a very serious physical or mental illness , which could justify the granting of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . Moreover , the Ministry noted that in general the fact that a person had expressed contemplation of suicide was insufficient to fulfil the criteria under LAW b of LAW . In addition , it had not been established that the first applicant was suffering from a mental illness , which according to a concrete medical assessment entailed a significant risk that he would commit suicide . The applicants were ordered to leave the country without delay .", "By decision of DATE ORG refused to grant the applicants a residence permit pursuant to LAW CARDINAL c of LAW finding that no extraordinary circumstances existed . The applicants did not appeal against the decision to ORG .", "LAW and GPE in GPE .", "", "According to information provided by the Government , in DATE GPE evacuated a total of CARDINAL GPE , which were selected together with ORG . The applicants in the present case were not among those evacuees . They entered GPE themselves in DATE . A \u201c FAC \u201d of DATE created the legal basis at domestic level for receiving displaced persons from GPE with a need for temporary protection . The LAW was repealed in DATE . At the same time a provision was inserted in LAW introducing the possibility of granting a residence permit to distressed persons from GPE assumed to need temporary protection ( now section CARDINAL e ( CARDINAL ) ) . A precondition for obtaining a residence permit under this provision is that the person in question must be assumed to need temporary protection in GPE and formerly held a residence permit pursuant to the \u201c GPE Emergency Act \u201d or has been registered as an asylum - seeker before DATE . The assessment whether applicants are eligible for a residence permit under section CARDINAL e ( CARDINAL ) of LAW is made on the basis of ORG recommendations . Thus , in accordance with the ORG recommendations it is possible to issue residence permits under LAW ) to persons - who formerly held a residence permit under LAW or who applied for asylum before DATE \u2013 and who can be referred to CARDINAL of the categories of \u201c chronically ill persons whose conditions requires specialised medical intervention of a type not yet available in GPE \u201d ; \u201c Persons with severe and chronic mental illness whose conditions requires specialised medical intervention of a type not yet available in GPE \u201d ; \u201c Severely handicapped persons ( including their caregivers ) whose wellbeing depends on a specialised support system not yet available in GPE \u201d ; \u201c Unaccompanied elderly persons who have no relatives or any other form of societal support in GPE \u201d ; and \u201c Separated children without relatives or caregivers in GPE , and for whom it is found not to be in the best interest to return to GPE \u201d . AppCARDINALications for a residence permit under section CARDINAL e ( CARDINAL ) of LAW are determined in the first instance by ORG and in the second instance by ORG .", "The applicants in the present case are not covered by section CARDINAL CARDINAL ( e ) of LAW because they never held a residence permit under the \u201c GPE Emergency Act \u201d and they entered GPE after DATE . However - like asylum - seekers from other countries \u2013 they had the possibility of applying for asylum pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds pursuant to section CARDINAL b of the LAW , or for a residence permit due to extraordinary circumstances pursuant to section CARDINAL c of the Act .", "Asylum is granted to aliens , who satisfy the conditions of LAW . Applications for asylum are determined in the first instance by ORG and in the second instance by ORG , which is an independent quasi - judicial body that is not subject to any instructions from ORG . Thus , ORG has no authority to decide applications for asylum . ORG are included in the background material of the asylum authorities in connection with the determination of concrete asylum cases .", "The granting of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds pursuant to section CARDINAL b of the LAW is a discretionary decision , which according to practice may be granted to persons who do not satisfy the conditions of LAW , but who is suffering from very severe physical or mental illness ( unless the possibility of receiving the requisite medical assistance exists in the applicant \u2019s country of origin ) . Applications for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds cf . section CARDINAL b ( CARDINAL ) are determined by ORG .", "A residence permit may be granted pursuant to section CARDINAL c of LAW on a discretionary basis , if due to extraordinary circumstances , there are strong grounds for granting such . AppCARDINALications for a residence permit under this section of the LAW are determined in the first instance by ORG and in the second instance by ORG .", "According to LAW an alien whose application for a residence permit for GPE has been refused must leave the country . Furthermore , under LAW it is possible to provide financial assistance if the person in question returns without undue delay voluntary .", "In connection with the forced return of aliens from GPE , UNMIK ( ORG in GPE ) is the relevant partner . In every case there is a close dialogue between the NORP National Commissioner of Police and UNMIK . Firstly the NORP National Commissioner of Police notifies UNMIK about the return to GPE of GPE whose applications for a residence permit in GPE have been refused . Such notifications state the time of the individual \u2019s departure from GPE and entry into GPE and inform of decisions made by the NORP authorities and the individual \u2019s personal situation , including his or her home town in GPE , the languages mastered by the individual and where his or her family members are staying . It also appears from the notification if the individual has been expelled due to crime . The notifications also state particulars on the individual \u2019s health status . This notification procedure was first established at a meeting held in GPE from CARDINAL to DATE between officials of ORG , ORG and UNMIK . The notification procedure was confirmed and expanded at a meeting in GPE on DATE between a delegation of high officials from the immigration authorities and UNMIK , who agreed that UNMIK will be provided with extended information , especially concerning the mental status of GPE who are non - voluntarily sent back to GPE in order to support UNMIK in its efforts to solve its task . Such information will be available to UNMIK by offering the GPE in question a voluntary medical status report prior to the return to GPE . ORG Commissioner of Police has presented to UNMIK a number of PERSON whose applications for a residence permit in GPE have been refused for which reason they have had to leave GPE . In some cases PERSON objected to the return of the persons in question . In such situations the NORP National Commissioner of Police has suspended the return until further notice .", "In the present case , the NORP National Commissioner of Police has not yet contacted UNMIK because the forced return of the applicants has not been planned yet . Normally a forced return takes quite some time , not CARDINAL or three months .", "Relevant international materials", "With regard to the current security situation in GPE , the following statements/ findings are of particular relevance :", "The Secretary General on ORG in GPE stated in his report of DATE covering the activities of UNMIK and the developments in GPE , GPE , and GPE among other things that given the continued violence , harassment and discrimination faced by minorities , achieving sustainable minority returns to GPE was difficult , time - consuming and resource - intensive ;", "In his report of DATE he stated inter alia that incidents of violence and crimes against minorities continued to be a cause for concern within GPE ;", "In his report of DATE he stated inter alia that despite setbacks resulting from recent violent incidents involving GPE NORP victims , the overall rate of returns continued to accelerate during the reporting period . Over CARDINAL displaced persons had returned so far that year to areas where they were a minority ( including CARDINAL ORG , CARDINAL ORG NORP , CARDINAL NORP , CARDINAL PERSON and CARDINAL GPE NORP ) . Funding expected from several major donors had been provided in GPE and work on a number of returns projects had begun in earnest , including the return of GPE NORP to GPE ( NORP region ) and LOC ( NORP region ) , and ORG / NORP returns to PERSON ( GPE ) and GPE town . The heightened level of security within ORG and other minority communities had not resulted in the cancelling of any returns project , but it had led to numerous postponements of returns activities , at a stage in DATE where such delays may mean that returns are not possible until DATE . It was also considered likely to have a dampening effect on ORG return .", "The Tenth Assessment of the Situation of Ethnic Minorities in GPE of DATE , conducted jointly by ORG and the ORG , stated that minorities continue to face varying degrees of harassment , intimidation and provocation , as well as limited freedom of movement , and that considering the overall situation described in the report , the changes noted during the reporting period were not yet fundamental enough to conclude that conditions would exist for large scale return of ethnic minorities in the near future , underscoring the continuing need for international protection for members of ethnic communities , in particular GPE NORP , GPE and NORP ;", "The UNHCR Position Paper on the continued Protection Needs of individuals from GPE of DATE stated that especially GPE NORP and GPE , but also GPE and NORP should continue to benefit from international protection in countries of asylum . ORG stressed that return of these minorities should take place on a strictly voluntary basis and be based on fully informed individual decisions . Any such voluntary return movements should be properly coordinated , and re - integration should be supported through assistance to ensure sustainability . ORG , GPE and NORP individuals or families should not be forced or induced to return to GPE .", "The First Vice - President of ORG on LAW , recommended in his mission report of DATE \u201c ORG and GPE \u201d for ORG , inter alia that GPE asylum seeker / returnees ( from LOC ) , who fled GPE , should not be returned to GPE unless they wish to return and they are advised by PERSON and UNCHR that it is safe for them personally to return to their homes , and", "In its report of DATE and GPE ( GPE ) \u201c Prisoners in our own homes \u201d : ORG concerns for the human rights of minorities in GPE - Amnesty International urged inter alia host countries not to end international protection for all minority refugees from GPE and ensure that refugees still in need of protection were not subject in any way to pressure or inducement to \u201c voluntarily return \u201d . ORG considered that the forcible return of members of minority groups to GPE would be a violation of the principle of non - refoulement and place minority individuals at risk .", "It follows from a \u201c Memorandum of Understanding \u201d between the Federal Minister of the Interior of GPE and GPE the Secretary - General of ORG for GPE of DATE that CARDINAL members of ethnic minorities from GPE are required to leave GPE . It was agreed that certain members of specific ethnic minority groups were no longer in need of international protection and could therefore be returned to GPE , as from DATE . In DATE GPE would return CARDINAL persons . This figure would include members of the NORP , NORP , PERSON and GPE minority communities , as well as GPE and NORP minorities . As to the latter CARDINAL groups of minorities , they would be returned depending on the results of an individualised screening process performed by UNMIK .
