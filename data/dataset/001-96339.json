The investigation was assigned to the LOC prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the investigation was discontinued for a lack of indications of a criminal offence .

The trial court took testimony from a neighbourhood resident , the janitors PERSON and PERSON , ambulance doctors PERSON and PERSON . , who described the circumstances in which they had discovered the applicant and Mr N. The senior operational officer PERSON , who had been on duty at the PERSON police station on TIME to DATE , stated that no telephone call concerning CARDINAL young men on FAC had been recorded in the log . However , he had been replaced for TIME by the officer Mr Vancharin .

The officer Mr Vancharin confirmed that he had taken a call concerning the young men but had not recorded it in the log because it had not been placed through the emergency line . He had radioed to the patrol officers from the private - security department and told them to verify the information . They reported back that they had found CARDINAL drunk men and that the situation was under control . In response , he instructed them to continue patrolling . The security co - ordinator testified to the court that at TIME he had received an alarm signal and had dispatched the officers PERSON and PERSON to check it out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted both police officers , having made the following assessment of the evidence :", "\u201c ... [ T]he court considers that it has not been shown that the defendants PERSON and PERSON acted in the knowledge of the fact that [ the applicant and his friend ] were in a state that was dangerous for their life and health because they could not know it , as they only spent TIME on the scene in the night time and as no injuries were visible . They decided that [ the applicant and his friend ] were in a state of alcohol or drug intoxication ...", "In support of their claim that Mr PERSON and PERSON made a false report [ to the officer - on - duty ] the prosecution referred only to the testimony by the witness Mr Vancharin , who was a police officer but who was not authorised to take any reports . However , he was replacing the officer - on - duty , in breach of the regulations of the LOC police station ...", "Upon receipt of such information , an officer - on - duty has an obligation to record it in the registration log , to check it and to record the results of the check . The court considers that the officer - on - duty , upon receiving information from PERSON and PERSON that the situation was under control , was required to verify it and obtain credible information about the situation . Mr Vancharin , however , did not do that and did not relay that information or the results of the check to the actual officer - on - duty ... The court therefore lends credence to the testimony by PERSON and PERSON ... because in these circumstances Mr Vancharin had no interest in telling the truth . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal in a summary fashion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief medical officer of the emergency care unit informed the applicant \u2019s mother that an internal inquiry had established that the ambulance doctor had diagnosed the applicant on the basis of his friend \u2019s statements .

Further to a complaint by the applicant \u2019s mother , on DATE the first deputy to the GPE prosecutor cancelled the decision of DATE , by which the institution of criminal proceedings had been refused , and instructed LOC prosecutor to open a criminal investigation into the offence under LAW of LAW ( failure to render medical assistance to a patient resulting in grave damage to his health ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a composite medical study was commissioned for the purpose of determining whether the applicant \u2019s health could have been harmed by belated and inadequate medical treatment at Hospital no .

On DATE the investigator PERSON suspended proceedings because the person responsible could not be identified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the experts\u2019 panel returned their findings based on the applicant \u2019s medical record ( no . DATE ) from Hospital no . CARDINAL , materials of the criminal case and information from attending physicians . The experts found , in particular , that an incomplete and contradictory description of the applicant \u2019s injuries upon his arrival at Hospital no . CARDINAL made it impossible to determine the exact origin , time and cause of his injuries . It could only be established that he had been hit on the head with a heavy blunt object . Moreover , a subsequent examination at ORG revealed CARDINAL broken thoracic vertebrae which had gone unnoticed at Hospital no . CARDINAL , where an X - ray examination had been indicated but never carried out .", "CARDINAL . The experts determined that , given the grave condition in which the applicant had been admitted , he should have been examined immediately by a neurosurgeon and other specialists for differential diagnosis of craniocerebral injury and intoxication and for decisions on urgent treatment . However , a neurosurgeon examined the applicant TIME later upon his arrival and in the following TIME no specialists saw him and no medical tests , not even the basic blood and urine tests , were carried out . Even the applicant \u2019s temperature was not taken . The experts determined as follows :", "\u201c From the moment of arrival ( at TIME on DATE ) and until the beginning of preparation for surgery ( at TIME on DATE ) the [ applicant ] was not adequately and objectively examined , the real clinical diagnosis was not made ... and appropriate medical treatment was not indicated ... Prolonged passive observation of the [ applicant ] not accompanied by clinical examination led to drastic deterioration of his condition and , as a consequence , to belated surgical intervention not based on clinical and lab tests which resulted in markedly negative post - traumatic and post - surgery complications for the [ applicant ] ...", "In the post - surgery period antibacterial treatment was indicated but given inconsistently and without appropriate supervision which , most likely , pre - determined subsequent development of CARDINAL inflammation of post - operative wounds , arachnoid membranes and medullary substances , osteomyelitis of the right parietal bone , etc ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The experts also noted that there had been no objective basis for diagnosing the applicant with alcohol intoxication . Neither the ambulance doctor in his notes nor his colleagues in subsequent entries in the medical record mentioned alcohol breath . A reference to alcohol breath appeared for the first time in the partly illegible and incomplete report of a medical examination of DATE . However , that examination was carried out in breach of the applicable regulations . No treatment for intoxication was indicated and the intoxication diagnosis did not feature in any other documents . The credibility of the intoxication diagnosis was further undermined by the fact that the amount of alcohol allegedly found in the applicant \u2019s blood would have been lethal .", "CARDINAL . The experts concluded as follows :", "\u201c The extent of damage resulting from the [ applicant \u2019s ] prolonged stay in a medical institution without adequate medical assistance can not be fully ascertained . It can only be asserted that his condition gravely deteriorated during that period and that irreversible brain changes progressed to the point where emergency surgery was required by life - saving indications ...", "The present study identified a number of defects in the medical care dispensed to [ the applicant ] at Hospital no . CARDINAL of GPE \u2013 in particular , unjustified conservative treatment , incomplete examination , belated and incomplete diagnosis , belated surgical intervention , inadequate medical measures \u2013 which failed to arrest development of the grave post - traumatic process and contributed to an unfavourable outcome and the [ applicant \u2019s ] disability . However , it is not possible to measure the extent to which these defects affected the outcome because appropriate measurement methods do not exist . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In their view , at the moment of the applicant \u2019s admission to Hospital no . CARDINAL , no urgent surgery was required . The hematoma was allowed to grow over a period of time under constant supervision by medical specialists who awaited the most propitious moment for brain surgery .
