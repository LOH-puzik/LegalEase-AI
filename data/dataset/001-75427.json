POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the Court by Mr P. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr J. GPE , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant suffers from severe dysfunction of the limbs and is confined to a wheelchair .", "On DATE the applicant was driven by his mother to a polling station in GPE where he intended to vote in the elections to municipal and district councils and provincial assemblies ( wybory do rad gmin , rad powiat\u00f3w i sejmik\u00f3w wojew\u00f3dztw ) . The applicant \u2019s mother asked the Chairman of ORG to either show her how the applicant , who was waiting in his wheelchair outside the station , could enter it or hand a ballot paper to him . The chairman informed the applicant \u2019s mother that the applicant could not cast his vote because it was not permitted to take ballot papers outside the LOC of the polling station and the chairman was not going to carry the applicant inside the station . The applicant returned home without casting his vote .", "At TIME on DATE , i.e. TIME before the polling stations closed , the applicant telephoned ORG ( PERSON ) and protested about the refusal to allow him to vote . He also asked for help in casting his vote . However , the applicant was informed that ORG acted in conformity with the PERSON of DATE on ORG , ORG ( ORG wyborcza do rad gmin , rad powiat\u00f3w i sejmik\u00f3w wojew\u00f3dztw ) ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) and advised to arrange for assistance in entering the LOC of the polling station .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an electoral complaint ( protest wyborczy ) with ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) . He submitted that he had been unlawfully deprived of his right to vote . The applicant pointed out that getting to the polling station had required substantial effort on his part , the assistance of other persons and certain expenses . He ended his submissions with the following statement :", "\u201c I would like to stress that the only way I could have been carried in was on a stretcher ( which was not available ) and anyway no handicapped person would have agreed to that because of the feeling of embarrassment . Carrying me upstairs in a wheelchair was also impossible as [ my ] battery - powered wheelchair weighed , together with myself , QUANTITY and was not portable .", "As the number of physically handicapped persons in GPE is CARDINAL , one can assume that my case was not isolated and that making it impossible for handicapped persons to vote by not preparing polling stations for them could have had a fundamental impact on the turnout and the results of the elections . \u201d", "In a letter of DATE ORG asked the applicant whether his complaint concerned the validity of the elections or whether he requested amendments to the relevant law .", "On DATE the applicant informed ORG that his electoral complaint resulted from the fact that he had been deprived of his right to vote in the elections held on DATE . The applicant referred to section CARDINAL of LAW , which stated that every NORP citizen had a right to vote .", "On DATE ORG refused to consider the applicant \u2019s electoral complaint . The court was of the view that it did not fall within \u201c the scope of the subject matter \u201d of an electoral complaint . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) .", "On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal , quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case to ORG .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the electoral complaint lodged by the applicant . The court observed that the applicant had assumed that a ballot paper would be handed to him and cast by his mother . However , he had been advised by the Chairman of ORG and ORG that this was not permissible under LAW . Moreover , the applicant had not considered the possibility of entering the polling station with the assistance of third persons on a stretcher or in a wheelchair as he had felt that it would have been embarrassing and degrading for him . The court further considered that :", "\u201c The complainant \u2019s general claim that \u2018 the organisers of the elections\u2019 should have provided him with the possibility of entering the polling station ... does not fall within the legal scope of an electoral complaint ... since none of the provisions of LAW imposes such an obligation on the electoral commissions \u2013 on the contrary , section CARDINAL of the LAW excludes such help .", "Each disability is in itself restricting in different fields of private and public life . It makes it difficult for a handicapped citizen to enjoy his rights . The public authorities are not in position to eliminate all those difficulties . [ There ] is no statutory or higher provision requiring such [ elimination ] \u2013 even if those provisions concern handicapped persons ( LAW and LAW ... which is part of our legal system , and LAW .", "The complainant was aware of his disability and therefore had a special duty to acquaint himself with his rights and the restrictions under LAW before the date of the elections . Ignorance of DATE in particular one so important \u2013 can not excuse anybody . If the complainant had known the law , he would not have expected that it would be breached in order to allow him to vote . He would have taken steps to obtain the assistance of third persons in casting his vote .... As pointed out above , a disability is always a restriction . Therefore , the complainant \u2019s argument that he did not consider the possibility of being carried by third persons to the polling station because it would have been embarrassing for him can not justify his claim that he could not vote for reasons beyond his control . Since the complainant was put in DATE probably by third persons DATE he could have been carried by those persons , for instance in a chair .... \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . In his appeal the applicant submitted that :", "\u201c Participation in the elections was the only purpose of my presence at the polling station .... I was not aware of the details of LAW , and I thought that I would be able to vote in the way I had done before ( i.e. ballot papers are handed to me under the stairs , I mark them and a member of my family puts them into the ballot box ) . However , this time it turned out that casting a vote by a disabled person would be considered as a violation of the electoral law . ...", "ORG did not take into consideration my good will and my positive civic attitude and indicated several additional solutions that should have been undertaken by me . [ The court ] tried to establish that I could , and should , have solved all those problems by myself . ... Under section CARDINAL of LAW \u201c ... every NORP citizen has a right to vote ... \u201d . [ It ] does not impose on the disabled any additional obligations which should be fulfilled before ... entering a polling station .", "I do not know of any institution that would offer \u201c election services \u201d with a stretcher . ... Using a stretcher in the way suggested by the court would make the voting grotesque .", "In suggesting that the problem could have been solved with the assistance of third persons , the court did not take into account the fact that such persons could have refused help , or that they might not have managed to help ( even using a chair - because of the significant degree of my disability ... ) , or that there could have been a risk of injuries for those who helped and those who were being helped , or that there could have been no people around to help . The standard solution in similar cases is to provide a ramp or a lift .... Even in the case of the polling station in question , it would have been possible to prepare such a ramp at small ( when compared with the electoral campaign ) financial cost .", "I have read several times with disbelief the reasoning of ORG judgment which states that \u2018 each disability is in itself restricting in different fields of private and public life . It makes it difficult for a handicapped citizen to enjoy his rights\u2019 . I think that this odd reasoning ... compromises the institution which protects social justice . By giving such reasoning ORG outlined the position of a disabled person in NORP society . With reasoning like this one can deprive disabled persons of several other civic rights . It contradicts the perception of disability in all other democratic countries . The question arises here : can criminal law , tax law or traffic regulations also be applied to a limited extent in the case of a disabled person ?", "The NORP State imposes on its citizens a number of obligations .... In return it gives every citizen a right to vote and in this way the possibility of having an influence on public life . It is the fundamental right in democratic states and that is what democracy is all about . ... \u201d", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The appellate court agreed with ORG conclusion that the applicant \u2019s case did not disclose a breach of LAW .", "LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
