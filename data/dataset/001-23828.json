ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant was the owner of a bus capable of transporting QUANTITY persons . On DATE the applicant hired his vehicle for DATE to PERSON , a company which was authorised under the rental agreement to take passengers to GPE and all countries of LOC and LOC . L. further undertook to comply with \u201c all limits and prohibitions imposed by NORP and international legislation \u201d .", "On DATE the drivers of the bus , X and Y , were arrested in ORG ) while illegally transporting CARDINAL clandestine immigrants of NORP nationality . The applicant \u2019s bus was seized and was entrusted to a security guard .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG imposed on X and Y a sentence , negotiated with the prosecution , of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended . Under LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , as amended by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , the court ordered the confiscation of the bus .", "On DATE the applicant requested the return of his vehicle . He pleaded his good faith , declaring that he was not aware of the fact that X and Y had used his bus to commit an offence .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application . It observed that in the light of the principles of the LAW and by analogy with what was provided in the general provision on confiscation ( LAW ) LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE was to be interpreted as excluding any deprivation of property where the object seized belonged to a person not linked to the offence ( se la cosa appartiene a persona estranea PERSON ) . It noted that in the case concerned the applicant had produced documents establishing that he was the owner of the bus seized . However , he had not duly proved his good faith , since there was at least a doubt about his participation in the offence committed by NORP and Y. In that connection ORG noted that the rental agreement between the applicant and PERSON indicated that the bus was to be used \u201c to take passengers abroad \u201d , a fact which did not exclude the possibility that the owner was aware that the vehicle might be used for unlawful purposes . Moreover , CARDINAL dates ( DATE and DATE ) appeared at the end of the document , so that it could not be asserted with certainty that the agreement had existed before the date of the offence ( DATE ) . Lastly , the applicant had not proved that vehicle hire was part of his normal occupation . In view of the use that had been made of it , ORG considered that the vehicle \u2019s availability constituted a danger , and that justified its confiscation .", "On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law . He argued in particular that ORG had wrongly reversed the burden of proof , obliging him to establish that he did not know about the unlawful use of his bus , with any doubt working to his detriment .", "On DATE the applicant asked the President of ORG to stay the destruction of his bus pending the decision of ORG . That application was allowed on DATE .", "In a judgment of DATE , deposited with its registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It observed that a person who had obtained pecuniary advantages as a result of the commission of an offence could not be considered to have had nothing to do with it ( estraneo PERSON ) . However , the case - law of the plenary division of ORG protected \u201c non - wrongful trust \u201d ( affidamento incolpevole ) and affirmed the principle that the owner of the confiscated object could always prove his good faith by establishing that by exercising the diligence normally required in such matters he could not have known that his property was to be used illegally , and that he had done everything in his power to prevent such use . But ORG had correctly taken the view that the applicant had not adduced the evidence in question , regard being had in addition to the fact that the local situation , characterised by frequent cases of clandestine immigration , called for special diligence on the part of the owner of a vehicle intended to take passengers abroad .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s bus was destroyed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
