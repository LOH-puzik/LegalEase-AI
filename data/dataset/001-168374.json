He had not seen the motorcycle before the collision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police investigator examined the scene of the accident . The investigator \u2019s report indicated that the accident had occurred on DATE , on a straight paved road which had been dry . It described the location of the applicant \u2019s motorcycle and ORG \u2019s car as they had been found after the accident , as well as the presence of skid marks and fragments of glass and plastic on the road .

The examination detected no traces of alcohol in the blood of either of them .", "CARDINAL .

The examination was carried out by an expert from ORG ( NORP teismo ekspertiz\u0117s centras ) , a governmental institution responsible for carrying out forensic examinations required by courts and other pre - trial investigation bodies . The expert was provided with the sketch of the accident ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and photographs of the CARDINAL vehicles , and asked to determine the location of the collision , to estimate the speed of the motorcycle before the collision , and to establish who had been responsible for the accident . The expert report , delivered on DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the first expert report \u201d ) , stated that the description of the skid marks and the fragments of glass and plastic on the road indicated that the collision had occurred in the right - hand lane . The expert estimated the speed of the motorcycle immediately before the collision as QUANTITY / h and , assuming that the speed limit on that road was QUANTITY , noted that the applicant had exceeded that limit . The expert concluded that the accident had been caused by the applicant because he had been exceeding the speed limit and had started applying his brakes too late to avoid the collision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor instructed the police investigator to carry out a number of additional investigative actions , including :", "\u2212 interviewing the officer who had sketched the accident scene ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in order to determine whether the sketch was accurate and why it had not been signed by the applicant and ORG ;", "\u2212 examining the scene of the accident together with the applicant in order to verify his account of the events leading to the collision ;", "\u2212 finding out whether , at the time of the accident , there were any traffic signs on the road indicating the speed limit , or any restrictions on overtaking ;", "\u2212 additionally questioning an eyewitness who had claimed that following the collision the applicant \u2019s motorcycle had risen up in the air and landed in the right - hand lane , in order to clarify the details of that testimony ; and", "\u2212 questioning another eyewitness identified by the applicant \u2019s mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother , PERSON , whom the applicant had authorised to act on his behalf , complained to the district prosecutor that the pre - trial investigation was being carried out slowly and ineffectively . She claimed that the sketch of the accident was inaccurate , as proven by the absence of the ORG signatures . She also complained that the investigators had not questioned all the eyewitnesses to the accident and had not eliminated the contradictions between different testimonies . PERSON further complained that the questions of the applicant \u2019s lawyer had not been forwarded to the expert examining the circumstances of the accident ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Lastly , she complained that the prosecutor had sent that expert \u2019s report to the wrong address , so she and the applicant had not received it . PERSON asked the court to change the investigator in charge of the pre - trial investigation and to ensure that essential investigative measures were carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor upheld PERSON \u2019s complaint . The pre - trial investigation was transferred to a different investigator within ORG and the investigator was instructed to carry out the investigative measures requested by PERSON As to the forensic expert \u2019s report , the prosecutor informed PERSON that the questions to be submitted to the expert had been approved by a court decision , which the applicant had not challenged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor notified ORG that the newly appointed investigator was conducting the pre - trial investigation \u201c in a sluggish manner \u201d ( vangiai ) , contrary to the requirement to complete it in the shortest possible time .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the police investigator carried out the additional investigative measures ordered by the district prosecutor ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to PERSON \u2019s complaint , the district prosecutor informed her that the police officer who had drawn up the sketch of the accident had been questioned and confirmed its accuracy , so there were no grounds to suspect that the sketch had been falsified . The prosecutor also noted that an internal inquiry had been opened concerning the absence of the ORG signatures on the sketch of the accident .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in his order to ORG the district prosecutor pointed out that the absence of the ORG signatures on the sketch had given PERSON legitimate doubts as to its accuracy , and asked the police to look into the ORG actions when drawing up the sketch . On CARDINAL DATE the inquiry found that the police investigator who had carried out the initial investigative measures and who had been responsible for ensuring that the drivers signed the sketch had not performed her duties properly . However , the investigator was not given a disciplinary penalty because DATE had passed since the breach and she was no longer working in the interior affairs system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL PERSON complained to ORG that the district prosecutor was not properly supervising the pre - trial investigation , which was slow and ineffective . She raised similar complaints to those she had raised before ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and asked for the removal of the prosecutor who had been in charge of supervising the investigation . On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s complaint , finding no serious breaches in the prosecutor \u2019s actions . ORG also held that although the prosecutor had sent some documents to an incorrect address , those same documents had also been sent to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , so the applicant had in fact received them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC ordered an additional forensic examination of the circumstances of the accident . The examination was carried out by the same expert from ORG as before ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The expert report , delivered on DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the second expert report \u201d ) , did not make a fresh estimate of the speed of the applicant \u2019s motorcycle but relied on the findings of the first expert report and considered that the applicant had been travelling at a speed of QUANTITY . It found that the speed limit at the location of the accident had been QUANTITY / h and not QUANTITY / h , as assumed in the first expert report , which nonetheless meant that the applicant had exceeded the speed limit . Having examined the sketch of the accident and the damage to both vehicles , the second report confirmed the conclusion of the first report that the collision had occurred in the righthand lane , while the motorcycle was moving into it from the left - hand lane . It found no data indicating that ORG had been driving at speeds in excess of the speed limit or that he had done anything which might have caused the accident . The report concluded that the accident had been caused by the applicant : the main cause had not been the speed of the motorcycle but the difference between the speed of the CARDINAL vehicles , and the fact that the applicant had not started to brake in time to avoid the collision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor discontinued the pre - trial investigation on the grounds that ORG \u2019s actions had not amounted to a crime as provided for by LAW . PERSON appealed against that decision before a senior prosecutor , arguing that the investigation had been biased and incomplete . She stressed in particular that the sketch of the accident had been inaccurate , as proven by the absence of the ORG signatures ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . She also submitted that the prosecutor had disregarded the testimonies of some eyewitnesses that the collision had occurred in the left - hand lane and that it had caused the applicant \u2019s motorcycle to rise up in the air and land in the other lane ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Her appeal , however , was dismissed . The senior prosecutor pointed out that CARDINAL expert reports had concluded that the accident had been caused not by ORG but by the applicant himself , and that the testimonies of several eyewitnesses had confirmed that conclusion .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed before LAW . She again argued that the sketch of the accident was inaccurate , as proven by the absence of the LAW signatures . She also submitted an opinion by a specialist in the field of road traffic accidents , issued at GPE \u2019s request on DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the specialist \u2019s opinion \u201d ) , which had concluded that although both the applicant and ORG had exceeded the speed limit , that fact had not been the cause of the accident . The specialist considered that the accident had occurred in the left - hand lane and that it had been caused by ORG suddenly entering that lane \u2013 despite the applicant \u2019s attempts to brake and slow down , it had not been objectively possible for him to avoid the collision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vilnius City ORG upheld PERSON \u2019s appeal and reopened the pre - trial investigation . The court noted the contradictory findings of the expert reports on CARDINAL hand and the specialist \u2019s opinion on the other hand , and considered that it was necessary to conduct a fresh forensic examination by a different expert in order to eliminate those contradictions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police investigator ordered a fresh examination of the circumstances of the accident . The examination was carried out by a different expert from ORG . In his report , delivered on CARDINAL DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the third expert report \u201d ) , the expert examined the sketch of the accident and photographs of the CARDINAL vehicles , and estimated that immediately before the collision the applicant had been travelling at a speed of QUANTITY , and that it was not possible to determine the speed at which ORG had been driving . The report also stated that the motorcycle had hit the right side of the car , so even if , as claimed by the applicant , the car had entered the left - hand lane suddenly and unexpectedly , that would not have caused the collision , which had occurred in the right - hand lane . The report concluded that the accident had been caused by the applicant , who had exceeded the speed limit and had not slowed down in time to avoid the collision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor discontinued the pre - trial investigation on the grounds that ORG \u2019s actions had not amounted to the crime stipulated in LAW . On DATE a senior prosecutor upheld that decision , noting that the third expert report had confirmed that the accident had been caused by the actions of the applicant and not of ORG", "CARDINAL . PERSON lodged an appeal with LAW , submitting that the third expert report was inaccurate , in particular because it concluded that the collision had occurred in the right - hand lane , which was contrary to the material in the case file . She also submitted that the third expert report had not refuted the conclusions of the specialist \u2019s opinion . PERSON further argued that the testimonies of some eyewitnesses had clearly demonstrated that the accident had been caused by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , but they had not been properly considered by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE City ORG upheld the appeal and reopened the pre - trial investigation . The court held that it was necessary to address the arguments presented in GPE \u2019s appeal and that the third expert report had to be assessed together with the other available evidence , such as reports concerning the location of the accident and eyewitness testimonies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE City ORG ordered a fresh expert examination of the circumstances of the accident . The order was forwarded to ORG on DATE , together with the specialist \u2019s opinion . The examination was carried out by a different expert from ORG . The expert report , delivered on DATE ( hereinafter \u201c the fourth expert report \u201d ) , examined the sketch of the accident and photographs of the CARDINAL vehicles , and estimated that immediately before the collision the applicant had been travelling at a speed of QUANTITY . It found that although it was not possible to estimate the speed at which ORG had been driving , the fact that the motorcycle had hit the back of the car meant that the car had been going slower than the motorcycle . The expert considered that it was not possible to determine the trajectory of the CARDINAL vehicles before the collision . However , even if the applicant \u2019s version was to be believed and ORG \u2019s car had suddenly entered the left - hand lane at a distance of QUANTITY from the applicant \u2019s motorcycle ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) , the applicant could have slowed down and avoided the collision . The fourth expert report concluded that the accident had occurred in the right - hand lane and that it had been caused by the applicant who had exceeded the speed limit and had not slowed down in time to avoid the collision .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the police investigator again questioned the applicant , ORG and some of the eyewitnesses questioned previously .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was informed about the findings of the fourth expert report on DATE . She complained to the district prosecutor that she had not been given the opportunity to submit additional questions to the expert , in particular , whether having collided with the car , the motorcycle could have risen up in the air and landed in a different lane , as claimed by some eyewitnesses ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . PERSON also complained that the expert had relied on low - quality photographs of the motorcycle but had not examined the motorcycle itself , and that the report \u2019s findings had been incorrect . On DATE the district prosecutor upheld PERSON \u2019s complaint and ordered the police investigator to examine the applicant \u2019s motorcycle and to forward PERSON \u2019s questions to the expert who had conducted the fourth examination . On DATE the expert responded that the description of the location of the accident showed that during the collision the motorcycle had not risen up into the air .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor again discontinued the pre - trial investigation on the grounds that ORG \u2019s actions had not amounted to the crime stipulated in LAW . On DATE a senior prosecutor upheld that decision , considering that the fourth expert report had assessed all the material collected during the pre - trial investigation , including the specialist \u2019s opinion , and that PERSON had been given sufficient opportunity to present her questions to the expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE City Second ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by PERSON and upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision . The court considered that expert reports and eyewitness testimonies demonstrated that ORG had entered the left - hand lane within a safe distance from the applicant \u2019s motorcycle , and thus had not violated road traffic safety regulations . Although there had been contradictory eyewitness testimonies as to the exact distance between ORG \u2019s car and the applicant \u2019s motorcycle , the court considered that any doubts had to be interpreted in ORG \u2019s favour . The court also held that the conclusions of the specialist \u2019s opinion that the collision had occurred in the left - hand lane had been contrary to the description of the location of the accident as provided in the sketch ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s decision and reopened the pre - trial investigation . It held that the decision to discontinue the investigation had not been based on a comprehensive assessment of all the collected material but had relied exclusively on evidence favourable to ORG , disregarding the applicant \u2019s statements , eyewitness testimonies , and the specialist \u2019s opinion . The court disagreed with the conclusion that ORG had started overtaking within a safe distance from the applicant \u2019s motorcycle , and noted that ORG had also had an obligation to make sure that none of the drivers behind him had started overtaking , so it was possible that he had committed the crime stipulated in LAW . The court observed that the question of ORG \u2019s criminal responsibility would be best determined by a court examining the case on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at GPE \u2019s request , another expert from ORG submitted an opinion that , judging from the damage to both vehicles , there were no grounds to believe that the motorcycle had risen up in the air when it had collided with ORG \u2019s car .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district prosecutor discontinued the pre - trial investigation as time - barred , while also observing that the investigation had not identified any grounds to believe that a crime may have been committed ( the prosecutor did not refer to ORG decision of DATE see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The prosecutor \u2019s decision does not appear to have been appealed against .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a civil claim for damages against ORG He stated that the accident and the resulting injuries and disability had caused him significant distress , inconvenience and emotional trauma . The applicant claimed CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2212 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) in non - pecuniary damages and LTL MONEY ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in pecuniary damages for medical expenses and rehabilitation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It relied on the expert reports delivered during the pretrial investigation and noted that all of them had established that the accident had been caused not by ORG but by the applicant himself . Although the specialist \u2019s opinion , delivered at the request of the applicant \u2019s mother , had reached a different conclusion , the court considered that the fourth expert report had taken its findings into consideration , and that it was thus unnecessary for the court to discuss the specialist \u2019s findings separately . It also observed that the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph DATE above ) could not be interpreted as affirming ORG \u2019s responsibility for the accident . As a result , the court concluded that it had not been established that ORG had breached any legal requirements , which was a pre - condition for his civil liability to arise . The court also noted that the applicant had bought the motorcycle DATE before the accident , that he had not had any prior experience in driving that kind of vehicle , and that the motorcycle had not undergone a technical examination before the accident . Accordingly , the court found that the applicant himself may have breached road traffic safety regulations . The civil claim was dismissed and the applicant was ordered to pay LTL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) in legal expenses to ORG and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of the lower court in its entirety ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
