The applicant was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and prohibited for DATE and DATE from holding public office and exercising political rights or running a business .", "CARDINAL . The judge held that the applicant had had the operational role of organising the ORG structures , which were then used to disguise the various money transfers which had constituted money laundering . According to the judge it had been shown that the money transferred to the company ORG \u2019s current accounts had come from PERSON and had originally derived from the bankrupt company C.", "CARDINAL . The judge , applying LAW , also ordered the confiscation of the money that was still subject to the seizure order and which had not been transferred to company C. ( ORG ) .

On DATE , the applicant appealed against his conviction , challenging , inter alia , the order to pay the equivalent amount of money .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained that the order to pay ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL had to be considered as an unfair duplication of the penalty against him , noting that that sum of money had previously been seized and then transferred ( in accordance with the investigating judge \u2019s decision ) by way of compensation to the company that had been the victim of bankruptcy , without involving the applicant or his co - defendants .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained that the inability to carry out a \u201c direct confiscation \u201d , which was a prerequisite under the law for applying \u201c confiscation by way of equivalent measures \u201d , had not been the result of any actions by him , and thus he should not have been held responsible for the payment of such an amount .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also mentioned the unconstitutionality of , on the one hand , the \u201c overlapping \u201d of compensation for victims and , on the other , the confiscation of an equivalent amount of money .

The judge noted that the complaint regarding the confiscation of an equivalent amount had to be considered as clearly irrelevant given the fact that LAW of LAW ( as modified by PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , did not provide that the prerequisite for such a confiscation order was that \u201c direct confiscation \u201d had been made impossible by the defendant . The judge further noted that at the time of the firstinstance judgment it had not been possible for the judge to order the direct confiscation of all the assets which had been laundered as most of them had already been transferred to company C.
