FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE d\u00e9partement of Essonne ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME he was travelling by motor bicycle along a trunk road near GPE when the police recorded his speed as QUANTITY on a stretch of road where a QUANTITY limit was in force .", "CARDINAL . Such conduct contravenes LAW , which sets a speed limit of QUANTITY for dual carriageways with a central reservation , Article NORP CARDINAL CARDINAL - CARDINAL , which provides that exceeding the limit by QUANTITY is punishable by the fines prescribed for class CARDINAL offences , and LAW , which provides that where the speed limit has been exceeded by QUANTITY the offender may be temporarily disqualified from driving ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant refused to pay the fine imposed and on DATE elected to stand trial . On DATE he was summoned to appear in ORG .", "CARDINAL . In ORG the applicant argued firstly that in law the evidence adduced by the police or gendarmerie was not capable of establishing the offence , given the inaccuracy of the readings taken from the speed - recording device they had used for that purpose . In addition , he contested the lawfulness of Decrees CARDINAL . CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE implementing a points system for driving licences and the applicability of PERSON no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE introducing a points system for driving licences ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found Mr PERSON guilty of the offence of exceeding the speed limit by DATE kph . It fined him MONEY and disqualified him from driving for DATE pursuant to Articles R. QUANTITY CARDINAL - CARDINAL , R. CARDINAL CARDINAL - CARDINAL and R. CARDINAL of FAC ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "On the question of the decrees implementing the points system for driving licences , ORG held that criminal courts had jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness of administrative regulatory measures only in so far as such measures were the basis of a prosecution or carried a criminal sanction . Moreover , it followed from LAW , according to which ORG CARDINAL of the Criminal Code and CARDINAL of LAW did not apply to the deduction of driving licence points , that the deduction of such points was not a secondary criminal sanction triggered by a conviction , with the result that its legal basis fell outside the jurisdiction of the criminal courts .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed to ORG contending that the PERSON of DATE was incompatible with LAW in so far as sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of that PERSON excluded any possibility of judicial review of a measure which was recorded on the national register of driving licences and which restricted rights and deprived the person concerned of the freedom of movement . He also alleged that the above - mentioned decrees on the points system for driving licences and Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE concerning the penalties for exceeding the speed limits were unlawful , and asked ORG to acquit him .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the impugned judgment . It found in the first place that the deduction of driving licence points did not interfere with the freedom of movement as imprisonment , residence restrictions or exclusion from NORP territory would have done . In addition the court held :", "\u201c \u2026 the loss of points is not a criminal sanction as it does not have the requisite features , nor is it a secondary criminal sanction triggered by a criminal conviction .", "As it has the character of a sanction on account of CARDINAL of its features ( the punitive element ) the loss of points must be regarded in terms of current positive law as an administrative sanction .", "\u2026", "There is no doubt that disputes may arise as to the number of points lost or their restitution before or after a further loss for instance .", "It must be possible to submit the administrative sanction for review to an impartial and independent tribunal which gives its decision in public .", "However , as the law stands , that tribunal can not be the criminal court ; the question of the conformity of Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL with a superior law falls outside the jurisdiction of the criminal courts . \u201d", "ORG also dismissed the arguments based on the unlawfulness of Decrees nos . CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , arguing in particular that the PERSON of DATE and the Decrees of DATE and CARDINAL DATE implementing the deduction of points by administrative measure were contrary to LAW . He also pleaded the unlawfulness of LAW DATE penalising speeding and the unreliability of the speed - recording device .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It held as follows :", "\u201c ORG was entitled to dismiss the objections properly raised in the proceedings before it and based on the alleged incompatibility of the Law of DATE introducing the system of points for driving licences with LAW of LAW and the unlawfulness of the decrees of DATE and CARDINAL DATE implementing the deduction of points by administrative measure .", "It follows from LAW , according to which ORG CARDINAL of the Criminal Code and CARDINAL of LAW , as then in force , do not apply to the docking of driving licence points , that the latter measure does not have the character of a secondary criminal sanction triggered by a criminal conviction and that accordingly neither its alleged incompatibility with the ORG provision relied on nor its legal basis fall within the jurisdiction of the criminal courts .", "In addition , the outcome of a prosecution for a speeding offence , as in the present case , does not depend , within the meaning of LAW which entered into force on DATE , on examination of the provisions implementing the deduction of points \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . To date , Mr PERSON has not been notified of the docking of any points .", "CARDINAL . The system of points for driving licences was introduced by PERSON no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , which came into force on DATE . This system was supplemented by PERSON no . DATE of DATE , which made provision for automatic processing of points deductions . Responsibility for management of the data was assigned to ORG . The implementing decrees were promulgated on DATE and DATE . Ruling on applications to have these decrees declared void as ultra vires , the ORG d\u2019Etat found them to be lawful .", "CARDINAL . Under these provisions taken as a whole , each driving licence has an initial allocation of CARDINAL points . Points are then automatically docked if the licence - holder commits CARDINAL of the offences listed in Article CARDINAL of LAW , this being established by the payment of a standard fine or by a conviction which has become final .", "CARDINAL . The facts constituting the offence are assessed within the unfettered discretion of the criminal court , which establishes them and classifies them before imposing the appropriate criminal penalty . On the basis of the facts established by the criminal court , the administrative authority , here the Minister of the ORG , takes the decision to dock points from the offender \u2019s driving licence , a decision which is given formal effect by a letter sent to the offender pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to the established case - law of ORG ( judgments of DATE , and CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE ) and of the ORG d\u2019Etat ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE : ORG ) , the docking of points does not have the character of a secondary criminal sanction triggered by a conviction , but of a purely administrative measure .", "CARDINAL .
