On DATE the applicants brought court proceedings for restitutio in integrum and seeking to have the sale by the ORG declared null and void .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an application with the administrative authorities for restitution in kind of the property under Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the ORG . So far they have not received any answer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Instance allowed the applicants\u2019 action in part . In the operative part of the judgment it held , inter alia , that there were no grounds for rescission of the sale by the ORG , but ordered ORG to allow the applicants to take possession of the flat and the appurtenant land . The court compared the property titles , finding that the seizure had been unlawful but that ORG had made the purchase in good faith .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed an appeal by ORG and by company ORG and , in the operative part of the judgment , varied the judgment of the first - instance court by dismissing the applicants\u2019 action for recovery of the property . In its reasoning , the court considered that the first - instance court had been requested by the applicants to assess whether the seizure was null and void because they had not been sent a copy of the seizure decision , and that therefore the lower court should not have analysed the lawfulness of the seizure of its own motion . ORG also considered that the failure to inform the applicants of the seizure did not affect its validity and that the applicants had no valid property title .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in the operative part of a final decision , dismissed as groundless an appeal on points of law by the applicants . In the reasoning of the judgment the court considered that although some of the ORG criticisms were well - founded , in particular regarding the misinterpretation of the law by ORG when it found that ORG had exceeded the limits of the request made by the applicants , those criticisms did not constitute grounds for amending the previous judgment in accordance with LAW , but only for removing its reasoning . Therefore , in the reasoning part of its decision , ORG considered , in line with the findings of the first - instance court , that the ORG had no valid title and that therefore the applicants had never lost their right of property . However , the court reasoned that as the applicants had not contested ORG \u2019s good faith in their appeal , ORG had correctly dismissed their claim for recovery of the property .", "CARDINAL .
