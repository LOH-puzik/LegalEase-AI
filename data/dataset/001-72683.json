It stated that that title had been confirmed by ORG decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , by Decree no . DATE issued on CARDINAL DATE by the ORG of ORG of GPE , and by Decree no . CARDINAL issued on CARDINAL DATE by ORG of GPE ( see paragraphs PERSON , DATE and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , the mayor of PERSON stated in reply to a question from the first applicant that the NORP Federation embassy in GPE was using the building in PERSON that had belonged to GPE ; an appendix to the nationalisation decree indicated that the embassy had gained possession of the building in issue by virtue of an exchange of immovable property between GPE and the GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following the enactment of PERSON no .

A ORG - owned company , ORG , applied to ORG for judicial review of that decision . It argued that the building was not designated as residential and had not been vacant on the date on which PERSON no . DATE had come into force , whereas the PERSON provided that the administrative authorities empowered to apply it could order the return of property to its owners only if those conditions were met . The applicants applied to intervene in the proceedings , seeking to have PERSON 's application dismissed on the ground that the building in issue was not managed by that company .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG Instance found for the applicants and dismissed the application by PERSON on the ground that that company did not have locus standi since the building was not managed by it . In the absence of an appeal , that judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the first applicant brought proceedings against ORG and ORG under Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , seeking an order requiring them to execute the administrative decision of DATE by returning the property in issue to him .", "Relying on various documents by means of which he intended to prove that DATE was the former owner of the property and that he himself was DATE 's heir , he urged that the restitution should be effective and enforceable against the legal successor of the GPE , notwithstanding the international principles concerning immunity set forth in the DATE Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations .", "He submitted that it was impossible for the final administrative decision of DATE in his favour to be enforced in the normal manner by bailiffs , in view of the immunity enjoyed by the NORP Federation embassy in GPE with regard to the LOC it occupied . Recapitulating the circumstances in which the property had been taken from GPE , he contended that a domestic statute , Law no . DATE the application of which entailed the return of his property \u2013 could not be deprived of effect by securing diplomatic rights to GPE which , moreover , no longer existed .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant sought leave to intervene in the proceedings , arguing that as an heir of DATE she had the same rights as the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG allowed the applicants ' applications and ordered the respondent authorities to return the property to them . It noted that the relevant decision of DATE , which had become final , had been given after verification of the legal status of the property and that the respondents could no longer claim that it was administered by the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Snagov Town Council appealed against that judgment . It asserted that the building in issue was not owned or administered by it but was used by the NORP Federation embassy , which had informed it that it was the owner of the building in a diplomatic note which ORG submitted in evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Emphasising that it was not contesting the applicants ' title to the building , ORG argued that it lacked the capacity to take the action demanded by the applicants since the property was occupied by the embassy .", "ORG argued , lastly , that it was impossible to execute the final decision of DATE , seeing that the bailiffs were also prevented from taking any enforcement measures for similar reasons .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , ORG allowed ORG appeal , quashed the judgment of ORG and dismissed the applicants ' application as being ill - founded . It noted that the building was not managed by the administrative authorities in question but was used by the NORP Federation embassy in GPE , which had stated in a diplomatic note that it was the owner ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG considered that execution of the administrative decision of DATE would amount to breaching the immunity enjoyed by GPE diplomatic mission in GPE , and thus directly undermining the GPE 's fundamental interests . Lastly , it pointed out that immunity from execution was a principle recognised in international law , legal theory and practice .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment , submitting that the lower courts had been incorrect in their interpretation of the evidence and of the nature of the legal relationships in the case before them . They argued , in particular , that the requisitioning of the property in issue and its passing into ORG ownership had been unlawful on the ground that Decree no . CARDINAL on the exchange of property had not been signed and was therefore null and void . They submitted plans showing the location of the property in question and documents concerning the exchange of property between the NORP and GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG allowed their appeal , quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case to ORG for rehearing . ORG asked the court to conduct additional inquiries in order to ascertain the procedure by which the building had become the property of ORG and had been transferred to GPE , and to clarify the legal status of the building at CARDINAL Dr FAC , GPE , which the GPE had exchanged for the building in issue . The court was also instructed to investigate who had used the building before and after DATE and for what purpose .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , ORG raised of its own motion the objection that the respondent administrative authorities could not be a party to the proceedings as the property was not managed by them . It joined that objection to the merits .", "CARDINAL . In a decision delivered on DATE the court , without having conducted the additional inquiries ordered by ORG , allowed the objection and dismissed the applicants ' action . It noted that the building in issue had initially been requisitioned and then nationalised in the circumstances outlined in DATE above , and that it had subsequently become the property of GPE by means of an exchange between GPE and the GPE , approved by Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Observing that the building was now the property of GPE , the GPE 's legal successor , the court considered that the first applicant 's application for an order requiring the relevant authorities to return the building in accordance with LAW had been brought against entities lacking the capacity to take part in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment , arguing that the court had omitted to take into account either the fact that the property had been taken unlawfully from DATE or the evidence which they had submitted to that effect ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine above ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , against which no ordinary appeal lay , ORG dismissed their appeal and upheld the judgment of DATE . It noted , firstly , that the applicants ' criticism that the lower court had not taken into account or interpreted correctly the evidence they had submitted was unfounded . It considered in that connection that the building had passed into the ownership of GPE under Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on nationalisation and that the applicants could accordingly not claim that it had been taken unlawfully by the ORG . It further observed that GPE title to the building in issue had been confirmed and that the lower court had consequently been correct in finding that the applicants ' action was directed against respondents lacking the capacity to take part in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an application to set aside the judgment of DATE . They submitted that ORG had breached LAW by overlooking its previous judgment of CARDINAL DATE in which it had ordered additional inquiries . They added that ORG had omitted to draw any inferences from the evidence they had submitted .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , against which no ordinary appeal lay , ORG dismissed the applicants ' application as being ill - founded . It observed that in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE it had not dealt with points of law , so that its decision could not have been binding in the new round of proceedings after the case had been remitted ; rather , it had simply requested the lower court to clarify the legal position regarding the building in issue and the entity occupying it . It therefore held that LAW of LAW had not been breached by the lower court . ORG held that the applicants ' second complaint was likewise unfounded , seeing that in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE on the applicants ' appeal it had found that title to the building in question was vested in GPE and not in the respondents , thereby settling the dispute in the light of all the evidence before it .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants sent a memorial to the Ambassador of GPE in GPE , requesting him to allow the relevant NORP authorities to return the building in PERSON to them , as they had inherited it and had been granted restitution of it under PERSON no . LANGUAGE . After recapitulating the circumstances that had led to GPE 's loss of the building ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , they argued that the exchange of property between the NORP and GPE under Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE had been unlawful and hence void in that , firstly , the decree concerning the exchange had been neither signed nor published and , secondly , the building offered by GPE in return for the building in PERSON had not belonged to a NORP national , a criterion that would have justified its transfer to the NORP authorities in accordance with the decisions taken at FAC .", "The applicants stated , lastly , that they did not wish to be party to a possible dispute with GPE , contending that any such proceedings would be thwarted by the application of the principle of diplomatic immunity enjoyed by the embassy . They argued , however , that that principle should not contravene the domestic legal order , adding that the property in issue was not of any particular practical interest .", "CARDINAL . It is not clear from the evidence before the ORG whether the applicants received a reply to their request .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants contacted the FAC prefect 's office . Relying on Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the legal status of immovable property wrongfully seized by ORG DATE and DATE , they sought restitution of the building in PERSON . In a letter of DATE the prefect replied that , by virtue of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL taken together , the authority responsible for restitution of such property was the entity in possession of the building or the council of the district in which the property was situated . He invited the applicants to contact those authorities through the bailiffs at ORG . There is no indication in the evidence before the ORG as to whether the applicants acted on that recommendation .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE , the representative of GPE at the ORG , in reply to a request for information sent under LAW ( a ) of ORG by the ORG dealing with the case , stated that GPE , as the GPE 's successor in title to all its movable and immovable property abroad , had title in GPE to a housing complex in PERSON and the appurtenant land . He indicated that GPE title to the property had been confirmed by ORG decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , by Decree no . DATE issued on DATE by the Presidium of ORG of GPE , and by Decree no .
