On DATE the radio communications surveillance unit of ORG ( PTT ) located on a frequency reserved for civil and military aircraft a private telephone conversation being held on a telephone of an unauthorised type . The surveillance unit recorded the conversation held on the line allocated to Mr Camenzind \u2013 a lawyer living in GPE DATE and informed the appropriate PTT authorities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was suspected of contravening section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE \u201c regulating telegraph and telephone communications \u201d . On DATE the GPE cantonal telecommunications office ( Fernmeldekreisdirektion ) of the PTT began an investigation concerning the applicant pursuant to ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the area director of the PTT in GPE issued a warrant to search the applicant \u2019s home under sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW . It was specified in the warrant that the purpose of the search was to find and seize the unauthorised cordless telephone .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE CARDINAL PTT officials went to the applicant \u2019s home . He admitted having tested a cordless telephone in the past but said that it was no longer in his possession . After being shown the search warrant , he allowed the PTT officials into the hall of the flat , in which he in fact occupied only CARDINAL room , the other CARDINAL being let . Having been told of the legal aspects of the search , he consulted the file on his case and telephoned a lawyer and a senior official at the PTT office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The search was carried out by a single PTT official , as requested by PERSON , and in his presence . The official searched every room of the QUANTITY building , including the cellar . He did no more than check whether the telephones and television sets were PTT - approved . He did not touch anything , open any drawers or examine any documents . No equipment of the type sought was found . At TIME a record was drawn up and signed by both the applicant and the investigating official . The record indicated among other things that a complaint could be made about the search under sections CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Camenzind applied to ORG under section CARDINAL of LAW for a declaration that the search was a nullity . ORG of the PTT argued that the application was inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment dismissing the application in the following terms ( translation from NORP ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ( a ) ORG of ORG has jurisdiction to hear complaints about coercive measures ( sections CARDINAL et seq . of the [ LAW ] ) and related administrative acts ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of [ that LAW ] ) . Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW a complaint may be lodged by anyone who is affected by the impugned investigative measure and has an interest worthy of protection in having it quashed or varied .", "( b ) The applicant did not dispute that he had in his possession a telephone that had not been approved in GPE . He even expressly said , during the course of the search , that he had used such a telephone ; it had , however , proved to be unusable and had consequently been destroyed ... It was therefore not possible for any seizure to be effected as the telephone could not be found . The complaint is not , therefore , directed against a seizure ( none was effected ) but against the search and the interception of telephone conversations ...", "( c ) In so far as the complaint concerns the search as such ( \u2018 unlawful search [ unlawfully entering DATE , \u2018 forced ORG , \u2018 threat of the use of force\u2019 ) , and the interception and recording of telephone conversations , it is unnecessary to consider it , since the applicant has no present interest in invoking the protection of the courts ( aktuelles Rechtsschutzbed\u00fcrfnis ) as the measures have ceased and he is no longer affected by them ( BGE [ Bundesgerichtsentscheidungen \u2013 Judgments of the Federal Court ] CARDINAL PERSON ) .", "( d ) That is also true in principle of the locating and recording of the telephone calls concerned here , which are closely linked to the search . Exceptionally , however , ORG does not in practice require a present interest where the impugned infringement of the law is likely to recur at any time , where an application to the courts could not be heard in time in the particular case and where the issues raised could arise again in similar or comparable circumstances at any time and are , because of the importance of the principle concerned , of sufficient public interest ( FAC E. CARDINALa ; QUANTITY CARDINAL E. CARDINAL ; PERSON ) .", "These conditions are satisfied in the present case because the carrying out of a search presupposes that in the first place the person using a telephone of an unauthorised type has been located by appropriate means . That investigation will , however , already have ended by the time the search and any seizure are made . For that reason , the complaint must be upheld in so far as it is directed at the interception and recording of conversations held on the applicant \u2019s unauthorised telephone .", "...", "For these reasons ORG holds :", "( CARDINAL ) In so far as it has been declared admissible , the complaint is dismissed ;", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG imposed a fine of MONEY on the applicant for an offence under section CARDINAL of the Act \u201c regulating telegraph and telephone communications \u201d and ordered him to pay the costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL .
