Among a number of other legal provisions , he relied on LAW ( application of subsequent more lenient criminal legislation ) .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that , in part , the applicant \u2019s arguments were to be examined in the framework of proceedings on an appeal on points of law ( dovolanie ) and that , as to the remainder , there was no constitutionally relevant arbitrariness in the impugned decisions of ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant made a submission in which he argued , inter alia , that his continued detention after DATE had been unlawful , since on DATE the DATE period for pre - trial detention ( from the date of his arrest in GPE on DATE ) had expired and no extension of his detention had been authorised . He accordingly sought to be released .", "ORG subsequently sought a judicial ruling that the period of the applicant \u2019s detention in GPE be deducted from his detention time in GPE .", "ORG granted the request of the prosecution service and dismissed the request of the applicant on CARDINAL and DATE , respectively .", "Following the applicant \u2019s interlocutory appeals , the matter was finally resolved by ORG on DATE when it upheld ORG ruling to the effect that the applicant \u2019s detention time in GPE did not count as pre - trial detention for the purposes of the timelimits on its maximum duration in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s further request for release , finding that , although it was no longer necessary to keep him detained to prevent him from interfering with the course of justice , there was a continuing need for his detention to prevent him from absconding .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s further requests for release were dismissed at first instance on DATE ( by ORG ) and DATE ( by ORG ) and , following interlocutory appeals by the applicant , on DATE and DATE ( by ORG ) , respectively .", "The latter decision was made after a previous decision of ORG had been quashed by ORG on account of a technical error .", "CARDINAL . Extensions of the applicant \u2019s detention were authorised by decisions of DATE ( until DATE ) , DATE ( until DATE ) , DATE ( until DATE ) , DATE ( until DATE ) , DATE ( until DATE ) ( see below for details ) , on DATE ( until DATE ) ( see below for details ) and CARDINAL DATE ( until DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The courts observed that the applicant stood accused of wideranging criminal activity and that an extensive amount of evidence had to be obtained and assessed , including statements from a very large number of witnesses . Some of the evidence was abroad and had to be obtained by means of international judicial assistance . The length of the applicant \u2019s detention was therefore justified .", "CARDINAL . As to the existence of a risk that the applicant would abscond , the courts held that it was of crucial importance that when leaving GPE the applicant had known that criminal proceedings concerning his activities might commence shortly . The applicant had not been staying at his habitual residence in GPE and his whereabouts in GPE had been unknown even to his family .", "CARDINAL . The courts observed that if convicted the applicant faced a heavy penalty , that he had CARDINAL passports , that his financial situation would allow him to settle in any country , and that there were indications that he would do so in a country out of the reach of ORG .", "CARDINAL . These reasons were endorsed by ORG in its decision of DATE to declared inadmissible as being manifestly illfounded the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW , in which , represented by a lawyer , the applicant had sought to challenge the decision of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , arguing that his continued detention had been unjustified and as such contrary to LAW and CARDINAL of LAW and LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) concerning the extension of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , ORG acceded to a request by the President of ORG trying the applicant and extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , ORG expressed the opinion that the limitation on the maximum duration of pre - trial detention to DATE under the new ORG applied to the applicant \u2019s case by operation of the constitutional principle of equality before the law , although , pursuant to the transitional provisions of the new ORG , the applicant \u2019s trial and detention continued to be governed by the old ORG , which allowed detention pending trial to last at DATE . Therefore , as the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention in GPE had commenced on DATE , a further extension after DATE would not be permissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge NORP of ORG requested that ORG authorise an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his observations in reply , the applicant , assisted by his lawyer , relied on the ORG decision of DATE , considered the matter to be res judicata and asked for the request to be dismissed .", "Moreover , the applicant submitted that he had not been heard in person in any of the previous proceedings on extension of his pre - trial detention and argued that this was contrary to his right to adversarial proceedings and equality of arms .", "CARDINAL . The request fell to be determined by a different bench of ORG which , on DATE , summoned the applicant and his lawyer to a public session ( veren\u00e9 zasadnutie ) on the extension of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , to be held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , prior to the scheduled public session , ORG established that the summons had not been served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer within the procedural time - limit of DATE before the session . ORG held that in those circumstances the public session could not take place and the matter had to be decided in private session ( neverejn\u00e9 zasadnutie ) , that is to say behind closed doors .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , before opening the private session , ORG allowed , and the applicant used , the opportunity to address the court orally . The applicant was assisted by CARDINAL defence lawyers and CARDINAL substitute defence lawyer . He made various submissions , including that he had never had any intention of absconding .", "CARDINAL . Later on DATE , in private session , ORG extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE . ORG explained in detail that the offences of which the applicant stood accused fell within the category of \u201c extremely serious offences \u201d ( obzvl\u00e1\u0161\u0165 z\u00e1va\u017en\u00fd trestn\u00fd \u010din ) within the meaning of the old ORG and the old ORG , that pre - trial detention on charges of such offences could last DATE under the old ORG and that the old ORG applied .", "In that context , ORG referred to a decision of ORG of DATE in an unrelated but similar case , file no .

CARDINAL , DATE ) , in which ORG had upheld a previous decision of ORG of DATE interpreting and applying the relevant law in line with the decision taken in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then requested that the Minister of ORG challenge the decision by way of an appeal on points of law and lodged a complaint with ORG under LAW . He argued that his detention beyond the DATE time - limit under the new ORG was unlawful and complained that there had been no public hearing .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request , having found no error of law or procedure . As to the maximum duration of detention pending trial in situations such as that of the applicant , ORG also referred to the above - mentioned decision of ORG in the case file no . II . \u00daS DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , sitting in private , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible . It observed that , although he had complained to ORG that there had been no oral hearing on the extension of his detention , the applicant had failed to make a formal request for a public hearing . The applicant had had ample opportunity to make written submissions and he had actually used it , both directly and through the intermediary of his lawyers . In addition , the applicant had addressed ORG orally before the private session on DATE . The principle of always applying the more lenient criminal legislation was only valid in substantive criminal law and not in respect of detention , which was a procedural measure . There was no doubt that under the relevant statutory provisions the old ORG continued to apply to the applicant \u2019s detention , including the limits on its maximum duration .", "The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

According to the explanatory report ( d\u00f4vodov\u00e1 spr\u00e1va ) on LAW ( Law . No CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) , the aim of the LAW was to create structures for the detection , investigation and prosecution of corruption and organised crime . ORG and other authorities established under LAW had national jurisdiction with a view to ensuring better specialisation and protection as well as to severing local ties .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Section VII.CARDINAL of the LAW , the Special Court had criminal jurisdiction over members of ORG , members of the ORG , heads of central administrative agencies , judges , prosecutors , the ORG , the Director of ORG ( ORG bezpe\u010dnostn\u00fd \u00farad \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the Director of ORG and members of the board of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

A judge could only be assigned to ORG after passing security vetting by the ORG for access to top secret information ( Section VI.CARDINAL of the LAW ) and would be recalled if he or she ceased to meet the security vetting criteria ( Section VI.CARDINAL of the LAW ) . A decision to refuse security vetting clearance ( bezpe\u010dnostn\u00e1 previerka ) could be appealed against in a special parliamentary committee and ultimately , by way of an administrative - law action , in ORG .", "CARDINAL . Special Court judges were entitled to a salary as ORG judges ( Section VI.CARDINAL of the Act ) and to a special DATE allowance equal to double the average nominal wage in the NORP economy in DATE ( Section VI.CARDINAL of the Act ) .

On DATE a group of CARDINAL members of ORG challenged in ORG the constitutionality of the statutory provisions establishing ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in plenary , gave a judgment , by majority of CARDINAL against CARDINAL , declaring the statutory provisions establishing ORG unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , ORG ruled that its judgment gave no ground for reopening proceedings which had ended by final but not yet executed judgments of ORG , which would otherwise be the case under section CARDINALb of LAW .", "DATE . On the publication of the judgment in LAW DATE , the unconstitutional provisions ceased to have legal effect .", "CARDINAL . The majority of ORG relied on a comparative law analysis concerning specialised jurisdictions in various ORG member GPE . It observed that there was no specific legal basis in GPE allowing for an extraordinary jurisdiction whereas ORG had mixed features of a specialised court and an extraordinary court . However , the existence of the latter could only be justified by extraordinary circumstances and for the attainment of an extremely serious goal that could not be attained by other means .", "CARDINAL . Restricting the jurisdiction of the Special Court ratione personae was an anachronism . This and the requirement for ORG judges to have valid security vetting clearance from the ORG , which was an agency within the executive , was found to be incompatible with the principles of legal certainty and division of power . It was also noted that the role of the ORG in respect of appointment of judges to ORG unacceptably interfered with the role to the professional body of the judiciary in GPE , ORG Rada Slovenskej republiky ) .", "CARDINAL . In reaching the conclusion mentioned in the precedent paragraph , the majority took into account , inter alia , that existing remedies against decisions of the ORG were insufficient and limited in effect .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the remuneration arrangements for the ORG judges were discriminatory and disproportionate and as such unacceptable .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , it was pointed out in the reasoning of the judgment that the judgment would have no impact on decisions of ORG which had become final , because the reasons for the judgment concerned the institutional status of ORG within the judiciary and had no bearing on the legal basis of its decisions .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting judges were of the opinion that the majority had applied an incorrect test for the determination of the compatibility of ORG with the judicial system of GPE as a whole . The appropriate test was whether such a court offered sufficient guarantees of a fair trial before an independent tribunal .", "CARDINAL . The question of the social need for ORG , which the majority had examined , was predominantly political in nature , fell within the discretion of ORG and the courts should be most cautious in dealing with such questions .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting judges found no support for the conclusion that ORG had unacceptable features as an extraordinary court .", "CARDINAL . The requirement for a ORG judge to obtain security vetting clearance from the ORG was legitimate and constitutional .
