This was granted on DATE , inter alia , on the condition that the card was not to be used to pay for the personal purchases of the cardholder . The credit - card company , however , closed the account on DATE as by then the card had been used for purchases worth MONEY ( ORG ) that allegedly had no connection with the business activities of the company .", "On the basis of these alleged irregularities the police commenced an investigation into the activities of A , B and C. A was interrogated by the police from DATE and on CARDINAL and DATE . It appeared that the irregularities related in particular to a trip to GPE , involving A , B and C as well as the applicant , and to a car rental . During the police interrogations A repeatedly incriminated the applicant who was not at that moment under investigation . It appears that also B and C incriminated the applicant in their statements to the police .", "Following the police investigations charges of fraud were brought against A , B and C.

It appears that the prosecution intended to rely on the statements made by A , B and C during their own trials , whereas the applicant called A to testify . During his testimony before ORG on DATE A withdrew his previous statements concerning the involvement of the applicant in the frauds and stated that the applicant had not been involved in them . Confronted with his previous statements made in connection with his own trial A maintained , primarily , that , because of his excessive use of alcohol at that time , he had been in a bad physical condition during his detention and that he had not read the documents carefully enough .", "Following the examination of A , and after the applicant had had the opportunity to comment thereon , the prosecutor requested an adjournment in order to call B and C to testify .
