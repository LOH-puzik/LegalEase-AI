The mater semper certa est rule has not found acceptance in NORP law . There is an ancient tradition in GPE that enables newborn babies to be abandoned in accordance with a set procedure .

That provision was repealed and subsequently reintroduced by decrees of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , before being amended in DATE and becoming first LAW and then the current LAW CARDINAL of ORG Code :", "\u201c The costs of accommodation and confinement of women who , on being admitted to a public institution or approved private institution , request that their identity remain secret shall be borne by ORG in the d\u00e9partement in which the institution 's head office is located .", "At their request or with their agreement the women referred to in the first sub - paragraph shall receive psychological support and practical advice from ORG .", "The first sub - paragraph shall apply without any means of identification being required or inquiry conducted .", "If the name of the child 's father or mother has been recorded in a birth certificate issued within the period prescribed by Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , there shall be no legal entitlement to have the costs of accommodation and confinement paid for by the ORG . \u201d", "The system of anonymous births was embodied in PERSON no .

Since the adoption of the law of DATE , several official reports have suggested that a reform of the system of anonymous births would be desirable .", "As far back as DATE a report by the PERSON d'Etat , entitled \u201c Status and protection of the child \u201d , proposed the setting up of a mediatory body , \u201c ORG \u201d , to allow information to be communicated and contact to be established between the persons concerned , provided the interested parties consented . The PERSON d'Etat thus emphasised the need for a prior consensual basis before secret information about a child 's origins could be disclosed . In that connection , it noted the difficulties inherent in searching for a parent ( \u201c this task is rendered all the more difficult by the fact that the administrative authorities currently follow a wide variety of practices with regard to the secrecy of origins . No method for tracing relatives can be established in these conditions . Nonetheless , CARDINAL consistently finds in practice that a certain amount of information is collected and preserved and , in theory , it could be used . However , it will only become usable if a uniform , clear and simple procedure for collecting and preserving the confidential information relied on is established beforehand \u201d ) ; it also observed that professional secrecy obligations constituted a serious impediment to tracing . For that reason it proposed a compromise that would enable professionals to disregard their confidentiality obligations if they considered it appropriate for the purposes of enabling family origins to be established . In short , the PERSON d'Etat proposed that children should be given a limited right of access to information regarding the identity of their progenitors through the intermediary of a specially created structure that would be responsible for ascertaining the wishes of the parents and facilitating a psychological rapprochement of the parties .", "In DATE a report by Mr PERSON entitled \u201c Children from here , children from elsewhere \u2013 Adoption without borders \u201d proposed preserving the system of secret births , but suggested that it might be possible for non - identifying information to be gathered .", "The report of the parliamentary inquiry committee presided over by PERSON entitled \u201c Rights of the child , uncharted territory \u201d , which was made public on CARDINAL DATE , proposed reforming the system of anonymous births in these terms :", "\u201c It is possible to envisage information on the child 's biological filiation being kept with a public institution . Confidential information could be disclosed during the child 's minority on a joint application by the mother and child . The right to make such an application could be made subject to conditions concerning the child 's capacity or as to minimum age . The right would only be exercisable by the child in person , not its legal representative . Once the child has reached DATE , the information would automatically cease to be confidential at the child 's request , subject to the mother being informed . In any event , disclosure of the confidential information would be incapable of having any effect on the parental ties the child already enjoyed . ...", "A system of this type could initially be established for cases of anonymous births and secret abandonment and subsequently extended , once the legislature considered it appropriate , to births following medically assisted procreation . \u201d", "A report by PERSON entitled \u201c Couples , filiation and parenthood DATE \u2013 The challenges posed to the law by changes in family and private life \u201d , which was submitted to the Minister of ORG and the Minister for Employment and ORG on DATE , made the following proposal :", "\u201c In view of the extremely serious consequences of anonymous births , which deprive the child of both its paternal and maternal filiation , we propose repealing Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW .

It is relatively rare for mothers to be entitled to give birth anonymously under NORP domestic legislation , as GPE and GPE stand alone in not imposing a statutory obligation on the natural parents to register a newborn child or to state their identity when registering it . Conversely , many countries make it obligatory to provide the names , not only of the mother , to whom the child is automatically linked , but also of the father . The countries concerned are GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ( where section QUANTITY of the PERSON on civil status , which allowed mothers to have the words \u201c mother unknown \u201d entered in the register of births , deaths and marriages , was held to be unconstitutional in a decision of ORG in DATE ) , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "The current trend in certain countries is towards the acceptance , if not of a right to give birth anonymously , then at least of a right to give birth \u201c discreetly \u201d . An example of this is provided by GPE , where a debate has begun , largely as a result of the large number of women crossing the border to give birth anonymously in GPE . In an opinion delivered on DATE ORG set out the CARDINAL lines of argument that were defensible from an ethical standpoint : the first considered it unacceptable for children to be brought into the world without parents ; for that reason its proponents proposed that facilities for \u201c giving birth discreetly \u201d should be provided , without completely closing the door on all attempts to trace the parents . Proponents of the second line of argument considered that the ethical dilemma posed by the right to give birth anonymously did not result from the need to resolve the conflict arising out of the clash between the respective rights of \u201c the child to filiation \u201d and \u201c the mother in distress \u201d , but from the more fundamental confrontation of CARDINAL values : the life of the child on the one hand and the right of everyone to know his or her natural mother on the other . They contended that in the face of that dilemma , the primary concern had to be the protection of the life and of the development of the child . For that reason , they considered that giving birth anonymously was perfectly legitimate and acceptable from an ethical standpoint . Likewise , in GPE , in view of the rising number of abandoned newborn infants , the first \u201c baby box \u201d ( Babyklappe ) \u2013 a system that allows the mother to leave her child , ring a bell and leave without giving her identity DATE was installed in GPE DATE . Since then , other \u201c baby boxes \u201d have been installed in other towns . In DATE a bill on anonymous births was rejected by the GPE . On DATE the Land of Baden - W\u00fcrttemberg introduced a further bill in the NORP which was submitted to the relevant committees for presentation to the GPE . Yet another example is provided by GPE , where mothers may decide to remain anonymous by abandoning their newborn child in a special , unsupervised room in the hospital ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
