Following an attempted collective break - out from ORG no .

NORP In DATE their lawyer lodged an application for release on behalf of each of them before the chambre du conseil of ORG , by registered letter posted on DATE .

On DATE the applicants ' counsel applied under the extremely urgent procedure to the President of ORG , who dismissed the application on DATE on the ground that the applicants did not have a personal right of access to the territory , as such a right was not conferred either by the submission of an application for asylum or by the orders for their release .", "CARDINAL .

The first applicant refused to board the plane but ORG . did board it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' counsel lodged an application to shorten the period of notice of a hearing , arguing that keeping her clients in the transit zone constituted an illegal act that infringed their right to liberty , a right confirmed by the decisions delivered in respect of their detention in the transit centre .

The applicants submitted that by keeping them in a closed space , despite the fact that the chambre du conseil of ORG had ordered their release , the ORG was in breach of the domestic and international provisions guaranteeing the right of personal liberty . In addition , they were completely destitute , without lodging or resources and left to their own devices in the transit zone , where they had no proper facilities and for DATE had had neither food nor drink , which constituted inhuman and degrading treatment .

CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c It is common ground that the applicant is at present subject to a decision of DATE to remove him from national territory , upheld on DATE .", "The time - limit for bringing an action for a stay of execution and for judicial review does not have suspensive effect ; nor does the application for regularisation under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW of DATE which the applicant submitted on DATE .", "As the applicant 's administrative status is binding on the court , it must take note of the fact that the applicant is therefore not entitled to remain on NORP territory .", "Nonetheless , the decision of ORG is also binding on the court and in the present case , that division ordered the applicant 's immediate release .", "It is also common ground that ORG was aware of the applicant 's administrative status and in particular of the decision of the CGRA and therefore ordered his release with full knowledge of the facts .", "It is not for this court to adjudicate on that status but , rather , on the way in which that decision to release the applicant is implemented by ORG , all other things being equal .", "The defendant maintains that , in view of the fact that the applicant has not been authorised to enter national territory as such , it was correct to take the view that the applicant 's release should be effected in the transit zone , since that zone is not an area where the law does not apply but is in fact part of the GPE for persons in transit in GPE and those who have not yet been authorised to enter the national territory as such .", "ORG has held that ' as regards the access , residence , establishment and removal of aliens , it does not follow from the legal distinction between the port area and the rest of the territory of the GPE that the transit zone is not part of the GPE and that the law referred to does not apply there ' ( Court of Cassation , DATE , Pas . DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "The closed centres are in reality nothing more than extensions of the transit zones , antechambers to the territory of the GPE , the only difference being that , unlike the transit zone , they are designed to be capable of accommodating persons for a more or less long period in what are assumed to be decent conditions .", "While the defendant 's reasoning can therefore be followed in so far as it considers that by being present in the transit zone the applicant was in fact on NORP territory , that reasoning can not be followed where it considers that such presence amounts to ' release ' .", "It can not be accepted that the legislature , by creating centres at the borders , specially equipped to accommodate persons who are being held pending leave to enter the GPE or pending deportation , and by providing that persons held in those centres have a right of appeal to the chambre du conseil , took the view that if their release was ordered by the chambre du conseil and then by ORG , those persons could be sent to the transit zone , which is wholly unequipped to receive them , since this would place them in an even more precarious and adverse situation .", "If release limited to the transit centre were to be accepted , that would amount to allowing the NORP State unilaterally to block a court decision ordering release on the basis of a person 's administrative status , when that administrative status had been taken into consideration by that court and must have constituted a ground of its decision ordering release .", "Since DATE the parties have both known that the removal order is enforceable , since the applicant 's appeal to the CGRA was rejected and no urgent application for a stay of its execution was made .", "Since then the applicant has shown no intention of complying voluntarily with the removal order .", "Nor has ORG forcibly removed him since then .", "Since the ORG is now required to comply with the decision ordering the applicant 's release , there are CARDINAL possibilities : either the defendant prefers to wait until the applicant decides to leave voluntarily , but in that case , while awaiting his departure , the ORG must allow him to move freely within the territory ( in observance of res judicata ) , or the defendant assumes its responsibilities and provides itself with the means to enforce the order for the applicant 's return in order to ensure compliance with its own administrative decisions .", "In that regard , the PERSON allows ORG to order the alien in question to reside in a specified place pending implementation of the order for his removal ( section QUANTITY of DATE ) .", "What is unacceptable and contrary to the rule of law in the present case is that the NORP State should place the applicant in another closed place ( the transit zone ) in which the living conditions are inhuman and degrading , in the hope that the applicant will then decide to implement the removal order ' voluntarily ' .", "In transferring the applicant from the closed centre at NORP to the transit zone , ORG committed an illegal act .", "On the basis of the file as it currently stands , the release ordered by ORG necessarily means that , until such time as he is removed , the applicant is free to leave the transit zone , without prejudice to the ORG 's right to order the applicant to reside in a specific place ( section CARDINAL ) .", "That solution to a wholly contradictory situation is the CARDINAL possible if the procedure under section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE is not to be reduced to a farce .", "In the light of the foregoing , the application must be allowed in accordance with the operative part of the present order . \u201d", "The decision delivered in connection with application no . CARDINAL is based on the same reasoning .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' lawyer sent that decision by fax on DATE to ORG , which cancelled the booking made for the flight on DATE . On DATE the ORG was instructed to allow the applicants to leave the transit zone , without restriction .", "CARDINAL . The orders of CARDINAL DATE were served on ORG , by bailiff , first on DATE to the office of the Minister of ORG ; the order made in favour of the first applicant was served for a second time , on DATE , on the federal police border inspection post at FAC .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants left the transit zone on DATE , in the late morning ; the precise time was not stated .", "CARDINAL . The parties differed as to the situation which the CARDINAL applicants encountered in the transit zone .", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated that the transit zone had no bedrooms and , a fortiori , no beds , and that they were housed in the mosque located there . They were taken in by the NORP counsellor , who took them in again after the various attempts to remove them . They remained for DATE without food or drink , receiving food only irregularly from the cleaning staff , the company running the airport , the NORP counsellor or the lay counsellor at the airport . The CARDINAL counsellors explained in their testimony that the applicants ' situation was unbearable , mentioning that they had been abandoned or \u201c deserted \u201d by the authorities . The applicants were unable to wash themselves or to launder their clothes . They were often checked by the airport police ; on several occasions they were placed in a cell and left there for TIME without food or drink , in an attempt to force them to agree to leave the country voluntarily , then taken back to the transit zone . They were also violently struck and beaten inside the mosque by certain members of the federal police .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that , following the criticisms in a report by ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in DATE , the situation in the transit zone at FAC had been remedied by , inter alia , setting up the \u201c FAC \u201d on the airport LOC . The centre was able to take in , on a voluntary basis , persons staying in the transit zone and provide them with bed and board . In its DATE report on its visit to GPE , the ORG observed that the material conditions and the activities offered in the \u201c FAC \u201d could generally be described as satisfactory for a stay of not DATE , with just CARDINAL exception ( the lack of provision for those staying in the centre to enjoy fresh air ) . In addition , persons in the transit zone awaiting a reservation on a flight for the purpose of their removal were able to receive meals via the control services . A federal police circular of CARDINAL DATE confirmed that practice and reminded the various services of their obligations in that regard . It was apparent from that circular that the team dealing with the case of a particular alien was responsible for distributing meals to him or her and that upon arriving in the transit zone aliens were informed that they could go to the \u201c arrivals \u201d level CARDINAL times a day to be given a meal . The team responsible ordered CARDINAL meals per person per day at the \u201c FAC . Although that procedure had been properly confirmed only by the circular of DATE , the fact nonetheless remained that the first applicant had been informed on DATE that he could be housed and fed on a voluntary basis in the \u201c FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicants , after leaving the transit zone , were subjected to an identity check by officials of the federal police responsible for border control . After finding that the applicants were not in possession of a valid residence permit , the police drew up an administrative report for each of them . The reports stated that the applicants were travelling together and that they spoke LANGUAGE in addition to their mother tongue . The police contacted ORG at TIME and were instructed to detain the applicants so that they could be served with an order to leave the territory together with a decision ordering their removal and a decision ordering their detention for that purpose . A decision to that effect was served on them on DATE , at an unspecified time , by an officer from ORG . Both applicants refused to sign .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was informed of those measures and was told that , with a view to their implementation , he was being taken to the PERSON centre for illegal aliens . He stated that he objected , on the advice of his counsel . During the journey to PERSON this applicant complained that the handcuffs placed on him were too tight around his wrists . The journey was interrupted at TIME so that the handcuffs could be loosened .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was informed of those measures and told that he would be taken to the centre for illegal aliens and he too stated that he objected , on the advice of his counsel , and resisted the police who were putting him in the van being used to transfer the CARDINAL applicants . TIME after the van was closed , it was noted that , although he was handcuffed , the second applicant had intentionally injured himself by banging his head against the van window , which was protected by a grille . It was then decided to take him to PERSON in a police vehicle and ORG bands were placed round his arms and legs to prevent any mutilation . According to the report drawn up on that occasion , the applicant told the members of the escort that he would use his self - inflicted injuries as evidence to support a complaint against the police . Upon arriving at PERSON he was examined by the doctor at the centre , who noted the presence of external injuries , namely a bruise and a small wound ( \u201c klein wondje \u201d ) on his forehead .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer representing the CARDINAL applicants wrote to the Minister for the ORG to complain about his clients being placed in a closed centre in spite of the orders made on DATE . On DATE he had lodged an application with the PERSON d'Etat for judicial review of the decision of DATE of the Commissioner ORG and an application for a stay of its execution ( see above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , measures were taken to remove the first applicant to GPE , but the order for his repatriation was subsequently set aside . On DATE ORG instructed ORG to make arrangements for his removal as soon as possible . His repatriation was rearranged for DATE .", "DATE . On DATE the first applicant left PERSON and his personal effects , his luggage and the sums of LAW , MONEY ( ORG ) and QUANTITY which he had been carrying on his arrival were returned to him . He had previously been informed of the repatriation procedure that would be followed and of the measures of physical restraint that might be taken . Following a discussion , he stated that he no longer objected to being repatriated , but expressed the wish that certain conditions should be observed . He asked , in particular , that he should not be handcuffed and that he should carry his passport . He was told that those conditions could not be met , in view of the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was repatriated on a flight to GPE , via GPE , escorted by CARDINAL police officers . The first applicant was placed in fabric handcuffs before being taken on board . The handcuffs were removed after take - off . During the flights and while waiting in the transit zone at FAC he was given food and drink . The members of the escort reported no incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , measures were taken to remove the second applicant to GPE , but the order for his repatriation was subsequently set aside .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was repatriated on DATE . Upon his departure from PERSON , his personal effects , his luggage and a sum of LAW were returned to him . According to the report drawn up in connection with his removal , he arrived at the airport at TIME He was searched and placed in a cell . At TIME the officials in charge of his repatriation questioned him in order to determine the extent of his cooperation with the removal order . During that interview , he indicated that he had realised that he had to return to GPE . He allegedly added that he had not been happy with his situation for DATE and that he had the impression that he had been a pawn in a game between his lawyer and the ORG officials . He was allowed to telephone his family and contacted his sister , who was informed of the precise details of the flight and of the scheduled time of arrival . In order to prevent any attempt at resistance , the members of the escort decided , in view of the information in their possession and the circumstances of the transfer on DATE , to use measures of physical restraint . The applicant was wearing fabric handcuffs and had ORG around his ankles when he boarded the flight to GPE via GPE . The boarding of the plane , the flight and the transit passed without incident . The applicant was released from his restraints as soon as the plane reached cruising altitude and he was given food , drink and cigarettes during the journey . Upon his arrival in GPE his passport was returned to him . Members of his family were waiting for him there . The NORP consul in GPE was also present at the airport .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
