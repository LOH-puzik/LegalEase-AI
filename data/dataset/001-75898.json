As to the applicant \u2019s allegation that his trade union had not been consulted , the appellate court held that the defendant had not been notified that such trade union existed within the school and that the statutes of that trade union did not foresee consultations with employers in similar cases . In addition , the defendant had consulted the trade union which had been established within the school and the existence of which had been officially known to everybody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal on points of law . He argued that the courts had disregarded the fact that he had been dismissed after he had become inconvenient because of his criticism of the management of the school and that they had failed to hear the other persons who had also been dismissed for similar reasons at that time .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law by a decision given on DATE . It noted , in particular , that there were no apparent shortcomings in the proceedings at the lower instances which would render an appeal on points of law admissible under the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure .
