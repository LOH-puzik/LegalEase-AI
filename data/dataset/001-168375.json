The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE convicted the applicant of murder . In the criminal proceedings PERSON was heard as a witness . In its judgment the domestic court dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that he had shot the victim in self - defence . The applicant was subsequently transferred to GPE to serve his prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE V. , the owner of the apartment where the applicant had committed the crime brought a civil action against the applicant before ORG . He claimed compensation for damage caused as a consequence of the offence ( damaged chair which had been hit by the bullet , damaged or lost belongings ( mostly various items used to wrap parts of the victim \u2019s cut up body ) , damaged flooring after the police had cut out a piece of parquet with a bullet mark to serve as evidence , a lock cylinder removed for evidence , cleaning bills , unpaid utility bills ) in the amount of CARDINAL kroons ( EEK ) ( corresponding to MONEY ( EUR ) ) . The plaintiff submitted to the court documentary evidence ( material from the criminal case , photos , invoices , inventory list of the apartment attached to the contract between ORG and the victim ) in support of his claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that the action was accepted for proceedings and that the case was to be dealt with in simplified proceedings ( lihtsustatud menetlus ) under LAW ORG ) ( ORG seadustik ) . It also explained to the parties that if they wished to be heard , they would have to notify the court within DATE of the date of receiving the decision . The applicant was asked to provide the court with a written reply to the action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed ORG in writing that he did not object to accepting the action for proceedings but he contested the claim , arguing that he had not damaged or destroyed the items in question . He further contended that he had not committed murder but had shot the victim in self - defence ; in so far as the alleged damage related to the collection of evidence , it had been caused by the police ; the claims were unsubstantiated in part . He requested examination of the case at a court hearing and asked that he and CARDINAL witnesses ( T. and PERSON and NORP forensic experts ) be summoned and questioned in court . He stated that he wished to explain that he had not caused the damage and had acted in self - defence . As to the witnesses , he also wished them to give evidence about his acting in self - defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE plaintiff PERSON replied in writing to the applicant \u2019s submissions , stating that he did not deem it necessary for the applicant to be present in person at the court hearing . He asked the court to dismiss the applicant \u2019s request for the summoning of witnesses , as these individuals would be unable to give testimony about the items in the apartment or their value , and their statements could not refute the findings of a final court decision . He also submitted additional evidence to the court ( a photo of CARDINAL of the items in question ; a bank statement about the payment of utility bills ; price lists to prove the cost of another damaged item and the cost of cleaning services ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that the case was to be examined in written proceedings ( kirjalik menetlus ) under LAW ORG . The court noted the plaintiff \u2019s agreement to the case being examined in written proceedings and that the applicant wished to be heard . It then went on to explain that under LAW ORG a written procedure could be applied when the amount of the claim was under CARDINAL kroons ( EUR CARDINAL ) and a party \u2019s appearance in court was significantly hindered by a long distance or for any other good reason . It gave the parties a thirtyday time - limit from the date of receipt of the decision for making any written submissions . No appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . No submissions were made to the court within DATE time limit .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG adjudicated the case in simplified and written proceedings . The court noted in its judgment that it had also examined the material pertinent to the related criminal case and relied as documentary evidence on the statements made by T. in the criminal proceedings . Relying on the judgment in the criminal case , ORG considered it established that the applicant had not acted in self - defence when he killed the victim . Based on the material of the criminal case as well as documentary evidence submitted by ORG , ORG accepted PERSON \u2019s claim in part , that is in the amount of EEK CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL , which amounted to PERCENT of the initial claim ) . The court found on the basis of the applicant \u2019s submissions that accepting the claim was not justified in so far as it concerned the lock cylinder , unpaid utility bills and certain allegedly damaged items . It was noted in the judgment that an appeal lay to ORG and that the appeal could be examined in a written procedure unless examination at a court hearing had been requested in the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against ORG judgment . He complained that , although he had requested an oral hearing before ORG , no hearing had been held . He had therefore been deprived of an opportunity to be examined and to explain his position , according to which he had caused no unlawful damage to the plaintiff \u2019s property . He relied on LAW and also referred to persons whose examination he had requested . He challenged ORG reliance on the criminal court \u2019s judgment and claimed that in a civil case it should be possible to challenge facts established in a criminal case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s appeal . It noted that ORG had examined the case in simplified proceedings ( lihtmenetlus ) . In such circumstances , ORG could only accept an appeal for examination if ORG in its judgment had granted leave to appeal or a provision of substantive or procedural law had clearly been incorrectly applied or it was clear that the evidence had been wrongly assessed and this could have significantly influenced the court \u2019s ruling . ORG had not granted leave to appeal . ORG did not find that in the case at hand it could be said that ORG had clearly incorrectly applied a provision of substantive or procedural law or clearly wrongly assessed the evidence or breached the right to be heard ( \u00e4rakuulamise \u00f5igus ) . ORG had examined the matter under LAW ORG in simplified proceedings . Pursuant to LAW ORG , in such proceedings the court had to guarantee that the fundamental rights and freedoms and the essential procedural rights of the parties were observed and that the parties were heard ( kohus kuulab menetlusosalise \u00e4ra ) if they so requested . However , for that it was not necessary for a court hearing ( kohtuistung ) to be conducted . On DATE ORG had ruled that the case was to be examined in written proceedings and had given the parties an opportunity to make written submissions . The applicant had thus been guaranteed an opportunity to present his position to the court . ORG further noted that the applicant had not objected under LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG to ORG decision of DATE whereby the court had ordered that the case be examined in simplified proceedings and requested the applicant to make his submissions in writing . Pursuant to LAW and LAW ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) ORG could not therefore consider these arguments in the appellate proceedings . ORG concluded that there was no legal basis for it to accept the applicant \u2019s appeal for examination .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against ORG decision , arguing that by refusing to allow him a hearing ORG had clearly violated procedural law and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG decided not to examine the appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
