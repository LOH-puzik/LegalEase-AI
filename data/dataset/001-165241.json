On DATE the NORP authorities issued an expulsion order in respect of the applicant . According to the case file , the applicant did not seek judicial redress against that order .", "CARDINAL . Her first asylum request was dismissed on DATE . The administrative authorities found that the inconsistent and contradictory statement of facts provided by the applicant cast doubts on her current nationality and the existence of the alleged persecution .

On DATE GPE administrative judge no . CARDINAL rejected the applicant \u2019s request to have her expulsion suspended on the following grounds : the applicant had failed to demonstrate the existence of a risk to her life or physical integrity if returned to GPE ; the applicant had submitted an international protection request only after having been detained and held in immigrant detention ; the applicant had already sought asylum unsuccessfully in DATE ; the reports compiled by the administrative authorities supporting rejection of the asylum request were better reasoned and more convincing than the report produced by the ORG office .

CARDINAL ruled that he lacked jurisdiction to examine the applicant \u2019s appeal , and relinquished the case to FAC .

On DATE at TIME the applicant was expelled to GPE . ORG first learnt of the applicant \u2019s expulsion on DATE , the date on which she was served with a decision by ORG dated DATE rejecting the request for a recovery and reflection period . On the basis of an interview conducted by police officers , ORG found that there was no evidence to support the argument that the applicant was a victim of human trafficking . It was clear that she had not been forced into prostitution since she worked independently and voluntarily without being controlled , lived alone and had not been deprived of her freedom of movement . Furthermore , she had no relatives in GPE who might be threatened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instituted administrative judicial proceedings for the protection of fundamental human rights ( procedimiento contencioso administrativo para la defensa de los derechos fundamentales ) , claiming that the applicant had been expelled before the NORP authorities had examined the substance of her request for a recovery and reflection period .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG argued before the judge that the manner in which the applicant had been expelled had prevented the organisation from having a power of attorney signed by the applicant before a notary or a judicial secretary . ORG contended that it had not been informed about the expulsion beforehand and had not been able to contact the applicant since then . In its view , the written authority dated DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) should be regarded as valid for the purposes of representation before domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the administrative judge rejected ORG \u2019s submissions . He referred to sections CARDINAL and DATE ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL July on Administrative Judicial Procedure , which established the obligation to furnish a power of attorney in cases where applicants had instructed a lawyer to represent them before an administrative judge , and to section CARDINAL of Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE on Civil Judicial Procedure , which provided that the power of attorney must be signed before a notary or a judicial secretary . The judge observed that the aim of these requirements was to demonstrate the genuine existence of the person intending to apply to the judicial authorities for the purpose of defending his or her individual rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as a result of a claim lodged by ORG concerning the applicant \u2019s case , the NORP ORG issued a recommendation to ORG to the effect that the asylum authorities should automatically initiate a procedure aimed at determining whether the alleged victim should be granted a recovery and reflection period in cases where an international protection request has been supported by the ORG office because it is thought that the person concerned might be a victim of human trafficking .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after holding a hearing in the presence of ORG , GPE administrative judge no . CARDINAL declared the appeal inadmissible as ORG had no locus standi to represent the applicant . The judge found that ORG had failed to substantiate its assertion that its lawyers had tried CARDINAL times to procure the attendance of a notary at the GPE detention centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Madrid High Court of Justice upheld this decision , observing that ORG had not demonstrated that it had approached the professional association of notaries for the purpose of requesting the attendance of a duty notary at the GPE detention centre . ORG also found that no evidence had been produced showing that the applicant was unable to avail herself of consular services in her country of origin as provided by CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of Organic Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE on LAW in GPE . In view of the above , ORG declared that the written authority dated DATE , which was valid for the purposes of the applicant \u2019s representation in administrative proceedings , was not sufficient to satisfy the representation requirements under LAW of LAW .
