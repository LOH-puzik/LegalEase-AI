The lawyer \u2019s subsequent appeals on the merits of the case were rejected by ORG and ORG .

The third finding concerned the effect of an appeal lodged by an accused , in the absence of a co - accused \u2019s appeal , on the latter \u2019s application for leave to appeal out of time . ORG held that , as a rule , \u201c in criminal proceedings against several co - accused , the court should not grant an accused \u2019s application for leave to appeal out of time , if it is proved that the [ merits of the ] case were examined upon the appeal lodged by a co - accused \u201d .

On DATE , following CARDINAL accused \u2019s applications for leave to appeal out of time , ORG , relying on its unifying decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , rejected those applications ( decisions nos . GPE and GPE . ORG held that the accused \u2019s lawyers , who had been appointed by family members in accordance with Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , had previously and unsuccessfully appealed against the accused \u2019s conviction in absentia to both ORG and ORG . Consequently , their conviction in absentia \u201c had acquired the force of res judicata \u201d which barred any re - trial .", "CARDINAL . Following extradition from GPE , an accused lodged an application for leave to appeal out of time . On DATE ORG , relying on its unifying decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , rejected that application on the ground that the accused \u2019s family - appointed lawyer had previously and unsuccessfully appealed against the accused \u2019s conviction in absentia to both ORG and ORG ( decision no . GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , relying on its unifying decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , held , inter alia , that the lower court had erred in granting the accused leave to appeal out of time , since the accused \u2019s family - appointed lawyer had previously and unsuccessfully appealed against his conviction in absentia ( decision no . PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a referral request by ORG on the constitutionality of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , ORG decided , by decision no . CARDINAL of DATE ( decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , that the appointment of a lawyer or counsel by a family member should be accepted by the domestic courts in so far as it could be established that this constituted an explicit manifestation of the accused \u2019s intention not to attend the proceedings . The same reasoning applied to an application for leave to appeal out of time made by counsel appointed by the accused \u2019s family . The authorities should establish that the accused did not have effective knowledge of his conviction in absentia and that the accused had effective knowledge of the appointment of counsel by his family .", "CARDINAL . In response to a referral request by ORG on the constitutionality of LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG , ORG , by decision no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( decision no . TIME ) , clarified that the term \u201c the court seized \u201d provided for in LAW referred to the court against which decision the accused is seeking leave to appeal out of time . If the accused sought leave to appeal against an appellate court decision , the application for leave to appeal out of time should be [ lodged with and ] examined by the appellate court instead of ORG . What confused the interpretation of the above term was the use of the words \u201c with the court of appeal \u201d in LAW ORG . ORG decided that those words were unconstitutional and that they could be replaced by the words \u201c with a higher court \u201d . Since LAW ORG did not provide for the parties\u2019 [ direct ] right to appeal against a decision granting leave to appeal out of time ( LAW ORG ) as opposed to the parties\u2019 right to appeal against a decision refusing leave to appeal out of time ( LAW of the CPP ) , ORG further held that the legislature should separately provide for the parties\u2019 right to appeal against the granting of the application for leave to appeal out of time prior to the examination of the merits of the appeal . The law as it stood meant that , in the examination of the merits , ORG would also have to examine the lawfulness and substantiation of the application for leave to appeal out of time , which was not compatible with the nature of proceedings before that instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that an extradited person could make an application for review of the final conviction in absentia under LAW ORG , provided that the Minister of ORG had given an assurance to the requested ORG that the extradited person would be re - tried following extradition ( decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In its reasoning , ORG relied on LAW to LAW which was ratified by GPE and , consequently , took precedence over national law in accordance with the LAW as well as on section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and DATE below ) . In that case , the appellant was extradited from GPE on the strength of the Minister of ORG \u2019s assurance that he would be given a re - trial . ORG accepted his application for review of the conviction in absentia under LAW ORG , in spite of the exhaustive grounds of review listed in LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , relying on its decision no . ORG , accepted an appellant \u2019s application for review of his conviction in absentia under LAW ORG ( decision no . CARDINAL ) .

In both cases , the appellants were separately convicted in absentia by ORG decisions of DATE and DATE . They were extradited on an unspecified date in DATE , CARDINAL from GPE and the other from GPE . Upon extradition , they lodged separate applications for leave to appeal out of time , but these were rejected by ORG on DATE and DATE respectively . ORG held that , having regard to ORG unifying decision no .
