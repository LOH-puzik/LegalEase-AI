The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant started going to the dental practice of Dr A.D. in order to have dental bridges fitted . The treatment involved work on CARDINAL teeth , fitting bridges and crowns and adapting the adjacent teeth .", "CARDINAL . NORP The treatment started in DATE . When the first part of the bridgework was ready , the applicant noticed that it did not fit well . The dentist told her that she could still use it in order to eat and that he would rectify the problem . When the rest of the bridgework was ready , she again noticed that she could not close her mouth and that when she tried to eat it caused her great pain . The bridges were fitted provisionally and it was agreed that they would be permanently fixed at a later stage after being further adapted . Nevertheless , while wearing them she realised that her gums were affected . During DATE , she went to the dental surgery several times in order to have the bridges adapted , but the dentist told her that they were perfect and that all that remained was for them to be fixed permanently , even though she showed him that she could not close her mouth and that her gums were bleeding .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that she had attempted to make a new appointment with Dr DATE on several occasions prior to DATE , but to no avail . During this period , her state of health worsened and she had no money to pay for further dental treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the dentist issued her with a certificate of guarantee for the dental work that he had carried out and he kept the bridges with a view to adapting them . The applicant only received them back DATE , without any change having been made to them .", "CARDINAL . She insisted that she could not use the bridgework , she could not eat while wearing it and that it hurt her gums and caused them to become infected .", "CARDINAL . In a complaint of DATE addressed to ORG , the applicant asked to undergo a medical expert examination in order to determine whether the bridgework was functional , to what extent it affected her teeth and how long she could wear bridges which were only fitted provisionally without this affecting her teeth and gums or causing irreversible speech problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she was informed that her complaint would be reviewed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , she had a consultation with another dentist , PERSON According to the applicant , she was told that the bridgework had not been correctly done and , given all the problems that it had caused her ( infected gums , cuts , pain ) , it was not recommended that the bridges be fixed permanently .", "CARDINAL . DATE , she was asked to undergo an examination by a panel of experts attached to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The second examination took place on DATE . She submitted that she had been told that there had been no need to perform an overly detailed examination , as it could be easily seen that the bridges should not be worn .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE addressed to ORG , she asked to be informed of the findings in the medical expert report . On DATE , ORG replied that the findings of the medical examination that they had carried out were only for the internal use of ORG of ORG . If she wished to obtain an expert report , she had to request CARDINAL from ORG ( hereafter , \u201c the Institute \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . She contacted the ORG , but was informed that a medical expert report could only be requested in the context of judicial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint , asking that a detailed medical expert report be ordered to determine whether there had been medical negligence .

Her complaint was registered with the competent police department on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the police department asked the ORG to draw up a medical expert report in order to determine whether the dental work performed by Dr A.D. had caused injuries which required medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . The Institute , having received a request by the applicant for the examination not to be conducted by ORG , where Dr A.D. had studied , asked ORG to examine the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG issued its report on DATE , after having examined the applicant . The applicant took the report and handed it over to the ORG , which issued a forensic expert report on DATE .", "Its findings were as follows :", "\u201c after having examined S.B. and reviewing the medical papers , it appears that in DATE she underwent treatment to fit a variety of bridges and crowns , which proved to have been carried out incorrectly and inadequately . The attempt to wear the bridges and the subsequent absence of them led to complications and functional disorders ( dental abrasion , chronic marginal periodontitis ) [ made ] very widespread and severe by the dental bridgework , which is currently not correctly adapted to the cervical and axial margins [ of the interproximal surfaces ] .", "...", "We underline that her current state is not completely the fault of the doctor who performed the work , but is also a result of the lack of dental treatment in DATE , a period of time during which the functional disorders [ outlined above were ] aggravated because the bridges were not correctly adapted to the cervical and axial margins [ of the interproximal surfaces ] .", "In order to redo the treatment and put in place correct bridges , it is estimated that ORG would have to undergo TIME of medical treatment ..... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant tried to obtain a copy of that report , but she was told that she could only obtain one once the case had been referred to a court . In the end , she obtained a copy from the investigating officer on CARDINAL October CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contested the findings of this medical expert report , submitting that it had played down the negative findings of the report issued by ORG following that hospital \u2019s examination of her . She also complained that there was no opportunity to have the conclusions reviewed by a medical review board .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor attached to ORG opened a criminal investigation against Dr DATE on charges of causing bodily harm , for which criminal liability was established by LAW , as in force at the material time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same prosecutor put an end to the criminal investigation , reasoning that the applicant \u2019s failure to go to DATE \u2019s dental surgery in order to have the bridges permanently fixed had led to the deterioration of her state of health .", "CARDINAL . That decision was communicated to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint against the decision . The complaint was allowed by a prosecutor \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . The prosecutor held that the case had been investigated on the basis of a crime punishable under LAW ( causing unintentional bodily harm ) , whereas the decision to terminate the proceedings had concerned a crime punishable under LAW ( causing bodily harm ) .", "CARDINAL . The case was referred back to the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the prosecutor terminated the criminal investigation against DATE on the basis that the applicant had failed to lodge a criminal complaint against him within the twomonth timelimit set by LAW . A criminal action for unintentional bodily harm could only be started on the basis of a preliminary complaint by the victim , which had to be lodged within DATE from the date on which the victim had become aware of who the perpetrator was . As the applicant had known who had carried out the dental treatment since DATE but had only lodged her complaint with the prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE , it followed that her complaint was out of time . This decision was upheld by the supervising prosecutor on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s application for judicial review of those decisions was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Her subsequent appeal was allowed by GPE ORG in a final decision of CARDINAL DATE , by which it was established that the prosecutor and the district court had wrongly assessed the evidence . ORG noted that the criminal investigation had not been completed within a reasonable time . It was further established that the evidence in the case file had been sufficient to support the allegation that Dr DATE had committed an act punishable by LAW \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , a crime in respect of which a criminal investigation could be automatically started by a public prosecutor . ORG drew attention to the findings of the medical expert report in respect of the complications caused by the bridgework . It therefore considered that these complications ( the destruction of bone supporting the teeth ) amounted to a permanent physical disability .", "CARDINAL . ORG remitted the case to ORG CARDINAL District Court , instructing that court to consider the case in the light of the crimes punishable under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The district court ordered a new expert report from ORG . The report could not be produced mainly because all the medical documentation from PERSON consulting room , consisting of medical records , xrays , dental prints , and so forth , could not be found . The applicant refused to undergo a new medical examination on the ground that the new report should have been based not only on her examination in DATE but also on the documents existent in her medical file .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found , on the one hand , that the applicable statute of limitation had expired . On the other hand , examining the merits of the case it acquitted the defendant on the basis of the expert report of DATE , finding that \u201c the subsequent behaviour of the injured party , who chose to ignore the medical advice of the defendant , refused the completion of the treatment , in particular the permanent fixing of the dental prosthetics , only wore the prosthetics when eating , as she had personally testified before the court , [ and failed to maintain ] proper oral hygiene , [ as ] underlined by the expert report , ... led to complications , [ which ] can not be blamed on the defendant but on the injured party herself . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG . She sought a requalification of the charges from Article CARDINAL ( causing unintentional bodily harm ) to Article CARDINAL ( causing intentional bodily harm ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It held , inter alia , that the additional evidence requested by the applicant such as the contract , order and invoice for the manufacture of the bridges , as well as dental xrays , was irrelevant . Furthermore , it held that no causal link could be established between the treatment and the injuries sustained by the applicant , which were attributable exclusively to her conduct , that is , ignoring medical advice ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
