He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON who was granted leave to represent the applicant by the President of ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Rules of Court ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant became a civil servant employed by ORG ( ORG , ORG ; henceforth \u201c the GPE \u201d ) where he worked until his retirement on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the Trustees of the ORG ( pankkivaltuusto , bankfullm\u00e4ktige ) introduced an equal retirement DATE for all men and women who entered the service of ORG that date or later . The retirement age for women was thereby raised from DATE to DATE while for men the retirement age remained unchanged . As the rule was not retroactive , the different retirement ages for men and women still applied to those persons who had started employment before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Trustees of the ORG amended the pension rules of the ORG so that men who had joined the ORG prior to CARDINAL DATE and who continued their employment until retirement were also granted an opportunity to lower their retirement age from DATE . For DATE the retirement age was lowered , and the pension accrued prior to DATE was reduced by PERCENT . At its highest the early retirement reduction was PERCENT for DATE . Under the pension rules of CARDINAL DATE the retirement age for women who had joined the ORG prior to CARDINAL DATE was DATE and no reductions applied to pension accrual .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the pension rules of the ORG had provided that a civil servant who applied for early retirement , who had been employed by the ORG prior to CARDINAL DATE and who had DATE of service behind him , had a right to a pension guarantee ( takuuel\u00e4ke , garantipension ) which was PERCENT of the salary . This pension guarantee was increased by PERCENT for DATE the person \u2019s personal retirement age ( henkil\u00f6kohtainen el\u00e4keik\u00e4 , individuell pensions\u00e5lder ) , which was DATE for men and DATE for women , fell short of DATE ( the personal retirement age before DATE ) . This guarantee was significantly reduced as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted a pension , which was reduced by PERCENT , or MONEY ( ORG ) per month , on the ground that he had retired at DATE . This method of calculation was chosen as it was more beneficial to the applicant than calculating his pension with a PERCENT pension guarantee which included the increase of PERCENT as his personal retirement age was DATE . The pension so calculated amounted to ORG CARDINAL per month , starting from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a letter of appeal to the ORG , requesting that his pension be recalculated so that DATE brought him an additional pension of PERCENT per year , thus altogether PERCENT . He claimed that the amendments made to the pension guarantee on DATE had led to discrimination between men and women due to the fact that the theoretical personal retirement age for men was DATE , even if they retired earlier , whereas for women it was always DATE . In the applicant \u2019s situation the percentage for accrued pension was PERCENT while for a woman in the same situation it would be PERCENT higher , at PERCENT . He also complained about the fact that his pension had been reduced by PERCENT , or ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL per month , on the ground that he had retired at DATE . As the ORG could not rectify the pension decision , it referred the case on appeal to ORG ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a new , interim pension decision to the applicant as the pension decision of DATE , which had been appealed against to ORG , was partly rectified . The rectified pension amounted to ORG . The applicant had no right to appeal against this interim pension decision .", "CARDINAL . During the ORG proceedings , the court requested a statement from ORG ( tasa - arvolautakunta , j\u00e4mst\u00e4lldhetsn\u00e4mnden ) . In its statement of CARDINAL DATE the ORG stated that there was a presumption of discrimination in CARDINAL respects : different personal retirement ages for men ( DATE ) and for women ( DATE ) as well as the fact that the reduction was made only in respect of men who retired early , not in respect of women . It further stated that the ORG had not been able to give an acceptable reason for this discrimination . Moreover , the lack of transparency in the calculation of the ORG \u2019s pensions prevented the effective supervision of the principle of equal pay .", "CARDINAL . ORG Valtiokonttori , ORG ) and the NORP ORG Pensionsskyddscentralen ) were also asked to submit a statement in the matter . In its statement of DATE , ORG stated that , had the applicant been subject to LAW ( valtion el\u00e4kelaki , lagen om statens pensioner ) , his pension guarantee would have been calculated in exactly the same manner as in the pension decision of DATE . In its statement of CARDINAL DATE , the NORP ORG noted that the central question was whether the applicant \u2019s personal retirement age was interpreted to be DATE . Concerning private sector pensions , the ORG noted that there might be situations where a man \u2019s pension remained lower than a woman \u2019s who had a similar work history and who retired at the same age .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly accepted , partly rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . As concerned the percentage for accrued pension , the court accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal and ordered that the percentage be PERCENT instead of PERCENT . It found that in this respect the pension was not calculated in an equitable manner in regard to men and women , and that women were put in a more favourable position than men . The applicant \u2019s personal retirement age should also have been DATE , as was the case for women in the same position . As this inequality affected also the time after DATE , the date on which the ORG rules on equal pay became applicable in respect of GPE , the applicant \u2019s pension had been calculated in a manner contrary to ORG law during the period starting from DATE until DATE . In this respect the case was referred back to the ORG for a new decision . As to the rest of the applicant \u2019s complaints , they were rejected . As concerned the reduction of PERCENT due to early retirement , the court found that as the reduction concerned the time before DATE , it was not contrary to ORG law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a new pension decision to the applicant . The percentage for accrued pension was now PERCENT , increasing his personal pension guarantee percentage to PERCENT . The pension calculated in this manner amounted thus to ORG DATE . The applicant did not appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant petitioned the Chancellor of Justice ( oikeuskansleri , justitiekanslern ) , claiming that the ORG decision was illegal as it was not adequately reasoned and thus not transparent in respect of the rejected complaints . Moreover , he complained about the fact that his pension guarantee still remained at PERCENT even though ORG had , on DATE , amended a similar pension decision in the case of PERSON and granted him a pension right amounting to PERCENT on the ground that he fulfilled the pension guarantee requirement as he had completed DATE of service .", "CARDINAL . It is not known whether the applicant \u2019s petition is still pending before the Chancellor of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an extraordinary application with ORG for the reopening of the proceedings as far as they related to the decision of DATE .
