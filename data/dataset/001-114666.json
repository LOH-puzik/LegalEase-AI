On DATE the applicant submitted arguments in writing . He maintained that he had acted in conformity with the law and the LAW , as the relevant law could not be interpreted as allowing ORG to carry out an audit of ORG . The applicant submitted detailed arguments in support of that view . In particular , he submitted that ORG functioned on the basis of a budget approved by the ORG . Responsibility for audit of the use of those funds lay with ORG . Governmental audit and other measures had no legal basis and were contrary to the principle of independence of the judiciary . ORG was neither a public administration body nor a central authority within the meaning of the relevant provisions of LAW DATE . The applicant also relied on ORG on ORG and on ORG decision PL . \u00daS CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant challenged CARDINAL different constitutional judges for bias . In particular , he argued that Judge PERSON had made negative statements about the applicant \u2019s professional skills in the context of the election of the President of ORG . The applicant noted that there had been statements in decision II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE . That decision had been given by a chamber of ORG which included Judge PERSON", "CARDINAL . As regards Judge PERSON , the applicant submitted that he had made several negative statements in the media about the applicant . Thus in DATE that judge had stated , at the time as chairman of a parliamentary committee , that the way the applicant had acted as President of ORG was such that the interest of the judiciary would be best served by replacing him . In a different statement Mr O. had indicated that the applicant could be removed under the law in force and in compliance with LAW . In different proceedings involving the applicant a chamber of ORG had excluded Judge PERSON ( decision ORG of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further objected that Judge PERSON was a member of the same chamber to which Judges PERSON and NORP belonged . Their relations were not neutral .", "CARDINAL . Finally , Judge PERSON had been convicted of a criminal offence , that of failure to pay tax , and had ignored the document of DATE in which ORG ( in plenary session ) had invited him to consider his position as a constitutional judge . The applicant had criticised Judge PERSON on several occasions earlier on that ground . He therefore feared that that judge would lack impartiality in his respect .", "CARDINAL . In reply to the applicant \u2019s objection all the judges stated that they did not consider themselves biased . Judge PERSON indicated that the decision on which the applicant relied contained no statements about his professional skills and that she had never made any such statements personally . Judge PERSON stated that his involvement in different proceedings concerning the applicant was not a relevant reason for his exclusion . Judge PERSON considered irrelevant the applicant \u2019s argument based on the fact that he belonged to the same chamber as Judges PERSON and O. Judge PERSON rejected the applicant \u2019s objection concerning his standing to act as a constitutional judge as unsubstantiated . He acknowledged that the applicant enjoyed freedom of expression , which included the freedom to make critical remarks about constitutional judges . Such criticism did not affect the ability of Judge PERSON to carry out his duties in an impartial manner .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG found that the CARDINAL judges challenged by the parties were not excluded from dealing with the case . The fact that CARDINAL of those judges ( including Judges O. and H. ) had earlier been excluded from other sets of proceedings involving the applicant could not affect the position . ORG had found in particular that the determination of the disciplinary offence allegedly committed by the applicant was within the exclusive jurisdiction of its plenary session . Excessive formalism and overlooking the statements of the individual judges posed the risk that the proceedings would be rendered ineffective . Examination of the case by a plenary session of ORG represented a guarantee that constitutional principles , including independence , would be respected . Furthermore , all the constitutional judges had pledged to decide cases independently and impartially , to the best of their abilities and conscience .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG declared ORG representation admissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again challenged the constitutional judge , PERSON argued that ORG had excluded that judge in different proceedings , in which the applicant had been involved as President of ORG ( III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further challenged the Minister \u2019s standing to initiate disciplinary proceedings against him . He relied on ORG judgment of DATE and ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and argued that he had not acted in a manner contrary to the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court heard the parties and CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( plenary session in which all CARDINAL judges took part ) found the applicant guilty of a serious disciplinary offence ( z\u00e1va\u017en\u00e9 disciplin\u00e1rne previnenie ) under section QUANTITY ) of ORG .

ORG imposed a disciplinary sanction on the applicant under section PERSON ) of ORG , which consisted of a PERCENT reduction of his annual salary .", "The applicant indicated that that sanction corresponded to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In the reasons for its decision ORG referred to its decision GPE . \u00daS CARDINAL of QUANTITY DATE and examined the case from the point of view of the principles of independence of the judiciary , independence of judges , and separation of powers .", "CARDINAL . It held that any external audit in respect of the judicial branch of power had to be limited . Any such audit must have an unequivocal legal basis and a clearly defined scope . Those criteria had been met in the case under consideration .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , ORG referred to sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , and noted that ORG had entered ORG in the register of public administration bodies . That register had been established in accordance with rules applicable within ORG pursuant to ORG ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL . As an organisation using public funds ORG was therefore to be considered a public administration body within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) of LAW DATE . At the same time , it was a central authority within the meaning of section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , as it administered part of the ORG budget .", "CARDINAL . These matters did not affect the position of ORG as the highest judicial authority within the system of ordinary courts . ORG independence in that respect was ensured by constitutional and other legal rules , irrespective of how it was financed . The way ORG was financed and subsequent monitoring of how it used public funds did not therefore affect its independence as a judicial authority .", "CARDINAL . NORP The position of ORG as regards its administration and functioning was similar to that of other legal persons using public funds . The audit which ORG had intended to carry out did not therefore threaten the judicial independence of ORG , as it exclusively related to the way public monies had been spent and how ORG property was administered , including audit of the elimination of the shortcomings which had been identified in the course of the previous audit , in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considered it irrelevant that the ordinary courts were of a different legal opinion as to the power of ORG to carry out an audit , and that they had quashed the decision by which ORG had imposed a fine on ORG .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with section PERSON ) of LAW DATE , the decision was taken by a secret vote . It indicated that for that reason judges\u2019 separate opinions would not be attached to it .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the above proceedings the applicant further submitted that CARDINAL of the constitutional judges who had found him guilty of a serious disciplinary offence , PERSON , lacked impartiality . That judge had been an unsuccessful candidate in the election in which the applicant had been elected President of ORG . PERSON had subsequently challenged that election before ORG . The applicant had not challenged Judge PERSON , as he had expected that the latter would withdraw , as he had in several other constitutional proceedings to which the applicant was or had been a party .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following a submission by CARDINAL former employees of ORG , the applicant , in his capacity as Minister of ORG , ordered ORG to conduct a check of how ORG was complying with the legislation and regulations governing civil servants . The applicant initiated disciplinary proceedings against the then President of ORG , who had refused to allow the check to be conducted . ORG discharged the President of ORG in proceedings filed as PL \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the above submission of CARDINAL DATE the then Minister of ORG made CARDINAL other representations in which she asked ORG to find the applicant guilty of serious disciplinary offences .", "CARDINAL . In the representation dated DATE it was imputed to the applicant that he had failed to ensure the allocation of cases to judges within ORG by means of random assignment . On CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the representation admissible ( proceedings ORG . \u00daS PERSON ) . It dismissed the Minister \u2019s and the applicant \u2019s requests for exclusion of constitutional judges on the basis of the same facts as in the disciplinary proceedings relating to the present case . The proceedings were stayed on DATE pending the outcome of the proceedings before ORG on the present application .", "CARDINAL . In her representation of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG imputed serious disciplinary offences to the applicant on CARDINAL counts . They related to allocation of cases to judges . The Minister relied , inter alia , on ORG finding of DATE , concluding that a party \u2019s right to a hearing by a tribunal established by law had been breached as a result of a change in ORG judges .", "CARDINAL . In the context of the proceedings on that representation ( ORG . ORG ) the Minister of ORG challenged CARDINAL judges for bias . The applicant raised a similar objection in respect of CARDINAL different judges . On DATE the Constitutional Court excluded CARDINAL of the judges challenged by the Minister of ORG and one of the judges challenged by the applicant ( Judge PERSON ) . Those judges had been excluded earlier , in different sets of proceedings , because of their relationship with the applicant or their attitude towards him . It further dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for exclusion of Judges PERSON and ORG , as no majority had been reached in the vote .

The decision indicated that several constitutional judges had criticised the decision taken in proceedings file no . GPE . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL not to exclude any of the judges challenged by the parties . The view was expressed that although the CARDINAL judges who had been found to lack impartiality in earlier sets of proceedings due to their relation to or attitude towards the applicant were excluded from the proceedings filed as ORG . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the plenary session of ORG would still have enough judges to decide on the Minister \u2019s representation of CARDINAL DATE . CARDINAL judges joined dissenting opinions to that decision . On DATE ORG decided that it was not appropriate to stay the proceedings filed as ORG . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of ORG initiated a new set of disciplinary proceedings , on the ground that the applicant had failed to lodge an appeal in the civil proceedings in which the first - instance court had ordered ORG , as the authority representing the ORG who was the defendant , to pay compensation for non - pecuniary damage to the plaintiffs , amounting to MONEY ( proceedings filed as ORG . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .

On DATE the ORG admitted the Minister \u2019s representation and dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for the proceedings to be stayed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted a compilation of media articles and transcripts of broadcasts covering the period from DATE to DATE . It is CARDINAL pages long and relates mainly to the differences of opinion as to what authority should carry out the audit of ORG and the ensuing disciplinary proceedings against the applicant , including statements by ORG and the Minister of Justice .", "CARDINAL .

The Minister was persuaded that such an audit would not in any way undermine ORG independence . The audit concerned exclusively the use of public funds , and the applicant \u2019s position cast serious doubt on the trustworthiness and functioning of the judiciary as a whole . The Minister of ORG stated that she had made the representation on the initiative of the Minister of Finance and also on the basis of information she had obtained from the files of ORG .

The generally accepted criterion for disqualification is the reasonable apprehension of bias .

Depending on the circumstances , a reasonable apprehension of bias might be thought to arise ( a ) if there is personal friendship or animosity between the judge and any member of the public involved in the case ; ( b ) if the judge is closely acquainted with any member of the public involved in the case , particularly if that person \u2019s credibility may be significant in the outcome of the case ; ( c ) if , in a case where the judge has to determine an individual \u2019s credibility , he had rejected that person \u2019s evidence in a previous case in terms so outspoken that they throw doubt on the judge \u2019s ability to approach that person \u2019s evidence with an open mind on a later occasion ; ( d ) if the judge has expressed views , particularly in the course of the hearing , on any question at issue in such strong and unbalanced terms that they cast reasonable doubts on the judge \u2019s ability to try the issue with an objective judicial mind ; or ( e ) if , for any other reason , there might be a real ground for doubting the judge \u2019s ability to ignore extraneous considerations , prejudices and predilections , and the judge \u2019s ability to bring an objective judgment to bear on the issues .
