They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "Mr PERSON owns PERCENT and Mr PERSON owns PERCENT of the active shares of a limited company , ORG , which in turn owns a restaurant , PERSON . Both applicants are involved in the DATE running of the restaurant which is open for lunch , dinner and , during DATE , a discotheque .", "During DATE ORG ) in GPE carried out a tax audit of the restaurant covering the period from DATE . It found that the bookkeeping of the restaurant was severely deficient and that it had not kept the necessary evidence of the business \u2019s expenses and sales . Based on certain calculations and statistics , ORG estimated that the restaurant had omitted to account for and declare all its sales in its bookkeeping and tax returns . Consequently , it found it necessary to make a discretionary assessment of the restaurant \u2019s unrecorded sales , which it calculated at SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) and to adjust its tax returns accordingly .", "On DATE , on the basis of the results from the tax audit , ORG decided to increase the applicants\u2019 income from business for the tax assessment DATE and DATE and to impose tax surcharges on them amounting , in total , for Mr GPE to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) and for Mr PERSON to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) . As the applicants , together with a third person , were the main owners of the company which owned the restaurant , and as they were in charge of its DATE running , ORG found that most of the unrecorded sales from the restaurant were to be considered as taxable income , in the form of salary , for the applicants and the third person . Moreover , since the applicants had failed to provide correct and complete information concerning their income , ORG considered it justified to impose tax surcharges on them and found no grounds on which to remit the surcharges .", "In DATE the applicants and the company appealed against the decisions to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , disputing ORG findings and claiming that there were no grounds for changing their tax returns or imposing tax surcharges on them . In both their appeals and their supplementary submissions , the applicants stated that they wished to rely on the same grounds as the company had in its appeal and supplementary submissions to the court . The applicants and the company were represented by the same lawyer .", "On DATE ORG made the obligatory reassessment of its decisions of DATE but decided not to change them . Following this , it forwarded the appeals to ORG .", "On DATE the applicants requested ORG to grant them legal aid to engage a lawyer to represent them . They referred to LAW ) of the LAW , claiming that since their cases concerned tax surcharges they had a right to free legal aid . The applicants stated that they lacked the means to pay for a lawyer since they had been obliged to pay the additional taxes and tax surcharges , as they had not been granted respite from the payment . Furthermore , they alleged that , as immigrants in GPE , they did not have a complete command of NORP or knowledge of the NORP legal system and that their cases were complicated and involved significant amounts of money for them .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 request . It first noted that , according to LAW R\u00e4ttshj\u00e4lpslagen , DATE ) , the possibilities for a businessman to be granted legal aid in tax matters were very limited and it could only be granted if there were special reasons . It further observed that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 FAC ) of the ORG laid down that a person was entitled to free legal assistance only if he could not afford it himself and the interests of justice so required . It also noted that the domestic case - law indicated that there was no absolute right to legal aid in cases involving tax surcharges but that regard must be had to the amount at stake ( the tax surcharges ) and the complexity and nature of the case . Turning to the particular circumstances of the ORG cases , the court considered that the material invoked by the parties was relatively voluminous but that the legal questions at issue and , in relation to these , the ancillary questions concerning tax surcharges were not of such a character as to warrant a grant of legal aid , under either NORP law or the Convention .", "The applicants appealed against the decisions to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , repeating their claims and adding that , having regard to their financial situation , the tax surcharges amounted to substantial amounts for them . They added that they needed professional help to show that ORG audit report and decisions were flawed .", "On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decisions in full .", "The applicants lodged a further appeal to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) , which , on DATE , refused them leave to appeal .", "The tax proceedings are still pending before the national courts .", "The relevant rules concerning legal aid in GPE are to be found in LAW ( R\u00e4ttshj\u00e4lpslagen , DATE hereinafter \u201c the Act \u201d ) . Section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW provides that legal aid may be granted if the person applying for it is in need of legal assistance and can not obtain it by other means . Moreover , pursuant to LAW CARDINAL of the LAW , legal aid may only be granted if it is reasonable for the ORG to contribute to the costs , having regard to the nature and importance of the matter , the value of the contentious issue and other relevant circumstances . In any event , in matters concerning taxes and various fees for taxes , legal aid may be granted only when there are special reasons ( LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , point CARDINAL ) .", "Furthermore , section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW stipulates that legal aid may not be granted to a person who is , or has been , a businessman where the contentious issue has arisen in connection with the business , unless there are special reasons relating to the nature and limited scope of the business , his or her financial and personal situation and other relevant circumstances . The LAW defines a businessman as a natural person who runs a business of an economic nature that can be described as professional , or who has a deciding influence over a legal entity which runs such a business ( section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "From the case - law of the national courts , it appears that when a case involves tax surcharges , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(c ) of the LAW is applicable , but that consideration must be given to the amount of the imposed tax surcharges as well as to the nature and character of the case . Moreover , only if there is a risk of particularly serious consequences or if complicated legal questions arise should free legal assistance be granted on the basis of the LAW in cases involving tax surcharges ( PERSON \u00c5rsbok DATE ref DATE ) .", "Section CARDINAL of the Administrative Court Procedure Act ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) requires the administrative courts to ensure that the circumstances of each case are clarified to the extent that its character demands .
