{"ITEMID": "001-155824", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "LIE", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2015, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF A.K. v. LIECHTENSTEIN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Constitutional proceedings;Article 6-1 - Impartial tribunal);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed (Article 41 - Pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction);Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE , the applicant and GPE have been involved in legal disputes against each other concerning the property rights in PERCENT of the bearer shares in both the EMK stock corporation and the EMK Engineering stock corporation , companies resident and registered in GPE which trade in building units .", "CARDINAL . By an immediately enforceable interim injunction dated DATE , taken in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG granted GPE \u2019s request to prohibit ORG to register certain changes concerning the EMK Engineering stock corporation which had been decided in the corporation \u2019s extraordinary ORG meeting of DATE ( file no . CARDINAL.CG.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . It thereby confirmed its provisional order of CARDINAL DATE to that effect . The ORG notably prohibited registering the decisions taken in that meeting that GPE had been voted out of his office as a representative and member of the corporation \u2019s supervisory board with power to represent the corporation and that the applicant had been elected managing director of the corporation with power to represent the corporation alone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that decision on the applicant \u2019s request and the case was remitted to ORG for a further investigation of the facts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a fresh identical interim injunction . It stated that the interim order served to secure GPE \u2019s claim in the main proceedings for a declaration that the decisions taken in the EMK Engineering stock corporation \u2019s extraordinary ORG meeting of CARDINAL July DATE were null and void and for a prohibition of the entry of those decisions in the real property and commercial register .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed that the applicant had not obtained property of PERCENT of the bearer shares in the EMK Engineering stock corporation and had not therefore validly represented PERCENT of the shares in the corporation \u2019s extraordinary ORG meeting . The decisions taken in that meeting were thus unlawful . It further found that interim injunctions under LAW could also be taken in order to secure claims for a declaration ( Feststellungsanspr\u00fcche ) if such a measure was necessary to preserve the status quo of either an object or a legal relationship . For such interim orders the restriction that interim injunctions should not anticipate the outcome of the main proceedings did not apply . In the present case , it was necessary to maintain the status quo in the commercial register in order to prevent GPE from suffering irreversible damage . GPE could suffer such damage if the changes in question were made in the real property and commercial register as dispositions could then be taken for the stock corporation without his participation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against ORG decision dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that judges PERSON . , PERSON , ORG and PERSON would deliberate on his complaint in private on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By submissions dated DATE , which were received at the court on DATE , the applicant , who was not represented by counsel at that stage of the proceedings , lodged motions for bias against all CARDINAL judges called upon to decide on his complaint and against the secretary in charge ( PERSON ) , PERSON", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued , in particular , that ORG had to his disadvantage not quashed previous decisions of the lower courts in related proceedings . Moreover , he complained that it had taken LAW DATE to assign the judges who were to decide on his complaint despite the importance of the proceedings for him and that the court discriminated against NORP nationals .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in the applicant \u2019s submission , judges PERSON , PERSON and PERSON and secretary PERSON had failed to take measures to remedy the disadvantages resulting from the fact that the commercial register did not reflect his rights concerning the EMK Engineering stock corporation and had arbitrarily disregarded his rights under LAW no . CARDINAL to the LAW in previous related proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that , for different reasons , the CARDINAL judges of ORG individually were not impartial . As regards the court \u2019s president , judge PERSON , the applicant complained that the latter had not granted his constitutional complaint suspensory effect and had refused to order interim measures in related proceedings . Furthermore , judge PERSON was a member of different committees and commissions of which judges of ORG , which had given a decision contested by him in the main proceedings , and judge PERSON , who was a judge at ORG and GPE \u2019s brother , were equally members .", "CARDINAL . In the applicant \u2019s submission , judge PERSON . , for his part , was biased because he worked for the Government in that he drew up expert reports on constitutional questions and taught at seminars organised by the Government . He further worked with judge PERSON on a regular basis .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further stressed that judge PERSON was a member of the supervisory board of a state - owned company and was therefore not independent and impartial .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON , for his part , had been a professor at ORG and was , therefore , not independent as he had worked for the Government and as judges had short terms of office . Moreover , he was biased as he was a good friend of judge PERSON , GPE \u2019s brother .", "CARDINAL . Finally , judge PERSON , in his law firm , was the partner of a lawyer against whom the applicant had brought proceedings concerning an inheritance . Another lawyer of that law firm had already represented the EMK Engineering stock corporation . Moreover , judge PERSON had previously worked as a lawyer in judge PERSON \u2019s law firm .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the judges of ORG made statements on the applicant \u2019s motions for bias . Judge PERSON . stated that he had not drawn up any expert reports for the Government since his appointment as a judge . Judge S. submitted that he did not draw considerable income from his work as a member of the supervisory board of a state - owned stock corporation . Judge PERSON explained that he did not have any knowledge of whether his partner in the law firm , who was currently absent , was involved in unrelated legal proceedings with the applicant . His work for judge PERSON dated back DATE and he had been working as a self - employed counsel for DATE already since then .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , composed of judges PERSON . , PERSON , ORG and PERSON , dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion for bias against them ( file no . PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that , in accordance with the principle that , if possible , a motion for bias should not be decided upon by the challenged judge , the challenged judges , respectively , had not participated in the deliberations and the decision on the respective motion for bias against them , which had been decided upon by the CARDINAL remaining judges .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considered that the fact alone that judges PERSON , PERSON and PERSON had already taken part in decisions finding against the applicant in related proceedings did not suffice to substantiate that there were objectively justified doubts as to their impartiality . Likewise , the fact that the judges were elected for DATE did not compromise their impartiality .", "CARDINAL . NORP The independence of the judges of the Constitutional Court vis - \u00e0 - vis the executive was guaranteed by LAW . The applicant further had not substantiated that the executive had influenced the judges of ORG in the present proceedings in any way . The fact that some of the judges had previously worked for the executive did not suggest that the executive had influenced the present proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the fact that the challenged judges worked together with ORG brother , the vice - president of ORG , on a regular basis and were friends of the latter did not objectively cast doubts on their impartiality in the circumstances of the present case . In a small country like GPE , excessively strict standards in this respect would disproportionately obstruct the administration of justice .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , composed of judges PERSON . , PERSON , PERSON allowed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint in so far as he had complained under LAW about the unreasonable length of the proceedings and dismissed the remainder of his complaint ( file no . PERSON ) . The applicant complained about that judgment in a new , separate application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) to the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
