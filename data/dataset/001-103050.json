The delegation also met a man who had spent DATE in CARDINAL of the cells with no change of clothes , no access to fresh air nor any exercise nor any purposeful activity . \u201d", "Following its visit to GPE in DATE , the ORG noted that there had been no improvement as regards the manner in which persons detained were treated and reported cases of ill - treatment at the hands of the police officers in the deportation cell at FAC :", "\u201c At Petru PERSON detention facility , a NORP national alleged that he had been slapped and kicked by the escorting police officers in the deportation cell at FAC after he had refused deportation . He further alleged that they had compressed his throat , pressed their fingers into his eye sockets , twisted his hands behind his back and kicked him on the back of the legs , the buttocks and in the abdomen , after which he had fainted . On examination by CARDINAL of the medical members of the delegation , the following injuries were observed : a small abrasion ( QUANTITY ) on the lower lip and a red linear contusion on the left cheek beneath the eye ( QUANTITY ) , which had CARDINAL abrasions therein ; diffuse areas of purplish bruising on both sides of the forehead and a reddish bruise ( QUANTITY ) on the centre of the chest ; swelling over the thyroid cartilage on the front of the neck and swelling of the outer parts of both upper arms ; on the right leg , beneath and lateral to the kneecap , a diffuse area of purplish bruising with a reddish area ( MONEY ) in its proximal part . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the time of its visits in DATE and DATE , ORG described the detention centre next to the airport as follows :", "\u201c The facility is divided into CARDINAL sectors . The first consists of CARDINAL cells , each approximately QUANTITY m. There is CARDINAL window in each cell , and the sector has CARDINAL separate toilets and showers . The second consists of CARDINAL large cells , each approximately QUANTITY m. There are separate toilets in the corridor outside the cells . The third sector consists of CARDINAL very small cells , each approximately QUANTITY m. The cells are arranged in a row , off a small corridor where a card phone is situated . On the opposite side of the corridor there are CARDINAL toilets and CARDINAL showers .", "During the DATE visit , ORG delegates were able to view the first CARDINAL sectors where GPE II returnees and other asylum - seekers were being held . The delegates observed that detainees were held in conditions of severe overcrowding and that the physical conditions were inadequate . Many asylum - seekers reported that they had been verbally abused by police officers .", "During the organisation \u2019s visit in DATE , ORG representatives were allowed to visit all CARDINAL sectors . The police authorities told delegates that the first sector was used for the detention of GPE II returnees and other asylum - seekers , the second for the detention of female irregular migrants convicted for attempting to leave GPE with false documents and the third for the detention of male irregular migrants convicted for attempting to leave GPE with false documents .", "During the DATE visit , there were CARDINAL asylum - seekers held in the first sector ( CARDINAL male and one female ) but no NORP returnees . In the second sector , CARDINAL females were held in one cell , QUANTITY of them pregnant . CARDINAL of the pregnant women complained several times that she could not breathe , and was asking when she could go outside her cell . In another cell there was a man with an injured leg . Those held in the first and second sector told ORG delegates that the police rarely unlocked the doors of their sectors . As a result , they did not have access to the water cooler situated outside , and were forced to drink water from the toilets . At the time of the visit approximately CARDINAL detainees were held in the third sector in conditions of severe overcrowding . Among them , delegates found a GPE II returnee . There were CARDINAL cells in total . The delegates were able to view CARDINAL of the cells , each of which contained CARDINAL bed ( a concrete base with a mattress on top ) and held CARDINAL individuals . There were not enough mattresses , and detainees slept on the floor . As a result of the overcrowding and mattresses on the floor , there was no space to move around . The detainees told ORG that , because of the lack of space , they could not all lie down and sleep at the same time . While the cells viewed had windows , the overcrowding meant that the ventilation was not sufficient . The heat in the cells was unbearable .", "Detainees held in the third sector told ORG that the police officers did not allow them to walk in the corridor outside their cells , and that there were severe difficulties in gaining access to the toilets . At the time of the organisation \u2019s visit , detainees were knocking on the cell doors and desperately asking the police to let them go to the toilet . ORG delegates observed that some people who were allowed to go to the toilet were holding a plastic water bottle CARDINAL or almost completely full of urine . The police authorities admitted that in every cell detainees used plastic bottles for their toilet needs which they emptied when they were allowed to go to the toilet . The delegates also observed that the toilet facilities were dirty and the CARDINAL showers had neither door nor curtain , and thus lacked any privacy .", "The FAC police authorities told ORG that the imposition of prison sentences on irregular migrants or asylum - seekers arrested at the airport for using false documents , who were unable to pay trial expenses , contributed to the overcrowding of the detention area .", "At the time of the visit , the organisation observed a complete lack of hygiene products such as soap , shampoo and toilet paper in all sectors . In addition , many of those detained told the delegates they had no access to their luggage , so they did not have their personal belongings , including changes of clothes . Some said that , as a result , they had been wearing the same clothes for DATE . Furthermore , there was no opportunity for outside exercise at all . CARDINAL individuals complained that they did not have access to their medication because it was in their luggage . Similar reports were received during the DATE visit . In addition , concerns regarding access to medical assistance remained unchanged since DATE . The airport authorities told ORG that there was no regular doctor in the facility and medical care was provided only when requested by a detainee by calling the airport \u2019s first aid doctors . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following their visit on DATE , M\u00e9decins sans GPE \u2013 GPE published a report which also described overcrowding in the detention centre ( CARDINAL detainees ) and appalling sanitary and hygiene conditions . In CARDINAL cells for families , with a capacity of CARDINAL people , CARDINAL people were being held without ventilation and with CARDINAL toilets and showers .", "CARDINAL . According to the people interviewed for the reports listed in paragraph CARDINAL above , when asylum - seekers were released the practice varied . At FAC they were either given a \u201c pink card \u201d directly or they were told to report to the LOC police headquarters to get one . Sometimes those in GPE for the first time were directly issued with an order to leave the country within DATE . If they arrived and were detained elsewhere in the country , the practice was more consistent and consisted of issuing them with an order to leave the country and sending them to a large city like GPE or GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In any event , it appears that they are given no information about the possibilities of accommodation . In particular , the people interviewed reported that no one told them that they should inform the authorities that they had nowhere to live , which is a prerequisite for the authorities to try to find them some form of accommodation .", "CARDINAL . NORP Those persons who have no family or relations in GPE and can not afford to pay rent just sleep on the streets . As a result , many homeless asylum - seekers , mainly single men but also families , have illegally occupied public spaces , like the makeshift camp in GPE , which was evacuated and torn down in DATE , or the old appeal court and certain parks in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Many of those interviewed reported a permanent state of fear of being attacked and robbed , and of complete destitution generated by their situation ( difficulty in finding food , no access to sanitary facilities , etc . ) .", "CARDINAL . Generally , the people concerned depend for their subsistence on civil society , ORG and some religious institutions .", "CARDINAL . Having a \u201c pink card \u201d does not seem to be of any benefit in obtaining assistance from the ORG and there are major bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining a temporary work permit . For example , to obtain a tax number the applicant has to prove that he has a permanent place of residence , which effectively excludes the homeless from the employment market . In addition , the health authorities do not appear to be aware of their obligations to provide asylum - seekers with free medical treatment or of the additional health risks faced by these people .", "In DATE , ORG reported :", "\u201c Asylum - seekers of all nationalities who manage to obtain and maintain their [ pink ] cards have little hope of receiving support from the government during the often protracted time their claims are pending . The homeless and destitute among them often lack housing accommodation and other basic forms of social assistance , in part , because GPE only has reception centre spaces for CARDINAL of the most needy and vulnerable asylum - seekers . Although CARDINAL of the CARDINAL reception centres are reserved for unaccompanied children , ORG met unaccompanied children , among others , who were living in the streets , parks , and in abandoned buildings because of a lack of accommodations and other social services . A DATE NORP boy registered with the police , but at the time ORG interviewed him was living on the street with no assistance whatsoever : \u2018 I still do n\u2019t have a place for me to live . The lawyers gave me an appointment to have a place to live . Now I sleep out on the streets . I do n\u2019t live anywhere . I have cold in my body . I do n\u2019t feel safe .

They observed : \u2018 The large majority of asylum - seekers remain completely without social assistance with regard to accommodation and/or other forms of social assistance . GPE is in practice a country where asylum - seekers and refugees are almost entirely left to their own devices.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The reports mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above describe the numerous obstacles that bar access to the asylum procedure or make it very difficult in practice for both first - time arrivals and persons transferred under LAW who pass through FAC .", "CARDINAL . The first - hand accounts collected by international organisations and non - governmental organisations and the resulting conclusions may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Very few applications for asylum are lodged directly with the security services at FAC because of the lack of staff but also , in certain cases , because of the lack of information that the services even exist .", "CARDINAL . When they arrive at the airport , asylum - seekers are systematically placed directly in detention before their situation has been clarified .", "CARDINAL . When they are released , those who have come to GPE for the first time are sometimes issued with an order to leave the country , printed in NORP , without having first been informed of the possibility of applying for asylum or contacting a lawyer for that purpose . It has even been known to happen that persons returned under LAW who had applied for asylum when they first arrived in GPE were issued with an order to leave the country on the ground that , in their absence , all the time - limits for lodging an appeal had expired .", "CARDINAL . At FAC several organisations have reported that the information brochure on the asylum procedure is not always given to persons returned under LAW . Nor are they given any other information about the procedures and deadlines or the possibility of contacting a lawyer or a non - governmental organisation to seek legal advice .", "CARDINAL . On the contrary , the police use \u201c tricks \u201d to discourage them from following the procedure . For example , according to several witnesses the police led them to believe that declaring an address was an absolute condition for the procedure to go ahead .", "CARDINAL . The DATE time - limit asylum - seekers are given to report to police headquarters is in fact far too short in practice . The offices concerned are practically inaccessible because of the number of people waiting and because asylum applications can be lodged only on DATE in DATE . In addition , the selection criteria at the entrance to the offices are arbitrary and there is no standard arrangement for giving priority to those wishing to enter the building to apply for asylum . There are occasions when CARDINAL of people turn up on DATE and CARDINAL applications are registered for DATE . At the present time CARDINAL applications are being registered per day , while CARDINAL people are waiting outside to complete various formalities . This results in a very long wait before obtaining an appointment for a first interview .", "CARDINAL . Because of the clearly insufficient provision for interpretation , the first interview is often held in a language the asylum - seeker does not understand . The interviews are superficial and limited in substance to asking the asylum - seeker why he came to GPE , with no questions at all about the situation in his country of origin . Further , in the absence of any legal aid the applicants can not afford a legal adviser and are very seldom accompanied by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . As to access to the ORG , although any asylum - seeker can , in theory , lodge an application with the ORG and request the application of Rule CARDINAL of ORG , it appears that the shortcomings mentioned above are so considerable that access to the Court for asylum - seekers is almost impossible . This would explain the small number of applications the ORG receives from asylum - seekers and the small number of requests it receives for interim measures against GPE .", "CARDINAL . The above - listed reports also denounce the deficiencies in the procedure for examining asylum applications .", "CARDINAL . In the vast majority of cases the applications are rejected at first instance because they are considered to have been lodged for economic reasons . Research carried out by the ORG in DATE reveals that out of CARDINAL decisions taken at first instance , CARDINAL were negative and worded in a stereotyped manner with no reference whatsoever to information about the countries of origin , no explanation of the facts on which the decision was based and no legal reasoning .", "CARDINAL . The reports denounce the lack of training , qualifications and/or competence of the police officers responsible for examining the asylum applications . In DATE , according to the ORG , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL officers at the LOC police headquarters responsible for examining asylum applications were specialists in asylum matters .", "CARDINAL . According to several accounts , it was not unusual for the decision rejecting the application and indicating the time - limit for appeal to be notified in a document written in NORP at the time of issue or renewal of the \u201c pink card \u201d . As the cards were renewed DATE , the asylum - seekers did not understand that their applications had in fact been rejected and that they had the right to appeal . If they failed to do so within the prescribed deadline , however , they were excluded from the procedure , found themselves in an illegal situation and faced the risk of being arrested and placed in detention pending their expulsion .", "CARDINAL . ORG for Human Rights and the ORG also emphasised that the notification procedure for \u201c persons with no known address \u201d did not work in practice . Thus , many asylum - seekers were unable to follow the progress of their applications and missed the deadlines .", "CARDINAL . The time taken for asylum applications to be examined at first instance and on appeal is very long . According to the ORG , in DATE , CARDINAL cases at first instance and CARDINAL cases on appeal were affected by delays . According to information sent to the Commissioner by ORG , the total number of asylum applications pending had reached CARDINAL in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Being opposed , inter alia , to the abolition in DATE of the second - instance role played by the refugee advisory committees ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG announced in a press release on DATE that it would no longer be taking part in the asylum procedure in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As regards appeals to ORG , the reports mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above denounce the excessive length of the proceedings . According to ORG for Human Rights , the average duration at the present time was DATE . They also emphasise that an appeal against a negative decision does not automatically suspend the expulsion order and that separate proceedings have to be initiated in order to seek a stay of execution . These can last between DATE and DATE . Furthermore , they consider that the review exercised by ORG is not extensive enough to cover the essential details of complaints alleging Convention violations .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , they remark that in practice the legal aid system for lodging an appeal with ORG does not work . It is hindered by the reluctance and the resulting lack of lawyers on the legal aid list because of the length of the proceedings and the delays in their remuneration .", "CARDINAL . The risk of refoulement of asylum - seekers by the NORP authorities , be it indirectly , to GPE , or directly to the country of origin , is a constant concern . The reports listed in paragraph CARDINAL above , as well as the press , have regularly reported this practice , pointing out that the NORP authorities deport , sometimes collectively , both asylum - seekers who have not yet applied for asylum and those whose applications have been registered and who have been issued with \u201c pink cards \u201d . Expulsions to GPE are effected either at the unilateral initiative of the NORP authorities , at the border with GPE , or in the framework of the readmission agreement between GPE and GPE . It has been established that several of the people thus expelled were then sent back to GPE by the NORP authorities without their applications for asylum being considered .", "CARDINAL . Several reports highlight the serious risk of refoulement as soon as the decision is taken to reject the asylum application , because an appeal to ORG has no automatic suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sent a letter to the NORP Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy criticising the deficiencies in the asylum procedure and the conditions of reception of asylum - seekers in GPE and recommending the suspension of transfers to GPE . A copy was sent to ORG . The letter read as follows ( extracts ) :", "\u201c The ORG is aware that the ORG , in its decision in GPE v. GPE [ ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ] ... recently decided that the transfer of an asylum - seeker to GPE did not present a risk of refoulement for the purposes of LAW . However , the ORG did not give judgment on compliance by GPE with its obligations under international law on refugees . In particular , the ORG said nothing about whether the conditions of reception of asylum - seekers were in conformity with regional and international standards of human rights protection , or whether asylum - seekers had access to fair consideration of their asylum applications , or even whether refugees were effectively able to exercise their rights under LAW . The ORG believes that this is still not the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It concluded :", "\u201c For the above reasons the ORG maintains its assessment of the NORP asylum system and the recommendations formulated in its position of DATE , namely that governments should refrain from transferring asylum - seekers to GPE and take responsibility for examining the corresponding asylum applications themselves , in keeping with LAW of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . GPE has been embroiled in an armed conflict since DATE . The present situation is based on the civil war of DATE , during which the mujahideen ( the veterans of the anti - NORP resistance , many of whose leaders now hold public office ) fought the ORG movement , and the fall - out from the attacks of DATE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the situation in GPE can be described as an intensifying armed conflict accompanied by serious and widespread targeted human rights violations . The NORP government and their international allies are pitted against groups of insurgents including the ORG , the PERSON and ORG . A complex array of legal and illegal armed groups and organised criminal groups also play an important role in the conflict . Despite efforts at reform , GPE is still faced with widespread corruption , lack of due process and an ineffective administration of justice . Human rights violations are rarely addressed or remedied by the justice system and impunity continues to be pervasive . The progressive strengthening of religious conservatism has pressured the NORP government and ORG into curtailing fundamental rights and freedoms .", "CARDINAL . In the above - mentioned document , the ORG states that most of the fighting is still in the south and south - eastern part of the country . In the south , the provinces of GPE and GPE , ORG strongholds , are the scene of fierce fighting . The conflict raging in the southern , south - eastern and eastern regions has displaced the population and caused numerous civilian casualties .", "CARDINAL . There is more and more evidence that the people implementing or thought to be implementing government projects and the non - governmental organisations or civil firms actually working or thought to be working with the international forces in GPE face a very high risk of being targeted by anti - government factions .", "CARDINAL . As to the possibilities of internal relocation , the ORG points out that no region of GPE is safe and that even if one were to be found , it might not be accessible as many of the main roads in GPE are dangerous .", "CARDINAL . In GPE the situation has deteriorated . Rising economic emigration is putting increasing pressure on the employment market and on resources such as infrastructure , land and drinking water . The situation is exacerbated by persistent drought , with the resultant spread of water - related diseases . Endemic unemployment and under - employment limit many people \u2019s ability to cater for their basic needs .", "CARDINAL . The ORG generally considers internal relocation as a reasonable alternative solution when protection can be provided in the relocation area by the person \u2019s family in the broad sense , their community or their tribe . However , these forms of protection are limited to regions where family or tribal links exist . Even in such situations , case - by - case analysis is necessary , as traditional social bonds in the country have been worn away by DATE of war , mass displacement of refugees and the growing rural exodus .", "CARDINAL . Bearing in mind the recommendations contained in these directives , the NORP body responsible for examining asylum applications ( ORG ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) stated in a document published in DATE , entitled ORG , that they granted protection to a large number of NORP asylum - seekers from particularly dangerous regions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
