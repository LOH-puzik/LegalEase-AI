{"ITEMID": "001-22164", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "AUERBACH v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr ORG , is fiscal consultant . He is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Professor M.W.C. PERSON of ORG of ORG , who also works as a fiscal advisor in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , the applicant \u2019s employers provided him with a company car . The car \u2019s catalogue price was ORG . CARDINAL . The applicant used this car DATE a week for transport from his home to his office . The distance between both places was QUANTITY . The applicant further used this car for private purposes . The distances travelled for private purposes in DATE exceeded QUANTITY .", "On DATE , ORG issued the income tax assessment ( aanslag inkomstenbelasting ) for DATE in respect of the applicant . In the determination of the applicant \u2019s taxable income for DATE , ORG had added \u2013 pursuant to the DATE LAW ( Wet op de Inkomstenbelasting ; \u201c FAC \u201d ) as amended in DATE an amount of ORG . CARDINAL ( i.e. PERCENT of the catalogue price of the applicant \u2019s company car ) to the applicant \u2019s taxable income .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with ORG against the DATE assessment . He complained that the PERCENT increase of his taxable income instead of PERCENT was contrary to the principle of equality ( gelijkheidsbeginsel ) as guaranteed by , inter alia , LAW . He submitted that , under LAW , there is a difference in treatment between CARDINAL categories of persons who are in a same situation , namely \u2013 on the one hand \u2013 persons who , because of LAW ITA , have to add to their taxable income PERCENT of the catalogue price of the car placed at their disposal ; these persons are taxed for their private use of this car ( PERCENT ) and for their \u201c excess \u201d commuter travel ( where a CARDINAL - way journey from their home to their place of work exceeds a distance of CARDINAL kms ) ( PERCENT ) ; and \u2013 on the other hand \u2013 persons in identical circumstances apart from the fact that they use their company car for QUANTITY a year for private purposes , and are fully exempted from adding a percentage of the car \u2019s catalogue price to their taxable income .", "Thereby , according to the applicant , the taxation of the \u201c excess \u201d commuter travel is made dependent on the number of QUANTITY travelled for private purposes with a company car . He argued that this difference in treatment lacked any objective and reasonable justification and that , therefore , LAW ORG should not be applied . He requested that his taxable income be reduced by ORG . CARDINAL ( i.e. the difference PERCENT of his company car \u2019s catalogue value ) , which would result in a reduction of ORG . CARDINAL for the income tax due for DATE .", "ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection on DATE . On DATE , the applicant appealed to the \u2018 sHertogenbosch ORG ( Gerechtshof ) .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG found in favour of the applicant . It held that the reasons stated by the legislator for creating the difference in treatment at issue could not be regarded as constituting an objective and reasonable justification . Consequently , it quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and reduced the determination of the applicant \u2019s taxable income accordingly . ORG further ordered ORG to reimburse the applicant \u2019s legal costs , including the court fees paid by him .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG ( Staatssecretaris PERSON ) filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) against the judgment of DATE . In the ORG Secretary \u2019s first complaint in cassation , it was argued , inter alia , that ORG judgment of DATE created in effect a new and significantly more serious inequality of treatment between , on the one hand , persons living QUANTITY from their place of work and who commute to work either with their own car or with public transport , and , on the other , persons living QUANTITY from their place of work and who commute to work with a company car . In the ORG Secretary \u2019s third cassation complaint , it was stated that the problems concerning LAW as identified in ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , reported in \u201c Beslissingen in FAC \u201d ( GPE Fiscal Law Reports \u2013 \u201c LOC \u201d ) no . CARDINAL , were under discussion in ORG on fiscal - technical reform regarding income tax / wage tax and that , in the light of the signal given by ORG , it was to be expected that the legislative measures resulting from ORG study would also include a termination of the possible inequality of treatment identified by ORG . According to the ORG Secretary , it followed from a ORG judgment of DATE ( ORG , no . CARDINAL * ) that the judicial authorities in cases like the present refrain from interfering where a removal of an inequality in law is to be expected . On this basis , the ORG Secretary argued that there was no need for the judicial authorities to interfere , as there were indications that an amendment , in which the difference in treatment complained of would be removed , was being prepared .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG ruled that the applicant was treated unequally without justification . However , it upheld ORG decision of DATE . Consequently , ORG quashed the judgment of DATE with the exception of the costs order against ORG , and further ordered the ORG Secretary to reimburse the applicant \u2019s legal costs in the cassation proceedings . This judgment , insofar as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In objecting to the application of this so - called increased fixed amount for car costs ( verhoogde autokostenforfait ) , the < applicant > has argued before ORG that the legislator unjustly subjects him to different treatment from those taxpayers to whom LAW , fourth paragraph , is not applied , as those taxpayers , unlike the < applicant > , use their company car for private purposes for a distance of QUANTITY per year > but , like the < applicant > , live CARDINAL kms from their place of work and drive with their ORG car to and from work . ...", "CARDINAL . In answering the question whether it concerns an inequality in treatment prohibited by these Treaties [ including LAW in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL ] , it must be stated at the outset that they do not prohibit every inequality in treatment of equivalent cases . The legislator has a certain margin of appreciation in answering the question whether cases , for the purposes of the application of these Treaties , are to considered as equivalent and , if so , whether there is an objective and reasonable justification for nevertheless regulating those cases in a different manner .", "CARDINAL . The difference in treatment challenged by the < applicant > has been created by LAW DATE ... The aim of this LAW was to make a contribution to both reducing commuter traffic as such ( limitation of mobility ) and reducing the use of cars for commuting purposes ( limitation of car mobility ) . ...", "CARDINAL . It thus follows from the < legislative > history of the creation of the < PERCENT > addition ... that the legislator , as a basic premise , no longer wished to make a link between the strictly private use of the car and its use for commuting purposes . The legislator did not therefore intend to tax \u2013 through the introduction of an increased percentage of the fixed amount for car costs ( autokostenforfait ) \u2013 the higher sum of income considered as being derived from employment as an extra advantage , made dependent on the travel distance , on account of private use .", "CARDINAL . This entails that the addition of PERCENT of the catalogue price of the < company > car , though in form an increase of the fixed amount for car costs , in nature has the character of an independent addition for the cases where tax payers habitually travel DATE a week over a CARDINAL - way distance of QUANTITY between their home and their work place using for this a car placed at their disposal for work purposes . ORG fails to see that , for the application of that independent addition , it is of any relevance whether or not the car , apart from commuter travel , has not or only to a limited extent been used for private purposes .", "CARDINAL . The considerations set out in CARDINAL . to CARDINAL . lead to the conclusion that the legislator , by not prescribing the addition of PERCENT of the catalogue price in cases where there is no or only a limited private use of the < company > car , has given preferential treatment to a limited group within a category of equivalent cases - in short : commuter travel CARDINAL kms - , and has thus treated equivalent cases unequally .", "CARDINAL . Members of ORG ( PERSON ) have shown doubts as to the legitimacy of that unequal treatment . It has been stated in justification on the ORG side that , from the point of view of transport arranged by the employer , the employees privileged by the proposed regulation are on a par with employees who , either collectively or not , are transported by their employer in minibuses and the like . That contention is , however , in all reasonability untenable . Within the group of employees whose transport is arranged by the employer , those disposing of a < company > car are in a completely different situation from those who are , either collectively or not , transported by the employer in minibuses and the like . As of old , the legislator itself has not viewed these cases as equivalents . It has long since made a difference within the relevant group of employees by including employees disposing of a < company > car as being liable to income tax for the private use of such a car . The form chosen for this , the fixed amount for car costs , prompted an addition of a fixed amount for private use < of a company car > to the taxable income in all cases where an employer has made a car available , unless the tax payer can convincingly prove that , on an DATE basis , the car has been used for private purposes for less than ( at present ) QUANTITY . In addition , the \u201c employer \u2019s car \u201d in the latter situation is further treated differently from other transport arranged by the employer , as in that situation the value of the real private use is taxed . Also , given this long standing difference , the argument made in an earlier phase of the examination of the draft Act , that the distinction of the employees with a < company > car runs up against practical difficulties , is defective .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , ORG has not found outside this legislative history any grounds of a fiscal or non - fiscal nature that can justify the unequal treatment at issue .", "CARDINAL . Further , it can not be said that the unequal treatment results in a quantitatively unimportant advantage as , with the addition of PERCENT of the catalogue price of a < company > car , quickly one finds that an increase in income of ORG . CARDINAL to ORG . CARDINAL is involved .", "CARDINAL . Even taking into consideration the margin of appreciation of the legislator , the above also leads to the conclusion that the legislator can not in all reasonability have held that it concerns here unequal cases , or that there is a reasonable and objective justification for the unequal treatment of those cases . The < cassation > complaints I and II , insofar as they are based on a different opinion , fail .", "CARDINAL . The < cassation > complaint I ... is however successful insofar it points out that not to apply the rule contained in LAW CARDINAL of the ORG would result in an equally unjustifiable inequality in treatment , namely in respect of employees who habitually commute , involving a CARDINAL - way travel distance of QUANTITY , with their own car or with public transportation without having a public - transport - declaration [ for fiscal deduction purposes ] ( openbaar vervoerverklaring ) . This could only be remedied by the non - application of the entire < regulation on the > \u201c capping < of the tax allowance for commuters > \u201d ( \u201c aftopping \u201d ) . ORG considers for the time being that such a consequence of the inequality found is disproportionate . It is for legislator to remove the inequality found . ORG assumes that the PERSON announced in the < cassation > complaint III will be presented < to Parliament>. \u201d", "Pursuant to LAW ( Wet op de Inkomstenbelasting ) , employees disposing of a company car provided by their employer must add a fixed amount to their taxable income because of the use of such a car for private purposes . The wording of this provision fixes this amount , the so - called fixed amount for car costs ( autokostenforfait ) , at PERCENT of the catalogue price of the car concerned .", "Following the adoption of LAW of DATE amending income tax and salaries tax [ capping of the tax allowance for commuters ] ( PERSON wijziging van de inkomstenbelasting en de loonbelasting [ aftopping reiskostenforfait ] ) , this fixed amount was increased by PERCENT ( i.e. to PERCENT ) in those cases where an employee habitually travels DATE a week between his or her home and work place when the distance of a oneway journey between these CARDINAL places exceeds QUANTITY ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "LAW provides that the rules contained in LAW are not applied where it appears that , on an annual basis , the company car has been used for private purposes for a total distance not exceeding QUANTITY . In that situation no fixed amount for car costs has to be added to the taxable income , but the actual benefit must be added on the basis of a fixed amount per CARDINAL , e.g. QUANTITY at MONEY per kilometre .", "The underlying rationale of the LAW of DATE was of an environmental nature , i.e. to reduce commuter traffic by encouraging employees to live closer to their place of work , as well as to reduce the use of cars for commuter travel by encouraging employees to opt either for public transport or other forms of collective transport arranged by the employer .", "In the original proposal contained in the PERSON , which resulted in LAW of DATE , the existing possibilities for tax deduction of costs for commuting to work and the exemption from taxes of compensation paid by employers in respect of commuting costs were limited to a maximum ( aftopping ) . Costs for commuting to work for distances in excess of QUANTITY were to be considered as \u201c private \u201d and no longer eligible for tax allowances .", "As to the application of the fixed amount for car costs in cases concerning a company car , the commuter traffic in excess of QUANTITY was to be considered as \u201c private \u201c and lead to the application of a higher percentage . This would only apply , however , where a car was also being used for private purposes . If the car would only be strictly used for work purposes , including commuting , the fixed amount for car costs would not come into play .", "As this approach met with the objection that QUANTITY driven by a company car for private purposes could result in the addition to the taxable income of the fixed amount for car costs , the PERSON was amended . The fixed amount for car costs would be applied when a company car was to be used for private purposes involving a distance of QUANTITY or DATE . In the determination of this question , the distance between the home and place of work DATE whether or not it was QUANTITY \u2013 would be irrelevant . If the limit of QUANTITY for private use were exceeded , an addition of PERCENT of the car \u2019s catalogue price would be applied where the commuting to work remained limited to a distance of QUANTITY from the home . For commuting involving a distance between the home and place of work of QUANTITY , a percentage of PERCENT would be applied .", "Although some critical questions were put during the parliamentary debate the system as amended was adopted by LAW DATE .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( BNB no . CARDINAL ) , ORG held that :", "\u201c In the present proceedings , the question has not been raised whether the rules contained in LAW and QUANTITY [ ITA ] entail a prohibited unequal treatment in respect of those case in which a car made available by an employer is used for private purposes for QUANTITY per year . That question must at present , however , remain unresolved , since its answer also requires an investigation of the facts for which there is no scope in cassation proceedings . \u201d", "The rules contained in LAW remained in force until DATE when fiscal reform legislation came into force - LAW DATE . This Act provided that the distance between the home and place of work is no longer relevant in the determination of the addition of the fixed amount for car costs in respect of company cars . Only the distance for private purposes for which the company car is used is relevant . In case this use is less than CARDINAL kms per year , no fixed amount has to be added to the taxable income . For a distance QUANTITY , PERCENT of the car \u2019s catalogue value must be added to the taxable income , for distances QUANTITY , PERCENT , and for distances exceeding QUANTITY , PERCENT . Commuter travel is considered to be work - related .", "LAW ( PERSON ) , provides :", "\" All persons present in the GPE shall be treated in the same way in similar situations . Discrimination on the ground of religion , philosophical convictions , political leanings , race , sex , or any other ground whatsoever shall not be allowed . \"", "LAW reads :", "\" The courts shall not rule on the constitutionality ( grondwettigheid ) of statutes and treaties . \"", "Under LAW , as interpreted in the constant caselaw of ORG , the judiciary is not permitted to examine the lawfulness of Acts of ORG . The courts can , however , review the lawfulness of subordinate legislation and of all other acts of the administration including the lawfulness of decisions which have a general character such as regulations , plans or directives ( cf . PERSON , DATE , Beslissingen in DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "LAW provides that provisions of international treaties and decisions of international ( intergovernmental ) organisations which , according to their content , may be binding on anyone shall have binding force after they have been published . Pursuant to LAW , such provisions of international treaties and decisions of international organisations take precedence over domestic statutory rules in case of conflict .", "As regards the prohibition on discrimination , ORG recognised in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( PERSON \u201c GPE \u201d , DATE , no . CARDINAL [ corrected in GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ] ) , that LAW is a provision of an international treaty which , according to its content , may be binding on anyone , and must therefore in principle be applied directly by the GPE courts .", "However , in a number of judgments ORG has declined to construe DATE the LAW in such a way as to deprive national legislation of its effect even if it considered that a given measure constituted unlawful discrimination , holding that \u2013 where various options were open to the national authorities to remove such discrimination \u2013 the choice should be left to the legislator in view of the social and legal implications attending each possible course of action ( PERSON , DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ; and PERSON , DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "In its judgment of DATE ( GPE DATE , no .
