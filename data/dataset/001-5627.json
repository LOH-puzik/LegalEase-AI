He did not take part in the second round of the election on DATE .", "In accordance with Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW , which requires campaign accounts to be lodged within DATE of the second round of voting , the applicant lodged his accounts with ORG on DATE . In response to requests for further particulars on DATE and DATE from the scrutineers auditing his accounts , the applicant supplied the information and documents sought on CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s accounts showed electoral expenses of ORG CARDINAL and receipts of ORG CARDINAL . The receipts were broken down as follows : an advance from the State of FRF CARDINAL , FRF CARDINAL in bank loans , FRF CARDINAL in the form of an advance from a party named \u201c F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour une nouvelle solidarit\u00e9 \u201d ( Federation for a New Solidarity ) and ORG CARDINAL in loans made by natural persons , which included ORG CARDINAL interest - free , and ORG CARDINAL in donations .", "It appears from the documents supplied by the applicant that he had personally taken out a bank loan of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and that it had been stipulated that this loan was to be \u201c paid off by reimbursement of the campaign expenses \u201d .", "The loans amounting to a total of FRF CARDINAL were made by CARDINAL individuals during the period from DATE . All but CARDINAL of these loans were interest - free and were to be repaid in full after Mr Cheminade had received the statutory lump - sum reimbursement to candidates in presidential elections .

For the CARDINAL candidates in the second round the receipts recorded in the campaign accounts were approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL for PERSON and ORG CARDINAL for Mr PERSON .", "LAW DATE on election by universal suffrage to the office of President of the Republic , as amended by LAW of DATE on the financing of political life , provides for a sum of PERCENT of the maximum expenses ( that is a maximum of ORG CARDINAL ) to be reimbursed in a lump - sum to each candidate who does not obtain PERCENT of the total votes cast in the first round .", "This lump - sum reimbursement may not , however , exceed the amount of the candidate \u2019s expenses as recorded in his campaign accounts , and no reimbursement is made to candidates whose campaign accounts have been rejected .", "In the present case , by a decision of DATE , ORG , which was empowered for the first time , pursuant to LAW of DATE , to approve , reject or correct the campaign accounts of candidates in a presidential election , rejected the applicant \u2019s campaign accounts on the following grounds :", "\u201c It appears from the campaign accounts lodged by the candidate that he received a total of ORG stated to be interest - free loans from natural persons . The investigation has revealed that FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL out of this sum , or CARDINAL of all the receipts declared , came from CARDINAL loans made after DATE . In view of the relative weight of these resources in the campaign finances as a whole , the fact that no interest was stipulated gave the candidate in the present case an advantage which must be equated with a donation pursuant to LAW Regard being had to the dates of the contracts concerned , and the scale and systematic nature of the advantages thus provided , the campaign accounts must be considered to have been drawn up in breach of PERSON DATE , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON of LAW and must accordingly be rejected . \u201d", "The applicant was therefore deprived of the possibility of obtaining a lump - sum reimbursement of his electoral expenses to the value of ORG CARDINAL and on DATE the Minister of the ORG served him with an order to repay the FRF CARDINAL paid to him by the ORG as an advance on this reimbursement .", "On DATE the ORG sent the applicant a notice to pay , which led to nothing .

Where the amount of the reimbursement does not reach that sum , the surplus must be repaid .", "A sum of up to CARDINAL of the amount of the relevant ceiling for campaign expenses shall be reimbursed , in a lump - sum , to each candidate . This sum shall be increased to CARDINAL of that ceiling for each candidate who receives PERCENT of the total votes cast in the first - round ballot .

The campaign accounts must be in balance or in surplus and may not show any deficit . \u201d", "\u201c Where an item of expenditure recorded in the campaign accounts costs less than the normal price , [ ORG ] shall evaluate the difference and add an equivalent sum to the campaign expenses , after inviting the candidate to produce any documentary evidence which might help to assess the circumstances . The sum thus added shall be considered a donation , within the meaning of Article PERSON , made by the natural person or persons concerned . [ The ORG ] shall deal in the same manner with all direct or indirect advantages , services and donations in kind from which the candidate has derived benefit . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Taking receipts into account", "\u2026", "( b ) The Constitutional Council further notes that in some cases funds paid in have been declared to have come from loans made by natural persons . Such loans , which may in part really constitute donations where no interest is payable , or where the rate of interest payable is lower than the usual money - market rates , make any attempt to exercise scrutiny a hit - or - miss affair . Moreover , the ORG is not in a position to verify , once the accounts have been made up , whether the contractual repayments have actually been made . Yet in the absence of such verification the payments owed by the ORG may be the cause of unjustified enrichment for the candidate . It therefore appears to be desirable for natural persons to be allowed to make only donations within the limits laid down by law , but not loans of any kind . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
