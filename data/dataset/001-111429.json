The applicant , a NORP national of NORP origin , was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE with his family on DATE and lodged an asylum request on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was raised in ORG and in LOC in GPE and went to school there for DATE . He did not have any vocational training , but worked subsequently in different jobs .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s wife was born in ORG and spent all her life in GPE , where she married the applicant in DATE in a religious ceremony .", "CARDINAL . With regard to his reasons to apply for asylum , the applicant claimed that he had supported the NORP fighters during the first war from DATE . Because he did not feel that his support had been sufficiently acknowledged , he did not take part in the second war in GPE . In DATE , mercenary soldiers came looking for him during a \u201c cleaning operation \u201d based on a file about the applicant that had been created after the first war . When they did not find him at home , the soldiers beat up the applicant \u2019s father . Later on , the family \u2019s house was burned down . Thereupon , the applicant \u2019s father advised the applicant and his wife to leave GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s asylum request and declared the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE permissible .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal and awarded him asylum status . Referring to relevant country reports it found that the security situation in GPE had deteriorated from DATE and that numerous killings and unexplained disappearances occurred on a regular basis , many within the context of \u201c cleaning operations \u201d . It further found the humanitarian situation in GPE to be critical . Finally , it stated that there were no domestic alternatives , due to systematic hindrances encountered by NORP with NORP authorities throughout the country and also due to difficulties in obtaining registration and settling in other parts of GPE . It found the applicant \u2019s statements to be credible and sufficiently substantiated and concluded that the applicant was at a real risk of being subjected to ill - treatment if he returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG also granted asylum to the applicant \u2019s wife . It reasoned that since the applicant was wanted in GPE because of his alleged hostility towards the NORP authorities , his wife was also at real risk of ill - treatment if she returned to GPE . It also noted that the applicant had been awarded the status of a recognised refugee and that the family would not be able to establish their life together in another country . Ruling out a domestic alternative ( moving to live elsewhere in GPE ) , it concluded that the applicant \u2019s wife therefore should be awarded asylum status in application of the principle in dubio pro fugitivo .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s daughter , who was born in DATE , was granted asylum on CARDINAL DATE ; and his son , born in DATE , was granted asylum on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) convicted the applicant of attempted theft and sentenced him to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment , suspended , and placed him on probation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Leoben Regional Court ( PERSON ) convicted the applicant of attempted resistance to public authority , aggravated damage to property and aggravated bodily harm , and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , CARDINAL of which were suspended , and placed him on probation for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) convicted the applicant of partly attempted and partly actual aggravated bodily harm , and sentenced him to QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment , while quashing the probation order in the previous sentence . The applicant was found to have hit a prostitute on the head with an empty bottle because she had not told him that she was suffering from a sexually transmitted disease .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his sentences and was released again in DATE . Since then , the applicant has been living with his wife and CARDINAL children in an apartment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG initiated proceedings to lift the applicant \u2019s asylum status . In the interview conducted in the course of the proceedings , the applicant stated that he could not return to GPE because of his past and that he was convinced that he would be killed if he returned . He claimed that many people had returned to GPE after being informed that they would no longer be in danger of persecution in GPE , but had then disappeared or been killed by the security service of the NORP president . He could not prove this , since the people concerned were dead . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s father had told him that he should not return to GPE and that he was still at risk of persecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lifted the applicant \u2019s asylum status and ordered his expulsion to GPE . Referring to section DATE LAW , it noted that asylum status could be lifted after conviction by a domestic court of a particularly serious offence . It further referred to the CARDINAL criteria developed by ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) that were as follows : firstly , the conviction must be for a particularly serious crime , such as murder , rape , child abuse , arson , armed robbery , drug trafficking , or similar crimes . Secondly , it must be a final conviction . Furthermore , the offence committed must be especially dangerous ( gemeingef\u00e4hrlich ) ; and finally , the public interest in lifting the asylum status must outweigh the applicant \u2019s interest in the protection provided by the asylum status . ORG continued by finding that in practice , offences against physical integrity and life would be qualified as \u201c particularly serious crimes \u201d . It also made reference to LAW DATE relating to the Status of Refugees that requested a balancing of the interests involved . In conclusion , it stated that the applicant had been convicted more than once of offences against physical integrity , and that he had reoffended after his first conviction .", "CARDINAL . It further found that the security situation in GPE had improved since the applicant had been awarded asylum status , and came to the conclusion that the applicant would not be subject to a real risk of ill - treatment contrary to LAW upon a return to GPE . As regards the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW , ORG stated that the applicant had not taken any serious steps towards integration into NORP society since the award of asylum status . He had for example only started learning NORP in DATE , when he had already been in the country for DATE . With regard to the applicant \u2019s family , it questioned its entitlement to protection , in the context of the violent offences the applicant had committed in the past . It referred also to the applicant \u2019s family still living in GPE , namely his parents and CARDINAL siblings , with whom the applicant maintained regular telephone contact and who constituted a clear link between the applicant and GPE , and concluded that the public interest , in view of the applicant \u2019s criminal record , outweighed his interests in respect of his family life .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision . On DATE ORG ( Asylgerichtshof ) held an oral hearing , at which the applicant repeated that he could not return to GPE . In general , his family had no problems with the security services there . His father had been visited by a member of the ORG DATE after the applicant had left the country and had been told that his family should not expect any problems with the authorities , as they were only looking for the applicant . The applicant \u2019s wife was also interviewed . Asked about her relationship with the applicant , she confirmed that she visited the applicant regularly in detention and that they would naturally continue to live together as a family as soon as the applicant was released from prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . As regards the general security and political situation in GPE , and referring to relevant country reports , it found that military activities had decreased significantly in DATE and that the second war had ended officially on DATE . However , a country report by ORG dated DATE showed that there were still massive human rights violations occurring in GPE under Ramsan PERSON \u2019s dictatorship . Furthermore , the reports generally conceded that the civilian population was still the victim of \u201c cleaning \u201d operations , but also that unexplained disappearances had decreased since DATE . ORG considered torture still to be a problem in the region . Referring to reports of ORG High Commissioner for Refugees , it found people particularly targeted for persecution to be ( former ) rebels , their relatives , political adversaries of PERSON , human rights activists , and people who had lodged complaints with international organisations . It further stated that ORG High Commissioner for Refugees still dismissed any domestic opportunity for NORP in GPE . However , it also referred to a NORP practice that declared a domestic alternative elsewhere in GPE acceptable for NORP .", "CARDINAL . In its legal reasoning ORG stated that asylum status could be lifted if the person was convicted by a domestic court of a particularly serious offence , if he therefore presented a danger to the community , and if the public interest outweighed the person \u2019s private interests . It referred to ORG illustration of NORP practice , which is to qualify a particularly serious offence as one with a sentence of DATE imprisonment , but called it a \u201c flexible system \u201d . With regard to the applicant , ORG found that his repeated offences were of a very serious and violent nature . Finally , it emphasised the applicant \u2019s lack of integration in GPE and the poor prospects for his future development .", "CARDINAL . ORG continued by examining the possibility of subsidiary protection pursuant to section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . In that context it found that the civil war in GPE had ended and that there was no general risk of treatment contrary to LAW in the event of expulsion to GPE . Further referring to the applicant \u2019s \u201c minor \u201d role in the first war , the stable life situation of his family in GPE and his good prospects of work in GPE , ORG dismissed a real and individual risk of persecution within the meaning of LAW in relation to the applicant . Finally , examining the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW with regard to his expulsion , as foreseen in section LAW ) of QUANTITY , it found that the applicant still had strong ties with GPE , and that his children were of a young and adaptable age .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for legal aid to lodge a complaint against the appeal decision of ORG , due to lack of prospects of success . The applicant nevertheless lodged a complaint and on DATE , ORG refused to deal with the complaint .", "CARDINAL . That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG and requested the application of an interim measure pursuant to Rule CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG applied the interim measure under Rule DATE and requested ORG to stay the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE until further notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Graz Federal Police Authority ( Bundespolizeidirektion Graz ) issued an exclusion order against the applicant for a period of DATE . Complaint proceedings are pending with ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG examined Article ORG ) of LAW DATE relating to the Status of Refugees ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) and stated that CARDINAL conditions needed to be fulfilled cumulatively to allow for the expulsion of a refugee , despite a real risk of persecution : the refugee must have committed a particularly serious offence ; his or her conviction must be final ; the refugee must be especially dangerous ; lastly the public interest in the refugee \u2019s expulsion must outweigh the refugee \u2019s interests for protection in the state granting asylum status ( see judgment of ORG of DATE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In a subsequent judgment , ORG analysed the condition of a \u201c particularly serious offence \u201d in view of international law and academic writing and stated as therein used definitions that it needed to be a \u201c capital crime or particularly grave offence \u201d that was \u201c objectively and subjectively particularly serious \u201d . It further referred to academic sources that claimed that LAW was only \u201c meant to be applied on extremely rare occasions \u201d and as an \u201c ultima ratio \u201d that needed to be interpreted restrictively . Finally , ORG added for illustration that GPE used as a landmark for the application of LAW ) of the DATE Convention the condition of a sentence of DATE imprisonment ( see judgment of ORG of DATE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The NORP CARDINAL LAW provides that a foreigner is excluded from the award of asylum status if he or she has been convicted of a particularly serious offence , if that conviction was final , and if the foreigner presented a danger to society due to his or her criminal conduct . For the same reasons , it is lawful to lift an asylum status ( see sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and QUANTITY CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . If an asylum request is either dismissed or lifted , an asylum seeker can still be awarded subsidiary protection under section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW if his or her expulsion , deportation or extradition constitutes a real risk of a violation of ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In the event that an asylum request is dismissed or an asylum status lifted , the authority is obliged to declare at the same time that expulsion is permissible . However , it is not allowed to expel a person even pursuant to a negative asylum decision , if an expulsion would constitute a violation of LAW ( see sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The main aim of that visit of ORG for Human Rights was to review the human rights situation in the LOC in the context of the regular field visits that the Commissioner PERSON , like his predecessor , conducted . The report noted that since the Commissioner \u2019s previous visit in DATE , there had been an increased emphasis on the socio - economic development of LOC , and the implementation of a strategy aiming to improve the investment climate , fight corruption and address unemployment was ongoing . Despite these positive steps to improve the quality of life of the people living in the region , the situation in the LOC continued to present major challenges for the protection of human rights . The Commissioner defined as some of the most serious problems in terms of the protection of human rights in the GPE visited the issues of counter - terrorism measures , of abductions , disappearances and ill - treatment , of combating impunity and of the situation of human rights defenders . The report included the Commissioner \u2019s observations and recommendations in relation to those topics .", "CARDINAL . With regard to counter - terrorism measures , the report concluded that the continuing challenges to security in the LOC amounted to a major ongoing crisis , with consequences which extend beyond the region . While state authorities had a clear duty to protect the public from terrorism and the actions of illegal armed groups , counter - terrorism measures should be carried out in full compliance with human rights norms ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Commissioner was further deeply concerned by the persistence of allegations and other information relating to abductions , disappearances and ill - treatment of people deprived of their liberty in LOC . While the number of abductions and disappearances in GPE might have decreased in the more recent period compared to DATE , the situation remained far from normal . Referring to the far - reaching effects of disappearances on a society as a whole , he supported the proposal of ORG for creating an interdepartmental federal commission to determine the fate of persons who have gone missing during the entire period of counter - terrorism operations in LOC . The Commissioner further emphasised the importance of the systematic application in practice of rules against the wearing of masks or non - standard uniforms without badges as well as against the use of unmarked vehicles in the course of investigative activities . He also encouraged a wide spread dissemination of all reports of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment among all stakeholders and reiterated the principle that evidence obtained through ill - treatment or other unlawful means should be treated as inadmissible in criminal proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner went on by stating that the persistent patterns of impunity for serious human rights violations were among the most intractable problems of the LOC and remained a source of major concern to him . There have certainly been a number of positive steps , such as the establishment of ORG structures , the increased support for victim participation in criminal proceedings , and the promulgation of various directives such as LAW on victim participation and the instructions of ORG and ORG regarding the conduct of investigations . Despite these measures of a systemic , legislative and regulatory nature , the information gathered during the visit had led the Commissioner to conclude that the situation remained essentially unchanged in practice since his previous visit in DATE . He emphasised the importance of effective investigations of possible violations by State actors of the right to life and the prohibition against torture and ill - treatment and called on the NORP leadership to deliver the unequivocal message that impunity would no longer be tolerated to help in creating the requisite determination on the part of the investigators concerned ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . As a conclusion for his fourth and last topic , the Commissioner stated that human rights activists continued to face serious obstacles in their work and could be exposed to significant risks . In settings which present considerable challenges to the protection of human rights , it was all the more important to ensure that those persons and organisations which engage in human rights monitoring activities were able to go about their work freely and without undue impediments ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the heading \u201c Use of excessive force and other abuses in internal conflicts \u201d , ORG on GPE of ORG of DATE stated that violence continued to spread in the GPE republics , driven by separatism , inter - ethnic conflicts , jihadist movements , vendettas , criminality , and excesses by security forces . However , GPE saw a decrease in violence from DATE . Government personnel , rebels and criminal elements continued also to engage in abductions in LOC . Officials and observers disagreed on the number of victims . Human rights groups believed the number of abductions was under - reported due to the reluctance of GPE relatives to complain to the authorities for fear of reprisals . According to a report on the website PERSON , during DATE approximately CARDINAL people were kidnapped or unlawfully detained by armed parties in LOC , and CARDINAL were freed . Allegedly , there was no accountability for government forces involved in abductions . There were continued reports that abductions were followed by beatings or torture to extract confessions and that abductions were conducted for political reasons . Security forces under the command of NORP President PERSON allegedly played a significant role in abductions , either on their own initiative or in joint operations with federal forces . Human rights groups reported these forces were frequently suspected of being responsible for disappearances and abductions , including those of family members of rebel commanders and fighters .", "CARDINAL . Armed forces and police units reportedly frequently abused and tortured people in holding facilities where federal authorities dealt with rebels and people suspected of aiding them . In GPE and PERSON there continued to be reports of torture by government forces . There was also a report of a continued arson campaign . The NORP arson campaign began in DATE , following explicit threats by NORP President PERSON and PERSON Mayor PERSON to burn down houses belonging to families whose sons were suspected of joining the insurgency . Human rights activist PERSON was working on a documentary on the arson campaign when she was killed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the overall security situation , the ORG report of CARDINAL DATE stated that general violence increased in DATE in GPE , PERSON and ORG . Even though the number of people killed decreased , the number of injured civilians increased , which showed that civilians were affected more and more by the armed conflict between the security services and the rebels . The NORP President PERSON was quoted as saying on DATE that the situation in the NORP had not in practice improved . The widespread impunity further encouraged the arbitrariness exercised by the security services ( see page CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . The main human rights violations happened by way of arbitrary detention to obtain confessions and information about rebels , torture and ill - treatment in secret detention centres , kidnappings and disappearances executed by members of federal and local security services and criminal groups for ransom , executions , the arson campaign targeting family members of alleged rebels , and lack of financial compensation , for example for burned houses and property . Those most at risk belonged to the following groups : NGO and human rights activists ; victims , their lawyers , witnesses and their families ; journalists ; government opponents and returnees from abroad and their relatives . The report noted that returnees from abroad were generally immediately detained , questioned about their stay abroad and sometimes tortured . The questioning did not necessarily stop after their release from detention . Returnees and their relatives had to expect arbitrary detention at any time . In individual cases , criminal suspicions were invented so that returners could be ill - treated as a form of punishment for leaving GPE in the first place ( see pages CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . Relying on statistical data provided by ORG , the report from ORG of DATE showed that DATE saw a return to the old tactics of abductions and disappearances , and the number of abducted people again increased in DATE to CARDINAL recorded cases . Furthermore , the number of punitive house burnings increased dramatically . Newer data were not available , since ORG work was severely hampered due to PERSON abduction and killing in DATE and the subsequent suspension of the organisation \u2019s work for DATE . However , ORG reported fewer human rights violations in GPE in DATE and DATE . Both NGOs stated that after PERSON \u2019s death it had become increasingly difficult to obtain reliable information about the security situation in GPE and that victims of beatings , threats and detention had become increasingly afraid to report those incidents to NGOs or official investigation authorities ( see pages CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . As particular groups at risk of being exposed to torture , disappearances , kidnappings and extrajudicial killings the report enumerated members of rebel groups and any person suspected of supporting or sympathising with these groups ; relatives and friends of supporters or sympathisers of rebel groups ; young , healthy men ; young women ; persons who lodge complaints with ORG , NGOs or ORG and returnees from abroad . With regard to the last - mentioned group , there were reports that people returning from abroad were stopped by law - enforcement officials who requested money or kidnappings for ransom of returnees . They further risked being suspected of holding information about anti - Kadyrov elements of the NORP diaspora in NORP countries and were often interrogated on their return to GPE . A returnee would need to explicitly unite with the government and PERSON \u2019s policies ( see pages CARDINAL et seq . of the report ) . On the other hand , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in GPE reported on voluntary returns to GPE which were considered a success . In DATE the ORG assisted CARDINAL returns to LOC . The ORG conducted regular visits to GPE and met returnees there . The organisation conceded however that it was difficult to assess the situation in GPE on such short visits . It was also emphasised that the number of returnees in a particular ORG project might be too low to fully reflect the situation of returnees in general ( see pages CARDINAL et seq . of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the risk to former members of the illegal armed groups , the report quoted an anonymous NORP embassy source stating that active participants in the fighting against the NORP federal army in DATE who have not since been militarily active or in opposition to ORG regime were not at risk of being persecuted by the present NORP authorities ( see page CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to NORP returning from other countries , LAW of DATE stated that upon their return they were often suspected of either being involved in illegal armed groups , or at the very least of having significant resources . They encountered suspicion , became victims of extortion and had criminal cases fabricated against them . Returnees were reportedly called to meetings with ORG and ORG , where they were questioned , often with threats and ill - treatment and demands for payment . Young men especially were made to collaborate with the security services . Those who spoke out about the regime were most at risk , for example applicants to ORG , as well as those who appealed to national courts , federal authorities or NGOs ( see pages CARDINAL et seq . of the report ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
