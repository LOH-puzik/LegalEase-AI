NORP In DATE the applicant association published a book entitled GPE at war . There were CARDINAL versions \u2013 NORP , LANGUAGE , LANGUAGE and LANGUAGE \u2013 and the book was distributed in numerous countries , including GPE and GPE . According to the applicant association , this was a collective work containing contributions from a number of academics with specialist knowledge of ORG and giving an account of the historical , cultural , linguistic and socio - political aspects of the NORP cause . It ended with a political article entitled \u201c LOC at war , a promise of peace \u201d by the NORP national liberation movement .", "CARDINAL . The book was published in DATE . On DATE a ministerial order was issued by ORG under section CARDINAL of the LAW DATE , as amended by the decree of CARDINAL DATE , banning the circulation , distribution and sale of the book in GPE in any of its CARDINAL versions on the ground that \u201c the circulation in GPE of this book , which promotes separatism and vindicates recourse to violence , is likely to constitute a threat to public order \u201d . On DATE , pursuant to the aforementioned order , the d\u00e9partement director of the airport and border police refused to allow over CARDINAL copies of the book to be brought into GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association lodged an administrative appeal against the ban . When this was implicitly rejected , it appealed to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that it did not have jurisdiction and so referred the case to the ORG d\u2019Etat . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the President of ORG of the ORG d\u2019Etat remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered on DATE after a public hearing in the presence of both parties , ORG rejected the applicant association \u2019s appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c It has been established that the book at issue entitled GPE at war was printed in GPE , that CARDINAL of its CARDINAL chapters were written by authors of NORP nationality and that the documentation used for the preparation of the publication was mainly of NORP origin . Therefore , and notwithstanding the fact that the book was published by the applicant association , which is based in GPE , the offending book must be regarded as of foreign origin within the meaning of the aforementioned provisions . Accordingly , the Minister of the ORG was legally entitled to prohibit the book \u2019s circulation , distribution and sale .", "In taking the view that the book at issue could pose a threat to public order since it argued , particularly in LAW , that the violence of the NORP State justified the ORG terrorist organisation \u2019s \u2018 proportionate counter - offensive\u2019 , the Minister of the ORG did not make any obvious error in assessing the evidence .", "Under LAW , \u2018 [ e]veryone has the right to freedom ... \u2019 ; it is the task of the administrative courts to assess whether any restriction of the freedom of expression guaranteed by the above - mentioned LAW is proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued and to assess whether the ban on a publication of foreign origin is in keeping with that aim . In the instant case the evidence does not show that the general prohibition of the book at issue was disproportionate to the public - order objectives being pursued ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant association lodged an appeal against this judgment with the ORG d\u2019Etat on DATE . In its further observations , it asked the ORG d\u2019Etat to find that section CARDINAL of the LAW DATE , as amended , was incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW taken together .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat ruled that section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , as amended , was not incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention on the following grounds :", "\u201c Under section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , as amended by the decree of DATE , \u2018 the circulation , distribution or sale in GPE of newspapers or texts written in a foreign language , whether periodicals or not , may be prohibited by a decision of the Minister of the ORG . Newspapers and texts of foreign origin written in NORP and printed abroad or in GPE may also be prohibited\u2019 . In the absence of any statutory provision establishing the conditions circumscribing the legality of decisions taken on the basis of this provision , any restrictions of the Minister \u2019s power derive from the need to reconcile the general interests for which he is responsible with the respect due to public freedoms , particularly freedom of the press . When an appeal against such a prohibition order is lodged with an administrative court , it is duty - bound to assess whether the banned publication poses such a threat to these general interests that it warrants an infringement of public freedoms . Contrary to the applicant association \u2019s assertions , the power thus exercised by the Minister of the Interior , under the supervision of the courts , is not incompatible with the combined provisions of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , the ORG d\u2019Etat quashed the judgment and the ministerial order of CARDINAL DATE on the following grounds :", "\u201c By the impugned order , the Minister of the ORG prohibited the circulation , distribution and sale of the collective work GPE at war , which must be viewed as a written text of foreign origin within the meaning of the aforementioned section CARDINAL of the PERSON of DATE . Having regard to the interests that the Minister is responsible for protecting , in particular public safety and public order , the ORG finds that the content of this publication does not provide sufficient legal justification for the serious infringement of press freedom embodied in the impugned decision .", "It follows from the above considerations that the Association Ekin has good grounds for maintaining that ORG was wrong to reject , by means of the impugned judgment , the association \u2019s application to set aside the decision of CARDINAL DATE , taken on the basis of the aforementioned section CARDINAL of the LAW DATE , by which the Minister of the ORG prohibited the circulation , distribution , and sale in GPE of the book entitled GPE at war , published by the association ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a registered letter with recorded delivery received by ORG on DATE , the applicant association presented the Minister with a claim for compensation for the pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage caused by the application of the unlawful order of CARDINAL DATE for DATE . According to the applicant association , the implementation of this order amounted to tortious conduct on the part of the authority . It estimated the overall losses it had sustained at MONEY ( ORG ) , including ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL resulting from the financial loss deriving directly from the prohibition of sales of the book throughout GPE . To date it has not had any reply from the Minister of the ORG . Under the rules of NORP administrative proceedings , this silence counts as a refusal of the applicant association \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . NORP The general rules governing the freedom of the press guaranteed by LAW and the Citizen , which has constitutional status , are mainly based on LAW DATE , as amended , which established a \u201c repressive \u201d system , so called because any offences that may have been committed are punished and any damage caused is made good ex post facto . This is the principle laid down by LAW DATE , as amended , when it states in LAW CARDINAL that \u201c anyone may print or sell books and other publications \u201d and in section CARDINAL that \u201c any newspaper or periodical may be published without prior authorisation or the payment of any security ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The NORP rules governing publications do nonetheless include forms of prior intervention which can lead to bans or seizures but are always subject to respect for the principle that they must be proportionate to the facts which prompt them .", "Such measures are justified only by the need to protect public order against any unrest caused , or liable to be caused , by the distribution or sale of a publication . The PERSON d\u2019Etat ruled on DATE ( Abb\u00e9 de Kervenoael , PERSON , CARDINAL ) that \u201c the provisions of sections CARDINAL et seq . of the PERSON of DATE do not prevent mayors from taking measures under their general policing powers for the preservation of order and calm \u201d and that \u201c it is therefore their duty to prohibit the distribution on the public highway of written documents likely to cause unrest \u201d .", "Nonetheless , as was established in a judgment of ORG of DATE ( L\u2019action fran\u00e7aise , D.P. DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , conclusions by ORG , note by NORP ) , these means may only be deployed if there is no other way of preserving or restoring public order . They must also be proportionate to the disorder and limited in their duration and geographical scope to what is strictly necessary .", "Under section CARDINAL of the PERSON , an investigating judge may order the seizure \u201c of written or printed documents , placards or notices \u201d , under the conditions laid down in LAW and \u201c in the cases contemplated in sections CARDINAL ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Law \u201d . These cases are incitement to or vindication of crimes ( section DATE ) , inciting military personnel to disobey orders ( section CARDINAL ) , and insulting heads of ORG and government and foreign diplomats ( sections CARDINAL and DATE ) . Section CARDINAL of the PERSON states : \u201c If there is a conviction , the court may , in the cases contemplated in sections CARDINAL ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , order the confiscation of any written or printed documents , placards or notices seized and , at any event , order the seizure and suppression or destruction of any copies put on sale , distributed or displayed in public . Suppression or destruction may however apply only to certain parts of the seized copies . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , as amended , adds that , in cases of sentences passed under sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL ( \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , or MONEY incitement to or vindication of crimes \u2013 and DATE penalising the offence of spreading false news \u2013 \u201c the suspension of the newspaper or periodical may be ordered in the same judgment for a period not exceeding DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Administrative review has also been introduced in respect of certain specific types of publication . The main categories concerned are publications intended for young people or which may pose a threat to young people and publications which are of foreign origin or drafted in a foreign language .", "This is chiefly the result of implementing the LAW DATE , which established the specific rules governing \u201c publications intended for young people \u201d which may be applied to all publications posing a threat to this type of reader . These rules , which stem from a desire to protect young people , are in fact twofold in nature since they relate both to publications \u201c mainly intended for children and adolescents \u201d and to publications \u201c of all types that may pose a threat to young people \u201d .", "A system of administrative supervision also operates pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , as amended by the decree of DATE , which reads as follows :", "\u201c The circulation , distribution or sale in GPE of newspapers or texts written in a foreign language , whether periodicals or not , may be prohibited by a decision of the Minister of the ORG .", "Newspapers and texts of foreign origin written in NORP and printed abroad or in GPE may also be prohibited .", "When performed knowingly , the sale , distribution or reproduction of banned newspapers or written texts shall be punishable by a DATE prison sentence and a fine of MONEY .", "The same applies if the publication of a banned newspaper or written text is resumed under a different title . In this case , however , the fine shall be increased to MONEY .", "All copies and reproductions of banned newspapers and written texts and of any which resume publication under a different title shall be liable to administrative seizure . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Case - law has fleshed out the conditions for the application of this rule . It has both defined the concept of \u201c foreign origin \u201d and established the grounds on which publications can be banned , wherever they are not laid down by statute .", "CARDINAL . The test used by the administrative courts to determine whether a publication is of foreign origin is made up of a number of strands woven together into the theory of \u201c convergent evidence \u201d . According to the submissions of Mr Genevois , the Government Commissioner in the case of the Minister of the ORG v. ORG PERSON ( PERSON d\u2019Etat ( \u201c CE \u201d ) , Ass . , DATE , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , the ORG d\u2019Etat takes account of both material and intellectual factors : \u201c The material factors are those relating to the conditions in which the text was printed . Even if it was printed abroad , a book written in LANGUAGE by a NORP author can be considered to be of foreign origin only if it is established that foreign assistance made possible or helped to make possible its production or publication ... The intellectual factors relate to the inspiration and the content of the book . It was on the basis of such factors that [ the PERSON d\u2019Etat ] held that a publication which presented itself either as the NORP edition of a foreign publication or as the NORP edition of the texts and articles contained in that publication should be regarded as being of foreign origin within the meaning of section CARDINAL even though the publishers were LANGUAGE ( CE , Ass . , DATE , ORG PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The PERSON d\u2019Etat has regarded all the following factors as indications of a publication \u2019s foreign origin : the author \u2019s nationality and place of residence ( CE , DATE , Monus , p. CARDINAL ) , the fact that the publication was a translation ( ORG , DATE , PERSON les CARDINAL de la terre du feu , p. CARDINAL ) , the nationality of the publisher and the country in which the text was published ( CE , Ass . , DATE , cited above ) , the country in which it was published or printed ( CE , Sect . , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , the fact that foreign assistance was provided ( CE , Sect . , DATE , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , or foreign documentation and inspiration .", "CARDINAL . None of these factors suffices alone . For instance the fact that the author is a foreign national is not enough in itself for section CARDINAL to be applicable . The status of the publication is decided on by considering all of these indications taken together .", "CARDINAL . Although the law did not indicate the grounds on which it should be applied , the case - law of the ORG d\u2019Etat has established the rule that section DATE can be applied only for certain reasons relating to the public interest and public order . Initially , the administrative courts did not carry out any review of the assessment of the facts warranting the measure nor , a fortiori , did they consider the proportionality of the measure . They checked whether the reasons given by the authorities to justify the use of section CARDINAL were legitimate by ensuring that they duly came within the PERSON \u2019s scope ( see , for example , CE , DATE , NORP and PERSON , PERSON , p. CARDINAL , and ORG , DATE , ORG , PERSON , p. CARDINAL , concl . Braibant ) .", "CARDINAL . The main grounds which the ORG d\u2019Etat has considered to be \u201c among those which can justify in law a measure taken under \u201d section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE , as amended , are as follows : the protection of public order ( see , for example , CE , Ass . , DATE , cited above ) , the immoral nature of the publication concerned ( see , for example , ORG , DATE , cited above ) , and the need to combat racist ideology , in particular the revival of national - socialist ideology ( ORG , DATE , St\u00e9 les ORG , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Applications for judicial review of decisions taken by the Minister of the ORG under LAW of DATE may be made to the administrative courts and subsequent appeals lie to the administrative courts of appeal set up by the PERSON of DATE . The Minister \u2019s decisions can also be quashed by the ORG d\u2019Etat which acted as the appellate court in such cases before the DATE reform . On the other hand , stays of execution of bans on publications are not granted by the administrative courts since they consider that the damage caused by the application of such bans is not irreparable and accordingly is not of a nature to justify a stay of execution ( CE , DATE , ORG and ORG du ORG , ORG , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The administrative courts begin by carrying out a review of the \u201c outward legality \u201d of the measures taken under LAW , in other words they consider whether the authorities have respected the rules of jurisdiction , procedure and form . In so doing they pay particular attention to the grounds for the measure , which must comply with LAW , and verify that the rights of the defence , as set out in section CARDINAL of the decree of CARDINAL DATE , have been respected . This decree , which applies to the authors of publications covered by LAW , as amended , and to those whose writings are covered by the law on publications intended for , or posing a threat to , young people , provides that , \u201c save in exceptional or emergency situations and subject to the requirements of public order \u201d , such decisions \u201c may legally be taken only once the party concerned has been given the opportunity to submit written observations . Anyone concerned ... must be heard , if he or she so requests , by the official responsible for the case or , failing that , a person authorised to record his or her oral observations . Such persons may be assisted or represented by a lawyer of their choice \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the administrative courts also review the \u201c internal legality \u201d of the measures concerned , the scope of which changed on promulgation of the legislative decree of DATE . The ORG d\u2019Etat has always made sure that the authorities have had good grounds to describe the publication as being \u201c of foreign origin \u201d , that they have made no legal error in the application of the law , that they have not based themselves on factually inaccurate evidence and that they have not abused their powers . However , in their earlier decisions , the administrative courts did not review the assessment of the threat posed to public order or the public interest by the publication at issue .", "CARDINAL . A major development in the case - law on this matter has occurred since .", "CARDINAL . Initially , in its ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG PERSON , cited above ) , the PERSON d\u2019Etat decided to broaden its review of the legality of ministerial decisions taken under LAW by extending it to cover manifest errors of judgment , that is by checking that a serious error of judgment had not led to a manifest disproportion with the facts that had prompted them .", "CARDINAL . Then , when the applicant association brought the instant case before it , the ORG d\u2019Etat decided to depart from its previous case - law and broaden the scope of its review . The effect of the PERSON d\u2019Etat \u2019s ruling of DATE is that the administrative courts must conduct a \u201c full \u201d review of the grounds for the decision . In its judgment the ORG d\u2019Etat held that it is the administrative ORG duty to \u201c consider whether the banned publication is likely to cause such damage [ to the general interests for which the Minister is responsible ] as to warrant an infringement of public freedoms \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
