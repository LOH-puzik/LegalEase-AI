Flats represented PERCENT of the pre - war housing stock of GPE ( around CARDINAL housing units out of CARDINAL ) . By local standards , they were a particularly attractive type of home , equipped with modern conveniences and located in urban centres . Practically all flats were under the regime of \u201c social ownership \u201d \u2013 a concept which , while it does exist in other countries , was particularly highly developed in the former ORG ( \u201c the SFRY \u201d ) . They were generally built by socially owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees , who became \u201c occupancy right holders \u201d . All citizens of the SFRY were required to pay a means - tested contribution to subsidise housing construction . However , the amount an individual had contributed was not amongst the legal criteria taken into account in the waiting lists for allocation of such flats .", "CARDINAL . The rights of both the allocation right holders ( public bodies which nominally controlled the flats ) and the occupancy right holders were regulated by law ( LAW DATE , which is still in force in GPE ) . In accordance with this LAW , an occupancy right , once allocated , entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent , lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee . When occupancy right holders died , their rights transferred , as a matter of right , to their surviving spouses ( indeed , spouses held occupancy rights in common ) or registered members of their family households who were also using the flat ( sections DATE and CARDINAL of this Act ) . In practice , these provisions on transfer meant that occupancy rights originally allocated by public bodies to their employees could pass , as of right , to multiple generations for whom the initial employment - based link to the allocation right holder no longer existed . Occupancy rights could be cancelled only in court proceedings ( section QUANTITY ) on limited grounds ( sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of this Act ) , the most important of which was failure by the occupancy right holders to physically use their flats for their own housing needs for a continuous period of DATE , without justified grounds ( such as , military service , medical treatment , prison sentence , or temporary work elsewhere in the SFRY or abroad ) . Although inspections were foreseen to ensure compliance with this requirement ( section CARDINAL of this Act ) , occupancy rights were rarely , if ever , cancelled on these grounds prior to the DATE - CARDINAL war . Moreover , on DATE ORG annulled the inspection provisions .", "CARDINAL . Following its declaration of independence on DATE , a brutal war started in GPE . CARDINAL people left their homes as a consequence of \u201c ethnic cleansing \u201d or generalised violence . As a rule , they fled to areas controlled by their own ethnic groups . All parties to the conflict quickly adopted procedures allowing the flats of those who had fled the territory under their control to be declared \u201c abandoned \u201d and allocated to new occupancy right holders . While the alleged rationale for the allocation of \u201c abandoned \u201d properties was to provide humanitarian shelter to displaced persons , particularly attractive properties \u2013 typically urban flats DATE were commonly awarded to the military and political elites . In some cases , occupancy rights were cancelled pursuant to the aforementioned section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , because of failure by the occupancy right holders to use their flats for a continuous period of DATE . In most cases , however , the authorities applied legislation specially enacted for those purposes : GPE DATE , GPE , LAW DATE , LAW DATE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . The concept of \u201c social ownership \u201d was abandoned during the DATE - CARDINAL war . As a result , socially owned flats were effectively nationalised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the General Framework Agreement for Peace in GPE ( \u201c the GPE Peace Agreement \u201d ) entered into force . Pursuant to that Agreement , GPE consists of CARDINAL Entities : ORG and PERSON . In the immediate aftermath of the war , legislation on abandoned property remained in force in both Entities and reallocation of flats continued nearly unabated , which further reinforced ethnic separation .", "CARDINAL . All such legislation was repealed in DATE under international pressure . Initially , however , in GPE only those who could prove that they were genuine refugees or displaced persons were entitled to return to their pre - war homes ( former section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG . The vague terms of this provision left broad discretion to the housing authorities and reportedly led to abuses . The High Representative therefore repealed it in DATE . Nevertheless , as a result of strong resistance of the military of ORG ( see decision CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL et al . of ORG of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , a similar restriction remained in force as regards military flats ( section CARDINAL of this Act ) . While this was done on the pretext of creating a pool of flats which could be used to house destitute war veterans and their families , the domestic ORG held that there was no evidence that the property was necessarily being used for this stated purpose ( see , for example , its decision CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL et al . of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . ORG maintained , in its third - party submissions to that ORG , that many high - ranking military officials in ORG GPE whose housing needs were otherwise met had nevertheless been allocated military flats , in direct contravention of domestic legislation , and that ORG GPE had CARDINAL unclaimed military flats at its disposal to pursue the legitimate aim of housing war veterans without the need to reach out for claimed ones ( see decision PERSON . of ORG of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; see also ORG submissions in decision CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL et al . of ORG of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The JNA , the armed forces of the SFRY , nominally controlled QUANTITY flats in GPE until the DATE - CARDINAL war .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the JNA members were offered the opportunity to purchase their flats at a discount on their market value ( see LAW ) . On DATE GPE and GPE put on hold the sale of military flats on its territory ( see the Suspension on the Sale of Flats Decree DATE ) . The Decree was respected in what is DATE GPE , and those who had purchased military flats located in that Entity could not register their ownership and remained , strictly speaking , occupancy right holders ( a purchase contract does not of itself transfer title to the buyer under domestic law ) . Since the Decree was ignored in what is DATE PERSON , those who had purchased military flats in that Entity became their registered owners .", "CARDINAL . During the war , the local armed forces ( namely , the ORG , ORG and ORG forces ) assumed the nominal control of all non - privatised military flats on the territory under their respective control . Although on DATE those forces merged into the armed forces of GPE , non - privatised military flats are still under the nominal control of ORG see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL . The dissolution of the SFRY was a gradual process which took place in DATE ( see Opinion No . CARDINAL of ORG of ORG on the Former GPE of DATE ) . GPE declared its independence on DATE . It was recognised by ORG and GPE on DATE and admitted to membership of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting under LAW , demanded that all units of the JNA and all elements of ORG either be withdrawn from GPE , or be subject to the authority of ORG , or be disbanded and disarmed with their weapons placed under effective international monitoring ( see Resolution CARDINAL ) . While the JNA formally withdrew from GPE on DATE , the ORG Secretary General and ORG for the former GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , a ORG court of law dealing with war crimes that took place during the conflicts in the LOC in DATE , later established that JNA members born in GPE actually remained there with their equipment and joined the ORG forces and only those born in GPE and GPE left and joined the LAW forces ( see the ORG Secretary General 's report of DATE , ORG , LAW , and the ORG judgment in the PERSON case , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-A , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has also held that the ORG forces were to be regarded as acting under the overall control of and on behalf of ORG and that hence , even after DATE , the armed conflict in GPE between the local NORP and the central authorities of GPE must be classified as an international armed conflict ( see the ORG judgment in the PERSON case , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-A , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE , and the ORG judgment in the PERSON case , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-A , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . It has arrived at a similar conclusion as regards the relationship between neighbouring GPE and ORG ( see the ORG judgments in the PERSON case , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-T , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE , and ORG , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the ICJ \u201d ) , the principal judicial organ of ORG , has arrived at a different conclusion in the LAW ( GPE and GPE ) case . It held that despite much evidence of direct and indirect participation by the LAW forces , along with the ORG forces , in military operations in GPE , the acts of those who committed genocide at GPE can not be attributed to GPE under the rules of international law of ORG responsibility ( see the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in GPE in DATE . He lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Being a lecturer at a military school in GPE , the applicant was allocated a military flat there in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he bought the flat pursuant to LAW . Although he had paid the full purchase price on DATE ( in the amount of MONEY ) , the local authorities refused to register his title ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military school was transferred from GPE ( initially to Sombor and then to GPE ) . On DATE the applicant decided to leave GPE and to continue lecturing at the same military school .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made an application for the restitution of his flat in GPE . On DATE his application was rejected pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent ORG upheld the first - instance decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG , a domestic human - rights body . He relied on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of , and LAW No . CARDINAL to , the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on an application for judicial review , quashed the administrative decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE for procedural reasons and remitted the case for reconsideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the restitution commission set up by Annex CARDINAL to ORG , before which the applicant pursued parallel proceedings , held that the applicant was neither a refugee nor a displaced person within the meaning of Annex CARDINAL and declined jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent housing authorities refused once again the applicant 's application for restitution pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the competent ORG upheld the first - instance decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for judicial review . On DATE ORG stayed the proceedings under an instruction from the legislature of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG GPE formally allocated the disputed flat to PERSON . PERSON , a former member of the ORG forces . It would appear , however , that PERSON . PERSON had lived in that flat even before , since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( which had succeeded ORG in DATE ) found a violation of LAW because of the length of the restitution proceedings and awarded the applicant MONEY for non - pecuniary damage in this connection . Having established the excessive length of the restitution proceedings , ORG held that they did not constitute an effective remedy which would have to be used as a condition for the examination of the applicant 's substantive complaints . In accordance with domestic jurisprudence , it considered that although the purchase contract of DATE had not of itself transferred title to the impugned flat to the applicant , it had conferred on him valuable personal rights ( that is , the rights to occupy the flat and to be registered as owner ) amounting to \u201c possessions \u201d within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW . ORG further held that the situation complained of ( that is , the applicant 's inability to repossess the flat and to register his title to it ) undoubtedly amounted to a continuing interference with the peaceful enjoyment of his \u201c possessions \u201d . While assessing the proportionality of the interference , ORG held that the applicant 's service in the VJ forces after the DATE - CARDINAL war demonstrated his disloyalty to GPE . Taking into consideration also the serious shortage of housing units and compensation to which the applicant was entitled , ORG concluded that the interference was justified . It therefore found no violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention and considered it to be unnecessary to examine the discrimination and LAW complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case to ORG for reconsideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the administrative decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has not been allocated a flat in GPE , but receives from the NORP authorities a rent allowance in the DATE amount of MONEY ( ORG ) . It would appear that he has not applied for compensation pursuant to section CARDINALe of the Privatisation of Flats Act DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE all purchase contracts concluded under LAW DATE were declared void . As explained in paragraph CARDINAL above , this affected flats in GPE only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the domestic ORG held that a contract to purchase a military flat , although it had not of itself transferred title to the buyer , conferred on the buyer valuable property rights ( that is , the rights to occupy the flat and to be registered as owner ) which constituted \u201c possessions \u201d for the purposes of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . It then found a breach of that Article and ordered GPE to restore the legal validity of all such contracts ( decision CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL et al . ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended LAW DATE and ORG . While all such contracts have since been regarded as legally valid , CARDINAL categories of buyers are not entitled to repossess their flats and to register their title ( see section DATE of the Privatisation of Flats Act DATE and section CARDINAL of ORG . First , those who served in foreign armed forces after the DATE - CARDINAL war . Since those who were granted a refugee or equivalent status in a country outside the former SFRY are exempted , the restriction affects only those who served in the forces of the successor ORG and , in reality , almost exclusively those who served in the LAW forces referred to in paragraph QUANTITY above . The second category is those who acquired an occupancy or equivalent right to a military flat in a successor State of the SFRY . At present , people falling into those categories are only entitled to the refund of the amount paid for their flats in DATE plus interest at the rate applicable to overnight deposits ( see section DATE of the Privatisation of Flats Act DATE , as amended on DATE ) . Previously the compensation was calculated differently : the value of a flat was to first be calculated at a rate of approximately ORG QUANTITY , the age of the flat was to then be taken into consideration with the depreciation of PERCENT of its value for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG considered the amended legislation to still be discriminatory and in conflict with LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . It ordered ORG to register the applicants as owners , regardless of their service in foreign armed forces ( decision CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL et al . ) . The relevant part of that decision ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) reads as follows :", "\u201c It could potentially be reasonable and necessary to bar persons serving in a foreign army from the exercise of certain rights ; however service in a foreign army is not a basis for stripping a person of an otherwise valid property contract . \u201d", "ORG , which had succeeded ORG in DATE , followed that approach in decisions ORG of DATE and CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL November CARDINAL , but on DATE it decided to depart from that jurisprudence ( decision CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL et al . ) . It regarded those who had served in foreign armed forces after the DATE - CARDINAL war as disloyal to GPE and held that it was hence justified to strip them of their purchase contracts . The same approach has subsequently been applied in numerous follow - up cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held in a similar case ( also concerning the purchase of a socially owned flat before the DATE - CARDINAL war which had not been followed by the registration of ownership ) that a legally valid purchase contract , although it had not of itself transferred title to the buyer , conferred on the buyer valuable property rights ( notably the right to be registered as owner ) which constituted \u201c possessions \u201d for the purposes of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention ( see decision CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG held that a tenancy right of limited duration on a military flat in GPE should not be regarded as equivalent to occupancy right for the purposes of the restitution legislation .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE it has no longer been possible to acquire occupancy rights in GPE ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ) . From that date until DATE members of the armed forces had the opportunity to acquire a tenancy right of unlimited duration on a military flat .
