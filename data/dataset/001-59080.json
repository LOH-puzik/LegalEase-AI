The applicant was born in DATE in GPE and lived for a period in GPE , where he married in DATE and had CARDINAL children : TIME . born in DATE , A. born in DATE and F. born in DATE . The family moved to GPE in DATE but , following marital difficulties , the applicant \u2019s wife left the family home with the children in DATE . She agreed to return in DATE when the applicant agreed to move out . Divorce proceedings were instituted on DATE and the divorce became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Contact between the applicant and his children was arranged by agreement with the mother present DATE . However , in DATE , contact was stopped by the mother who claimed that the children no longer wanted to see their father . In DATE , the applicant \u2019s former wife made allegations that the applicant had sexually abused the children , but these allegations were not substantiated in investigations carried out by ORG in DATE . It was however considered that the patterns of behaviour of the children were consistent with the behaviour of children under considerable stress and , with the consent of both parents , the family were referred to ORG and FAC for therapeutic intervention . Meanwhile , in DATE , an application by the applicant for a residence ( custody ) order was refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an interim contact order was made by the Kingston - Upon - Thames County Court providing for DATE supervised access . This contact never took place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the same ORG made a further interim order for supervised access , with DATE access to be by arrangement . CARDINAL periods of supervised access took place on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . The children were reported as showing no signs of distress and the CARDINAL younger children as appearing to enjoy seeing the applicant . The DATE access did not take place as the mother took the children to GPE .", "CARDINAL . A psychiatric report dated DATE noted that the children had felt terrified of the applicant and raised concerns of emotional abuse . It found that the oldest child , TIME . , who suffered intrinsic learning difficulties , had been clearly disturbed by the applicant \u2019s behaviour and distressed by his mother \u2019s difficulties in the marriage . A. had been stressed and troubled , with the knowledge of the applicant \u2019s suicide attempts adding to his emotional burden . The youngest child PERSON was the least troubled , though the memories of hitting and shouting were clearly also frightening and disturbing for her . All CARDINAL children separately indicated that they wanted to live with their mother and were worried about contact with the applicant . There was evidence of a fairly ritualised and damaging cycle of events with the applicant being unreasonably harsh with his children on repeated occasions . Any further contact would have to be handled judiciously and it was of paramount importance to avoid further undue stress to the children .", "CARDINAL . ORG made a further interim order for supervised access on DATE . This order was , in the main , complied with . A further order was made by ORG on DATE for DATE contact to take place in the presence of a mutual friend or in a public place . In a welfare report before the court at that time , the court welfare officer concluded that a break in contact would be unhelpful in counteracting the children \u2019s negative views of their father and it was also noted that , if no contact order was made , then contact was unlikely to occur , whatever the children \u2019s wishes . A psychiatric report dated DATE suggested that there should be an increase in contact , unsupervised , and that there was no reason why overnight stays with the father could not be permitted . The report noted that the applicant had acknowledged hitting the children with a belt in the past , had provided a reason for it ( his illness ) and had apologised to the children for it . The applicant states that he represented himself in the hearings leading up to the DATE order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a contact order was made by ORG including DATE access , TIME stays and making provision for DATE . This contact order has never been complied with . In DATE , the applicant \u2019s former wife left the family home with the children and moved , it subsequently transpired , to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant brought to the attention of ORG that the order of DATE had not been complied with and applied for an order to compel his former wife to comply , failing which such penal action as the court deemed fit should be imposed . At the hearing of his application on DATE , the applicant appeared in person and his former wife was represented by counsel . The judge was told that the mother was very unhappy about contact , that the telephone was disconnected , that the house appeared to be occupied and that the door was unanswered . The applicant informed the judge that the mother might be suffering from depression . The applicant stated in his memorial that ORG judge said that he had power to make an order requiring the mother to be brought before the court , but suggested instead that the matter should be dealt with by ORG ) because of its greater powers . Therefore on DATE the applicant applied to ORG ex parte .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s application to ORG requested that the contact order of DATE be enforced . He stated that he effectively asked the judge to take such action as was necessary to enforce the order for contact , and that he did not make a specific application because he was following the suggestion of ORG judge and did not know what to do . The applicant appeared in person . Mr Justice Singer invited ORG to act as guardian ad litem for the children and , if accepted , granted leave to ORG to submit documents in the case to such experts as he chose , and for those experts to carry out such examinations and investigations concerning the children as they thought appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The Official Solicitor accepted the invitation to act on or CARDINAL September CARDINAL . He wrote to the mother at her last known address on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE to arrange for an interview with the children . He received no response . On DATE , he instructed enquiry agents in GPE to seek to ascertain the location of the mother and children . They were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , it appears that the applicant hired a private detective who traced the children to GPE in DATE . However , the mother moved them again to an unknown address .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied ex parte to make the children wards of court and was represented at this stage by counsel . His application requested that the children be located immediately and that the mother be restrained from moving the children from their current address without the leave of the court and that arrangements be made for the children \u2019s schooling . On DATE , ORG issued an injunction prohibiting the children \u2019s mother from removing them from jurisdiction without leave of the court and made the CARDINAL children wards of court . It also directed the GPE to seek and locate the children and to notify the applicant \u2019s solicitors of their address . ( The GPE is a court official who executes orders of the court . )", "The GPE was given a description of the children and addresses at which they might be living . He passed the information to the police who found no trace of them at those addresses . The police placed the names of the children and their mother on the police national computer so that , if they came to the attention of the police , their location would be notified to the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG wrote to ORG ( ORG ) seeking an address for the mother . On DATE , the ORG forwarded a letter to the mother . The mother did not respond .", "CARDINAL . As however no progress was apparently being made , the applicant , who was still receiving advice from solicitors , made a further application ex parte to ORG for information to be provided by particular bodies . On DATE , ORG ordered the ORG ( including ORG ) , GPE and ORG , ORG and ORG to divulge to the court any information which it had on the location of the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG wrote again to the ORG , asking them to forward a letter to the mother . She responded on DATE , declining to disclose her address or to take up the invitation to arrange interviews .", "CARDINAL . An address was provided to ORG by ORG during DATE . The applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the court requesting disclosure of this address . On DATE , leave was given by ORG to disclose the address of the applicant \u2019s former wife to the applicant \u2019s solicitor on an undertaking that the solicitor would not disclose the same to the applicant . The applicant stated that this never happened , as his former wife and the children had changed address again . The Government disagreed , saying that the address was supplied but that the applicant \u2019s enquiry agents were unable to locate the children who had been moved again .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant felt that he was not making any progress , he applied to ORG again , this time in person . On DATE , ORG again ordered the relevant authorities to disclose any information which they had as to the current address or whereabouts of the children . ORG also ordered that any address or information would not be disclosed to the applicant without leave of the court , but that the court would notify him as soon as possible after receipt of relevant information for the purpose of enabling him to seek further directions . The applicant was informed by the court on DATE that they had new addresses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that the District Judge refused to disclose the address , so he applied in person ex parte to ORG . The application was adjourned on DATE pending ORG agreeing to act for the children in the wardship proceedings . At the adjourned hearing on DATE , the applicant again appeared in person . ORG disclosed the address to ORG , the children were joined as defendants to the proceedings and the matter was adjourned until DATE to allow the Official Solicitor to report on any information which he had on the whereabouts and welfare of the children . On DATE , ORG wrote to the mother . As issued on DATE , the terms of the ORG order indicated that the children \u2019s address ( received from ORG ) be disclosed to ORG only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant again appeared in person before ORG . He was granted indirect contact with the children , by way of letters , cards and presents , to be monitored by ORG . Details of the address of the children and the social workers involved in the case were ordered not to be disclosed to the applicant . The matter was adjourned by ORG for further directions in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG disclosed to the applicant , who appeared in person , that his children were resident in GPE although , despite his request , he was not informed of their address so as not to unsettle his former wife . Also on DATE ORG ordered ORG to identify for the applicant the appropriate court in which he should issue proceedings in GPE in order to enforce the order for contact made on DATE . ORG also agreed that , upon receiving notice that the father has issued proceedings , it would forward to the relevant court in GPE the address of the children and the social worker instructed in the case , it being for that court to decide whether , and if so when , to disclose this information to the applicant . It then adjourned the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the applicant \u2019s application of DATE to ORG to forward a copy of the contact order of DATE , that order was registered in ORG in GPE . This permitted the order to be treated as an order made by a NORP court , which would enjoy the available powers to enforce it but did not confer any jurisdiction on the NORP courts to vary the order . They had power to act immediately for the welfare of the children ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) or to issue interim directions to secure their welfare pending the determination of the application to enforce the contact order ( section CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On or DATE , the applicant commenced proceedings for the enforcement of the NORP court order . The applicant stated that he was told that he had to have a solicitor in order to commence proceedings , unless he applied to waive this which would have meant further delay . He therefore instructed solicitors . The Government have submitted that this is not the correct position . There was no requirement for a solicitor to act in these type of proceedings , save that an advocate or solicitor advocate had to sign the petition for enforcement or permission ( though permission could be obtained from the court to proceed in the absence of a signature ) . An order was made on DATE for the service of the proceedings on the mother , and forbidding the mother from removing the children from GPE , pursuant to the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the mother filed her answers to the proceedings alleging that it was not in the children \u2019s interests for there to be contact and that the children would be at risk . The mother applied for an order staying the enforcement proceedings pending the commencement by her of proceedings to vary the DATE contact order . The applicant states that the allegations made by the mother in her answers had all been adjudicated on already by the LANGUAGE courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied again to ORG in GPE , which remained the court of primary jurisdiction , for an order directing the mother to appear before the court to show cause why the contact order should not be amended to provide for further staying and visiting contact at DATE and GPE DATE and thereafter in place of that originally ordered ; why a penal notice should not be attached to the order ; and to provide for an early hearing of the matters . On DATE , ORG refused the application as the applicant had engaged in proceedings in GPE to enforce the contact order and it would be a duplication of those proceedings to consider the same matters . ORG considered it appropriate for the courts of GPE to adjudicate concerning enforcement of the contact order and/or to make their own order for such contact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged a motion asking the NORP court to make an order enforcing the DATE order . This application was heard on DATE . Though it was not opposed , it was not proceeded with by the applicant . The applicant says that when it became clear that the judge was not going to grant enforcement of the order , as the judge did not consider the order made sense , the applicant \u2019s counsel withdrew the application ( without the applicant \u2019s specific instructions ) fearing that a refusal of the order would make it difficult for any other judge to disagree .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged another motion asking the NORP court to make an order enforcing the DATE order . On DATE , the matter was heard before a different judge and this time the application was defended . In the light of allegations of sexual abuse ( which had been rejected following investigation in GPE ) made by the applicant \u2019s former wife , a new report was ordered to be prepared quam primum by an advocate . The order stated that a named advocate was to enquire into and report on all the circumstances of the children and the proposed arrangements for their care and upbringing , with particular reference to the question of access . The applicant appealed this order but leave to appeal was refused on DATE . The applicant stated that he had to appear in person as his lawyer would not act .", "CARDINAL . An advocate , PERSON , was appointed on DATE to carry out enquiries and submit a report . The advocate visited the mother at home on DATE and on DATE , and saw the children alone on DATE and DATE . She spoke to the applicant on the telephone at DATE and arranged to see him on DATE , when they spoke for TIME . On DATE , the advocate visited the doctor , PERSON , who had reported on the children in the family proceedings in GPE , seeing the videos of meetings and also the social worker , PERSON , involved with those proceedings . She visited the teachers of the younger children and saw the guidance teacher of the oldest child on DATE . On DATE , she spoke to PERSON , a NORP social worker involved with the family from DATE , when the mother \u2019s doctor had made a referral for the family to be assessed as a matter of urgency by ORG for Sick Children , GPE , due to concerns that the children were showing disturbed behaviour . She noted that PERSON had talked to the social worker PERSON , who had told her that TIME . had told him that he did not want to see the applicant . The hospital team had not completed its assessment of the children due , inter alia , to the mother \u2019s failure to respond to an invitation for a further interview .", "The advocate also incorporated in her report the report of DATE prepared for ORG by the social worker PERSON , who had carried out CARDINAL interviews with the children , CARDINAL interviews with the mother and interviews with the children \u2019s head teacher and class teachers . The advocate submitted her report to the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The advocate \u2019s report recounted the history of the proceedings and her own contact with the children , their mother and the applicant . It concluded :", "\u201c This is a complex case . CARDINAL fact that I think is established is that these children were found by a number of professionals ... in DATE and DATE to be under stress . What was never established to anyone \u2019s apparent satisfaction was the reason for that . It seems to me from my investigations ... that the stress is likely to have been brought on by their GPE relationship and the way that impinged on them . I think it is also most probable given the children \u2019s ( particularly < PERSON ) accounts of being belted by the < applicant > that that behaviour was at least part of the cause of their stress . I accept the < applicant \u2019s > point that the children \u2019s stance may have been influenced a great deal even if only indirectly by the fact that they live with and now rely on < their mother>. I have to give the children some credit however particularly at their age for knowing their own minds . They seem to have quite clearly determined to communicate to me both by words and deed that they did not wish to see their father and that they were in < A. \u2019s > words \u2018 better with their mother than they were with both of them\u2019 .", "... The question is what is the best way forward for them ... . The < applicant > however accepts that at this stage DATE since the order and since he last saw them that it would not be appropriate for him to have the access that was ordered in DATE . It would not be in their interests for him simply to turn up and take them over the times ordered . If there were to be access it would have to be as he acknowledged built up over time starting with supervised access of some sort possibly with some sort of counselling .", "... I also accept to some extent what he suggests to the effect that the < mother > has made it her business to ensure the children will not see him . What is difficult to get to the bottom of is her motive . I think I accept that she is motivated by what she believes is in the best interests of the children even if she may on occasions be misguided . I think she has not always told the truth ... . Effectively she did not want to do anything to make access work . She was only keen to take those steps which she had to show that it would not work .", "... The < mother > has also been good at passing certain anxieties which could perhaps have been kept from ... the children whether deliberately or otherwise < Her suspicion that the applicant had killed the children \u2019s guinea pig , that they were being tracked down by a private detective > ... She has thus instilled fear in the children which she has fuelled by changing their NORP names ... .", "... I also accept that some of the evidence I heard and saw appeared to contradict the < mother \u2019s > absolute view that the children were always terrified about seeing the < applicant>.", "It may be that my only role in this Petition is to report to your Lordship on the circumstances of the children and I think I have done that in perhaps more detail than might be desired . If I am to give a recommendation with regard to disposal of this Petition it is clear as stated above that it would not be in the best interests of the children that it be immediately granted in the terms sought .", "I am not clear if I am expected thereafter to give a view as to whether any access should be awarded in this or any other Process . If I were to be expected to do so it would clearly be the most difficult task . On the one side I accept that the < mother > has managed to manipulate the situation to a great extent and has deliberately flouted the NORP order and kept the children from their father for DATE . I also accept that it is generally thought to be preferable , other things being equal , for children to grow up seeing both parents ... . But if I were to have to give a view I think I would have to allow myself to be influenced by what I saw of these children and of their parents . The < applicant > appeared to have an obsessive personality and be particularly obsessed by his relationship with the < mother>. His attitude and intensity would be wearing on anyone including his children . Further I did gain the impression even at this stage that he was more interested in the < mother > than the children .", "The < mother > was certainly pleasant in demeanour even if she was obviously much more determined and hardnosed than she appeared . She certainly had manipulated the situation effectively . But ultimately I think the only course which it would be in this case appropriate to take would be to listen to and observe the children . They not only told me and meant it ... that they did not wish to see their father . They also seemed ... to be genuinely much happier than they had been and to be very much more settled and confident than they ever have been . It would be unfortunate if this were to be disturbed by a further attempt to re - establish a relationship with their father ... particularly when it seems in all the circumstances that it would probably be unsuccessful . For these reasons ... I would humbly recommend ... with some hesitation , that the children be allowed to continue as they are and not be asked to go through further arranged visits with their father at this stage . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following extended discussion and correspondence between the applicant and his legal advisers , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant applied , it appears with the assistance of a lawyer , for a hearing of his petition which the court on DATE listed for DATE . On CARDINAL DATE , the applicant applied for leave to amend the order sought by him - firstly , to insert a plea that the mother \u2019s answers should be rejected and the orders sought by the applicant be granted in full and , secondly , for an order that the mother deliver the children into the care and control of the applicant between TIME on one weekday forthwith , and on every second weekend thereafter between TIME DATE until TIME on DATE , and between TIME on DATE after the said initial access period . This arguably would have had the effect of increasing the contact from CARDINAL out of CARDINAL weekends to CARDINAL out of CARDINAL weekends .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the mother applied for an order withdrawing her answers to the applicant \u2019s petition , which was unopposed by the applicant and granted by the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an order was made by the court allowing the applicant \u2019s petition to be amended and an order for contact was made in the amended terms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant commenced proceedings seeking to have the mother punished for contempt for failure to comply with the order of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE , the mother applied for the rescission of the order of CARDINAL DATE on the basis that it was incorrect because it was at variance with the order of DATE , lacked clarity and contained material errors .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant returned to ORG in GPE requesting that the original order of DATE be varied . This approach was taken on the basis that ORG could not refuse to enforce a fresh order . However , given the change in circumstances , the applicant decided in DATE that the chances of getting any court to enforce the order of DATE were remote , and he decided to withdraw the action for enforcement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the mother applied to the courts in GPE for an order removing proceedings to GPE and , on DATE , the applicant applied again for a contact and/or residence order . The mother mistakenly lodged her application with ORG that issued the original contact order , which on DATE declined to hear the matter as it was now a ORG case . In a judgment handed down on CARDINAL DATE by ORG , Mr Justice Singer found it appropriate that the decisions as to contact be considered by the NORP courts , and made an order under section CARDINAL of LAW . This decision was taken with particular regard to the statement by the former wife \u2019s NORP lawyers that they could issue proceedings within DATE in GPE to determine custody and contact . The children were however to remain wards of court and it would be open to the applicant to apply to lift the stay on proceedings in GPE if the proceedings in GPE were not pursued . The judge noted that the applicant claimed that he would be disadvantaged by the change of jurisdiction , as he was not conversant with NORP procedures and as it would be more expensive for him to travel to GPE for hearings and to consult with lawyers . However , he found that the mother and children were firmly settled in GPE and that any difficulties posed by the mother in filing evidence or co - operating with interim orders would be more speedily dealt with if the proceedings were before the NORP courts . He commented that to some extent the NORP courts had already entered into the merits and that the reporter , who had been unclear as to her role , may have gone beyond her remit in assisting the court in its enforcement role when indicating that the DATE order was not one which she would subscribe to .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the mother commenced proceedings in ORG in which she sought an order that there should be no contact between the children and the applicant . The applicant sought an order for contact by a defence lodged on DATE . A hearing was set down in GPE for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the order of CARDINAL DATE was rescinded by the NORP court on the joint application of the mother and the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant applied for interim contact , which application came before the court on DATE but was not proceeded with by the applicant \u2019s counsel . The hearing set for DATE was deferred by agreement of both parties , following the mother \u2019s voluntary co - operation in seeing a psychologist , allowing the children to be seen by the psychologist and permitting the applicant to send the children cards and presents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an order was made by consent that the applicant should have contact as agreed between the applicant and his former wife and as consented to by the children . The applicant stated that as a result he has had indirect contact on a handful of occasions when either the applicant \u2019s sister or sister - in - law were allowed to see the children and convey messages , an indirect means of getting letters , presents and pocket money to the children and , very recently , via e - mail .
