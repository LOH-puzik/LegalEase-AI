The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . At the time of lodging his application , he was serving a prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , a person with previous convictions , was suspected of robbery . On DATE the police conducted a search of his home . The applicant complained to the prosecution that the search had been unlawful . He also alleged that the police had taken some documents and computer files belonging to ORG ( BYA ) , a non - governmental organisation which he ran .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested . His detention on remand was authorised by ORG on DATE . It was thereafter extended on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed in custody at FAC ( FAC tardymo izoliatorius - kal\u0117jimas ) .", "CARDINAL . He unsuccessfully attempted to escape from a convoy vehicle on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution rejected the applicant \u2019s complaints regarding the search of his home . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the pre - trial investigation was concluded and the case transmitted to the trial court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vilnius City Third ORG convicted the applicant of robbery , the illegal possession of ammunition , assault and an attempt to abscond . He was sentenced to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment and his property was confiscated . During the hearing the applicant was assisted by an officially - appointed defence counsel and an interpreter ( NORP / Lithuanian ) . When calculating the sentence to be imposed on the applicant , the trial court added a period of imprisonment relating to a previous conviction , which the applicant had not served fully as he had been released on licence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , claiming inter alia that the case against him had been fabricated , that the court had based its conclusions on evidence obtained by force , and that the conviction was arbitrary . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s allegations as unsubstantiated . The applicant was not present at the appeal hearing but was represented by officially - appointed counsel .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal , claiming that the charges had been fabricated in order to undermine the activities of the ORG , that the evidence had been collected by force , that the first - instance court had rejected his request to have his handcuffs removed during the trial , that some witnesses had not been questioned , and that the transcripts of the hearings had been false . The applicant further alleged that his defence rights had been violated during his questioning on DATE , and that the majority of other procedural acts during the pre - trial investigation had been carried out in the absence of his counsel . He also complained about the quality of the services provided by the lawyers officially appointed to defend him . Finally , the applicant objected to the fact that the appellate court had examined the case in his absence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal , the applicant \u2019s lawyer being present . ORG noted that the trial court had reasonably refused to call additional witnesses . The applicant had been able to question the witnesses summoned by the court . The applicant could also have submitted his comments on the contents of the trial transcripts . ORG further established that the applicant \u2019s lawyer had in fact been present during the examination of the applicant on DATE and , subsequently , at each trial hearing . ORG ruled that the applicant \u2019s presence at the appellate level had not been required in view of the nature of the issues examined , the appellate court not having had any need to question him on issues that could not be determined in the sole presence of his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to reopen the criminal proceedings , as being wholly unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of the Vilnius City Third District Court of CARDINAL DATE and ORG of DATE , the applicant \u2019s sentence of imprisonment was upheld , but the order to confiscate his property was lifted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released after having completed the sentence .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant was again arrested , this time on suspicion of possessing a stolen computer . According to the information in the case file supplied by the parties , the applicant was remanded in custody pending trial for that charge .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was held at FAC in the centre of GPE from DATE to DATE , when he was transferred to FAC which is also in GPE ( Vilniaus CARDINAL-oji grie\u017etojo re\u017eimo pataisos darb\u0173 kolonija ; sometimes referred to by the parties as ORG ) . He stayed there PERSON until DATE , when he was transferred back to FAC for DATE ( DATE ) . Subsequently , from DATE to DATE , the applicant stayed in FAC , with the exception of a period from DATE to DATE , when he was placed in a prison hospital .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , until his release on DATE , the applicant was held in FAC , with short , periodic transfers to other prisons .", "CARDINAL . In his submissions to the ORG , the applicant alleged that the cells had been severely overcrowded . In particular , CARDINAL to CARDINAL persons had had to share a cell of QUANTITY ( m\u00b2 ) , all the detainees being confined to the cell for most of DATE . The applicant had frequently been transferred from one cell to another , the conditions in all the cells being very similar . The toilets in every cell had been virtually open , requiring the inmates to relieve themselves in front of the others . This had constituted an affront to human dignity . The cells had been very dirty , inhabited by cockroaches and rodents . Mattresses and bed linen had rarely been washed . Prisoners had done their own washing ( except for the bed linen ) so the cells had often been humid from the attempts to dry clothes . There had been no adequate ventilation system , the applicant being obliged to stay in his cell together with smokers . His health had suffered as a passive smoker . He had only bought cigarettes himself to trade with other prisoners . Opening the windows had caused unhealthy draughts .", "CARDINAL . NORP In their observations in response before the Court , the Government conceded that there had been some overcrowding in the cells , although not as serious as that alleged by the applicant . For reasons beyond the control of the administration of FAC , detainees had had about CARDINAL.CARDINAL m\u00b2 of floor space per person , instead of the statutory CARDINAL m\u00b2 ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Government stated that remand prisoners at GPE currently have CARDINAL m\u00b2 of floor space per person . It had not been possible to provide the applicant with a permanent cell at that prison because there had been a constant turnover of remand prisoners .", "CARDINAL . The Government informed the ORG that regular inspections and DATE preventive disinfections had been carried out at FAC ( sometimes urgently albeit not during the applicant \u2019s stay there ) . Whilst the inspection reports had found overcrowding , no other material violation of public health or nutritional standards had been observed . No complaints about smoking in cells or an inadequate supply of soap or toilet paper had been recorded at that time . A few , minor violations of hygiene had been noted , which required repairs subsequently effected within set time - limits . A standard quantity of soap and toilet paper had been issued to each remand prisoner once DATE and bedding had been changed once DATE . Mattresses had been regularly disinfected and replaced when worn out .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained to the ORG that he had been refused a social allowance which he had requested in order to purchase basic toiletries . He could only rarely get soap and toilet paper . The standard supply to each prisoner of CARDINAL bar of soap and CARDINAL roll of toilet paper per month had been wholly inadequate . No toothpaste or other such items had been provided . The prison administration had allegedly prevented him from using his own money to purchase certain items of hygiene . He had often been deprived of any social allowance for such purchases due to arbitrary disciplinary measures imposed on him . This had been done to prevent him purchasing stationery to make further complaints . Moreover , his own paltry funds had had to be used for legal representation . He had received a total of QUANTITY in social allowances in DATE , and had suffered severe hardship as a result .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained that his head had been shaved against his will , that the prison food had been of very low quality , and that an orthodox priest had not been invited to visit the prison . The possibility to obtain any information from the outside world had been severely restricted . In particular , the applicant alleged that he had been precluded from visiting the library , and his requests to have books brought to him in the cell had been ignored . He had only occasionally been given some old books and newspapers . The prison administration had also refused to provide him with copies of legislation .", "CARDINAL . The Government responded that the applicant , as a remand prisoner , had been allowed to purchase food and necessities at the prison shop using his own money held on a personal account for him . He had only once used this facility when he had bought soap , washing powder and , despite his complaint about smoke in cells , cigarettes . Contrary to his submissions to the ORG , the applicant had had a right of access , on request , to legal literature and other materials in the GPE prison library . Moreover , NORP and NORP newspapers were personally delivered to him on DATE and from time to time he had received various materials from outside prison . NORP priests had made regular visits to the prison and had held mass . Short hair had been required of inmates , but they had not been shaved .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been provided with CARDINAL meals a day , according to prison nutritional standards , which had been regularly controlled . Although the applicant would have been allowed to receive certain family visits and parcels , none had been requested or sent at the material time .", "CARDINAL . The applicant next submitted that his outgoing letters had been delayed or withheld by the prison administration . He had thus been impeded in making complaints or prevented from receiving replies to his complaints to various authorities . Finally , the applicant alleged that the prison administration had never registered his complaints about his conditions of detention or the actions of certain prison warders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sued the GPE prison administration , alleging that his personal rights had been violated on account of the inadequate general conditions of detention , as well as his specific treatment by the prison administration . Many of these complaints were similar to those described above at DATE , a recurring grievance being that of overcrowding . He subsequently clarified his complaints on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims in a succinct , global manner , holding that the applicant \u201c had not proved that [ the prison administration \u2019s ] acts had breached the law \u201d . The court also stated that the prison administration had \u201c substantiated its arguments by evidence \u201d . The applicant was present at the hearing , assisted by an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining that the court had refused to examine certain evidence or appoint independent experts . The applicant also stated that the court had been biased since it had ignored facts which had been conceded by the prison administration ( i.e. the lack of space in the cells , smokers being detained with non - smokers , and the inadequate sanitary conditions ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held inter alia :", "\u201c The applicant alleged that his rights were violated by the officials of the [ GPE ] prison . In this case , LAW should be applied , being applicable to situations when damage is caused by the unlawful actions of [ ORG officials ] . The applicant claims non - pecuniary damages . LAW stipulates that in such cases , in addition to an award for pecuniary damage , non - pecuniary damage can also be compensated . Therefore , an award for non - pecuniary damage can be made only where pecuniary damage has been established \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded , as cryptically as ORG , that , since the applicant had sustained no pecuniary damage , there was no legal basis to award non - pecuniary damages . It did not analyse in detail the applicant \u2019s complaints . In particular , the court did not rule on whether there had been a violation of the applicant \u2019s personal rights as a result of the allegedly inadequate conditions of detention . The applicant was present at the hearing together with an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also alleged before ORG that he was subjected to unlawful searches , and that he was exposed to the risk of contracting HIV in prison . However , he did not raise these complaints before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made similar complaints in his submissions to the ORG about his conditions of detention after his conviction in FAC . The Government referred to this prison as ORG , ( formerly ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . It was a high security corrective labour colony for recidivists who had been sentenced to imprisonment . The applicant had served part of his sentence there .", "CARDINAL . The relevant periods for the ORG \u2019s examination ran from DATE until DATE , from DATE to DATE , and from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . In response to the applicant \u2019s complaints , the Government contended that the applicant had been detained in a sector which had had CARDINAL unlocked rooms , housing CARDINAL prisoners . Prisoners had been free to walk around the sector , talk to others , watch television , play games , etc . , from TIME on DATE , and from TIME on DATE and holidays . They had been allowed out of the sector , on request , to use educational or recreational facilities , to go to the washhouse , the chapel , the library or the canteen , to perform work , etc .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prison \u2019s population increased to CARDINAL at DATE and to CARDINAL at DATE . The minimum standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 of floor space per person had been respected and surpassed at the material time . After an inspection in DATE , CARDINAL prisoners being detained , the floor space per person had been CARDINAL m\u00b2 in the ordinary cells and ORG in the punishment cells . According to the inspection in DATE , the floor space had increased to between CARDINAL.CARDINAL m\u00b2 in the ordinary cells and PERCENT in the punishment cells . In DATE the latter had been reduced to PERCENT . A refurbishment of cell accommodation had begun .", "CARDINAL . Prisoners had had access to the law and regulations on the execution of their sentences . The applicant had been allowed DATE visits to the library and had been offered various kinds of work , which he had refused . He had been solvent at the material time due to external remittances or social benefits , so he could have used the prison shops .", "CARDINAL . The prison had been regularly inspected and found to comply with sanitary and nutritional standards .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the applicant complained to ORG on several occasions in DATE , but the ORG found most of his complaints to be unfounded . Instead , the applicant was advised to behave better and respect the rights of others , in accordance with his statutory duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action before the administrative courts , complaining about the general conditions of detention and his specific treatment by the administration of FAC . On DATE he raised further complaints . ORG and the ORG administration were the respondents in the proceedings . The applicant complained of the following :", "He had been refused a social allowance to purchase toiletries and certain basic items of hygiene .", "There had been no possibility of work in the prison to earn a little money , as a result of which he had been constantly hungry and unable to maintain his personal hygiene .", "He had been obliged to live in a cell with hostile persons or people suffering from infectious diseases .", "His relatives had not been allowed to visit him .", "He had not been allowed to make a telephone call freely , as he had been required to fill in a questionnaire , stating an addressee and the reason for every call ; at times the right to make a call had been refused even after completing the questionnaire .", "The prison administration had refused to issue him with certain official documents , including those required to bring court proceedings .", "He had not been able to make photocopies or have free postage stamps for his complaints , and he had not been provided with paper , envelopes or pens .", "The prison administration had prevented him from having a personal stamp with his name , or a floppy disc with educational programmes , and had prohibited him from using a personal computer to type his various complaints about the conditions of detention .", "The prison administration had seized paper which the applicant had received in a parcel .", "They had unlawfully deleted his personal notes from his electronic note - book .", "The prison administration had refused to provide him with information about the internal prison rules or the statutory requirements for ORG diet .", "He had not been afforded free legal and translation assistance to prepare various court proceedings concerning the alleged violation of his personal rights .", "The prison administration had delayed his letters and withheld some of them ; he had not been given certain letters sent to him , and certain of his letters and documents had been removed .", "He had been victimised by the prison administration in view of his criticism of the conditions of detention , by being subjected to unlawful disciplinary measures , such as solitary confinement ( for an unspecified period ) .", "The temperature in the solitary confinement cell had been very low and the toilet had smelled awful ; he had also been precluded from attending certain educational courses , church services or social activities , or from reading and using electronic equipment while in the solitary confinement cell .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that these grievances about his conditions of detention had been ignored by the authorities , and that he had never been informed about the decisions reached in response to his complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly rejected the applicant \u2019s case regarding numerous disciplinary sanctions , because he had not submitted a hierarchical complaint to ORG of ORG , and had missed the statutory time - limit of DATE to raise certain issues before the court . The applicant failed to appeal against the decision of DATE in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements , namely to set out his complaints in a comprehensible manner .", "CARDINAL . However , the court agreed to hear the applicant \u2019s complaints regarding other conditions of his detention and ordered him to submit the necessary documents proving that he had suffered damage . These complaints involved , inter alia , alleged persecution for having lodged complaints criticising the prison administration , a lack of legal aid , long term personal visits or telephone calls , a failure to supply copies of documents and envelopes , a failure to control cell temperatures , the censorship of correspondence , the lack of opportunity to attend educational courses , and the like ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG held a hearing in the presence of the applicant , assisted by an interpreter . His complaints were subsequently rejected as unsubstantiated . In particular , the court :", "\u201c ... found no indication of unlawful action or inaction on the part of the employees of [ the prison ] or ORG of ORG . Nor is there any indication that the applicant has suffered damage ... There is no evidence in the case file that the applicant has been victimised by way of revenge or psychological pressure in response to his complaints and criticism [ regarding his conditions of detention ] , or that his rights have [ otherwise ] been violated . The applicant \u2019s statements about psychological pressure and a violation of his rights are [ thus ] unsubstantiated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This decision was read out at the hearing . Subsequently , the applicant was served with a written copy of it in the NORP language .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining inter alia that the first - instance court had been biased , that it had refused to examine certain witnesses and evidence , and that it had ignored various facts . In his appeal , the applicant also raised new complaints . In particular , he submitted that he had not been given enough food , that he had been deprived of the right to dial a certain telephone number , and that the prison administration had refused to communicate with him in the LANGUAGE language .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance decision . It noted that the applicant had failed to substantiate his complaints as to the alleged violation of his personal rights .

The last inspection had been carried out on DATE , establishing that the quality of the food had been satisfactory , and that there had been no violation of the relevant food norms .", "- In response to the applicant \u2019s complaint about the inability to dial a certain telephone number , the respondents submitted that the making of telephone calls had been regulated by ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and LAW , which had stipulated that the cost of a telephone call should be met by the prisoner .", "- All the official communications and correspondence in the prison had been conducted in the NORP language , pursuant to domestic regulations , the applicant having been afforded the possibility to learn the NORP language since DATE .", "- In response to the applicant \u2019s complaint about the refusal to grant him a social allowance , the court noted that social benefits had been distributed in accordance with the Rules of ORG , approved by Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE . The rules stipulated that an inmate was eligible for a social allowance if , during DATE , he had no money or a sum inferior to CARDINAL of the statutory minimum standard of living , and had had no disciplinary penalties . The amount of such an allowance in each case also depended on the availability of funds . Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had received disciplinary penalties , the prison administration had taken into account his difficult financial situation , awarding him an allowance of LTL CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) on CARDINAL occasions : in DATE and DATE , and in DATE and DATE .", "- Insofar as the applicant had complained about the refusal of the prison administration to grant him free legal aid , his complaints were wholly unsubstantiated .", "- The applicant had been able to make photocopies of the documents necessary for the submission of his complaints .

The court refused to examine the applicant \u2019s other complaints which had not been raised at first instance .", "CARDINAL . By final decisions of DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE , DATE and DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s further claims for moral and pecuniary damages in relation to his conditions of detention , which claims had been lodged against various authorities , such as the central ORG of ORG , ORG itself and the PERSON prison administration .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had unsuccessfully tried to bring numerous civil and criminal proceedings against certain private newspapers and journalists and other private persons , as well as various ORG agencies and officials , for alleged affronts to his dignity and reputation , as well as an interference with his private life . However , his actions had been dismissed because he had failed to comply with the statutory procedural requirements to formulate his submissions adequately , to present his complaints in the NORP language or to pay stamp duty . The applicant had not appealed against those decisions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been subjected to various disciplinary penalties during his detention . According to the ORG , once , on DATE at FAC , his right to use the prison shop or receive parcels from the outside had been withdrawn for DATE . This penalty had been revoked before term by the prison director . DATE at FAC , he had been disciplined CARDINAL times , as a result of which he had served varying periods of DATE in the punishment cell on CARDINAL occasions . Otherwise the sanctions had involved mere warnings or reprimands .

The official standard floor space was also CARDINAL to CARDINAL m\u00b2 for such prisoners ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The sanitary , space , food and medical requirements in detention facilities were further regulated by ORG . CARDINAL and Ministerial ( health care ) Order No . CARDINAL . Adequate heating , ventilation ( windows ) , sanitation and cleanliness were necessary requirements for all places of detention , but no distinction was made between smoking and non - smoking cells .

The floors of sanitary facilities were to be cleaned DATE . Food was free of charge and had to comply with governmental nutritional standards .", "CARDINAL . Detainees were required to conform to their respective regimes or face disciplinary sanctions , to be determined according to the gravity and character of the offence . LAW set out GPE duty to observe order in prison , to comply with lawful demands , to refrain from communicating with people in other cells , etc . LAW specified the possible disciplinary penalties for remand prisoners , such as a warning or reprimand , extra cleaning duties , a denial of access to the prison shops and the receipt of parcels for DATE , or incarceration in a punishment cell for DATE .

Detainees were to be informed of incoming correspondence within DATE of its arrival but were not given it . Instead , until DATE , it was kept in the individual \u2019s file . The ORG \u2019s letters were , however , to be notified within DATE of receipt . As of DATE , the decision to censor a detainee \u2019s correspondence was only to be taken by the investigating officer , the prosecutor or a court ( as well as the prison director in respect of a convicted prisoner ) .

ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( hereafter the \u201c CPT \u201d ) visited several NORP detention centres DATE and its ORG was published ( ORG ) . CARDINAL such centre was FAC where the present applicant was detained . ORG called it FAC which was designated as both a remand establishment and closed prison . It was built in DATE and is located in the city centre . With an official capacity of CARDINAL , on DATE it was holding CARDINAL prisoners , including CARDINAL women and CARDINAL male minors . CARDINAL of the prisoners were on remand ; the rest were sentenced prisoners , CARDINAL of whom were serving life sentences ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CPT \u2019s Report ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted , inter alia , serious overcrowding in the prisons it inspected , a particularly high rate of prisoners remanded in custody pending trial , a lack of recreational and employment facilities and insufficient staffing . At GPE , cells measured TIME m\u00b2 and held CARDINAL people instead of a maximum of CARDINAL , with insufficient room for furniture other than double or triple bunk beds . The in - cell toilets provided little privacy or separation from the sleeping and eating area , where prisoners were obliged to spend TIME a day ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ibid ) . It commented at paragraph CARDINAL of its ORG as follows ( emphasis added ) :", "\u201c Prison overcrowding is an issue of direct concern to the ORG . An overcrowded prison entails cramped and unhygienic accommodation ; a constant lack of privacy ( even when using a sanitary facility ) ; reduced out - of - cell activities , due to demand outstripping the staff and facilities available ; overburdened health - care services ; increased tension and hence more violence between prisoners and between prisoners and staff . The establishments visited by the ORG \u2019s delegation ( and , in particular , FAC ) vividly illustrated these negative consequences of overcrowding , which were all present in varying degrees of severity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG noted at paragraph CARDINAL of its Report that :", "\u201c At FAC , CARDINAL prisoners sentenced for minor offences were employed full - time on maintenance work . Efforts were also being made to provide some activities to male minors held in the establishment . Other inmates , including life - sentenced prisoners , were not offered anything which remotely resembled a regime of activities . The only DATE out - of - cell activity consisted of TIME of outdoor exercise ( TIME for women and for ill prisoners ) , which was itself a relatively recent development . The yards used for this purpose were of an insufficient size ( CARDINAL ORG ) to allow prisoners to exert themselves physically , and were generally oppressive . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG recommended as a priority , amongst other elements , that :", "- The living space for inmates should be increased to CARDINAL m\u00b2 per person ;", "- Adequate in - cell sanitary facilities should be installed to allow greater privacy ;", "- Programmes for vocational and recreational activities should be developed ;", "- Sufficient possibilities for DATE outdoor exercise should be provided ;", "- Visiting entitlements should be upwardly revised to enable prisoners to maintain relations with their families ( visits to remand prisoners being particularly limited , even non - existent at that time ) ; and", "- a study should be made of whether the control of ORG correspondence was causing excessive delays and , if appropriate , remedial action should be taken , particularly with a view to ending the practice of systematic censorship .", "CARDINAL . However , the ORG commented that there was no medical justification for the segregation of prisoners who were HIV - positive or ill with AIDS unless they were known for their unsafe or irresponsible behaviour . Steps needed to be taken to respect medical confidentiality on this subject .", "DATE . In its renewed visit from CARDINAL to DATE to the ORG [ FAC , the ORG noted the continued , severe overcrowding ( CARDINAL prisoners in a cell of seven m\u00b2 ) , and that the conditions of detention , whilst varying from CARDINAL part of that prison to another , nevertheless for the most part remained very poor . These conditions were further exacerbated by the absence of personal hygiene products , the lack of proper clothing for indigent prisoners , insufficient heating , dirty bedding , no access to hot running water or showers , poor ventilation , etc .
