All CARDINAL witnesses corroborated the applicants\u2019 version of events , namely that they had been in another local caf\u00e9 at that time .", "CARDINAL . Since the identity of witness \u201c PERSON \u201d had been disclosed in the proceedings ( PERSON ) , the trial judge granted the ORG request for him to be questioned again . At a hearing held on DATE in the presence of the applicants , ORG denied that he had testified as an anonymous witness . He denied that the applicants had bought the car from MONEY He alleged that he had been beaten by the police in order to tell the investigating judge that the applicants had bought the car ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

During the proceedings , the trial judge granted the ORG request for a face - to - confrontation with the experts who had carried out the ballistic examination .

In their concluding remarks , the applicants claimed that PERSON was in the respondent ORG and had been involved in incidents relating to the parliamentary elections of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court delivered a judgment in which it found the applicants guilty of murder and sentenced them to life imprisonment . The applicants\u2019 presence at the scene when the incident happened , as well as the development and dynamics of events , was established on the basis of the testimony of the anonymous witnesses \u201c NORP \u201d and \u201c PERSON , which the court regarded as credible and consistent despite \u201c small differences which were due to the intensity of the shooting and fear for their lives \u201d . The court also gave weight to the statement given by ORG in the pre - trial proceedings under the pseudonym \u201c PERSON \u201d . It disregarded his statement of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , finding that it had been given under duress and the threat that he or his family would be killed . In this connection it referred to a police report of DATE according to which ORG had been visited several times by unknown people who had threatened him and his family about the testimony given in the pre - trial proceedings . The motive for the crime was established on the basis of the statement given by PERSON in the pre - trial proceedings . That witness had not been examined at the trial since he had been untraceable . In that context , the trial court referred to an official note by the police of DATE informing the court that PERSON had fled the respondent ORG and that an arrest warrant ( \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 ) had been issued against him . The court did not say anything regarding the ORG allegations that ORG had in fact been in the respondent ORG and could have been located ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In the court \u2019s view , the evidence produced by the defence witnesses was unreliable and aimed at enabling the accused to avoid criminal responsibility . For this reason it considered it irrelevant to examine the remaining witnesses proposed by the defence . The applicants\u2019 defence that they had been at another location at the relevant time was found to be selfserving .", "CARDINAL . NORP In public hearings held on DATE and DATE ( latter judgment served on the applicant on DATE ) respectively , ORG and ORG upheld the ORG conviction and the sentence imposed on them . They dismissed appeals lodged by the applicants in which they complained inter alia that the trial court had failed to admit evidence proposed by the defence , that their conviction could not be based solely on the statements of the anonymous witnesses , which had been unlawfully obtained , and that the trial court had not examined ORG notwithstanding their claims that he would have been available for examination . In this connection they argued that it had been an issue of public record that in the election incidents of DATE PERSON had been wounded and hospitalised and later detained by the police .", "CARDINAL . The courts held that the evidence produced by the anonymous witnesses had been lawfully obtained and that the applicants\u2019 opportunity to put written questions to them had secured their defence rights . The fact that the witnesses had only produced evidence DATE after the incident had been due to their fear . Furthermore , they stated that the applicants\u2019 conviction had not been based solely on the evidence produced by those witnesses . In this connection they found that the trial court had admitted other evidence , both documentary and verbal . As regards the evidence produced by PERSON , the courts held that the trial court had tried to secure his attendance at the trial , but he had been unavailable for examination , as described in the police note . The higher courts also endorsed the trial court \u2019s finding regarding the applicants\u2019 motive for committing the crime , as established on the basis of the evidence produced by PERSON That had been confirmed by the pre - trial statement of witness GPE given under pseudonym \u201c PERSON \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .
