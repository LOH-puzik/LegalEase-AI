The investigating judge subsequently examined several witnesses and ordered that a forensic report be prepared by ORG , an NORP forensic expert in the field of emergency medicine and anaesthesia . ORG stated in his report that the ultimate reason for the death of the applicants\u2019 son was rather uncertain .

Following a further objection to the indictment by ORG , the interlocutory - proceedings panel examined the case on DATE and decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings . Relying in particular on the opinions of ORG and GPE , it found that the ORG son \u2019s reaction to the administration of PERSON and/or PERSON was a consequence of his sensitivity to those drugs and of myocarditis , which was undoubtedly a pre - existing condition . The court found that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the applicants\u2019 accusation that PERSON had committed the alleged criminal offence .

She added that the applicants were constantly lodging objections which made it impossible to conduct the proceedings .

For the majority of these CARDINAL questions , the record does not contain any reasons to explain why the judge did not allow the plaintiffs to put the question . In each instance , there was a prior objection by the GPE representatives to the question .", "...", "Although [ the applicants\u2019 ] reactions , statements and proposals were perhaps sometimes extreme , the authorities , including the courts , ought to have taken into account their emotional distress ... This may require the trial to be conducted in a particularly respectful and flexible way , without breaching procedural rules to the detriment of the defendants .

In his DATE Report of DATE ( pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , the ORG criticised ORG for filing the criminal complaint against the first applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . The report drew attention to ORG explanation that the court was required by law to file and pursue the criminal complaint as to refrain would constitute a criminal offence . The Ombudsman stressed that there was no legal basis for such a conclusion . On the contrary , a criminal charge for an offence of insulting behaviour could only be pursued on the basis of the aggrieved party \u2019s criminal complaint , which in the instant case was ORG complaint . Following the ORG \u2019s intervention and in view of the arguments expressed in its letters , ORG decided to withdraw the criminal complaint against the first applicant .", "DATE .
