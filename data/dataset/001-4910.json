THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant is NORP and a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE .", "A.", "The applicant lives on LOC an island situated on the north - west coast of GPE . This island was linked to the mainland by ferry until DATE when a bridge was built . The bridge is controlled by a private company and provides the only year round access and is subject to a toll . Refusal to pay the toll is a criminal offence .", "The applicant was charged in ORG at Dingwall on a summary complaint containing CARDINAL charges . The court was QUANTITY away from the applicant \u2019s home although there is a court at GPE on the island of LOC . The first offence was committed on DATE . Each charge involved a contravention of section FAC ) of the New Roads and Street Works Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The charges were that on FAC crossing near the toll - booth , the applicant , being liable to pay a toll by virtue of FAC ( ACARDINAL ) Extension ( FAC ) Toll Order DATE , without reasonable excuse refused to pay the toll .", "There were CARDINAL other people charged at the same time as the applicant , but most people have had the charges against them dropped . The applicant did get legal aid in the form of emergency cover in ORG .", "When the applicant appeared in answer to the complaint , pleas as to competency and relevancy were put forward on DATE but rejected by ORG , and he adjourned the diet for trial , which took place on DATE . The applicant complained that on each occasion he had a reasonable excuse why he should not pay the toll . The sheriff found that the applicant \u2019s arguments did not amount to an objective reason or reasonable excuse of any kind . All of the applicant \u2019s reasons were subjective . The sheriff found the applicant guilty of all CARDINAL charges ; he imposed fines on each of the charges and ordered recovery of the fines by civil diligence .", "In this case LAW was entered into by the Secretary of ORG and ORG on DATE . In that agreement the Secretary of ORG assigned the right under and in terms of ORG to charge and collect tolls during the concession period , which was stated to commence on the date of issue of the NORP to Use for the crossing . On the same date those parties signed a ORG which provided that on the completion of the crossing the developer would be granted the right to collect and retain tolls and operate and maintain the crossing . The agreement also provided that , following an inspection of the bridge on completion , the Secretary of ORG , if satisfied all was in order , would issue a ORG to Use .", "The Invergarry - Kyle of FAC ( ACARDINAL ) Extension ( FAC ) Toll Order DATE ( \u201c the Toll Order \u201d ) was made on DATE and came into force on DATE . The Permit to Use was signed on DATE .", "The applicant appealed against both conviction and sentence but subsequently only proceeded with the former appeal . On DATE before the hearing the applicant was informed that he was to be granted legal aid .", "The first ground of appeal was that the proceedings were incompetent since FAC ( who subsequently changed their name to ORG ) had no proper assignation of the right to collect tolls . In LAW the Secretary of ORG had purported to assign the right to charge and collect tolls to ORG as the Concessionaire but that purported assignation was void as the Secretary of ORG did not have the power to grant an assignation at that time ( it was prior to the existence of LAW ) .", "On DATE ORG found that there was nothing in the DATE Act to prohibit an assignation of this type being made before execution of FAC and rejected this ground of appeal . They felt it was clear from section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL LAW that it was envisaged that the contract with the developer would pre - date LAW . The ORG found that in effect the terms of LAW were that there would be no transfer of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s right to charge tolls until the Toll Order was made . Further at common law it was possible to grant an assignation of a right in anticipation of it coming into existence .", "The second ground of appeal was that the copies of LAW provided were incomplete and this was unfair to the applicant . ORG", "The third ground of appeal was that it had not been established that the collection of the tolls was made by a person duly authorised by the concessionaire ( FAC ) . The ORG rejected this saying that it was reasonable to infer that the men in the toll booths had authority to collect tolls , and that by driving into the lane which was not appropriate for the toll barrier the applicant was seeking to by - pass the toll barrier and was thus refusing to pay the toll . In the circumstances the toll collectors were acting with ostensible authority and must be presumed to have been duly authorised . In any event on CARDINAL occasions the bridge manager himself and on CARDINAL occasion the bridge supervisor personally asked the applicant to pay and he refused .", "During DATE and DATE the applicant was called to PERSON court CARDINAL times and went to the appeal court once . He was charged with non - payment on each occasion he refused to pay the fine during this period . On DATE the applicant failed to appear at CARDINAL of the intermediate hearing diets because he never received notification of the hearing . He was as a result arrested and held TIME in the cells . Subsequent to this in DATE the Government enacted retrospective legislation to prevent the use of multiple intermediate diets to continue a case . He was in fact detained TIME in police cells CARDINAL times and in prison for DATE . The appeal was therefore dismissed .", "On his arrest the applicant was driven QUANTITY to the police station at speed and suffered pain from an old back injury and on CARDINAL occasion on arrival sought pain killers from the police doctor . He had to give up his property , and was placed in a cell with a thin mattress and non - flushable toilet . He was given water and no other drink on DATE of arrest . TIME he ate his breakfast standing by the open toilet and was only allowed to wash in a sink under guard .", "On DATE the applicant wrote to the Secretary of ORG for GPE seeking a review of his case because in other identical cases the prosecution submitted in evidence sections of the documents deemed to be irrelevant in his case . The Secretary of ORG replied on DATE having investigated the allegations made . He concluded that the applicant was mistaken in that the documents produced by the ORG in the other cases were exactly the same as in the applicant \u2019s case . Any additional material had been introduced by the defendants . There was nothing to suggest a miscarriage of justice .", "On DATE and DATE the applicant was charged and on DATE the applicant was found guilty of a road traffic offence following his stopping at the toll barrier and refusing to pay the toll . The police charged him with obstruction as they had been told not to charge anyone under LAW any longer . The applicant was legally represented and submitted a writ of suspension and appeal .", "On DATE the applicant also wrote to a Member of ORG complaining about the number of people imprisoned for refusing to pay tolls , the number of intermediate diets which were fixed against him , and the lack of legal aid . The Lord Advocate replied confirming that the applicant was remanded in custody because of his repeated failure to appear in court . He was not sentenced to imprisonment as punishment on conviction for an offence . The law in respect of intermediate diets was amended in DATE . In respect of the lack of legal aid it was pointed out that he was convicted after trial on CARDINAL separate occasions and his first CARDINAL appeals went to a full hearing . At CARDINAL of those the applicant was represented by counsel .", "On DATE the applicant did not attend court in GPE because he refused to pay the toll on FAC . On DATE the applicant wrote to the Secretary of GPE complaining about this event . There was a further trial on this charge on DATE relating to another charge of obstruction .", "B. Relevant domestic law and practice", "A summary of the relevant provisions of section CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL LOC and Street Works Act DATE is as follows :", "Section CARDINAL", "( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) This empowers the Secretary of ORG to make a toll order relating to a special road to be provided by the Secretary of ORG ( such as FAC ) . The power is exercisable by statutory instrument and there is no requirement for Parliamentary approval .", "( CARDINAL ) This provides that the toll order and the special road scheme are to proceed in tandem .", "( CARDINAL ) This envisages that the Secretary of ORG ( where he is the roads authority ) may enter a contract for the design or construction of a road which both parties intend will be subject to a toll order .", "Section CARDINAL", "( CARDINAL ) This states that the toll order may authorise the Secretary of ORG to assign his right to charge and collect tolls .", "Section CARDINAL", "It is an offence , without reasonable excuse , to refuse , fail to pay or evade a toll which a person is liable to pay by virtue of a toll order ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
