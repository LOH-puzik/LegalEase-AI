The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The first and second applicants live in GPE , the third applicant lives in GPE and the fourth and fifth applicants live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , who are siblings , were joint owners ( CARDINAL each ) of CARDINAL adjacent plots of land in GPE , registered under files nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LOC land register , which they inherited in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the property at issue still belonged to the applicants ' father , the NORP municipality issued a provisional area zoning plan ( PERSON ) designating the CARDINAL parcels of land as non - building land . Before that , the property was not covered by any area zoning plan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed an appeal by the applicants ' father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the area zoning plan ( GPE ) was approved by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' request for a change of the designation of their land into building land ( Bauland ) , dated DATE , was to no avail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants claimed compensation of MONEY ( CHF ) for damage allegedly incurred due to the designation of their land as non - building land . They claimed that that designation amounted to de facto expropriation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , dismissed their claim . They found that the impugned designation of the applicants ' property , not previously subject to any area zoning plan , as non - building land did not amount to a de facto expropriation conferring a right to compensation . In particular , the applicants ' land had not been opened up for building , nor had there been any plans of the municipality to prepare it for development .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed an appeal against the above Government decision with ORG ( PERSON ) . They claimed , inter alia , that the elements on which the ORG had based their decision had not been established in adversarial proceedings . In particular , the applicants alleged that they had not been given an opportunity to present their views on the question of whether or not their land had been opened up for development purposes , which , in fact , had been the case . Thus , they requested that the parties be heard on the matter and that an inspection of the property be carried out . Further , they requested that ORG obtain the TIME of ORG meeting of DATE , which showed that the municipality had considered the possibility of including their property in a building area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP municipality , as respondent , filed submissions ( PERSON ) requesting ORG to dismiss the appeal . They referred to the reasons underlying the designation of the applicants ' property as non - building land and claimed that the applicants ' predecessor had not appealed against the area zoning plan . Further , the municipality contested the applicants ' assertion that the said property had been opened up . Contrary to the applicants ' assertions , the adjacent parcels had equally been designated as non - building land . The municipality also submitted the TIME referred to by the applicants . The municipality 's comments were not served on the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , dismissed the applicants ' appeal . The ORG was presided over by judge PERSON", "CARDINAL . In its decision , ORG described the conduct of the proceedings so far , including a detailed summary of the comments submitted by the PERSON municipality , noting that the conditions for compensation were not met , inter alia because the applicants ' property had not been opened up . The neighbouring parcels were also undeveloped . When the zoning plan was issued , the applicants could not legitimately expect a designation of their property as building land .", "Pointing out that the applicants had filed very detailed written submissions , ORG found that they had been given sufficient opportunity to submit their arguments and evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a complaint with ORG ) under LAW of LAW ( Staatsgerichtshofsgesetz ) , claiming that the principle of equality of arms had been infringed in that ORG had based its decision on new submissions made by the PERSON municipality ( concerning the issue of whether the applicants ' predecessors had appealed against the zoning plan and concerning the question of whether the applicants ' property had been opened up ) , to which they had had no opportunity to reply .", "They also complained about procedural defects , in particular that ORG had failed to hear them and to carry out an inspection of the property at issue . In sum they asserted that ORG decision violated their right to property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicants of the composition of the panel of CARDINAL judges that would examine their case in private on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicants filed a challenge for bias against ORG , CARDINAL of the panel judges , claiming that he was to be disqualified on account of his partnership in a law firm ( Kanzleigemeinschaft ) with PERSON , i.e. with the presiding judge of the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , dismissed the applicants ' complaint , confirming that the designation of their property as non - building land did not amount to a de facto expropriation requiring compensation .", "CARDINAL . Bearing in mind that the principle of equality of arms was a basic element of the fairness of proceedings , it agreed in principle with the applicants ' argument that they should have been afforded an opportunity to be informed of and to comment upon the PERSON municipality 's observations in reply to their appeal . In that regard , the ORG observed that the submissions in issue had contained new information , in particular , the alleged fact that the applicants ' predecessor had never filed an objection against the area zoning plan . If established , that fact would have had a negative effect on the applicants ' legal position . However , ORG noted that this submission had not played any role in ORG decision . Thus , no prejudice had resulted from this procedural deficiency . Considering these special circumstances as well as the fact that the proceedings as a whole had been adversarial , ORG concluded that the applicants ' procedural rights had not been impaired .", "CARDINAL . As far as the applicants ' allegations of bias were concerned , ORG , referring to an academic commentary on GPE administrative law , recalled that a country of the size of GPE had limited human resources in the public sector . It stressed that , in such circumstances , questions of replacement should be dealt with cautiously if one did not wish to jeopardise the proper functioning of the GPE authorities . The court pointed out that , by virtue of section CARDINAL of LAW , a judge of ORG , being at the same time a judge at another GPE court had to be disqualified from proceedings where a complaint concerned a decision issued by that court . However , ORG found that the same did not apply in cases where a judge was merely acquainted with a judge who had taken part in the impugned decision . Moreover , it noted that , in a ORG based on the rule of law , the quashing of a decision by ORG was nothing unusual and did not cast doubt on the professional skills of the judges involved in that decision . In those circumstances , the ORG found that the applicants ' fears of bias could not be considered to be objectively justified .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court 's decision was served on the applicants on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW ( Staatsgerichtshofgesetz ) concerns the composition of ORG . It provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
