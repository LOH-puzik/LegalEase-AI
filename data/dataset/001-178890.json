If registration was granted \u201c it would operate in the territory of the respondent ORG as part of a foreign orthodox church ... it would operate and be managed autonomously within the canonical jurisdiction of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy , notably ( the SOC ) ... which had no canonical or any other jurisdiction over ( the ORG ) or in the territory of ( the respondent ORG ) . \u201d That was in violation of LAW on LAW , LAW ;", "( d ) the founding decision had specified only the temporary place of registration of the applicant association , without specifying \u201c a specific seat and address \u201d ( \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0430 ) , as required under LAW ) of the DATE Act ; and", "( e ) Bishop NORP was nominated to act on behalf ( \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0432\u0430 ) of the applicant association , but not to represent ( \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0443\u0432\u0430 ) it , as required under section CARDINAL LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act .", "CARDINAL . The registration court concluded that the applicant association \u2019s registration would run counter to the DATE Act . It further stated that :", "\u201c ( such a registration would violate ) the freedom of religion ... of all physical persons , which they manifest through already registered religious communities . It would also violate the legitimate legal status of other voluntary associations of persons recorded in the court register ... their management bodies , hierarchy , competencies , titles , religious activities ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing ( i ) that the court had erred when seeking \u201c an expert opinion \u201d about the meaning of \u201c Pe\u0107 Patriarchy \u201d from the ORG , which was not neutral ; ( ii ) that the registration of the ORG in DATE under the name \u201c ORG \u201d had been unlawful . In this connection , the applicant submitted extracts from several media reports published at the time , according to which the competent body of the ORG , at its meeting held on CARDINAL and CARDINAL October CARDINAL , had refused to change the name in its LAW ; ( iii ) that the ORG had applied to the Bureau for registration of the name \u201c ORG \u201d as a trademark was irrelevant , since LAW concerned goods and services and not religious organisations . In this connection , the applicant argued that , in any event , the ORG had confirmed that on DATE the ORG had requested registration of CARDINAL trademarks , including the trademark \u201c ORG \u201d . However , the ORG had never paid the registration fee for any of the trademarks for which registration had been sought . Consequently , those names were never registered as trademarks , nor were trademark certificates ever issued ; ( iv ) the applicant association was set up by CARDINAL founding members who had signed the minutes of the constituent assembly held on DATE . Consequently , the court had been wrong to hold that the founding decision had been rendered by the applicant association \u2019s ORG , as that body had no legal capacity to act before the applicant association was registered ; ( v ) no reasonable explanation had been given as to why the applicant association \u2019s intended name did not imply that it concerned a religious organisation ; ( vi ) the court \u2019s interpretation that the expression \u201c NORP \u201d was an LANGUAGE translation of \u201c ORG \u201d was wrong ; ( vii ) the intended name of the applicant association was different from the name of any registered religious organisation , including the name of the ORG to which \u201c ORG \u201d had been unlawfully added . In this connection the applicant stated \u201c ( it ) differs from the ORG , with which we refuse to be associated . \u201d It further submitted that the court had allowed registration of CARDINAL churches despite the fact that their names were substantially the same , namely \u201c ORG ( church of the NORP of DATE ) in GPE \u201d and \u201c ORG in GPE \u201d . It concluded the discussion under this head by saying that \u201c had the court had difficulty with the intended name , it could have raised that issue in written correspondence and we would have replied . This clearly suggests that the court would refuse to register [ the applicant association ] under any name \u201d ; ( viii ) the registration court had given unsubstantiated explanations of a theological and historical nature favourable to the ORG ; ( ix ) the applicable legislation did not preclude a religious community from being in canonical union with other churches in the world ; ( x ) the refusal to register the applicant association violated the freedom of religion of the orthodox NORP and NORP in the respondent ORG , as the intended name suggested that it represented those communities ; and ( PERSON ) lastly , the applicant association reiterated that it was ready to rectify any error the registration court might ask it to .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant association \u2019s appeal , reiterating the reasoning given by the registration court .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter , ORG ( Bishop NORP ) submitted a constitutional appeal to ORG , claiming that the authorities\u2019 refusal to register the applicant as \u201c the Greek - Orthodox ORG of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy \u201d had affected his religious rights specified in Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . In this connection , he claimed that the religious organisation with which he was affiliated had not been allowed registration for DATE , and thus had been denied the opportunity to obtain legal - entity status . He stated \u201c I \u2019m prevented from exercising my freedom of religious observance in association with other people on a voluntary basis . \u201d He further argued that without legal - entity status the applicant association was prevented from enjoying certain statutory rights : it could not construct religious temples ; its members could not conduct religious ceremonies ; it could not instruct religion or create religious schools ; and it could not manage its property , nor could it hold bank accounts . Bishop NORP invited the court to consider his appeal as submitted on behalf of all members of his religious organisation . Since ORG had already rejected a similar appeal lodged on behalf of several people ( U.br.CARDINAL/CARDINAL , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he consented that his appeal be regarded as being submitted only in his name . He further stated :", "\u201c I agree , and after having consulted the other members of my religious community , I know that they also agree , that ORG orders registration of ORG of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy under conditions specified by law and we would adjust to any requirements set by the court . If a change in the name is needed , that should be indicated as a condition for our registration and once it is satisfied , ( we ) should be registered . If another condition should be fulfilled , that should be specified and we will try to accommodate it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the constitutional appeal of GPE concerning \u201c the freedom of belief and prohibition of discrimination on religious grounds \u201d ( U.br.CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Referring to the courts\u2019 decisions rejecting the applicant association \u2019s request for registration as \u201c ORG of the Pe\u0107 Patriarchy \u201d and relying on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE of the LAW , the court stated :", "\u201c The court can not examine the appeal on the merits since the complainant did not comply with the formal statutory requirements before a competent court ( for registration of the applicant ) . The complainant is willing to comply with the statutory requirements for registration , but he has failed to do so in practice and ( he ) does not prove that the competent court was wrong in its judgment that those requirements had not been complied with ... in such circumstances , this court can not rule on the request for the protection of human rights and freedoms in relation to specific final decisions of competent bodies . It is so since the person concerned ( \u0441\u0443\u0431\u0458\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0442 ) did not take any action in the court proceedings to comply with the statutory requirements , which apply similarly to all citizens . This derives from his request that this court suggest to him what needs to be done for ( the applicant association ) to be registered , which implies knowledge that there were ( certain ) flaws which led to non - registration . The complainant was not a priori refused registration of his religious community by a final judicial decision . The refusal he received was for non - compliance with the statutory requirements . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An article published in the DATE newspaper GPE on DATE quoted the then Chairman of the Commission ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , who stated that :", "\u201c not at any price will Bishop PERSON ( PERSON ) be allowed to perform religious rituals or to have a seat in an exarchate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An article published in the DATE newspaper Vest on DATE quoted the following part of a joint statement by the then President of the respondent ORG and the Archbishop of the ORG :", "\u201c The ORG and ORG are and will remain together .

The media attention they receive , irrespective of motives and intentions , affects both the ORG and NORP national and ORG interests . \u201d", "CARDINAL . An article published in the DATE newspaper ORG on DATE reported on discussions held between the Prime Minister of the respondent ORG and the Archbishop of the ORG regarding certain provisions of the DATE Act . Following that discussion , the majority of bishops in the ORG , as stated in the article , had requested that the ORG should not accept any compromise which would prevent it from protecting itself against a parallel church , led by PERSON , being created .", "CARDINAL . An article published in the DATE newspaper ORG on DATE reported on the alleged discontent of the applicant \u2019s followers about its name as submitted in the second registration proceedings . In this connection the article quoted a letter by PERSON in which he allegedly stated :", "\u201c The ( Holy ) Synod was governed by the idea that the name of the religious community in respect of which we seek registration does not betray the essence of our ORG . You know well that NORP does not mean NORP ( by nationality ) of NORP faith , but that name refers to all known ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
