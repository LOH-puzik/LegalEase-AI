NORP The applicants\u2019 legal predecessors owned a plot of land with a surface area of QUANTITY m. located in the municipality of ORG , listed in a land register under entry no . DATE . In DATE the applicants inherited this property as coowners . The property was designated , by an administrative decision given on an undetermined date , apparently prior to DATE , for agricultural use .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the first applicant was informed by ORG that the starting date for the development foreseen by the draft land development plan for the municipality had not yet been yet fixed , but that it was most likely that work would begin after DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the relevant local development plan , which was adopted in DATE and later amended in DATE , the entire property had been designated for construction of a major roadway , connecting the municipality with GPE , and various commercial buildings . As a result , the applicants could continue to use their property for gardening or agricultural purposes , but could not carry out any development . A number of owners lodged objections against this plan , which were ultimately dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants requested the municipality to specify the use to which their property would be put under the land development plan and to indicate timelimits for the works to begin . They also requested the municipality to acquire the property from them . This offer apparently remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants made an enquiry with the municipality as to the development plans in respect of their property .", "CARDINAL . In a reply of DATE they were informed that their property remained covered by the development plan adopted in DATE under which it was designated for construction of a roadway and for various commercial buildings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants renewed their request for the municipality to acquire their plot . This was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants complained to the municipal authorities that the local land development plan had not been implemented and that no timeframe for its implementation had been foreseen , even tentatively . As a result , they could not carry out any development of the property and had been left in a prolonged state of uncertainty as to its future fate . It could not be used for leisure purposes as it was situated in a rather unattractive area . They had been contacted by many potential buyers who , having learnt about the lack of possibilities to develop the land immediately , had lost interest in buying the property . Their requests that the municipality acquire their land had been unsuccessful . As a result of the legal situation of the property , their ownership had been stripped of all economic value .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were informed by ORG that their land would be acquired in the future by a company which would construct the roadway foreseen under the DATE development plan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested , for the first time , that an initial approval of a development project ( decyzja o warunkach zabudowy ) be issued for the construction of a small house on their land .", "CARDINAL . In a reply of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed them that such a decision could not be issued as it would not be compatible with the local land development plan adopted in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a further letter of DATE ORG informed the applicants that the mere fact that their property had been foreseen for future expropriation for the purposes of the construction of the roadway did not entail for the municipality an obligation to acquire their land from them . Accordingly , there were no immediate plans to purchase the properties designated in the local development plan for the construction of the roadway . They were also informed that a new land development plan was being prepared by the municipality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants complained to ORG about the local administration \u2019s failure to adopt a new land development plan . They referred to the restrictions which the DATE plan imposed on the exercise of their ownership .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected their complaint , holding that a complaint against the administration \u2019s failure to act could not be made in respect of proceedings concerning elaboration of local land development plans .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the relevant local development plan expired , pursuant to LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Apparently to date no new land development plan has been adopted by the municipality .", "CARDINAL . DATE to DATE questions of land development were governed by LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW was enacted . It entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG passed a law amending LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW was enacted which repealed LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of DATE owners of properties to be expropriated in the future were not entitled to any form of compensation for damage resulting from restrictions on the use of their property or the reduction in its value originating in expropriations to be carried out at an undetermined future date .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW enacted in DATE created for local authorities a number of obligations towards owners whose properties were designated for expropriation at an undetermined future date under land development plans adopted by the competent municipal authorities . The municipalities were obliged to buy such property , replace it with other land within DATE of an owner \u2019s request , or provide compensation for the damage caused by the designation .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , pursuant to section QUANTITY , these obligations and the corresponding claims of the owners applied only to plans adopted after the Act had entered into force , i.e. to plans adopted by local municipalities after CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the DATE Act , plans adopted before its entry into force were to expire on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE an amendment to LAW was adopted under which the validity of such plans was extended for DATE until DATE . Again , on DATE , ORG passed a law amending LAW DATE which extended until DATE the validity of the land development plans adopted before DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , all local plans adopted before DATE remained valid , but not beyond DATE .", "CARDINAL . Compensation entitlements for owners , provided for by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , were in essence maintained by LAW . Pursuant to section QUANTITY , when , following the adoption of a new local land development plan , the use of property in the manner provided for by a previous plan has become impossible or has been restricted , it is open to the owner to claim compensation from the municipality , or to request the municipality to buy the plot . Any litigation which may arise in this respect between municipalities and owners can be pursued before the civil courts . It would appear that the operation of section CARDINAL is not retroactive , thus limiting the scope of any such claims to the period after the adoption of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . Other relevant legislative provisions are extensively set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG examined the request submitted to it by the ORG to determine the compatibility with LAW of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW DATE insofar as it excluded the application of section CARDINAL of that Act to land development plans adopted before DATE . The court referred to its established case - law to the effect that ownership could not be regarded as ius infinitivum . Consequently , its exercise was normally restrained by many legal and practical considerations , including the necessity of balancing the ORG interests against those of other persons . Local land development plans were to be regarded only as a practical expression of restraints originating in numerous statutes regulating the lawful exercise of ownership . In particular , owners of properties \u201c frozen \u201d for the purpose of future expropriations as a result of the adoption of such plans could normally continue to use their properties as they had been using them prior to the adoption of such plans . This did not amount to such an interference with ownership that it could be regarded as being incompatible with the constitutional protection of ownership ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
