The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a payment order under which the applicant was obliged to pay the equivalent of MONEY to the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , through his lawyer , filed an objection to the order . The lawyer sent the objection to ORG by registered mail . He submitted a copy of a postal certificate according to which he had deposited the mail for despatch to ORG in PERSON at the post office on DATE . The mail had registration number R CARDINAL . The certificate , in which the addressee was indicated by the sender , did not mention the contents of the mail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection to the payment order . The decision stated that the order had been served on DATE and that the time - limit for challenging it by means of an objection had expired on DATE . The court held that the applicant had filed the objection on DATE the date appearing on the stamp of ORG \u2013 which was out of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . With reference to Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Code of Civil Procedure he argued that by depositing the remedy as registered mail at the post office on DATE he had respected the statutory time - limit . He submitted a copy of the postal certificate R CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG judge heard the applicant and his lawyer . The lawyer stated that the registered mail R CARDINAL was the only mail which he had deposited in person at the post office in ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge heard an employee of ORG in charge of incoming mail . The employee , after having consulted the file , confirmed that the document in question had been stamped and signed by her and that she had received it in person . She further stated that , in accordance with constant practice , the court \u2019s registry would attach the envelope to the letter in case of its delivery by post and that this fact would be mentioned on the document . The employee also pointed out that the applicant \u2019s lawyer used to bring most of his documents to the court in person but admitted that he sometimes also sent submissions by post . In reply to a question by the lawyer the employee stated that it was impossible to determine the contents of the registered mail R CARDINAL addressed to the court and to whom it had been submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision of DATE . With reference to ORG stamp of DATE on the relevant document and to the above statement of the employee of ORG , ORG established that the remedy had been filed out of time . Since the postal certificate did not indicate the contents of registered mail R CARDINAL , the applicant had not reliably shown that he had deposited the relevant document at the post office on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal on points of law . He argued that the employee of ORG could have committed an error when registering the document and that the mail register of ORG did not indicate the contents of registered mail R CARDINAL and to whom it had been transferred . He argued that it had not been reliably shown that the document had been deposited in person as the lower courts had found .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal on points of law . ORG held that ORG stamp on the document challenging the payment order indicated that the document had arrived at FAC on DATE . According to a handwritten remark which the employee of ORG in charge of incoming mail had made on it , the document had been submitted to the court \u2019s registry in person . These facts , taken together with the statement of the employee before ORG judge , showed that the remedy had been filed belatedly . The applicant had not proved beyond any doubt that the registered mail R CARDINAL deposited at the post on DATE had actually contained his objection to the payment order .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Code of Civil Procedure , a time - limit fixed in the context of judicial proceedings is respected when the action to be taken is effected at a court or where a submission is transmitted , on DATE on which the time - limit is to expire , to a body which is under an obligation to deliver it to the addressee .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with established practice , a timelimit is deemed to be respected where a document is deposited , before DATE on which the time - limit expires , at a post office for the purpose of its delivery to the addressee through postal services .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment given in DATE ORG of the Slovak Socialist Republic held that the date indicated on the postal certificate issued to the sender of registered mail and not the date on the envelope of such mail was relevant when considering whether an appeal was filed in time . ORG expressed the view that a court could dismiss an appeal as having been filed belatedly only where it had reliable reasons for such a conclusion . In particular , it had to establish when , where and how an appeal was actually filed ( ORG Collection , CARDINAL , p.
