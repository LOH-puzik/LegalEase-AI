In DATE ORG issued a resolution in reply to a legal question whether a legal aid lawyer could refuse to lodge a cassation appeal . It replied to the question in the positive .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that issues involved in the legal aid concerned not only proper administration of justice , but also touched on human rights , and a right of access to a court in particular . Nevertheless , there was no comprehensive and coherent regulation of legal aid available under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . The mere fact that it was necessary for a cassation appeal to be lodged by a qualified representative was not open to criticism . However , a certain conceptual confusion was to be noted in the provisions governing legal aid as a whole , mostly because the legislator had failed to harmonise the relevant provisions of civil and criminal procedure . In particular , the scope of legal aid lawyers\u2019 obligations when legal representation was mandatory was not directly addressed by provisions of civil procedure . This was so partly because the essential body of law concerning civil procedure had been enacted in DATE , while the provisions on mandatory legal representation for the purposes of the cassation appeal had been introduced in DATE , when this new kind of appeal had been created .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the scope of legal aid lawyers\u2019 obligations to provide a party to the proceedings with \u201c legal aid \u201d in civil proceedings was unclear . In particular , the provisions on the ORG legal aid obligations in connection with cassation proceedings before ORG lacked clarity . The court noted that the judicial practice regarding the application of relevant provisions had given rise to serious difficulties of interpretation and discrepancies in the case - law of the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the issue of possible conflict between the opinion of a party granted legal aid and a lawyer assigned to represent him or her for the purpose of cassation proceedings had not been directly addressed by the applicable law . It further noted that the notion of legal assistance could not be identified with a simple obligation of a lawyer to act in accordance with the client \u2019s wishes . The role of a legal aid lawyer had rather to be understood as obliging him or her to provide legal advice to the party , including as to the prospects of success offered by a cassation appeal against a given judgment .", "CARDINAL . The constitutional role of ORG , the highest judicial authority , was also an argument in favour of a conclusion that a legal aid lawyer was not compelled by the will of the party to have a cassation appeal lodged if such an appeal was bound to fail . In case of a disagreement between the party and the lawyer , it was open to the party to complain to the local Bar under LAW . The Bar could then appoint a new lawyer who could lodge a cassation appeal , requesting at the same time to be granted leave to appeal out of time under LAW . It was true that the practice of ORG was not coherent in that in some cases it had been rejecting such requests and in other it accepted them . However , it did not prevent the parties from having recourse to this course of action .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a party to the proceedings may ask for retrospective leave to perform a procedural measure outside the prescribed time - limit ; this measure shall be performed simultaneously with lodging the request .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure reads , insofar as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
