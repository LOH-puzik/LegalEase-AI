At the material time the applicant was editor - in - chief of the local DATE newspaper \u201c I\u0142awski Tydzie\u0144 \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newspaper published an article coauthored by the applicant , entitled \u201c Municipality in danger ; authorities fail to see problem \u201d . It described in detail the situation concerning the sewage system in the I\u0142awa municipality . The thrust of the article was that the sanitary situation in the municipality was a matter of concern and posed significant public health risks ; extensive investments were necessary to improve it ; there was a serious shortage of available funds ; the municipal authorities were dealing with the problems in a slow and incompetent manner ; it was more important for them to save money than to prevent serious health risks and to avert a danger to the population ; the quality of water was unsatisfactory ; and the mayor , despite the fact that he had been in office for CARDINAL terms , had failed to deal with the problems properly .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the newspaper of the same date the mayor of ORG complained about the article . The first paragraph of that letter was couched in ironic terms . The mayor expressed doubts about the applicant \u2019s intentions and suggested that the applicant had been acting in his own personal interest . He maintained that the general tone of the article was inappropriate . He also voiced doubts as to whether the newspaper had any readers at all and whether it was therefore worth his while to react to the article .", "CARDINAL . He further requested , referring to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL read together with section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , that the applicant publish a rectification ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He stated that the development of the sewage network was a priority for the municipal authorities and listed a number of projects undertaken by the municipality during DATE . Further , CARDINAL projects planned for DATE were listed . The mayor stated that the quality of the water was monitored by the appropriate services and referred to several projects for modernising and overhauling the existing sewage and sanitary systems .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not reply to this letter and did not publish it .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified later date the municipality of ORG brought a private bill of indictment against the applicant before LOC for the offence of failure to publish a rectification or reply as prescribed by section QUANTITY of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his written pleadings of CARDINAL DATE the applicant argued that the mayor \u2019s letter could not reasonably be regarded as a request for rectification within the meaning of LAW CARDINAL of LAW , because its content lacked the essential characteristics of a \u201c rectification \u201d . It was not related to the facts and it was not couched in objective terms , as stipulated by that provision . In fact , its first part , in particular , was very critical of the applicant and contained innuendos about his character , motives and about the newspaper and its journalists . This alone made it impossible to regard the letter as a request for rectification . Furthermore , the style of the letter lacked the objectivity which could be expected of a rectification . It could therefore not be reasonably seen as such . It resembled rather a \u201c reply \u201d , within the meaning of the same provision of LAW , expressing the value judgments and views of its author vis - \u00e0 - vis the impugned article . Even assuming that the letter could be seen as a rectification , it did not comply with the relevant requirements laid down by LAW of LAW as it was more than twice the length of the contested article .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that the letter could not be seen as a rectification request because it breached his personal rights and the rights of other journalists working for the \u201c LOC \u201d , by calling into doubt their professionalism and personal integrity . The applicant referred to section CARDINAL of LAW , which obliged an editor - in - chief to refuse the publication of a rectification or a reply if its form or content were incompatible with the principles of co - existence with others ( \u201c zasady wsp\u00f3\u0142\u017cycia spo\u0142ecznego \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of an offence punishable by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW in conjunction with its section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL . The court sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 restriction of liberty in the form of CARDINAL ORG community service per DATE and suspended the sentence for DATE . It further deprived him of the right to exercise the profession of journalist for DATE and ordered that the judgment be made public by being displayed at ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the facts of the case , for the most part , were not disputed by the parties . It found that the applicant had not replied to the mayor \u2019s letter and had not published that letter or excerpts thereof , either as a rectification or reply . It noted that he was clearly obliged to do so under the provisions of LAW . He was aware of his obligation as he had previously published rectifications in the newspaper . No objective grounds existed which could be said to have legitimately prevented the applicant from complying with that obligation and , in any event , he had not invoked any such grounds . It was the applicant \u2019s own decision to refuse to publish the rectification requested . Similarly , he had failed to reply to the mayor , explaining to him the reasons for his refusal to publish . His failure corresponded to the offence specified in section CARDINAL of LAW read together with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The judgment further read :", "\u201c The above assessment of the [ applicant \u2019s conduct ] is additionally supported by the fact that in the impugned article he had discussed a question of significant importance for the municipality of ORG , namely the condition of its sewage system , by saying that the mayor had failed to take effective steps in order to have the sewage system installed . Assuming that the accused took into consideration the significance of his article , he should have , as a diligent journalist and editor - in - chief , either published the rectification demanded by the municipality , which directly concerned the questions raised in the article and outlined the steps which the municipality had already taken , or informed the municipality of the grounds for his refusal to publish a rectification . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court further held that the applicant \u2019s failure to publish the mayor \u2019s letter had been to the serious detriment of the I\u0142awa municipality as by making it impossible for a fair and public debate to develop it had undermined the confidence which a democratically elected municipal executive authority should enjoy .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , essentially reiterating his arguments as submitted to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the contested judgment .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Freedom to express opinions , and to acquire and disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone .", "CARDINAL .

If the refusal is based on reasons referred to in subsection ( CARDINAL ) , the editorin - chief shall indicate those parts which can not be published ; the DATE time - limit for producing an amended correction or reply starts running again from DATE on which the refusal and its justification were delivered . The editor can not refuse to publish a rectification or reply which has been amended in accordance with his or her indications . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides for the following penal provision :", "\u201c Whosoever , in breach of the statutory obligation , refuses to publish a rectification or reply , as referred to in DATE , or who publishes such a rectification or reply contrary to the conditions laid down in this LAW , shall be subject to a fine or a restriction of liberty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( P CARDINAL ) examined the constitutionality of the prohibition on making editorial comments on a request for rectification in the same issue of a newspaper in which the rectification was published , which was at that time provided for by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW DATE and backed up by a criminal sanction provided for by section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of that Act .", "CARDINAL . In the light of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the prohibition on publishing comments on requests for rectifications was not absolute , since it was permissible to include such comments in the next issue or broadcast . That prohibition was necessary to protect the freedom of expression of the person having submitted the request for rectification . The challenged provisions of LAW made it possible to maintain a balance of power between the media and persons submitting requests for rectifications to be published , with the latter generally having more limited opportunity to publicly express their views .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that the practical application of section CARDINAL had given rise to serious difficulties in judicial practice ; LAW did not formulate any conditions concerning either the form or the substance that would allow for a clear categorisation of a given request submitted to an editor - in - chief as a \u201c rectification \u201d or a \u201c reply \u201d . Hence , editors could have DATE and in practice did have \u2013 serious problems in classifying such submissions . Since it was impossible to provide an unambiguous interpretation of the relevant criminal law norm and no uniform interpretation had been developed in practice , the challenged provision ( that is , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) failed to respect the principle nullum crimen sine lege , enshrined in LAW .", "As a result , the prohibition on commenting on a rectification in the same issue , hitherto based on that provision , was deprived of its criminal sanction . The remaining elements of the criminal law provision contained in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW retained their binding force .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that the prohibition expressed in section QUANTITY of LAW should be secured by an adequately effective sanction , independently of civil liability . It should take into account the principle of proportionality and assume , on the one hand , the protection of the interests of those harmed by press publications and , on the other hand , values linked to the freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW were incompatible with LAW . It reiterated its findings concerning the lack of precision in the manner in which criminal offences punishable under those provisions were defined . It further held that as a result of the judgment those provisions were to lose their binding force no later than DATE after the judgment was officially published . Until that time , they should be applied by the courts .", "CARDINAL . DATE the Civil Code contains a non - exhaustive list of rights known as \u201c personal rights \u201d ( dobra osobiste ) . This provision states :", "\u201c The personal rights of an individual , such as , in particular , health , liberty , reputation ( cze\u015b\u0107 ) , freedom of conscience , name or pseudonym , image , secrecy of correspondence , inviolability of the home , scientific or artistic work , [ as well as ] inventions and improvements shall be protected by the civil law regardless of the protection laid down in other legal provisions . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In accordance with that provision , a person facing the threat of an infringement may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity , unless it is not unlawful . Where an infringement has taken place , the person affected may , inter alia , request that the wrongdoer make a relevant statement in an appropriate form , or claim just satisfaction from him or her . If an infringement of a personal right causes financial loss , the person concerned may seek damages .", "CARDINAL .
