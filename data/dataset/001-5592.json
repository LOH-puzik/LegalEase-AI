Moreover , that provision does not obstruct the free economic activity and free choice or practice of the profession of public notary , nor does it restrict their financial liberty . The obligation to pay PERCENT of the gross earnings is justified by the aim pursued by that provision , namely to avoid that all contracts are drawn up by a small number of privileged public notaries who may have a great number of acquaintances ( Judgment of ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON no DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It transpires from Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL that public notaries are always entitled to a fee when they draw up contracts , with the exception of deeds in which the contracting parties are the ORG , co - operatives and public law corporations .
