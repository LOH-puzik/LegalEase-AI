The applicants also explained that it had not been necessary to obtain a medical report , given that they had not received serious wounds or injuries . That did not , however , alter the fact that they had been struck by the police officers . Furthermore , in their opinion , the insults directed against them on account of their faith had been sufficient to establish that the police officers had been negligent in carrying out their professional duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on the same grounds as the first - instance court . In particular , it took account of the fact that the police officers had denied the allegations and that the applicants had suffered no physical injuries .

According to the applicants , the appeal court took into consideration an oral statement by ORG , who had claimed that he did not recognise a white car with the registration number DAQ CARDINAL , which Mr PERSON had nonetheless identified as being that in which the CARDINAL police officers had been patrolling at the time of the incident in question . After the hearing , however , ORG had left in that same vehicle , which had been parked in front of the regional court .

After postponing the hearing several times on account of the absence of the defending parties , ORG examined the ORG appeal on points of law in written proceedings , and dismissed it on DATE . It criticised the applicants for failing to bring criminal proceedings against the police officers . ORG stated that acknowledging that the police officers had failed in their professional obligations in the impugned manner ( attacking and assaulting the applicants ) would be equivalent to recognising , in the context of administrative proceedings , their criminal guilt , which would be contrary to the law .
