The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , at the material time a member of ORG ) , a registered left - wing political party , was convicted by ORG under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of the offence of having displayed a totalitarian symbol in public . The court observed that the applicant had publicly worn a CARDINAL - pointed red star while participating in a demonstration on DATE celebrating GPE \u2019s accession to ORG and , at the same time , the International Workers\u2019 Day . As a sanction , the court issued a reprimand .", "CARDINAL . NORP On appeal , on DATE ORG reversed this judgment and acquitted the applicant . In holding that his act had represented in fact no danger to society , ORG made reference inter alia to a judgment of ORG , adopted on DATE , which had been introduced by another individual on account of a conviction similar in nature ( PERSON v. GPE , no . MONEY ) . In that judgment ORG held that prosecution for having worn a red star amounted to a violation of that applicant \u2019s freedom of expression enshrined in LAW .", "CARDINAL . In pursuit of the prosecution \u2019s further appeal , on DATE ORG reversed the second - instance judgment and upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction . It confirmed the reprimand and ordered the applicant to pay MONEY in criminal costs . ORG held that positive NORP law did not permit the domestic courts to apply the holding of PERSON as such . It pointed out that the conditions of social dangerousness DATE which had been found by ORG to be absent in some , otherwise similar , cases \u2013 were indeed present in the instant circumstances . The court argued as follows :", "\u201c The common feature of those cases can be summarised as the absence of identification with the totalitarian symbol , in the first case more emphatically , and in the latter one by virtue of the perpetrator \u2019s indifference towards the symbol connected to the incriminated conduct .", "The situation in the present case , however , was quite the contrary .", "PERSON used the CARDINAL - pointed red star in a political context and as a sign of solidarity felt for his fellow party member , that is , because he identified himself with the symbol , with its meaning known and communicated to the outer world . In this context , the defendant \u2019s concrete political credo is irrelevant : the statutory provision prohibits everyone , irrespective of one \u2019s conviction , from the use of totalitarian symbols , including the CARDINAL - pointed red star associated with NORP dictatorship . This statement remains true even if the symbol in question has dual meaning referring both to the totalitarian system mentioned above and to the international workers\u2019 movement promoting the ascendance of large groups of society . ...", "The entirety of the elements of this offence is defined as the legal hypothesis of a socalled \u201c conduct \u201d ( immaterial ) crime . This means that the offence will be committed merely by performing the sanctioned conduct ( dissemination , use in public or public display ) and no further condition or result , let alone actual fear or anxiety caused to those perceiving , is required . \u201d", "The court concluded that the applicant \u2019s act was indeed dangerous to society .", "CARDINAL . Act no . DATE on LAW provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A criminal offence is an act perpetrated intentionally or DATE if the law also punishes negligent perpetration \u2013 by negligence , which represents a danger for society and for which the law orders the infliction of punishment .", "( CARDINAL ) An activity or omission shall be an act dangerous to society if it violates or endangers the constitutional , social or economic order of GPE , or the person or rights of citizens . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Any person who ( a ) disseminates , ( b ) uses in public or ( c ) exhibits a swastika , an ORG - badge , an arrow - cross , a symbol of the sickle - and - hammer or a CARDINAL - pointed red star , or a symbol depicting any of them , commits an offence \u2013 unless a more serious crime has been committed \u2013 and shall be sentenced to a fine .", "( CARDINAL ) The conduct prescribed under paragraph ( CARDINAL ) is not punishable if it is done for the purposes of education , science , art or in order to provide information about history or contemporary events .", "( CARDINAL ) Paragraphs ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) do not apply to the insignia of GPE which are in force . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
