They are all NORP nationals . The first applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and is currently residing in the GPE together with her son PERSON , who was born in DATE . The other CARDINAL children , PERSON , PERSON , were born in , respectively , DATE , DATE and DATE and are currently residing in GPE with a sister of their maternal grandmother . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in \u2018 ORG . ORG are represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE , the applicants\u2019 home in GPE was searched and ransacked by the ORG . A hand grenade thrown in their kitchen killed the first applicant \u2019s mother and seriously injured her sister .", "The first applicants\u2019 husband and the other applicants\u2019 father disappeared in DATE , likely after having been arrested by the ORG . DATE after his disappearance , the applicants fled from GPE to GPE where they stayed in the home of the first applicant \u2019s father . However , also in GPE , the ORG regularly visited and questioned them about the whereabouts of their husband / father . At an unspecified date , when trying to take the first applicant \u2019s injured sister to hospital , the second applicant , PERSON , was stopped by the ORG who beat him and broke his hand .", "On DATE , in order to escape from the continuous ORG harassment and as the first applicant \u2019s sister could not obtain adequate medical treatment in GPE , the first applicant together with her sister and PERSON fled to GPE . PERSON , PERSON remained in GPE in the care of their maternal grandfather . They were to join the first and second applicants in GPE as soon as possible . On DATE , with the assistance of a \u201c travel agent \u201d who had been paid by her father , the first applicant , her sister and PERSON travelled by air from GPE to the GPE , where they applied for asylum .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the asylum request filed by the first applicant and her son PERSON , but did grant them a conditional residence permit ( voorwaardelijke vergunning tot verblijf ) valid until DATE as \u2013 in light of the general situation in GPE at that time \u2013 their expulsion to GPE would entail undue hardship .", "On DATE , the first applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision with the Deputy Minister .", "On DATE , the validity of the first and second applicants\u2019 conditional residence permit was prolonged by DATE , i.e. until DATE .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister rejected the first applicant \u2019s objection of DATE . The first applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG of GPE on DATE .", "On DATE , the validity of the first and second applicants\u2019 conditional residence permit was again prolonged by DATE , i.e. until DATE . As from DATE , the first applicant became entitled to work in the GPE . She further started attending GPE language and sewing courses . She successfully passed a first exam in both courses on DATE .", "On DATE , pursuant to the terms and the transitory arrangements under the CARDINAL Aliens Act ( vreemdelingenwet ) which entered into force on that date and replaced the DATE LAW , the first and second applicants\u2019 conditional residence permit was automatically transformed into a residence permit for the purposes of asylum for a fixed period ( verblijfsvergunning asiel bepaalde tijd ) .", "In DATE , the first applicant learned from a friend , who had gone to GPE for a family visit , that her CARDINAL children DATE who had stayed behind in GPE in the care of their maternal grandfather and with whom the first applicant had not had any contacts since she had left GPE in DATE were living in GPE with a maternal aunt of the first applicant .", "On DATE , the first applicant filed a request with the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON ) for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) for the purposes of family reunion for her QUANTITY children living in GPE . The first applicant was not able to produce these children \u2019s birth certificates but submitted CARDINAL photographs of them , and declared to be willing to undergo DNA testing . She further declared that she had never been gainfully employed and was livinglived on benefits under LAW ( PERSON ) .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE , she advised her CARDINAL children in GPE to apply as soon as possible to the GPE consular authorities in GPE for the purposes of obtaining a provisional residence visa .", "On an unspecified date and in accordance with the policy rule that after DATE a temporary residence permit for the purposes of asylum is replaced by a residence permit for the purposes of asylum for an indefinite period ( verblijfsvergunning asiel voor onbepaalde tijd ) , the temporary residence titles granted in the instant case were changed into permanent residence permits for the purposes of asylum .", "On DATE , the first applicant passed a second exam in the GPE language and sewing courses attended by her .", "On DATE , the first applicant withdrew the appeal that she had filed on DATE .", "On DATE , the Minister of ORG rejected the request of CARDINAL DATE , considering at the outset that the transformation of the first applicant \u2019s residence title from a conditional residence permit under LAW to a temporary residence permit for the purposes of asylum under LAW did not entail entitlement to a residence permit under LAW ( e ) or ( f ) for family members having joined the person who has been granted asylum in the GPE within DATE after the latter \u2019s arrival in the GPE . This rule applied only where it concerned a first issuance of a residence permit for the purposes of asylum , which was not the first applicant \u2019s case . Consequently , her request fell to be examined under the regular immigration rules on family reunion set out in Chapter BCARDINAL/CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ) .", "The Minister further found that the first applicant \u2019s family tie with the CARDINAL children had not been demonstrated by means of official documents as no birth certificates of the CARDINAL children had been submitted . Although this requirement could be replaced by DNA testing , this possibility was only offered if all other conditions for family reunion were met . This did not apply to the instant case , as in addition the first applicant did not comply with the minimum income requirements under the applicable immigration rules . On this point , the Minister noted that her sole income consisted of general welfare benefits whereas , pursuant to LAW ) of the CARDINAL LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) and the provisions of Chapter BCARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW , benefits under LAW are not accepted as constituting ( a part of the ) means of subsistence within the meaning of the immigration rules . The Minister further found no special circumstances on the grounds of which it should be held that the aim served by the income requirement under the immigration rules entailed disproportionate consequences for the first applicant .", "As regards LAW , the Minister acknowledged the possibility of the existence of an objective obstacle to family life being exercised in the country of origin . Although this possible obstacle weighed heavily in the balancing - of - interests exercise to be carried out under this provision , it was not necessarily decisive . The first applicant \u2019s personal interests were to be weighed against the general interest served by the restrictive immigration policy pursued by the GPE and in which context it was justified to require persons seeking family reunion to have , independently and lastingly , sufficient means of subsistence . The Minister considered \u2013 in order to avoid that the exercise of family life would become permanently impossible DATE that in balancing these interests it had to be assessed whether it was possible that the first applicant \u2019s personal situation would change within a reasonable time . The Minister was only prepared to accept the existence of a positive obligation under LAW when , despite serious efforts made by the first applicant , there were no real prospects for her to obtain , lastingly , sufficient and independent means of subsistence and , given the circumstances in which she was finding herself , it would be unreasonable to maintain the income requirement . Finding that it was not excluded that the first applicant would be able to comply with the income requirement within a reasonable time , the Minister concluded that , for the time being , it could not be said that a hopeless situation had arisen in which it was impossible for the first applicant ever to comply with the requirements for family reunion . Consequently , the Minister concluded that the GPE authorities were not under a positive obligation to allow the CARDINAL children in GPE to join the first applicant in the GPE .", "On DATE , the CARDINAL children filed an objection against this decision with the Minister of ORG .", "On DATE , after a hearing held on DATE before an official committee ( ambtelijke commissie ) , the Minister of ORG rejected the objection in CARDINAL separate decisions . The Minister noted that the family tie between the first applicant and the children had still not been demonstrated by means of official documents and that , as the first applicant did not comply with the income requirement , she and the children did not qualify for the possibility of DNA testing in lieu . Furthermore , as PERSON had come of age in the meantime , the first applicant \u2019s request was also to be examined under the policy rules on extended family reunion ( verruimde gezinshereniging ) . The Minister noted that , according to the contents of a letter submitted , the CARDINAL children had left GPE after the death of their maternal grandfather and , since DATE , were staying in GPE with a maternal aunt of the first applicant . As her younger brothers were also not granted entry to the GPE , the Minister held that the refusal to grant PERSON entry to the GPE could not be regarded as entailing disproportionate hardship .", "As regards LAW , the Minister found no particular facts or circumstances on the basis of which the GPE were under a positive obligation to admit the CARDINAL children . The Minister considered that , in view of the first applicant \u2019s personal situation in her country of origin , there was in any event a suspicion of an objective obstacle to family life being exercised in that country . Although this possible obstacle weighed heavily in the balancing exercise to be carried out , it was not necessarily decisive . The responsibility of the first applicant to ensure that she would comply with the requirements for family reunion also played an important role . In this context it was expected of the first applicant that , for a reasonable period of time , she would make serious efforts to find employment so that she would lastingly possess sufficient and independent means of subsistence . This reasonable period , of generally DATE , had begun to run when the first applicant had become entitled to work in the GPE , i.e. on DATE . The Minister found no special circumstances on the basis of which this DATE period should be shortened in her case . The Minister further stated that the serious efforts asked from the first applicant required an active attitude on her part , implying actively looking for and accepting work even where a job would not correspond to her education or professional experience , registering at an employment office ( arbeidsbureau ) and interim employment agencies indicating to be willing to accept any kind of work , reacting to vacancy announcements , intensive writing of ( un)solicited job applications , and undertaking labour - market oriented studies . In so far as the first applicant had argued that she had to care for her wheel - chair bound sister who refused aid from strangers and that she did not wish to leave her sister alone in the house fearing that she might cause a fire , the Minister held that it was the first applicant \u2019s own choice to care for her sister and that she could appeal to aid providing bodies . Finding it not excluded that the first applicant would be able to comply with the income requirement within a reasonable time , the Minister held that it could not be said that a hopeless situation had arisen entailing a permanent impossibility for family reunion in the GPE and that , therefore , at present no positive obligation arose under LAW to allow the CARDINAL children entry to the GPE . It could be expected from the first applicant that she would make serious efforts aimed at complying with the income requirement and , in all reasonableness , there was no reason in the present case to anticipate this by giving more weight to the personal interests of those concerned than to the general interest at issue .", "On DATE , the CARDINAL children filed an appeal with ORG of The Hague .", "On DATE , the applicant registered at the GPE office of ORG ) .", "In its judgment of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the appeal of DATE . In so far as the appellants relied on LAW , ORG held :", "\u201c Where , such as in this case , there is no interference [ with the rights under LAW as the refusal at issue does not concern a withdrawal of a residence permit ] the question arises whether there are facts and circumstances of such a nature that the right to respect for family life nevertheless gives rise to a positive obligation for the Minister to grant the appellants residence [ in the GPE ] . In order to determine that question , the interests [ involved ] ... must be balanced against each other . To strike a \u2018 fair ORG between those interests is of primary importance , in which [ exercise ] the Minister enjoys a certain margin of appreciation .", "In the court \u2019s opinion , the Minister could in all reasonableness conclude that the appellants\u2019 interests did not outweigh the general interest of ORG . In this finding , the court takes into account that , given that at the present time there is no hopeless situation for the [ first applicant ] to comply eventually with the income requirement , there is no situation entailing a permanent impossibility of family reunion . The Minister has therefore considered on good grounds that there is no positive obligation to admit [ the CARDINAL children ] under LAW .", "In this , the court further takes into consideration that , in the present case , the Minister has held that , due to the [ first applicant \u2019s ] personal situation in her country of origin , there is a suspicion of an objective obstacle to the exercise of family life in the country of origin , but that this was not decisive in the context of the balancing of interests . In this connection the court further notes that [ the appellants\u2019 ] submission made in the present proceedings that [ the first applicant and PERSON ] are recognised refugees and that the Minister \u2013 other than suspecting \u2013 has acknowledged the existence of an objective obstacle to the exercise of family life in GPE finds no support in the documents .", "Noting this and the improving human rights situation in GPE after the removal of the ORG regime and the prior , apparently ill - founded request [ of the first applicant ] for admission as refugee [ under LAW relating to LAW ] , it can not be excluded in the court \u2019s opinion that the [ first applicant ] can also exercise her family life in GPE . This applies even more since the [ first applicant ] has submitted that she has been separated for a long time from her children and that she has difficulties integrating into the GPE society whereas she and [ the children ] are rooted in the NORP culture .", "In the court \u2019s opinion , the [ Minister ] did further in all reasonableness not have to see grounds to deviate from the guideline that within a reasonable period of DATE everything should be undertaken to comply with the income requirement as meant in [ Chapter ] BCARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL of the CARDINAL LAW . The point of departure for the [ Minister \u2019s ] policy is that the main person with whom stay is sought bears his or her own responsibilities , also as regards his or her living expenses and those of the family members by whom he or she wishes to be joined . That is why it is expected from the main person that he or she has done everything during a lengthy period to find work and thus lastingly to dispose of sufficient and independent means of subsistence . In this an active attitude is expected from him or her .", "The above - cited LAW also provides that in a special case the position in which the family members outside of the GPE find themselves , also if that position is not so harrowing ( schrijnend ) that already for that reason alone residency should be granted , may form a ground for applying a shorter DATE . Also special circumstances in respect of the admitted main person can in principle lead to applying a shorter period .", "The court is of the opinion that the [ Minister ] has correctly found no special circumstances as regards the [ first applicant ] which should lead to applying a shorter period . The court agrees with the [ Minister ] that it has not or at least insufficiently appeared that the [ first applicant ] has done the utmost to find work as meant in the DATE LAW . She has not substantiated by means of concrete documents \u2013 such as for instance several negative written replies to job applications \u2013 that she has intensively applied for several existing job openings or has sought assistance in every feasible manner [ in finding gainful employment ] .", "On the other hand it has appeared that the [ first applicant ] has taken on the care for her disabled sister , which choice apparently entailed that she distanced herself from the labour market and thereby indirectly from her [ CARDINAL ] children on account of failing to comply with the income requirement . In this connection the [ Minister ] has , in the court \u2019s opinion , justly considered that there is no hopeless situation in which the conditions for admission can never be met . In this [ finding ] the court takes into account that according to the case file documents the [ first applicant ] was allowed already since DATE to look for work on the labour market and that the [ Minister ] could hold in all reasonableness that the [ first applicant ] could appeal to aid providing agencies for the care of her sister .", "Consequently , the appellants\u2019 reliance on LAW fails . \u201d", "The CARDINAL children \u2019s subsequent appeal to ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) was rejected on DATE . It upheld the impugned ruling of DATE . It held , inter alia , that ORG had correctly concluded that it had not been established that the first applicant had made any effort to meet the income requirement . Further noting that the first applicant was not permanently and completely unfit for work and having found no indication that she would be permanently unable to meet the income requirement , it concluded that ORG had correctly rejected the ORG arguments under LAW .", "On an unspecified date , the first applicant and PERSON were granted GPE nationality and , on DATE , a GPE passport was issued to both of them .", "On an unspecified date in DATE , the first applicant travelled to GPE in order to visit her youngest son PERSON who had been admitted to hospital as he was suffering from serious diarrhoea . DATE after having arrived in GPE , the first applicant suffered a stroke , causing partial paralysis . She returned to the GPE , where she is currently staying in hospital . It is still uncertain whether the stroke she suffered will have any lasting effects . Her son PERSON was discharged from hospital in GPE after DATE .", "The ORG pursue a restrictive admissions policy due to the population and employment situation in the GPE . Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of obligations under international law , if their presence serves an essential national interest , or for compelling humanitarian reasons , with most policy rules for admission being more detailed formulations of this last criterion . Until DATE , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by DATE Aliens Act ( Vreemdelingenwet ) . Further rules were laid down in LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( Voorschrift Vreemdelingen ) and LAW ) . On DATE , the DATE LAW was replaced by QUANTITY ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . On DATE , LAW , the Regulation on Aliens and LAW were replaced by new versions based on LAW ( \u201c the Decree \u201d and \u201c the LAW \u201d ) .", "Under the system in force until DATE , a person having been granted asylum in the GPE on grounds of being a \u201c refugee \u201d within the meaning of LAW relating to LAW DATE was in principle entitled to family reunion if his or her family members had joined him or her within DATE after his or her admission to the GPE . For this specific category , no income requirement applied . However , a limited income requirement had to be met if it concerned family reunion with family members having joined him or her in the GPE DATE after his or her admission to the GPE . For persons having been granted a residence permit on any other ground , a higher income requirement applied when family reunion was sought . Persons having been granted a conditional residence permit were not entitled to family reunion under domestic law , as their residence title was only of a provisional nature .", "Under the system in force after DATE , the income requirement for all categories of persons having been granted an \u201c asylum - related \u201d ( i.e. on the basis of personal facts and circumstances , or the general situation in the country of origin ) residence permit who seek family reunion in the GPE is identical . For a person holding an \u201c asylum - related \u201d residence permit , no income requirement applies if his or her family members have joined him or her within DATE after his or her admission to the GPE . After this date , an income requirement must be met where family reunion is sought . Under the new system , also persons having been granted a temporary residence permit for the purposes of asylum are entitled to family reunion .", "As a rule , anyone wishing to apply for a residence permit in the GPE must first apply from his or her country of origin to the GPE Minister of ORG for a provisional residence visa . Such a visa is normally a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit which confers more permanent residence rights . An application for a provisional residence visa is assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit .", "Pursuant to LAW , a temporary residence permit ( verblijfsvergunning voor bepaalde tijd ) for the purpose of family reunion may be issued by ORG if a number of eligibility requirements \u2013 set out in GPE CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Decree \u2013 have been satisfied . These requirements include , inter alia , the possession of a valid provisional residence visa , actual cohabitation in the country of origin ( \u201c feitelijk behoren QUANTITY in het land van herkomst \u201d ) , possession of a valid international travel document , and the person in the GPE with whom family reunion is sought having sufficient means of subsistence as defined in LAW ( a ) of the LAW , i.e. having a net income from work of at least the amount equal to benefits under LAW for the corresponding category ( such as for instance a single parent ) .", "ORG ) is an independent administrative body that works on assignment from ORG ( PERSON en GPE ) . It is centrally managed and has CARDINAL offices throughout the GPE . It invites employers to offer vacancies and helps and activates job seekers to find work in every possible way . It can further help job seekers to apply for unemployment or supplementary benefits . If attempts to find work are unsuccessful , the municipal social services together with ORG will do everything possible to provide the person concerned with work or training . If necessary , a route plan will be drawn up . This contains all concrete arrangements that have been made for job application courses , for example , acquiring work experience and participation in a social assimilation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
