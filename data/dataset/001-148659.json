The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , who was the director of a ORG company ( referred to herein as \u201c B - G \u201d ) , acknowledged in court that the company owed a private company MONEY ( ORG ) plus penalties ( the total sum being LAW ) as a result of purchasing liquefied gas from that private company . On DATE he was dismissed from his job .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , in DATE the investigating authorities summoned him to appear before them and to make a statement in connection with the alleged defrauding of PERSON He was subsequently summoned on several occasions and always appeared before the investigating authorities and cooperated with them . According to the materials submitted by the parties , CARDINAL different criminal investigations were initiated against the applicant and his CARDINAL sons : the first CARDINAL were initiated on DATE , but most of the others on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE all the investigations were joined .", "It can also be observed in the case file that the applicant \u2019s sons were summoned to appear before the investigating authorities in DATE and were questioned as suspects in the case . It appears that the applicant \u2019s sons were never arrested . On DATE an invoice allegedly used for defrauding B - G was seized from the company . On DATE the applicant \u2019s personal computer was seized and various documents were recovered which allegedly proved the defrauding of B - G by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld an application to initiate bankruptcy proceedings which had been brought against PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the lower courts\u2019 judgments because it had been established that the debt to the private company was fictitious . The court relied , inter alia , on the results of a review of the economic and financial activities of PERSON The case was sent for retrial by the lower courts and is still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a further review of the economic and financial activities of PERSON was carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested . On CARDINAL DATE he was formally charged with defrauding PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted an application made by the prosecutor and ordered the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial for DATE . The court found that :", "\u201c ... the offence with which [ the applicant ] is charged is considered an exceptionally serious crime , which allows for detention pending trial , [ the court ] takes into account the nature and seriousness of the offence and the complexity of the case , and considers that at this incipient stage of the investigation there are reasonable grounds to believe that the accused could collude with other people ( his sons , who have not been interviewed ) in order to take a common position .", "The other statements of the prosecution concerning the possibility that the accused may abscond , the danger of influencing witnesses or of destroying evidence are not substantiated by any specific information and are not very probable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , referring to the ongoing civil proceedings concerning the debt owed by PERSON to the private company , as well as to a confirmation of that debt by an administrator appointed in the meantime by the court . He further relied on the absence of any material in the file suggesting that he would abscond or interfere with the investigation in any manner . Moreover , as confirmed by medical certificates , the applicant ( who was TIME the time ) suffered from a number of illnesses requiring in - patient treatment , which was unavailable in pre - trial detention . He was a well - known individual with a family , a residence and a job in GPE and who had appeared before the investigating authorities every time he had been summoned during the period from DATE to DATE . He further argued that the court had not even had the case file concerning the investigation in question before it when it had decided on his detention pending trial . The judge had only seen several documents concerning the charges against the applicant and the review of the economic activity of PERSON ( referred to above ) . The applicant added that his CARDINAL sons had not been formally charged with any crime and that in any event if they had wished to collude they had had plenty of time to do so since DATE when they first learned of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE , essentially repeating the reasons given by the lower court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial by DATE . After recapitulating the parties\u2019 positions and citing the applicable provisions of the law , the court found that :", "\u201c ... the grounds relied on when applying the preventive measure [ of detention ] remain valid , the majority of the investigative actions have been carried out , but a number of additional measures requiring [ the applicant \u2019s ] participation are still necessary in order to send the case to the trial court . The court considers that the application on the part of the defence to replace the preventive measure [ with house arrest ] is premature , taking into account the seriousness and complexity of the case and the need to protect public order and the public interest , as well as to ensure the smooth and objective course of the investigation . \u201d", "The applicant appealed , relying on essentially the same arguments as he had done earlier .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The court gave essentially the same reasons as it had in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , adding that :", "\u201c the risk that the applicant may destroy evidence persists , since the prosecutor has declared that not all the documents relating to the financial and economic activities [ of the company ] have been seized in order to be subjected to an expert analysis . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial by DATE . It gave the same reasons as it had done earlier . The applicant appealed , relying on essentially the same arguments as he had done earlier .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s decision , finding that it had been adopted in compliance with the law . The court also noted that the applicant was accused of a particularly serious offence which had allegedly caused damage to PERSON of MONEY NORP lei ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) and which was punishable by a prison term of CARDINAL to twenty - five years , that he had been charged with CARDINAL different offences , and that the investigation was still ongoing . If released he might be able to abscond or to influence witnesses who were staff at B - G and over whom he had influence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected a further application by the prosecutor for an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial and accepted the applicant \u2019s request by ordering that he be placed under house arrest for DATE . The court found that :", "\u201c ... the applicant has been detained for DATE and has participated in all the necessary investigative actions ; ... LAW imposes a presumption that an accused be freed while he awaits his trial ; ... certain evidence , which may have been sufficient earlier to justify [ detention ] or to render alternative preventive measures inadequate , could become less convincing with the passage of time ; ... it is for the prosecutor to prove the existence of a risk of absconding , and such a risk can not be proved only by reference to the severity of the potential punishment ; [ the court referred to the applicant \u2019s medical problems and his age , the lack of a criminal record , his permanent residence and married status ] ; the [ ORG ] \u2019s case - law provides that detention pending trial should be exceptional , always objectively reasoned and must correspond to the public interest ; the court finds that it is improbable that [ the applicant ] will abscond , influence witnesses or destroy evidence , and that the normal course of the criminal investigation is possible while the accused is under house arrest . \u201d", "The court set the following conditions for the applicant \u2019s house arrest : prohibition from leaving his house ; prohibition of having phone calls ; prohibition from discussing his case with any person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and adopted a new one , ordering the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial for DATE . The court found that :", "\u201c ... the lower court did not take into account the complexity of the case and the seriousness of the offence with which [ the applicant ] is charged ; the court considers that while under house arrest [ the applicant ] could communicate with the other accomplices , who are not under arrest and who are , moreover , his sons ; he could abscond by fleeing to the [ self - proclaimed and unrecognised \u201c GPE \u201d ] , which is not under the control of the GPE authorities ; he could influence witnesses , who are his former staff , in order to make them change their statements ; the applicant has received visits from doctors and can obtain medical assistance in prison . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial by DATE . It gave the same reasons as it had done earlier . The applicant appealed , relying on essentially the same arguments as he had done earlier . The court recalled the prosecutor \u2019s position , including the fact that the investigation had already been finalised and the file was ready to be presented to the applicant and his lawyers so that they could prepare for the trial . It also noted that", "\u201c the preventive measure of arrest was applied due to the seriousness of the offence with which [ the applicant ] is charged , the need to ensure the proper conduct of the criminal proceedings and of securing public order , as well as the existence of reasons to believe that he could exert negative influence on the course of the proceedings or abscond . \u201d", "The court then cited article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and found that \u201c the grounds relied on by the prosecutor are applicable \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s decision and adopted a new one , changing the preventive measure to house arrest . The court found that :", "\u201c the prosecutor did not provide any evidence confirming the continued need to detain [ the applicant ] , did not submit additional materials confirming the probability that he could exert influence on witnesses who have already been heard ; [ the applicant ] promises to appear before the investigating authorities whenever summoned ; there is no specific information concerning any risk of absconding \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The house arrest was maintained by the decisions of the Comrat District Court of DATE and DATE . On DATE the same court decided to release the applicant on bail , finding that he had been detained and then under house arrest for over DATE and never breached any of the restrictions imposed on him ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
