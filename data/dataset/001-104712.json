On DATE a second series of articles on the applicant \u2019s sexual activities was published in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Justice PERSON , in ORG , refused to grant an injunction because the material was no longer private by reason of its extensive publication in print and on the internet .", "CARDINAL . In assessing the approach to be taken by the court to the granting of an interim injunction , he noted that the following principles should be borne in mind in any case where it was sought to restrain publication on the basis of an alleged infringement of rights guaranteed by DATE , and where those rights came into conflict with the rights of other persons , and in particular the rights of the media to freedom of expression :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... i ) No Convention right has , as such , precedence over another ;", "ii ) Where conflict arises between the values safeguarded under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , an \u2018 intense focus\u2019 is necessary upon the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case ;", "iii ) The ORG must take into account the justification for interfering with or restricting each right ;", "iv ) So too , the proportionality test must be applied to each . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Here there is no doubt that the rights of Mr PERSON under LAW come into conflict with those of ORG under LAW . CARDINAL question which has to be answered is whether , in respect of the information contained in the edited footage , Mr PERSON any longer has a reasonable expectation of privacy , having regard to everything which has happened since the original publication . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON considered that there was no public interest in publication of the images powerful enough to override the applicant \u2019s prima facie right to be protected in respect of the intrusive and demeaning nature of the photographs , observing :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The only reason why these pictures are of interest is because they are mildly salacious and provide an opportunity to have a snigger at the expense of the participants . Insofar as the public was ever entitled to know about Mr PERSON \u2019s sexual tastes at all , the matter has already been done to death since the original coverage in ORG . There is no legitimate element of public interest which would be served by the additional disclosure of the edited footage , at this stage , on the Respondent \u2019s website . \u201d", "CARDINAL . However , as to the extent of the applicant \u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy , PERSON noted that the material had been seen by CARDINAL of people around the world and that it continued to be available . He went on :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The ORG must always be conscious of the practical realities and limitations as to what can be achieved ... Nevertheless , a point may be reached where the information sought to be restricted , by an order of the ORG , is so widely and generally accessible \u2018 in the public domain\u2019 that such an injunction would make no practical difference .", "CARDINAL . As Mr Millar [ for ORG ] has pointed out , if someone wishes to search on the Internet for the content of the edited footage , there are various ways to access it notwithstanding any order the ORG may choose to make imposing limits on the content of ORG . ORG should guard against slipping into playing the role of ORG . Even though an order may be desirable for the protection of privacy , and may be made in accordance with the principles currently being applied by the courts , there may come a point where it would simply serve no useful purpose and would merely be characterised , in the traditional terminology , as a brutum fulmen . It is inappropriate for the ORG to make vain gestures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded that the material was so widely accessible that an order in the terms sought would make very little practical difference , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The dam has effectively burst . I have , with some reluctance , come to the conclusion that although this material is intrusive and demeaning , and despite the fact that there is no legitimate public interest in its further publication , the granting of an order against this Respondent at the present juncture would merely be a futile gesture . Anyone who wishes to access the footage can easily do so , and there is no point in barring ORG from showing what is already available . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The edited video footage was restored to ORG website shortly afterwards .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the subsequent privacy proceedings before ORG , the court heard evidence from the editor of ORG . As to the reasons for providing no advance warning to the applicant of the imminent publication of the story , the following exchange took place :", "\u201c Q : Your third reason was the risk of an interim injunction , and that was the real reason , was it not ?", "A : That was a major concern , yes .", "Q : You were worried that the court might grant an injunction .", "A : It was a consideration , yes .", "...", "Q : So you did recognise that there was a real risk that a court would take the view , on an interim basis , that this intrusion on privacy was not justified ?", "A : It is a risk all newspapers are faced with DATE .", "Q : What is the matter with letting the court make the decision ? Is that not the way democratic societies work ; that CARDINAL person says it is not an intrusion of privacy and the other says it is ? ... There is nothing wrong with an impartial judge looking at it is there ?", "A : No . It happens a lot .", "Q : But you were not prepared to risk that on this occasion ?", "A : On this occasion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE judgment was handed down in the privacy proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the allegations in the articles that there was a NORP theme , PERSON noted that once the material had been obtained , it was not properly checked for NORP content and that the NORP was not even translated . Instead , those concerned were simply content to rely on general impressions , which PERSON considered to be \u201c hardly satisfactory \u201d having regard to the devastating impact the publication would have on all those involved and to the gravity of the allegations , especially that of mocking the treatment given to concentration camp inmates . He was prepared to accept that the journalist responsible for the story and the editor thought there was a NORP element , not least because that was what they wanted to believe . He concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The belief was not arrived at , however , by rational analysis of the material before them . Rather , it was a precipitate conclusion that was reached \u2018 in the round\u2019 , as Mr PERSON [ the journalist ] put it . The countervailing factors , in particular the absence of any specifically NORP indicia , were not considered . When PERSON [ the editor ] was taken at length through CARDINAL of photographs , some of which he had seen prior to publication , he had to admit in the witness box that there were no NORP indicia and he could , of course , point to nothing which would justify the suggestion of \u2018 mocking\u2019 concentration camp victims . That conclusion could , and should , have been reached before publication . I consider that this willingness to believe in the NORP element and the mocking of Holocaust victims was not based on enquiries or analysis consistent with \u2018 responsible journalism\u2019 ... [ T]he judgment was made in a manner that could be characterised , at least , as \u2018 casual\u2019 and \u2018 GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON went on to consider the newspaper \u2019s assessment , prior to publication , of the lawfulness of publishing the articles . He observed that , in the context of privacy , there was a good deal of scope for differing assessments to be made on issues such as whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy or a genuine public interest to justify intrusion . He considered that he was not in a position to accept the applicant \u2019s submission that any of the relevant individuals must have known at the time that the publication would be unlawful in the sense that no public interest defence could succeed , nor could he conclude that they were genuinely indifferent to whether there was a public interest defence . While , he said , they may not have given it close analysis and one could no doubt criticise the quality of the journalism which led to the coverage actually given , that was not the same as genuine indifference to the lawfulness of this conduct . He noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is also clear that CARDINAL of the main reasons for keeping the story \u2018 under wraps\u2019 until the last possible moment was to avoid the possibility of an interlocutory injunction . That would avoid delaying publication and , in a privacy context , would generally mean that a potential claimant would not trouble to institute any legal proceedings at all . Once the cat is out of the bag , and the intrusive publication has occurred , most people would think there was little to gain . Even so , it would not be right to equate such tactics with deliberately or recklessly committing a wrong . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON concluded that the newspaper articles and images constituted a breach of the applicant \u2019s right to privacy . He found that there were no NORP connotations in the applicant \u2019s sexual activities and that there was therefore no public interest or justification in the publication of the article about his personal life and the accompanying images .", "CARDINAL . On the question of damages , PERSON declined to award exemplary damages and limited the damages available to a compensatory award . He considered it questionable whether deterrence should have a distinct , as opposed to a merely incidental , role to play in the award of compensatory damages , noting that it was a notion more naturally associated with punishment . He further observed that if damages were paid to an individual for the purpose of deterring the defendant it would naturally be seen as an undeserved windfall . He added that if damages for deterrence were to have any prospect of success it would be necessary to take into account the means of the relevant defendant . Any award against ORG would have to be so large that it would fail the test of proportionality when seen as fulfilling a compensatory function and would risk having a \u201c chilling effect \u201d on freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . PERSON recognised that the sum awarded would not constitute adequate redress , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... I have already emphasised that injury to reputation is not a directly relevant factor , but it is also to be remembered that libel damages can achieve CARDINAL objective that is impossible in privacy cases . Whereas reputation can be vindicated by an award of damages , in the sense that the claimant can be restored to the esteem in which he was previously held , that is not possible where embarrassing personal information has been released for general publication . As the media are well aware , once privacy has been infringed , the damage is done and the embarrassment is only augmented by pursuing a court action . Claimants with the degree of resolve ( and financial resources ) of Mr PERSON are likely to be few and far between . Thus , if journalists successfully avoid the grant of an interlocutory injunction , they can usually relax in the knowledge that intrusive coverage of someone \u2019s sex life will carry no adverse consequences for them and ( as Mr PERSON put it in his DATE email ) that the news agenda will move on .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding all this , it has to be accepted that an infringement of privacy can not ever be effectively compensated by a monetary award . Judges can not achieve what is , in the nature of things , impossible . That unpalatable fact can not be mitigated by simply adding QUANTITY to the number first thought of . Accordingly , it seems to me that the only realistic course is to select a figure which marks the fact that an unlawful intrusion has taken place while affording some degree of solatium to the injured party . That is all that can be done in circumstances where the traditional object of restitutio is not available . At the same time , the figure selected should not be such that it could be interpreted as minimising the scale of the wrong done or the damage it has caused . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was awarded GBP CARDINAL in damages and recovered approximately GBP CARDINAL in costs . The judge noted that the applicant was hardly exaggerating when he said that his life was ruined . A final injunction was granted against the newspaper .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) is an independent body set up to examine complaints about the editorial content of newspapers and magazines , and their websites , in GPE . If a complaint is upheld , a public ruling will be issued by the ORG and the newspaper or magazine concerned is obliged to publish the critical ruling in full and with due prominence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld a complaint by PERSON that ORG had published an article about him which was inaccurate , in breach of clause CARDINAL of LAW ( see further paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The newspaper had failed to approach him for comments prior to publication . In its adjudication , the ORG noted :", "\u201c The [ ORG ] has previously said that failure to contact the subjects of articles before publication DATE while not obligatory \u2013 may constitute a lack of care under LAW in some circumstances . It has never said that people have no right ever to comment on a story , or to be offered a right of reply , if they have misled people in another context .", "The [ ORG ] was also aware of the newspaper \u2019s concerns about an undeserved injunction being granted .

When LAW was under consideration by ORG concern was expressed at the adverse impact the PERSON might have on the freedom of the press . LAW , guaranteeing the right to respect for private life , was among the Convention rights to which the legislation would give effect . The concern was that , applying the conventional NORP Cyanamid approach , orders imposing prior restraint on newspapers might readily be granted by the courts to preserve the status quo until trial whenever applicants claimed that a threatened publication would infringe their rights under LAW . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was enacted to allay these fears . Its principal purpose was to buttress the protection afforded to freedom of speech at the interlocutory stage . It sought to do so by setting a higher threshold for the grant of interlocutory injunctions against the media than the NORP Cyanamid guideline of a \u2018 serious question to be tried\u2019 or a \u2018 real prospect\u2019 of success at the trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) makes the likelihood of success at the trial an essential element in the court \u2019s consideration of whether to make an interim order . But in order to achieve the necessary flexibility the degree of likelihood of success at the trial needed to satisfy section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) must depend on the circumstances . There can be no single , rigid standard governing all applications for interim restraint orders . Rather , on its proper construction the effect of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) is that the court is not to make an interim restraint order unless satisfied the applicant\u2019\u2018sufficiently favourable\u2019 , the general approach should be that courts will be exceedingly slow to make interim restraint orders where the applicant has not satisfied the court he will probably ( \u2018 more likely than not\u2019 ) succeed at the trial . In general , that should be the threshold an applicant must cross before the court embarks on exercising its discretion , duly taking into account the relevant jurisprudence on article CARDINAL and any countervailing Convention rights . But there will be cases where it is necessary for a court to depart from this general approach and a lesser degree of likelihood will suffice as a prerequisite . Circumstances where this may be so include those mentioned above : where the potential adverse consequences of disclosure are particularly grave , or where a short - lived injunction is needed to enable the court to hear and give proper consideration to an application for interim relief pending the trial or any relevant appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

According to the evidence received by ORG , journalists contacted the subjects of their articles prior to publication in the great majority of cases .
