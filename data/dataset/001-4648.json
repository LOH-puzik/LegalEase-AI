The matter was remitted back to the Secretary of ORG . On DATE , by letter , the Secretary of ORG made a fresh refusal to revoke LAW of DATE . In a letter sent by ORG to B 's solicitors , received on DATE , it was stated :", "\" The Secretary of ORG has considered the suggested difficulties which [ the first applicant ] might face in GPE and her rights as a NORP citizen and has balanced them against her mother 's breach of the immigration control ... and remains of the view that there are insufficient grounds for revoking the deportation order . \"", "On DATE , B married the third applicant , a NORP citizen whom she had known for some time . The Secretary of ORG was informed of B 's marriage . In a letter dated DATE , B 's solicitors informed ORG that B was pregnant .

The removal arrangements were however deferred for the Secretary of ORG to consider the representations made by B 's M.P.

The second applicant , as the wife of an ORG national , was granted a visa by the NORP authorities and in DATE all the applicants moved to GPE .

The visa granted to the second applicant to travel to GPE provided no entitlement to social security assistance because the third applicant had failed to find employment there .", "In a letter dated DATE the ORG stated in reference to the second applicant being granted a visa to travel to GPE :", "\" the Secretary of ORG remains of the intention to deport the second applicant to GPE should she fail to embark elsewhere \" .", "In or around DATE the second applicant gave birth to a third child .
