The applicants , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE PERSON \u2019s . Their application was lodged on DATE . They were represented before the ORG by Dr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are full - time farmers and farm a considerable area of land which is partly owned and partly held on agricultural lease by them following the death of their father . Prior to their father \u2019s death the applicants also farmed the said land . This land included QUANTITY which had been earmarked for the building of a road . This parcel of land will hereinafter be referred to as land X.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG late father received a letter from ORG asking whether he had come to an agreement over land X with company M who had been attempting to take control of the land . He was informed that failure to reply within DATE would lead to expropriation proceedings being commenced .", "CARDINAL . Having failed to reach an agreement for the purchase of land X from the applicants , on DATE Company M asked the Government to expropriate the said land , it constituting the only access to its property . At around the same time Company M applied for a permit to build CARDINAL apartments and CARDINAL garages on its property .", "CARDINAL . By a declaration published in ORG of DATE , under ORG ) LAW ( \u201c LAPPO \u201d ) , LAW of LAW , it was stated that land X was being expropriated for a public purpose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants and their father ( hereinafter the applicants ) instituted constitutional redress proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction . They invoked Articles CARDINAL , in that their land constituted their only means of making a living , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL since no compulsory taking of land could occur without the payment of adequate compensation and particularly because the taking at issue had been effected solely in the interests of third parties and was not therefore in the public interest . The applicants contended that the proposed street would divide their farm and cultivated land in a way that reduced their very productive land and would make cultivation very different with respect to irrigation and manuring . The existing water reservoirs and livestock would be separated from the cultivated fields , a circumstance which would be disastrous for their livelihood . They noted that they had been cultivating and breeding animals on the said land for DATE , long before the arrival of the present developer . Moreover , they had not been informed of the expropriation until work on the construction of the road was commenced .", "CARDINAL . The following witness testimony was heard : The architect of ORG submitted that LAW provided that when a person wanted to develop land the developer had to ensure road access to such land and when this was not possible because the owners would not sell the land , there existed a legal process by which the developer could ask the Commissioner of Lands to expropriate the said land . The land would then be expropriated by the ORG and the developer would pay for the said land . An official of ORG submitted that land X had been expropriated in the public interest . Various requests had been made for its expropriation but eventually ORG had signed a deed of obligation . The ORG had then expropriated the land . However , the applicants had not accepted the compensation offered to them and it was then deposited in an interest - bearing account . Another official of ORG submitted that the taking had been in the public interest as the land had already been earmarked for the building of a road . He added that although a request had been made by a third party , once expropriated the land remained the property of the Government .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court rejected all the complaints . Noting the lack of pleadings on the matter , it held that the expropriation could not be considered as inhuman or degrading treatment under LAW CARDINAL could not apply since the case did not concern the expropriation of a home . Nor did any issue arise under LAW as the provision did not provide for a judicial process before the initiation of an expropriation . As to LAW in respect of which proper pleadings had been filed , the court noted that there had been an interference with the applicants\u2019 property rights ( partly a deprivation in so far as they owned part of the land , and for the rest a control of use in so far as they held part of the land on agricultural lease ) . The interference had been in accordance with the law , namely the PERSON , and the applicants had been offered compensation which they had not accepted . The court established that the applicants could not have been unaware of the expropriation , the details having been published in ORG . Moreover , land X had been earmarked for the development of a road DATE . A representative had been on site to estimate the value of the land and had informed the applicants that it was being expropriated . As to the public interest , it considered that LAW did not exclude that an expropriation could also serve the interests of third parties . Thus , while it was true that the expropriation in the present case had been triggered by a third party \u2019s request , since the land had originally been earmarked as a road it could not be said that the taking had not been in the public interest . As to the proportionality of the measure , the court considered that , bearing in mind that land X constituted CARDINAL of the applicants\u2019 entire property , and that the applicants only owned CARDINAL of the land the rest being held on lease , the applicants would not be made to bear an excessive burden . There had therefore been no violation of the said provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG . By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected their claims . The court noted that although in their initial application various issues were pleaded , also in relation to the expropriation , the ORG appeal had focused on the lack of a public interest . The court held that , as in the cases regarding expropriations for the purposes of the GPE project , a hospital and a national theatre , and although development of the land was to be carried out by a private third party who would benefit financially from the project , this did not diminish the public interest involved , which in the present case consisted in providing access to a housing complex . Indeed , the Government had a duty to deal with town planning and in consequence the taking in the present case , although to the advantage of third parties , had been made in pursuance of legitimate social and economic policies , namely to create housing for the general public served by adequate roads .", "CARDINAL . Other lawsuits were instituted by the applicants or their late parents , but none were successful . Details of these lawsuits have not been submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new declaration was published in respect of the same land . A new set of constitutional proceedings was instituted in this respect . These proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL .
