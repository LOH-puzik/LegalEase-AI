The ORG is a non - profit - making non - governmental organisation ( NGO ) , now dissolved , which was active DATE . The application was lodged by its former Chairman , PERSON , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was registered by ORG on DATE and acquired the status of a legal entity .", "CARDINAL . NORP Clause CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s Charter defined it as an independent , charitable public organisation with voluntary membership , conducting its activities within the framework of the laws of GPE on public associations , other applicable laws and its own LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to clause CARDINAL of the LAW , the main objects of the ORG were :", "\u201c ... in the circumstances of the present - day environmental crisis , to develop the environmental culture and awareness of the various strata of the country \u2019s population , to organise a public movement for a clean environment in GPE , to give impetus to the process of effective resolution of environmental protection problems , and to strive permanently to promote the measures necessary to create a healthier environment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the LAW , the ORG \u2019s governing bodies consisted of the ORG ( the general assembly of members ) , ORG ( the management board elected by the general assembly for a fiveyear term ) , ORG ( a body of internal control elected by the general assembly for a DATE term ) , and various local bodies . Clause CARDINAL of the LAW provided that the ORG , as the general assembly of members , was the ORG \u2019s supreme governing body and would convene once DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since the date of its establishment and ORG registration , and until DATE , the ORG had not convened a general assembly of its members .", "CARDINAL . It appears that , on DATE , DATE after the ORG \u2019s State registration , ORG sent a letter to the ORG , noting that the latter had committed certain breaches of the domestic law and the ORG \u2019s own LAW . The exact content of that letter is not clear from the materials available in the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG commenced an inspection of the ORG \u2019s activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a warning to the ORG in accordance with section CARDINAL of the PERSON on nongovernmental organisations ( public associations and foundations ) of CARDINAL June CARDINAL ) , applicable at the material time ( \u201c the NGO Act \u201d ) . The ORG stated that the ORG \u2019s activities did not comply with the requirements of its own LAW and the domestic law . It was noted that a general assembly of the ORG \u2019s members had not been convened within the DATE period specified in its own LAW . Moreover , in any event , this provision of the LAW was itself incompatible with the domestic law , as section CARDINAL.CARDINAL of LAW required that the supreme governing body of a public association \u2013 the general assembly of members \u2013 was to be convened at least once DATE . ORG requested that , within DATE , the ORG take measures to remedy the above - mentioned breach and inform ORG measures taken .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply , PERSON informed the Ministry that , in fact , a general assembly of members had taken place on DATE . It appears that , among other things , the ORG \u2019s general assembly decided to establish a working group in order to bring the Association \u2019s Charter into conformity with the current legislation .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the documents relating to the general assembly meeting of CARDINAL DATE , on DATE ORG issued a new warning to the ORG ( which constituted a second warning issued in DATE ) . It noted that the general assembly of CARDINAL DATE had been convened in violation of numerous provisions of the domestic law . ORG noted , inter alia , that not all members of the ORG had been properly informed about the general assembly and thus had been unable to participate in it , and that the ORG \u2019s local branches had not been equally represented at the assembly . Generally , the current membership records had not been properly kept and it was impossible to determine the exact number and identity of members . Local branches of the ORG had not held any regular local assemblies of members and , in fact , functioned as regional offices directly governed by the head office in an administrative and hierarchical manner , whereas in a genuine public association ordinary members should be able to directly participate in its management . ORG again demanded that , within DATE , information be submitted as to the steps taken to remedy these breaches .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the ORG disagreed with the above findings in its correspondence with ORG and took no action in response to this second warning .", "CARDINAL . Finally , on DATE the ORG issued a third warning , stating that it had not received any information from the ORG as to compliance with the prior CARDINAL warnings . In addition to reiterating the remarks contained in the prior warnings , the Ministry noted that the ORG also engaged in an activity prohibited by law . Specifically , the domestic law ( namely , LAW , the PERSON on environmental protection of DATE and the PERSON on entrepreneurial activity of DATE ) prohibited public associations from interfering with the activities of private businesses . In this connection , the ORG noted :", "\u201c However , contrary to these legal requirements , the ORG ... attempts to collect money from ORG organs and commercial organisations in the guise of membership fees , regularly conducts [ unlawful ] inspections at economic enterprises and draws up [ environmental compliance ] reports , and engages in other illegal acts interfering with the rights of entrepreneurs ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As it had done previously , the Ministry demanded that , within DATE , the ORG submit information as to the steps taken to remedy the situation . The ORG did not react .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG lodged an action with ORG , seeking an order for dissolution of the ORG . The ORG , represented by PERSON , lodged a counterclaim , contending that the ORG \u2019s warnings had been unlawful and unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG \u2019s counterclaim and granted the ORG \u2019s request , ordering the ORG \u2019s dissolution .", "CARDINAL . Specifically , in respect of the ORG \u2019s request for dissolution , the court heard oral submissions by the ORG \u2019s members and the officials of ORG , reviewed the content of the ORG \u2019s CARDINAL warning letters issued in DATE and examined the correspondence between the ORG and the ORG . The court also examined CARDINAL internal reports by various officials of ORG concerning the results of the inspection of the activities of the ORG \u2019s various local branches . According to these reports , most of the inspected branches had not held regular local assemblies of members and had not maintained proper records of members and membership fees . CARDINAL of these reports stated that , according to \u201c information obtained \u201d during the inspection , the ORG \u2019s branch in the GPE region carried out illegal environmental inspections and engaged in other illegal activities .", "CARDINAL . Based on the above materials , the court found that , despite the early warning issued on DATE ( the content of which was not specified in the judgment ) , the ORG had continued to commit breaches of domestic law on an even more systematic basis , which had led to the issuance by ORG of the CARDINAL warning letters in DATE . The court noted that LAW had not been brought into compliance with the domestic law on public associations , which required that a general assembly of members be held no less than once DATE . In any event , even the DATE period for convening a general assembly , as required by LAW , had not been complied with . The court further found that the ORG \u2019s findings concerning numerous irregularities during the general assembly meeting of CARDINAL DATE , as well as breaches of law in the general functioning of the ORG , constituted a basis on which to dissolve the ORG for systematic failure to comply with the domestic law .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , again based on the above - mentioned oral testimonies of the ORG officials and their inspection reports , the court noted that the ORG had frequently overstepped the limits of the scope of its activities as defined in its LAW and permitted by law , by interfering with the competence of the relevant ORG authorities . In particular , it was noted that the ORG \u2019s local branches had attempted to carry out unlawful environmental inspections on the premises of various ORG and commercial enterprises and collect membership fees from them , issued reports on these enterprises\u2019 compliance with environmental standards , and engaged in other actions interfering with the activities of commercial entities . The court found that , by engaging in such actions , the ORG had violated the rights of other persons and attempted to misappropriate powers of a ORG regulating authority .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that , in accordance with LAW , the issuance of CARDINAL warnings by ORG constituted a basis for an association \u2019s dissolution if the latter did not take any measures to remedy the shortcomings in its activities . The court therefore ordered that the ORG be dissolved .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed , claiming that the provisions of LAW were vague and imprecise , giving the Ministry a wide discretion to interfere with public associations\u2019 activities and to issue warnings even for minor irregularities in their activities . The ORG also argued that ORG factual findings concerning its activities had been incorrect and unsupported by any evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a final decision of DATE , ORG upheld the lower courts\u2019 judgments .", "CARDINAL .

A comparative study of the relevant legislation of CARDINAL out of CARDINAL member ORG shows that an NGO can be membership - based or non - membership - based and can take a variety of legal forms applicable in the domestic legal order , such as an association , foundation , trust , charity or even company . A key factor in determining the level of scrutiny and control that an NGO will be subjected to is whether the body concerned is legally incorporated and enjoys legal personality . Normally , unincorporated associations enjoy a much wider scope of selfmanagement and are not interfered with unless they conduct activities which are illegal or prejudicial to public order . Legally incorporated NGOs , on the other hand , are often subject to more narrowly delimited rules and may be dissolved or face other sanctions in the event of non - compliance .", "CARDINAL . It appears that in a number of GPE an NGO can , in certain circumstances , be dissolved either , specifically , for failure to conduct its internal management in accordance with the requirements of domestic law or , more generally , for failure to comply with its own charter .
