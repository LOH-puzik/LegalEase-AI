On the same date he confessed to having participated in group assaults on families NORP and S. in DATE upon PERSON invitation . He also noted that he believed that the families were visited for collection of unpaid business debts in favour of third parties . According to the applicant , he notified the investigator that he was unable to see the record of his questioning as he had been suffering from eye cataracts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted .

On DATE the applicant obtained access to an advocate . It is unclear , however , whether the advocate was present during the applicant \u2019s interrogation and indictment on that date .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the investigation was completed and the applicant , along with CARDINAL other individuals charged for being involved in a criminal association membership , was committed for trial to ORG of GPE ( subsequently renamed ORG of GPE ( hereafter \u201c ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following familiarisation of the defendants with the case - file materials and completion of other procedural formalities , ORG held a preliminary hearing in the case and scheduled the trial for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newspaper ORG published an article entitled \u201c Changelings with police epaulettes \u201d , featuring in particular an interview with PERSON . , the judge presiding over the applicant \u2019s case . The judge was quoted as saying that she was appalled by the audacious crimes committed by the defendants and their challenging conduct at court hearings .", "CARDINAL . Having held some CARDINAL hearings DATE , ORG adjourned the proceedings in connection with CARDINAL of the GPE request to ensure recording of the hearings with technical equipment which was unavailable .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG resumed consideration of the case and held some CARDINAL hearings in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that on various occasions he and his co - accused had requested the removal of Judge PERSON . from the proceedings on various grounds , including lack of impartiality ; however , their requests had been rejected . The applicant did not provide copies of his requests for the removal of Judge PERSON . or the decisions taken following their consideration .", "CARDINAL . The Government alleged that the applicant had never lodged any requests for the removal of the judge during the trial . Such requests had been lodged only by CARDINAL of his co - defendants , A. K. , who had also requested on DATE that the above newspaper article be added to the case - file . Those requests had been dismissed as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , the applicant denied any encounter with the PERSON family .

The applicant \u2019s confessional statements were not referred to by the court in the text of its judgment . The court sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , banned him from occupying certain posts for a DATE term and ordered the confiscation of his property .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicant , his lawyer , and his mother acting as his defence , submitted appeals in cassation against the applicant \u2019s conviction .

They further contended that all the evidence collected from the applicant in violation of his right to be legally represented should be excluded from the body of evidence . The appellants noted that immediately upon his arrest the applicant had informed the investigative authorities that he was almost blind and was unable to read the documents he was signing . The waiver of his right to be legally represented had not been genuine . On the contrary , the video - recording of the applicant \u2019s initial questioning showed that he requested the assistance of a lawyer , referring to his poor health and vulnerable state .
