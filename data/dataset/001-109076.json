The first applicant arrived in GPE in DATE , where he obtained a forged passport and a birth certificate stating a false identity indicating that he was a NORP national named PERSON , born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant is also of NORP origin . She had arrived in GPE in DATE , at DATE , with a view to be reunited with her father and CARDINAL siblings who still live in GPE . The first and second applicants met while she was travelling in GPE . The second applicant invited the first applicant to GPE and soon after they started cohabiting . They live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the second applicant obtained NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for a work- and residence permit as a citizen of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d , established in DATE under an agreement bringing the CARDINAL member states of ORG ( EFTA ) \u2013 GPE , GPE and GPE DATE and the CARDINAL member states of ORG ( ORG ) together in a single internal market , without the ORG members having to join the ORG ) . On the basis of the forged NORP passport indicating a false identity , the NORP immigration authorities granted him a DATE residence- and work permit from CARDINAL DATE to DATE as an ORG national .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the couple had a daughter ( the third applicant ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant applied for NORP citizenship . The application was refused because the duration of his residence in GPE had been insufficient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the couple married in GPE . According to the applicants , it was in that connection that the second applicant had become aware of the first applicant \u2019s true identity as he obtained a NORP passport .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant also used his false identity when he applied for renewal of his residence permit in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was arrested in the GPE while travelling to GPE , as the NORP authorities discovered that his passport was forged . Subsequently , the first applicant provided his true identity to the NORP authorities . After DATE he returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG warned the first applicant about the possibility that he might be expelled from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided that he should be expelled from GPE under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE ( according to which an alien may be expelled if he or she has committed serious or repeated violations of CARDINAL or more provisions of the Act ) . Reference was made to the fact that by having provided false information in connection with his application for work permit on DATE , he had violated section CARDINAL ( cf . section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the Act ) . He had submitted false information regarding his date of birth , identity and nationality . Whilst the first applicant had stated that his name was PERSON , a citizen of GPE , born on DATE , his true identity had been PERSON , a citizen of GPE , born on CARDINAL DATE . The ORG found that his expulsion would not be a disproportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis him for the purposes of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . He was prohibited from re - entry for DATE ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also decided that these measures should be entered into ORG , with the consequence that the expulsion in principle would apply to the entire LOC area . He was given until DATE to leave GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE as the above decision , the ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s application for work - permit and family reunification with the second and third applicants on the ground of his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . Like the ORG , it observed that the first applicant had given false information about his identity and in support of this had submitted a forged passport . He had further maintained his false identity in his respective applications for NORP citizenship , for renewal of his work permit , and for family reunification . He had accordingly repeatedly committed aggravated violations of the immigration rules .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that the first applicant \u2019s expulsion would not constitute a disproportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis him , nor vis - \u00e0 - vis his closest family members . In addition to having obtained a work permit as an ORG citizen on the basis of false information about his identity with the support of a forged passport , the first applicant had failed to comply with the order to leave the country by DATE . Strong interests of general prevention militated in favour of expulsion .", "CARDINAL . With reference to LAW , the ORG found that the first applicant \u2019s personal links to GPE carried little weight . He had arrived in GPE at an adult age , had since returned to his home country and had also married the second applicant in GPE , which suggested that he still had a strong attachment to his country of origin . In light of the gravity of the offences , his family links to his spouse and child could not be decisive in the global assessment . Since his relationship with the second applicant had been established during his residence on the basis of false identity , neither he nor she could entertain any legitimate expectation about being able to continue to live together in GPE if the matter was discovered . No weight could be placed on the fact that the second applicant claimed that she had been ignorant about the first applicant \u2019s actual identity . Reference was made to the fact that she had been aware that he originally had a NORP background and that , in connection with their marriage in GPE on DATE , he had obtained a NORP passport .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted that the third applicant had been conceived and born while the first applicant resided on the basis of a false identity . Links established under circumstances as described above thus carried less weight . The fact that the applicants were living together as a family and that the first applicant had significant contacts with the third applicant , could not be decisive for the assessment of the case as a whole . Reference was made to the fact that the second applicant was originally of the same nationality as the first applicant and could more easily accompany the first applicant to their country of origin . In view of her young age , the child had the closest attachment to her parents and for this reason could eventually follow them to their home country . Also , the duration of the prohibition on re - entry was limited to DATE .", "CARDINAL . Referring to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( pursuant to which the LAW ought to be applied consistently with GPE \u2019s international legal obligations aimed at strengthening the foreigner \u2019s position ) and to section CARDINAL of LAW , which incorporated the LAW into NORP domestic law , the ORG found that the first applicant \u2019s expulsion would not be incompatible with LAW . In this connection the ORG had regard to the ORG \u2019s case - law , notably PERSON v. GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ; GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALIX ; PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ; PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . ORG considered in detail the first applicant \u2019s arguments based on PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALI ) and agreed with the ORG that it was not directly applicable to the present case .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the ORG was of the view that , having regard to the gravity of DATE would not be a disproportionate measure either vis - \u00e0 - vis the first applicant or vis - \u00e0 - vis his closest family members , for the purposes of section CARDINAL ) of LAW , LAW and LAW on the Rights of the Child .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout the above proceedings before the immigration authorities the first applicant was represented by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant challenged the above decision before ORG ( tingrett ) , pending which it was decided in DATE to stay his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of DATE as being invalid . ORG found it obvious that the conditions for expelling the first applicant set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) had been fulfilled . The first applicant \u2019s offences of the immigration rules were aggravated and his expulsion was warranted by weighty considerations of general deterrence . According to the immigration authorities\u2019 practice , a prohibition on re - entry would normally be made permanent in such cases . The reason why the prohibition on reentry had been limited to a period of DATE in the present case was the fact that the first applicant had a DATE daughter ( the third applicant ) . The question thus arose whether the expulsion of the first applicant for DATE would be a disproportionate measure vis\u00e0 - vis his daughter despite the seriousness of his breaches of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In this regard ORG observed , inter alia , that the third applicant appeared to be an ordinary NORP girl and that it was not certain that it would be unproblematic for her to move to GPE , even though this was her GPE home country . One would have to take into account possible problems for her in the event of a return to GPE . If the first applicant were to be expelled to GPE for a period of DATE , his daughter would most probably loose the close contact she had with him . To deprive the child of her relationship with her father would be a serious measure and could have disturbing effects on the child \u2019s development . This would be so even if she were to have the opportunity to visit him in his home country . Although considerations of general prevention militated in favour of expulsion , the measure would be disproportionate vis - \u00e0 - vis the first applicant \u2019s daughter .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) . At the request of the ORG , ORG decided on DATE to suspend the proceedings in the first applicant \u2019s case pending the national outcome in a parallel case ( PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG , by CARDINAL votes to one , upheld ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The High Court observed that the first applicant \u2019s violation of LAW ought to be considered as serious . On CARDINAL different occasions he had submitted false information about his identity to the immigration authorities and had supported this with a forged passport . First he had been issued with a permit - an ORG permit - despite his not being entitled to such a permit . On the second occasion , his application for citizenship had been refused on other grounds , namely the duration of his residence in GPE . On the third and fourth occasions , his application had been rejected because his expulsion had already been decided . False information about one \u2019s identity made it very difficult for the authorities to exercise an effective control of a foreigner \u2019s entry into and residence in GPE . To a large extent the system had to be based on confidence . General preventive measures suggested therefore that breaches of the immigration rules should entail adverse consequences for the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . As to the question whether , nonetheless , there was such an attachment to GPE as to make the expulsion disproportionate , the High Court observed inter alia as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant had grown up in GPE and had his family there . He had lived in GPE since the autumn of DATE . Since his attachment had been established on the basis of a residence permit that he had misled the authorities to grant him , he could not have had any legitimate expectation about being able to remain in GPE . ORG found it clear that expulsion would not be a disproportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . As regards his wife , the second applicant , ORG observed that she had originated from GPE . She knew the culture and spoke the language of the country . Since DATE she had lived in GPE where she had her closest family , her father and CARDINAL siblings . She was a NORP citizen , spoke NORP and was working in GPE . In DATE she had started co - habiting with the first applicant in the belief that he held lawful residence in GPE as an ORG citizen . She thus had reason to believe that their marriage and his application for family reunification had not been necessary conditions for them to establish a reliable framework around their life together in GPE . She had become aware of her husband \u2019s true identity when they had married in DATE . Only when the false passport had been revealed in the GPE in DATE had she become aware that he was not a NORP national . Nonetheless , ORG found that her interests seen on their own could not render the expulsion a disproportionate measure .", "CARDINAL . The High Court found that a decisive consideration in this case was the interests of the daughter , the third applicant . She was DATE and was a NORP national . She was in DATE , active in sport and well established in her local environment . She only spoke NORP and a few words of her mother \u2019s language \u2013 Twi \u2013 and LANGUAGE . Her parents spoke primarily NORP at home . It had been submitted that she needed close follow - up in relation to school and that it was the first applicant who assumed this contact , staying at home after having lost his work permit . It was also him who followed up her hobbies .", "CARDINAL . According to CARDINAL medical statements dated DATE and DATE , respectively , by the third applicant \u2019s general medical practitioners , since she had been a child she had been suffering from rashes that worsened with heat .", "CARDINAL . The High Court pointed out that regard for the best interests of the child was a fundamental consideration to be taken into account in the proportionality assessment under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The High Court found it established that in the event of the first applicant \u2019s expulsion , either the family would be split , meaning that the second and third applicants would continue to live in GPE , or they would move with him to GPE . This would clearly not be in the best interests of the daughter , who was born and had grown up in GPE and was very attached to her father . Naturally she also had strong bonds to her mother .", "CARDINAL . It ought to be expected that an expulsion would involve financial , emotional and social strain on established family life . This applied not least when family life was interrupted as a result of the expulsion . Strain of this kind was not in itself a sufficient indicator that expulsion would be a disproportionately severe sanction .", "CARDINAL . The High Court further pointed to ORG judgment reported in PERSON ( \u201c GPE . \u201d ) DATE ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) , in which GPE \u2019s international obligations were also assessed , including ORG judgment in PERSON and PERSON , cited above . In ORG view , the interests of a child who had no special needs for care and who had a remaining parent able to provide satisfactory care should not be a decisive consideration in assessing whether an expulsion measure should be implemented .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the third applicant was a normal girl for DATE and had no special care needs . It saw no reason to doubt that her mother would be able to provide her with satisfactory care on her own . Since the child \u2019s mother originated from the same country as the father , and had been on visits there with the daughter on CARDINAL occasions , the situation was favourable for regular contact or , in the alternative , for the family \u2019s settling in GPE . Consequently , the expulsion of her father with a prohibition on re - entry for a limited period would not be a disproportionate measure .", "CARDINAL . As to the duration of that period ORG was divided .", "CARDINAL . The majority did not find DATE inconsistent with current practice or disproportionate . It observed that the case involved serious violations of LAW . According to ORG judgment in the PERSON case , an expulsion would only be disproportionate when it resulted in an extraordinary burden ( see paragraph CARDINAL of ORG judgment quoted in PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the present case , the High Court reiterated its finding above that the child \u2019s mother would be able to provide the child with satisfactory care of her own . Since the child \u2019s mother originated from the same country as the father and had visited the country with the daughter on CARDINAL occasions , there were favourable conditions for maintaining regular contacts or , in the alternative , for the whole family to settle in GPE . Thus the family had a better basis for maintaining family life and contact than would have been the case if the parents had not had the same country of origin .", "CARDINAL . The parents had informed the court that the daughter could not stay in GPE for extended periods since she suffered from a skin rash that was aggravated by heat . However , it was clear that she had been in GPE several times , most recently in DATE . In the majority \u2019s view , the information about the daughter \u2019s rashes had not been sufficiently documented and could not be relied upon .", "CARDINAL . The minority was of the view that the imposition of a DATE reentry ban would be too severe and disproportionate a measure and that DATE ban would be appropriate , observing inter alia the following .", "CARDINAL . The gravity of the first applicant \u2019s offences under LAW had been comparable to those committed by the applicant in the PERSON case , though less aggravated bearing in mind that he had not committed other offences in GPE and had not defied any prohibition on re - entry .", "CARDINAL . Since birth the daughter had been taken special care of by her father , who had followed her up in her recreational activities and through extensive contacts with her school . For a girl of DATE , and for her mother , it would make a considerable difference were reunification of the family to take place in GPE after DATE as compared to DATE . Taking into account the normal processing time for a request for family reunification , the daughter would be DATE before the family could resume cohabitation in GPE . DATE in between would be important years .", "CARDINAL . Even though there was a possibility for the family to follow the first applicant to GPE , this prospect was unrealistic . There was nothing to indicate that the family would easily find accommodation , work , etc . in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The minority agreed that the evidence submitted in support of the affirmation that the daughter had a skin rash aggravated by heat was weak . Nonetheless , on the basis of the CARDINAL statements form the daughter \u2019s CARDINAL general practitioners , it ought to be assumed that she had \u201c a recurrent skin rash . The diagnosis had been somewhat uncertain . \u201d As far as could be understood , CARDINAL only had the word of the parents to the effect that the rash had been aggravated by heat ; the general practitioners\u2019 statements on this point had apparently been based on information provided by the parents .", "CARDINAL . However , it was unnecessary to further consider this matter since in any event for the third applicant to be interrupted for DATE from her school , friends and hobbies in GPE in order to settle in a country where she neither knew the language nor the culture would be particularly unfortunate for her . Her knowledge of NORP would deteriorate and it would have social and educational consequences for her when returning to GPE at the age of DATE or DATE .", "CARDINAL . The minority in addition attached some weight to the second applicant \u2019s interests , notably the fact that she had entered into the relationship , had given birth to a child and had married the first applicant in the belief that it would be possible to continue family life in the country of which she was a national and where most of her remaining family lived . It further had regard to the fact that the first applicant had come to GPE because of his wife and that their cohabitation had been established almost immediately after his arrival in the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Leave Committee of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts ankeutvalg ) unanimously refused the first applicant leave to appeal , finding that such leave was warranted neither by the general importance of the case nor by other considerations .", "CARDINAL . In the above - mentioned judicial proceedings , the first applicant was represented by a lawyer at each judicial level .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of LAW DATE ( Act of DATE Nr CARDINAL , PERSON om utlendingers adgang til riket og deres opphold her \u2013 utlendingsloven \u2013 applicable at the material time and later replaced by LAW ) read :", "\u201c Any foreign national may be expelled", "a ) when the foreign national has seriously or repeatedly contravened CARDINAL or more provisions of the present LAW or evades the execution of any decision which means that the person concerned shall leave the realm . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Even when the conditions for expulsion pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW were satisfied , expulsion could not take place if it would be a disproportionate measure against the foreign national or the closest members of his or her family . LAW of LAW DATE provided :", "\u201c Expulsion pursuant to the first paragraph , sub - paragraphs ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of this section , shall not be ordered if , having regard to the seriousness of the offence and the foreign national \u2019s links to the realm , this would be a disproportionately severe measure vis - \u00e0 - vis the foreign national in question or the closest members of this person \u2019s family . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , an expulsion order would be accompanied by a prohibition on re - entry into GPE . However , the person expelled might , on application , be granted leave to enter GPE . Furthermore , according to well - established administrative practice , when considering an application for leave to enter under LAW ( CARDINAL ) , ORG was under an obligation to consider the proportionality of its decision on prohibition on re - entry . The provision read :", "\u201c Expulsion is an obstacle to subsequent leave to enter the realm . Prohibition on entry may be made permanent or of limited duration , but as a general rule not for a period of DATE . On application the person expelled may be granted leave to enter the realm , but as a rule not until DATE have elapsed since the date of exit . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provided inter alia :", "\u201c Any decision which means that any foreign national must leave the realm is implemented by ordering the foreign national to leave immediately or within a prescribed time limit . If the order is not complied with or it is highly probable that it will not lead to the foreign national \u2019s leaving the realm , the police may escort the foreign national out . ...
