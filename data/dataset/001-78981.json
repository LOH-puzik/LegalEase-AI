The applicant company has sold beer in GPE under the \u201c Budweiser \u201d mark since DATE . It broke into the NORP markets in DATE and says that it began to sell \u201c Budweiser \u201d beer in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company \u2019s decision to extend the sale of its beers to LOC led to a dispute with a NORP \u2013 now NORP DATE company called ORG . ORG produces a beer in the town of ORG in GPE ( GPE ) which is also called \u201c Budweiser \u201d . The term comes from PERSON , the NORP name for the town . The applicant company alleges that ORG has only been marketing beer under the \u201c Budweiser \u201d name since DATE , whereas PERSON says that it has been entitled to use that appellation since DATE , when ORG of ORG conferred the right to produce the beer on a number of independent brewers in \u010cesk\u00e9 GPE ( PERSON in NORP ) . The brewers used a special technique and beers produced by this method became known by the term \u201c Budweiser \u201d , just as beers produced using the methods of another NORP town , PERSON ( NORP in NORP ) , became known as \u201c NORP \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the information before the ORG , the applicant company concluded CARDINAL agreements in DATE with PERSON concerning the distribution and sale of \u201c Budweiser \u201d beer in GPE . However , these agreements did not deal with the question of the right to use the \u201c Budweiser \u201d name in LOC . As a result , the CARDINAL companies became embroiled in a series of legal proceedings over the right to use the term \u201c Budweiser \u201d in various NORP countries , including GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company applied to ORG ( PERSON ) to register \u201c Budweiser \u201d as a trade mark on the industrial - property register . The PERSON did not grant the application immediately because it was opposed by PERSON , which alleged that \u201c Budweiser Bier \u201d had been registered in its name as an appellation of origin since DATE . PERSON had effected the registration under the terms of FAC of DATE for ORG and their International Registration ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company then applied to ORG on DATE for an order cancelling PERSON registration . A summons was served on PERSON , but it did not file a defence . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( which , in the absence of an appeal , became final ) , ORG granted the applicant company \u2019s application on the ground that the product to which the registration referred , namely the beer known as \u201c Budweiser Bier \u201d , was not an appellation of origin or indication of source . ORG Instance noted that under the terms of LAW of DATE such protection was reserved to the geographical name of a country , region , or locality , which served to designate a product originating therein , the quality and characteristics of which were due exclusively or essentially to the geographical environment , including natural and human factors . \u201c Budweiser \u201d did not come within this category . The registration was therefore cancelled .", "CARDINAL . Following the cancellation of the appellation of origin , and despite the fact that ORG had challenged the application for registration under the opposition procedure , the ORG registered the \u201c Budweiser \u201d trade mark in the applicant company \u2019s name on DATE in a decision that was published on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON appealed to ORG against the PERSON \u2019s decision on the strength of an agreement between the governments of GPE and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic on ORG , Appellations of Origin and Other Geographical and Similar Designations ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) , which was signed in GPE on DATE and which came into force on DATE , after publication in ORG . As required by law , the applicant company was invited by the court to take part in the proceedings as an interested party . In DATE it was served with the originating summons that had been lodged by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG Instance dismissed the appeal . It found that the only intellectual property eligible for protection under NORP law and LAW ( which , according to the court was no longer in force , owing to the disappearance of CARDINAL of the contracting parties , GPE ) was the \u201c PERSON \u201d appellation of origin , not the \u201c Budweiser \u201d trade mark . In addition , it found that there was no risk of confusion between the appellation of origin and the applicant company \u2019s trade mark , which the vast majority of consumers tended to think of as an NORP beer .", "CARDINAL . Bud\u011bjovick\u00fd Budvar appealed against that decision to ORG , alleging , inter alia , a breach of LAW , sub - paragraphs ( l ) and ( j ) , of LAW . In a judgment of DATE , ORG overturned the impugned judgment and ordered the PERSON to refuse to register \u201c Budweiser \u201d as a trade mark . ORG did not consider that there had been a breach of LAW , as the expression \u201c Budweiser \u201d was incapable of misleading the NORP public as to the origin of the beer concerned . However , it found that such a registration would infringe LAW and , consequently , LAW j ) of LAW . In that connection , it noted that LAW had remained in force , following an exchange of notes between the NORP and NORP governments ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and had been incorporated into domestic law by virtue of LAW , which contained a clause providing for international law to take effect in the NORP legal system .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed on points of law to ORG alleging , inter alia , that the impugned decision contravened LAW of DATE on ORG ( \u201c the TRIPs Agreement \u201d ) , which establishes the rule that registration confers priority , and in particular its LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE . The applicant company also alleged that , in any event , the protected appellation of origin \u201c PERSON \u201d did not correspond to the NORP expression \u201c Budweiser \u201d , so that LAW could not be used to challenge its application for registration . The applicant company argued that , even supposing that the NORP expression \u201c Budweiser \u201d was an accurate translation of the NORP appellation of origin , LAW applied only to translations between NORP and NORP , not to translations into other languages . It submitted , lastly , that LAW was unconstitutional owing to a formal defect in that it had been adopted by the government , not ORG , in breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW governing parliamentary sovereignty .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law in a judgment of DATE , which came to the applicant company \u2019s attention on DATE .", "With regard to ORG , ORG began by noting that the provision on which the applicant company relied required it to have acted in good faith before going on to say that the applicant company had not referred in its application for registration to any factual information that demonstrated its good faith . In any event , the effect of DATE of ORG was that it had not become binding under NORP law until DATE , that is to say after the entry into force of the DATE LAW . ORG therefore found that ORG could not take precedence over LAW .", "As regards the interpretation of LAW , ORG considered that the intention of the CARDINAL contracting GPE in entering into it had incontestably been to protect through reciprocal arrangements their respective national products , including when translations of a name were used . The appellation of origin \u201c PERSON \u201d , which became \u201c PERSON \u201d or \u201c NORP \u201d in NORP , indicated a product from the \u010cesk\u00e9 GPE region in GPE . It was therefore protected by LAW .", "Lastly , the procedure whereby the ORG had been adopted did not contravene Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , since it did not concern a sphere for which ORG had exclusive competence .", "CARDINAL .
