On DATE the Director of ORG in GPE ( ORG ) dismissed the appeal brought by PERSON It further confirmed the entitlement to purchase the land created by the contested decision , considering , inter alia , that the plots concerned were adjacent to a farm owned and run by the applicant and her husband and that therefore they were natural candidates for the purchase . The authority referred to LAW DATE ( ustawa o sprzeda\u017cy nieruchomo\u015bci Pa\u0144stwowego Funduszu PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL .

ORG , when subsequently called by the applicant and her husband to execute the DATE decision by selling the land to them , refused to do so . In letters dated DATE and DATE and DATE addressed to the applicant and her husband , the municipality \u2019s executive board ( Zarz\u0105d miasta ) refused to transfer ownership to them essentially because the land concerned , situated within the administrative limits of the LOC municipality , had been designated for non - agricultural purposes under the DATE land development plan .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the Governor refused to do so , relying on the Act of DATE on the management of ORG - owned agricultural property ( ustawa o gospodarowaniu nieruchomo\u015bciami rolnymi PERSON oraz o zmianie niekt\u00f3rych ustaw ) . It was noted that under the DATE land development plan adopted by the GPE municipality , the plots no longer constituted agricultural land either within the meaning of LAW nor under the local land development plan .

The court further obliged the municipality to sell the land concerned to the applicant and her husband . It was of the view that the first - instance court had erred in finding that neither the provisions of the DATE Sale of ORG ( ustawa o sprzeda\u017cy nieruchomo\u015bci TIME PERSON ) nor the decision given in DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) on the basis of that Act provided for an obligation on the part of the municipality to sell the land to the addressee of that decision . That decision created on the claimants\u2019 part a claim of a pecuniary nature to have the sale contract concluded with them . They were not therefore obliged to participate in a tender which was simply another procedure for buying the land owned by the ORG , not applicable to their situation . The fact that the proceedings lasted until DATE because other persons had contested that decision did not affect the validity of their claim . Nor did the fact that the applicable provisions changed in DATE and the ownership of the land had thereby been transferred ex lege from ORG to the municipality ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) affect the existence and validity of the claim to have the purchase contract concluded or the corresponding obligation on the part of the public authorities .", "In the operative part of the judgment the court expressly formulated the essential provisions of the sale contract to be concluded by GPE with the applicants , including the price of ORG CARDINAL to be paid for the plots .

In DATE and DATE the applicant and her husband , referring to this judgment , called the municipality to sell the property to them , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that the statutory conjugal property of the applicant and her husband created ex lege by their marriage on DATE had been replaced by a separate marital property regime as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her husband lodged a civil action against GPE with the civil court requesting that steps be taken by that court to put right the discrepancies between the entry in the land register and the actual ownership of the plot ( pow\u00f3dztwo o uzgodnienie ksi\u00e7gi wieczystej z rzeczywistym stanem prawnym ) . They referred to the judgment of ORG , summarised in paragraphs DATE above and requested that ORG be listed as owner of the land concerned .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also submitted an alternative claim asking the court to order ORG represented by the Mayor of ORG to sell the property to them .

The land register could only be amended on the basis of an administrative decision issued by the Governor on the basis of section CARDINAL ) of ORG of DATE ( \" LAW \" ) confirming the ex lege transfer of ownership from ORG to the local municipality on the basis of that LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Governor had never given a relevant administrative decision . The civil court had no jurisdiction to order administrative bodies to issue administrative decisions . In the absence of such a decision the ex lege transfer of ownership to the municipality provided for by law could not become operative . In the absence of such a transfer certified by a decision , ORG remained the land \u2019s owner . It was therefore impossible for the court to order the municipality to sell the plot to the claimant or to amend the land register in such a manner as to list the municipality as the owner . The judgment given in DATE was not res iudicata towards ORG as it was the municipality who had been the defendant in these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The claimants appealed . They argued that they had already specified before the first - instance court that the claim was directed against both ORG and the municipality of GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing before the appeal court the lawyer representing the applicant and her husband stated that he had corrected the content of the alternative claim ( as regards the entity who was supposed to make a declaration of intent ) already during the proceedings before the court of first instance .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed on DATE by ORG . The court shared the conclusions of the lower court . It was of the view that the claimants had not made it sufficiently clear that the alternative claim had been directed against both ORG and the municipality . Despite the fact that the plaintiffs had pointed out the mistake in their statement of claim which had been addressed against ORG , the court could not rectify that mistake ex officio .", "CARDINAL .
