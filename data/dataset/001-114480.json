De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and is currently detained at GPE . He is represented before the Court by ORG , a firm of solicitors based in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of murder at ORG . He appealed against conviction before ORG , claiming that the evidence of CARDINAL of the principal prosecution witnesses was unreliable since that witness gave inconsistent evidence at later trials . The appeal was dismissed on DATE . ORG relied on case - law to the effect that the fact that a prosecution witness has been shown to have lied may not be fatal to conviction .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant sought to challenge the way in which ORG had dealt with the issue of adducing fresh evidence by way of an appeal to ORG . It was the applicant \u2019s case that , in determining this issue , ORG had wrongly followed the approach of a majority of ORG in the case of ORG v. ORG GPE and GPE ) [ DATE ] UKPC CARDINAL , rather than the approach of ORG in the case of GPE , NORP v. [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL . In order for an appeal to be lodged with ORG ( now ORG ) in criminal matters , ORG must certify that a point of law of general public importance arises in the case ( section ORG ) of LAW DATE ) . ORG indicated that it would not certify that a point of law of general public importance arose in the case .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then applied to ORG for a declaration that section ORG ) of LAW was incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . The applicant argued that the certification requirement constituted a violation of his right to an impartial tribunal and his right of access to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed this application , finding that the certification requirement did not violate the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW . As regards the challenge to ORG impartiality , ORG distinguished between the substantive appeal and the certification process :", "\u201c Although [ counsel for the applicant ] does not suggest actual bias , what he is in truth submitting is that in deciding whether to certify ORG may be influenced by an oblique motive ; the wish to avoid ORG considering the case and possibly overruling ORG decision . We entirely reject that . We reject too the suggestion that the fair minded and informed observer would conclude that in reaching its decision ORG would be so influenced . As [ counsel for the prosecution ] submits , in deciding whether or not to certify the court is not sitting on an appeal against its own decision . It is not determining any criminal charge . It is merely assessing whether its decision contains an important point of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also emphasised that the same court was best placed to determine the existence of a point of law of general public importance , since it had already examined all the issues in the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the certification requirement amounted to an interference with the applicant \u2019s right of access to ORG , which was , however , justified in pursuit of the legitimate aim of providing a filtering mechanism to control ORG caseload .", "CARDINAL . The essence of the applicant \u2019s right of access to ORG had not been denied since he had no right to have an uncertified point of law considered by ORG :", "\u201c Moreover , we do not accept that a refusal to certify amounts to a denial of the essence of the appellant \u2019s right of access to ORG . The appellant has the right to have his access to the second - tier appeal court decided by an independent and impartial tribunal properly applying legal principles . If such a decision goes against the appellant that has not denied him the essence of his right to access to ORG . It means that on proper application of legal principles by an independent and impartial court he is not entitled to have his case considered by ORG in circumstances where it is legitimate for there to be a filtering of the cases before that court . That is precisely what happened here . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW , the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim on the ground that , in criminal cases , ORG jurisdiction was limited to resolving important matters of legal principle , whereas it had a broader remit in civil cases , sometimes encompassing factual issues . Appellants in criminal and civil cases were not , therefore , in comparable situations .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , which replaced ORG DATE , provides as regards appeals in criminal proceedings :", "\u201c CARDINAL . - Right of appeal to [ ORG ]", "( CARDINAL ) An appeal lies to ORG at the instance of the defendant or prosecutor from any decision of ORG on an appeal to that court ...", "( CARDINAL ) The appeal lies only with the leave of ORG or the [ ORG ] ; and leave shall not be granted unless it is certified by ORG that a point of law of general public importance is involved in the decision and it appears to ORG or the [ ORG ] ( as the case may be ) that the point is one which ought to be considered by [ ORG ] .", "( CARDINAL ) Except as provided for by this part of this LAW ... no appeal shall lie from any decision of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following several high profile miscarriages of justice , ORG , PERSON ( ORG , DATE ) , chaired by PERSON , was tasked to consider , inter alia , whether changes were needed in the criminal appeals process . In its DATE report , ORG recommended the abolition of the certification requirement ( at \u00a7 MONEY ) :", "\u201c [ I]t is unduly restrictive to require such a certificate to be issued in addition to the necessity of obtaining leave from ORG or ORG itself . We think therefore that the requirement that ORG certify that the case involves a matter of law of general public importance should be dropped . The need to obtain the leave of either ORG or ORG before proceeding further is by itself a sufficient filter . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A review of the criminal courts carried out in DATE by Sir PERSON did not address this issue , since the composition and workings of ORG did not fall within its terms of reference .", "CARDINAL . NORP In GPE the High Court of Judiciary is the highest criminal court . There is no route of criminal appeal from ORG to ORG . However , there is an exception under LAW DATE for devolution issues . Devolution issues include questions as to the compatibility with LAW acts and functions of the Lord Advocate and legislation passed by the NORP parliament . In such cases , leave to appeal is required from either ORG or ORG . There is no certification requirement for criminal cases referred to ORG from ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In civil cases there is no certification requirement in respect of appeals to ORG from any order or judgment of ORG in GPE and GPE or in GPE . An application for permission to appeal must be made first to ORG . If that ORG refuses permission , an application may be made to ORG . For a \" leapfrog \" appeal directly from ORG to ORG , however , ORG judge must certify that the relevant conditions are satisfied , namely that a sufficient case has been made out to justify an application for permission to appeal to ORG and that all parties consent ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE ) . The \u201c relevant conditions \u201d ( which are set out in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE ) are that a point of general public importance is involved and that it either :", "\u201c ( a ) relates wholly or mainly to the construction of an enactment or of a statutory instrument , and has been fully argued in the proceedings and fully considered in the judgment of the judge in the proceedings , or", "( b ) is one in respect of which the judge is bound by a decision of ORG or of the [ ORG ] in previous proceedings , and was fully considered in the judgments given by ORG or the [ ORG ] ( as the case may be ) in those previous proceedings . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
