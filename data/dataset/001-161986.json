The applicants I.A.A. , Z.A.A. , B.A.A. , A.A.A. and DATE are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and who currently live in GPE . They are represented before ORG . The President ordered that the ORG identity should not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL applicants comprise CARDINAL biological siblings and their first cousin who is a sibling by adoption .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 mother was born in GPE . DATE she had CARDINAL children with her first husband . The CARDINAL eldest children went to live with their mother \u2019s paternal aunt and appear to have remained with her in GPE . Following the breakdown of her relationship with her first husband , the applicant \u2019s mother married her second husband and had a child with him in DATE . She subsequently returned to her first husband and gave birth to CARDINAL further children in DATE and DATE . In DATE she adopted her niece , who is the fifth applicant in the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s mother left her first husband for a second time in DATE . Around the same time , her second husband was granted refugee status in GPE . She joined him there DATE , leaving her CARDINAL youngest children , including the applicants , in the care of her sister in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants\u2019 mother \u2019s only child with her second husband was granted entry clearance to join the couple in GPE . In sponsoring the application for entry clearance , she did not mention that she had children by her first husband who were still living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants\u2019 aunt moved from GPE to GPE , taking with her the CARDINAL children in her care .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants\u2019 mother divorced her second husband .", "CARDINAL . In DATE CARDINAL of the applicants\u2019 siblings applied for entry clearance to join their mother in GPE . Apparently those children were chosen to join her because CARDINAL was the youngest and the other was in poor health . The application was initially refused but entry clearance was later granted following a successful appeal to the then ORG . In allowing the appeal , the ORG accepted first , that the mother had effective sole responsibility for the children abroad ; secondly , and in the alternative , that there were serious and compelling family or other reasons which made their continued exclusion from the GPE undesirable ; thirdly , that the mother and her children had enjoyed family life together as a unit before she had travelled to GPE to join her second husband ; and fourthly , that the mother could not reasonably relocate to GPE to care for her children as she would have no job and no means of survival there .", "CARDINAL . In or around this time the applicants\u2019 aunt left GPE and returned to GPE , leaving the QUANTITY children in the care of the eldest , who was then DATE . The CARDINAL applicants and their older sibling , who is not a party to the proceedings before this ORG , applied for entry clearance to join their mother in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG refused the application for entry clearance on the ground that the applicants and their older sibling did not meet the requirements of CARDINAL or CARDINAL of ORG HCCARDINAL ( as amended ) because they were not dependent on their mother \u2019s support and they were not the biological children of a recognised refugee . The Secretary of ORG also considered LAW but concluded that although there was a limited interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW , the refusal of entry clearance had been proportionate and justified .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicants\u2019 appeal against this decision was dismissed as the Immigration Judge found that they could not meet the requirements of ORG . He further found that as contact between the applicants and their mother had been sporadic since DATE , family life did not exist \u201c at the present time \u201d and LAW was not , therefore , engaged . However , on DATE permission to appeal was granted as the grounds of appeal raised arguable issues in relation to the manner in which the Immigration Judge had approached the LAW issue .", "CARDINAL . The appeal decision was promulgated on DATE . While the Immigration Judge had little doubt that the previous judge was correct to find that the applicants could not meet the requirements of ORG , he found it to be equally clear that he had not adequately addressed the Article CARDINAL issue . In particular , he had concentrated on whether family life existed \u201c at the present time \u201d when the correct test was whether it had existed at the date of the decision , namely CARDINAL DATE . Consequently , the Immigration Judge concluded that the previous judge had erred in law and set aside his decision . In reconsidering the LAW issue , the Immigration Judge accepted that family life had existed between the applicants and their mother at the date of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision and that the refusal of entry clearance had interfered with that family life . Nevertheless , he concluded that the interference had been proportionate because the ORG mother had made a conscious decision to leave them in GPE , knowing that the separation might be permanent , and at the date of the decision she had been living separately from them for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought leave to appeal on the ground , inter alia , that the Immigration Judge had failed to take into account the findings of the Immigration Judge in the first CARDINAL children \u2019s appeal against the refusal of entry clearance in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants\u2019 application for leave to appeal as it found that the Immigration Judge had considered all the relevant factors in the round and reached a conclusion which was rationally open to him . On DATE permission to appeal was also refused by ORG . However , on DATE ORG made an order by consent ordering that the applicants\u2019 appeal should be remitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The new ORG promulgated its decision on DATE . In assessing whether or not the refusal of entry clearance amounted to a disproportionate interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW , it accepted the conclusions of the Immigration Judge in the appeal of the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL siblings against the refusal of entry clearance . The ORG also accepted that the best interests of the children had to be treated as a primary consideration , albeit not the primary consideration , in assessing proportionality and that it was in the ORG best interests that they should be allowed to join their mother in GPE . Nevertheless , the general principle remained true that a foreign national who could not satisfy the requirements for entry clearance under LAW ( and the applicants had not disputed that this was the case ) would not normally be able to show that his exclusion from GPE would constitute a disproportionate interference with his LAW unless he could show good reason why his case should be treated more favourably that the generality of such cases . Moreover , the ORG noted that the ORG best interests could not be viewed in isolation and it was therefore relevant that their mother had decided to leave them in GPE , knowing that the separation was likely to continue for the foreseeable future , and that she had allowed DATE to pass before attempting to bring them to GPE , by which time they had long ceased to live together as a family unit with her .", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded that :", "\u201c The circumstances in which the appellants were living together in GPE at the date of the respondent \u2019s decision , and in which they are still living now , are undoubtedly harsh , to put it at its lowest . Indeed , they may fairly be characterised as harsh . But sadly they are conditions in which vast numbers of other individuals are compelled to live throughout the unhappier regions of the world . GPE does not have either the room or the resources to provide for all of them . There is no reason in logic why the appellants should be viewed differently from the vast numbers of other unfortunate individuals who would jump at the opportunity of a new and better life in GPE , but who can not fulfil the requirements for entry laid down by the Secretary of ORG in ORG and are therefore unable to avail themselves of that opportunity . On the facts of the NORP case as presented before me , I am not persuaded that they have shown why they should be treated differently from the generality of foreign nationals in the same or similar position . In short , whilst I accept that their exclusion from GPE would constitute an interference with their LAW and those of the third parties affected by their exclusion , nevertheless that would not constitute a disproportionate interference when balanced against the larger public interest to which I have referred . Their appeals therefore fall to be dismissed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants\u2019 older sibling , who had been looking after them , left the family unit in GPE and her current whereabouts are unknown . Since then , the applicants have been cared for by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL .
