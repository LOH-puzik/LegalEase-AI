The applicant and S.S. ( \u201c the respondent \u201d ) married in DATE . Their son PERSON was born in DATE . They lived in the respondent \u2019s GPE house in a neighbourhood of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant moved to her GPE house in the same neighbourhood . GPE continued living with his father and his paternal grandparents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request for interim custody with the competent first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court rejected the applicant \u2019s request for interim custody , but granted her extensive access rights in respect of the child pending the final outcome of the custody proceedings . This interim access order was immediately enforceable .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the interim access order was respected , with some resistance on the part of the child , until DATE , when the child ran away from the applicant during a visit and went back to the respondent \u2019s house .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge ordered enforcement of the said access order . After several failed attempts by the applicant to spend time with the child in accordance with the order , the enforcement judge sent a bailiff on CARDINAL and DATE to make an unannounced visit to monitor the applicant \u2019s attempt to make contact with the child . During the visit , the bailiff informed the enforcement judge that the respondent had brought the child to the front gate of the house , but the child had refused to leave with the applicant , even after the respondent tried to persuade him , and had gone back inside . After receiving the report , the enforcement judge scheduled an enforcement hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge ordered a child support team from ORG school to implement a system of psychological preparation to assist the child \u2019s acceptance of contact with his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge asked ORG to contemplate initiating corrective monitoring of the respondent \u2019s exercise of parental rights in the light of the respondent \u2019s substantial influence on the child \u2019s hostility toward his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG placed the respondent under formal corrective supervision ( korektivni nadzor nad vr\u0161enjem roditeljskog prava ) . On DATE ORG , with the approval of the enforcement judge , applied the same measure to the applicant so as to enhance the GPE collaboration with a view to satisfying the child \u2019s emotional needs .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the enforcement judge heard a psychologist working with the child . The psychologist advised the judge that interviewing the child within the proceedings would not be in his best interest .", "CARDINAL . Due to the respondent \u2019s failure to prepare the child appropriately for the contact with his mother , on CARDINAL DATE the enforcement judge ordered the respondent to pay a fine in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) and on DATE a fine in the amount of CARDINAL ORG , both within DATE . On DATE the competent second - instance court rejected the respondent \u2019s appeals against the fines . On DATE and DATE , after the failure of the applicant to pay the fines , the enforcement judge ordered their mandatory enforcement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked the enforcement judge to postpone enforcement of the access order for DATE in view of the pending parental therapy . The ORG further asked for , and the judge approved , a further DATE of therapy , stating that an improvement in the child \u2019s attitude as well as in the GPE relationship had been achieved . The ORG also proposed to the applicant and the respondent to stay the ongoing court proceedings until the therapy had ended . They observed that the court proceedings , in which the parents acted as opponents , jeopardised the progress achieved to date . It would appear that the applicant and the respondent did not accept this recommendation .", "CARDINAL . The parental therapy , which at that time had already lasted for DATE , included CARDINAL sessions in which ORG professionals continuously and intensively worked with the applicant , the respondent , the child and the paternal grandparents to reach mutually acceptable arrangements and enforce the interim measures in line with the best interest of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the custody judgment of CARDINAL DATE became final ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and the decision on interim custody rights came to an end . The enforcement proceedings were later formally terminated by the enforcement judge on DATE . The enforcement judge , however , explicitly ordered continuation of the enforcement in respect of the fine of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a new request for interim custody after ORG ( ORG zdravlje , hereafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) conducted an examination of the parental capacity of both parties at the request of the first - instance court . The ORG report recommended that custody be awarded to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court granted interim custody to the applicant and ordered the respondent immediately to surrender the child to her . It also quashed the part of the interim order of DATE containing its decision not to grant custody to the applicant . The rest of the interim access order remained in force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement court ordered enforcement of the interim custody order . The respondent appealed on DATE , claiming that the child himself did not want to live with the applicant . The appeal was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first attempt to reunite the applicant with the child took place on DATE . The enforcement judge , a bailiff , several representatives of ORG , CARDINAL uniformed policemen , CARDINAL plain clothes policemen , the applicant and her lawyer all entered the courtyard of the respondent \u2019s house , expecting that the child would be surrendered . The judge and the ORG \u2019s representatives explained to the child in front of the others that he should leave and go with his mother to her house , but the child rejected the planned reunion and went back inside . The respondent allegedly would not allow the enforcement to take place in the house . He maintained that he had informed the child that various officials would come , but had not prepared him for reunion . The applicant refused forceful removal of the child . The enforcement judge noted that the child was not yet prepared for a transfer of custody and postponed the enforcement until DATE at ORG LOC . The enforcement judge asked the parties and ORG representative to prepare the child adequately for the next reunion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the enforcement judge adjourned the custody transfer scheduled for those dates as it was awaiting an opinion from ORG regarding the formal corrective supervision of the respondent , as requested in the interim access enforcement proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement judge re - scheduled the transfer of custody for CARDINAL DATE at ORG LOC . The attempt of transfer was conducted in the presence of the enforcement judge , the psychologist , the psychiatrist and the lawyer from ORG and police officers . The child again refused to be separated from his father . The police explained that they could not forcefully remove the respondent from the premises to enable the social experts and the judge to facilitate a conversation with the child in his absence , since the child was clinging on the father , crying and refusing to let him go . It appears that the applicant was also against the use of force ( according to a report to the enforcement judge by ORG of DATE , the applicant refused the possibility of the use of force throughout the proceedings ) . ORG recommended that psychotherapeutic support be provided for the child . The enforcement of the custody transfer was postponed . Shortly afterwards , the respondent was placed under the corrective supervision of ORG ( see para . CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge held a hearing which appears to have been the last one within these enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant petitioned the enforcement judge to fine the respondent for obstructing her contact with the child , hoping that this would compel him to surrender the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge imposed on the respondent a fine in the amount of CARDINAL ORG for failing to appropriately psychologically prepare the child for the reunification . It would appear that the fine has been paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG informed the enforcement judge that its psychological therapies in respect of the family in question had produced no results ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . According to their reports , it became clear that the respondent had cooperated in form only and had in fact failed to take steps to encourage the child to have substantive contact with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the custody judgment of CARDINAL DATE became final and the decision on interim custody rights came to an end . From that moment , efforts to enforce the final custody judgment commenced ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .

On DATE the applicant lodged a civil claim requesting the dissolution of her marriage with ORG , sole custody of GPE and maintenance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court dissolved the applicant \u2019s marriage , granted her sole custody of ORG and specified the respondent \u2019s access rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the second - instance court and ORG , respectively , upheld this judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional appeal with ORG ( ORG ) . She relied on various ORG of the LAW , Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL LAW on the Rights of the LAW . She sought redress for the protracted length of the custody and subsequent criminal proceedings and the non - enforcement of the judicial interim access and custody decisions in her favour which , she claimed , violated her rights to a fair trial and to family life . She also complained that she had not had any legal avenue available to expedite those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . As regards the protracted length of the custody proceedings , ORG considered that the first - instance court had acted diligently , without any substantial periods of inactivity . It found the case to have been particularly complex , as the expert findings regarding the best interests of the child had conflicted with the latter \u2019s own wish as to who to live with .", "CARDINAL . It also found that the non - enforcement of the interim access and custody orders during the same period had been attributable to the particular complexity of the case , as the child had objected to being reunited with the applicant . It found that the enforcement court had undertaken , without any delay , all necessary measures , including fining the respondent , for the purpose of enforcing effectively the applicant \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of CARDINAL DATE became enforceable on DATE and the enforcement order was issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first forcible transfer of custody was scheduled for DATE , but the child refused any kind of contact with the applicant . The court noted that the respondent had failed to prepare the child for reunion . The applicant explicitly refused to countenance the use of force against the respondent and the child as the means of enforcement . The enforcement was therefore adjourned .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , upon the initiative of ORG , the applicant and the respondent signed an Agreement on Access Rights designed to assist the re - establishing of contact between the applicant and PERSON in order to facilitate the enforcement of the custody judgment .", "CARDINAL . Despite this agreement , on DATE the enforcement court imposed a fine on the respondent in the amount of ORG CARDINAL because of his failure to comply with the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It also ruled that the respondent was to be given DATE from the date of receipt of that order to surrender the child voluntarily to the applicant and with the added condition that , should he fail to do so , he would have to pay a further fine of FAC . The respondent did not comply with the order and it seems that the fine in the amount of CARDINAL ORG was subsequently imposed and paid .", "CARDINAL . The court scheduled a new forcible transfer of custody for DATE . In preparation for the enforcement , ORG psychologist drew up a detailed plan of action . The psychologist \u2019s assessment , after working with the child , was that such a transfer would be impossible or highly traumatic for the child and the enforcement was postponed once again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the respondent filed a claim for revision of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , seeking sole custody of MONEY He also requested an interim custody order to the same effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG provided the first - instance court with an expert opinion . ORG acknowledged that there had been no mechanisms available to facilitate a forcible physical transfer of child custody to the applicant in view of the respondent \u2019s refusal . According to the report , the only feasible proposal would be for the child to continue living with his father . Even though , taking into account the chronology of events , parental capacity , justice and equity , the opposite proposal would be more appropriate , it could propose only this arrangement \u201c not as an expression of their wish , but as the sole solution which is possible to impose and enforce in practice \u201d . A change of residence would in any event have a negative impact on the child \u2019s development .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court granted sole custody to the respondent , ordered the applicant to pay child maintenance and specified the applicant \u2019s access rights as TIME every weekend , as well as specified periods of school holidays .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant filed criminal complaints against the respondent for parental child abduction and continuous non - compliance with the interim access and custody orders . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the competent prosecutor \u2019s office charged the applicant with those crimes . None of the scheduled hearings was held . In DATE the first - instance court stayed the criminal proceedings as the prosecutor \u2019s office had dropped the charges . The applicant subsequently took over the prosecution as subsidiary prosecutor . On DATE the first - instance court , in a reasoned judgment , acquitted the respondent . It found , on the basis of numerous testimonies , CARDINAL expert opinions , CARDINAL expert reports from the civil proceedings case - file and other documentary evidence that the respondent always made the child available for enforcement , that he never physically or verbally , actively or passively obstructed enforcement at any point , and that there were no indications that the child ever showed signs that he was under pressure or undue influence not to have contact with his mother . On DATE the second - instance court upheld this judgment .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the applicant and her son have re - established contact with each other since the signing of ORG and the revision of the custody judgment of DATE . It would appear that they have been meeting DATE for TIME without supervision . The child still lives with the respondent ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
