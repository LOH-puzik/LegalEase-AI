On DATE ORG dismissed the claim . With reference to the documents before it and judicial decisions delivered earlier the court established that the property in question had been transferred to the company which had later become insolvent .", "CARDINAL . In an appeal the applicants argued , in particular , that the first - instance court had failed to take evidence , as suggested by them , with a view to establishing that the property had not actually been transferred to the company . They also maintained that the case should have been assigned to a judge dealing with civil cases instead of a judge deciding commercial disputes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the firstinstance court \u2019s judgment . It found that the applicants had failed to show that the property had been erroneously included in the assets of the insolvent company in the context of the insolvency proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law . They argued that there had been shortcomings in the proceedings before the appellate court which rendered the appeal on points of law admissible pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , they alleged that the appellate court had determined the case without hearing the parties and establishing the relevant facts . Earlier consent they had given for the appellate court to proceed with the case in their absence at the hearing of DATE did not mean that they accepted the determination of the merits without the parties having been heard . The applicants further argued that the case had been dealt with as a commercial dispute , whereas it should have been determined by judges dealing with civil cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal on points of law . It held that the reasons for its admissibility as invoked by the applicants could not be accepted . In particular , ORG noted that the applicants had notified ORG that they would not be appearing on DATE , and that they had agreed with the case proceeding in their absence . The fact that the appellate court had not quashed the first - instance court \u2019s judgment as requested by them could not affect the position .", "CARDINAL .

As ORG judgment had been reviewed by ORG upon appeal , ORG held that it did not have the power to examine the alleged shortcomings in the first - instance proceedings .", "CARDINAL . As to ORG judgment , the applicants had failed to submit their complaint within the statutory time - limit of DATE . The fact that they had sought redress by means of an appeal on points of law could not affect the position , as ORG had rejected that remedy as inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Finally , as to the cassation proceedings , ORG found no evidence of unfairness in the way ORG had dealt with and decided on the ORG appeal on points of law . Its failure to let the applicants comment on the other party \u2019s observations on it had not rendered the proceedings unfair in the circumstances ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
