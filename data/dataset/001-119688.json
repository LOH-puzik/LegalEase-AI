NORP By letter of DATE , the liquidator in the S. insolvency proceedings informed the mayor of Malyn and the Head of ORG that S. had been declared insolvent . As the sale of the hostels owned by S. would , according to the liquidator , create social tensions in the town , it was proposed that the town would take over their ownership .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the board of creditors agreed to sell CARDINAL of the hostels to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a contract of sale was signed . The applicants paid CARDINAL NORP hryvnias ( ORG ) ( at the material time MONEY ( ORG ) ) for the hostel and became owners of a CARDINAL share each .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants informed a local electricity supply company that they were the new owners of the hostel .

The applicants discovered that the power cables and electricity meters serving the property needed to be replaced , and that the hostel occupants had not been paying rent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the electricity supply company informed the hostel occupants that the electricity would be cut off on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor ordered the electricity in the hostel not to be cut off since he had been preparing to institute legal proceedings on behalf of the hostel occupants .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE , the applicants informed ORG , the mayor , the company S. , at that time allegedly in liquidation , and the hostel occupants , that they had bought the hostel in order to live there themselves . The applicants stated that when the hostel was being sold , the occupants had refused to participate in the sale process . Despite the hostel \u2019s change of ownership and need for refurbishment , its occupants had not been paying rent or communal charges for DATE . The applicants requested PERSON to provide new housing to those occupants , who were requested to vacate the hostel by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON , a DATE hostel occupant , sought the assistance of ORG as she had a young child and had been requested to leave the hostel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor instituted proceedings at the Malynsky ORG on behalf of PERSON , requesting that the decision of CARDINAL DATE and all subsequent transfers of ownership be declared invalid . The prosecutor noted that in DATE the hostel occupants had lodged previous complaints with his office . After examining the case the prosecutor concluded that the hostel \u2019s privatisation in DATE had been unlawful . He argued that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( ORG \u00ab \u041f\u0440\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044e \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0442\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0443 ORG ) prohibited the privatisation of rooms in hostels . The transfer of ownership of the hostel and its subsequent sale breached the LAW , other legal provisions and the \u201c moral principles of society \u201d , since the occupants\u2019 constitutional rights to housing had been violated . It also adversely affected the economic interests of the ORG and the housing rights of PERSON , who was a single mother with a young child and was therefore unable to lodge a claim herself . Lastly , the prosecutor requested that ownership of the hostel be transferred to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a counterclaim . They reiterated that the hostel occupants had refused to participate in the hostel sale process and had not been paying rent and communal charges which had resulted in S. \u2019s insolvency . The applicants submitted that they had informed the prosecutor \u2019s office of the matter and requested PERSON to provide housing to the hostel occupants . The prosecutor \u2019s office had failed to protect the rights of the new owners despite the fact that the hostel was in an alarming state , the drainage and water supply systems were not functioning and the rooms were being heated by stoves . Moreover , the LOC could no longer be classed as a hostel as it had become a normal multi - family apartment building . Its occupants were no longer employed by the company which had provided them with housing . Lastly , the applicants requested the court , in the event of finding against them , to award them ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation , to be paid by the ORG , representing the hostel \u2019s value and the administrative costs relating to the contract of sale .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG returned the counterclaim to the applicants and provided them with a deadline of CARDINAL DATE to correct errors in their application . In particular , the court noted that the counterclaim \u201c lacked logical consistency \u201d , in that there was no clear evidence of causation and loss . The decision was posted to the applicants on DATE . It is unclear when they received it . It appears that the applicants did not re - lodge their claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant sent ORG a copy of a decision of CARDINAL DATE taken by ORG in which it had rejected a prosecutor \u2019s application to declare as invalid decisions taken in DATE and DATE by ORG to privatise a certain hostel . The court found that there were no legal provisions prohibiting the privatisation of hostels , as section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG prohibited the privatisation of rooms within hostels but not hostels per se . The court did not refer to section CARDINAL of LAW , which prohibited the privatisation of State housing stock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the applicants\u2019 case , the court rejected the prosecutor \u2019s request as unsubstantiated . Again , the court did not refer to section CARDINAL of LAW . In reply to the applicants\u2019 objection that the prosecutor had missed the DATE time - limit for lodging his claim , the court noted that the prosecutor had only learned about the situation in question following PERSON \u2019s complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that decision and declared the decision of DATE and all subsequent transfers of ownership invalid . The court held that section CARDINAL of LAW provided that State housing stock , including hostels , was not amenable to privatisation . Since , at the material time , the hostel in question was owned by the ORG , it had been privatised unlawfully . Referring to LAW , the court awarded the applicants ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , to be paid by S. It further held that ownership of the hostel should be transferred to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on the grounds that the court \u2019s decision of DATE contradicted another decision taken in an analogous case by ORG , that the court had disregarded the time - limits for lodging claims and that PERSON had been declared insolvent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as a court of cassation , rejected the ORG appeal on points of law by finding , without any further explanation , that there had been no breaches of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG agreed to take over ownership of the hostel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the case of T. and PERSON v. ORG of GPE , PERSON , and ORG , ORG found , referring to decision no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE of ORG , that a transfer of ownership of another hostel in DATE had been lawful , since hostels did not form part of State housing stock .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that PERSON had failed to comply with the court decision of DATE requiring it to pay them compensation .", "CARDINAL . DATE , CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL apartments at the hostel were privatised by their occupants pursuant to the amended ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .
