On DATE the forensic medical commission of CARDINAL experts delivered its report . It confirmed that GPE had died of a heart attack at TIME on CARDINAL DATE . His injuries were estimated as light , with the exception of the subarachnoid haemorrhaging , which was of medium gravity . The haemorrhaging had commenced shortly before death and had originated from the repeated \u201c hitting and shaking \u201d action of blunt objects against the body . It could not be excluded that those objects had been fists , feet or other objects impossible to define . Given that the injuries were to different parts of the body , they could not all have been inflicted at the same time . Some of them \u2013 such as the sores on the nose and under the right eyebrow \u2013 could have originated from falling against a blunt object . The injuries could not be characterised as having resulted from first - aid efforts . No direct connection was established between ORG \u2019s injuries and his death . The experts also concluded that , prior to his death , GPE had suffered from a number of diseases \u2013 of the lungs , heart , kidneys and liver \u2013 which had been aggravated by a heart attack and had caused his death .

On DATE the ORG questioned the expert who had participated in the inspection of the cell on DATE ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) . Referring to the inspection of the scene , the expert stated that GPE could have hit himself against the table while falling from the upper bed , then against the bench next to the table , and , finally , against the floor . Most of his bruises and sores , as well as the cerebral haemorrhaging , could have resulted from such a fall . As to the bruises behind both ears , they could have resulted from the intensive rubbing which the inmates had resorted to , having no knowledge as to how first aid should be provided . Lastly , the expert noted that the subarachnoid haemorrhaging could be assessed as being of both light and medium gravity , as the major criterion for the categorisation of such an injury was the effect of time , which was not applicable to the circumstances under examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another forensic medical expert participating in the commission which had issued the report of DATE was questioned by the prosecutor . She noted that the internal bleeding could have resulted from a generalised trauma to the dead body . It could have occurred owing either to blows or to falling against a hard surface .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again refused to institute criminal proceedings against the PERSON administration or the detainees for a lack of corpus delicti in their actions .
