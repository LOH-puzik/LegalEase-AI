Furthermore , ORG first report , dated DATE , did not contain any information about alleged sexual abuse , while the reasoning in the second report , dated DATE , why certain observations of the children \u2019s behaviour would allude to sexual abuse by their father , was considered to be unsubstantiated .

It held that she was no longer adversely affected by the impugned decision as the enforcement date had already passed before she had filed the appeal . However , as an obiter dictum it pointed out that , according to recent reports from ORG , the children \u2019s accounts of alleged ill treatment by their father had become more precise in the meantime , which constituted a substantial change in the circumstances on which the return order had been based . Contrary to the outcome of the main proceedings under ORG and LAW , ORG therefore considered the obligation under LAW ) of ORG to be applicable in that ORG would have to ask the NORP authorities to use safeguards to ensure that the return of the children was in their best interests , such as not to return them to the applicant in person while the suspicion of abuse against him remained .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG dismissed appeals by ORG against the decisions of DATE and DATE concerning her requests for non - enforcement of the return order . It further rejected an appeal by her against the ORG decision of DATE , ordering the disclosure of her address to the applicant . However , it held again that it would be ORG task to obtain safeguards from the NORP authorities to avoid the children being exposed to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected an extraordinary appeal on points of law by PERSON against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .

On DATE ORG rejected an extraordinary appeal on points of law by PERSON against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . It noted that ORG had already contacted ORG by letter in accordance with LAW ) of ORG , and that the enforcement of a return order under LAW could only be stopped if it was established that there were no adequate safeguards to protect the children \u2019s best interests upon their return to GPE . It therefore called upon ORG to examine the adequacy of the safeguards offered by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing to examine how best to approach the question whether the children would face a grave risk of harm upon their return to GPE . The competent judge also requested that ORG inform her of all the proceedings then pending in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge appointed an expert psychologist , PERSON , and ordered her to submit a report on whether the children \u2019s return to GPE ( either to their father or to a child protection institution ) could harm their psychological development . The judge pointed out , inter alia , that due to the arrest warrants ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) PERSON was likely to be arrested as soon as she returned the children to GPE herself , and that the expert \u2019s observation of the father \u2019s and the children \u2019s interactions with each other would be of significant importance with a view to the accusations of ill - treatment directed against him . All the parties were ordered to cooperate with the expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON \u2019s counsel submitted to the court the requested information concerning the pending proceedings in GPE ( custody proceedings , criminal proceedings against PERSON for child abduction , and criminal proceedings against the applicant for sexual abuse ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL \u2013 CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON informed the court that the children would not be able to attend the scheduled examination by the appointed expert due to illness ; she also submitted a medical certificate describing the children \u2019s illness .", "DATE . On DATE PERSON challenged the judge and S. for bias . The president of ORG dismissed the challenge for bias against the judge on DATE . PERSON subsequently appealed against that decision and submitted new challenges for bias against the competent judge of ORG again as well as the panel of judges of ORG which had given the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG , ORG and ORG each subsequently ruled on these challenges for bias and on ORG \u2019s respective appeals . Her allegations were dismissed with final effect on DATE by ORG , which , inter alia , considered ORG \u2019s allegations to be unfounded and that she had lodged several challenges for bias for tactical reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed PERSON \u2019s challenge against the expert S.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG removed PERSON from the case and appointed another expert psychologist , NORP who , unlike PERSON , was a specialist in traumatology . It referred to the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON and GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) , in which the ORG found a violation of LAW because the domestic courts in that case had not adequately taken into consideration the risk of psychological trauma that would inevitably stem from a sudden and irreversible cutting of the close ties between mother and child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE R. submitted her expert opinion to ORG ; CARDINAL further psychological opinions were privately commissioned by ORG and submitted by her counsel to the court at the same stage of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request of DATE for enforcement of the return order ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Referring to the CARDINAL expert opinions mentioned above ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in particular the one obtained from NORP , it held that the children had been severely traumatised by all the events which had occurred in their family since DATE , that they were suffering from severe post - traumatic stress disorder , and that a separation from their mother and their return to GPE would very likely trigger an existential crisis and gravely harm their emotional and cognitive development . The court did not deny that the mother \u2019s adverse influence on the children regarding their father had also contributed to their negative attitude towards him . However , it also stated that the allegations of sexual abuse against him could neither be proven nor excluded . Regarding the statement on the applicant \u2019s mental health in the psychiatric opinion forwarded by ORG ( see paragraph DATE below ) , ORG considered that the report had not been drawn up in accordance with the NORP standards for examining a person \u2019s educational skills as it had only been based on the applicant \u2019s interview with the expert and no psychological tests had been carried out . In contrast , the CARDINAL expert opinions ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were not only based on ORG \u2019s allegations , but also on psychological tests of the children and their mother . However , in her examination of the case NORP did not hold a meeting between the children and the applicant as such an interaction would have very likely resulted in the children being further traumatised .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG further reiterated that a court could only refuse to return a child for the reasons set out under LAW ( b ) of LAW if it was not established that adequate measures to protect the child \u2019s best interests after his or her return would be taken . In DATE it had therefore requested that the NORP authorities provide the appropriate safeguards . According to ORG answers by letters of CARDINAL May and DATE , all conditions would be met to ensure that the children were returned without any risk ; they also stated that the children would not be immediately entrusted to the applicant upon their return . ORG concluded therefore that the children would temporarily be put into foster care , which was contrary to their best interests . It also pointed out that on DATE it had held a hearing to discuss possible scenarios concerning the children \u2019s return to GPE and to consider alternative ways of reestablishing contact between the applicant and the children . Since the applicant had failed to attend the hearing without providing any excuse , the court assumed that the purpose of the proceedings seemed to be more for him to argue out his conflict with PERSON than for the children \u2019s return to GPE . It further held that a balancing of the competing interests of those involved had to be carried out in such a case , and that the children \u2019s interests were of paramount importance . Referring to the case of Neulinger and GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . ORG , ORG DATE ) , the court stated that the possibility of the children being further traumatised , the serious difficulties that they would be likely to encounter under new living conditions in GPE and the lack of adequate safeguards were reasons why the return order could not be enforced . Instead , psychologically assisted contact between the applicant and the children should be slowly re - established in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision and challenged the judge for bias .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the challenge for bias . The decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL and DATE above ) , upholding its reasoning and adding that , due to the arrest warrant against ORG , the children would likely be put into foster care without their mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case . It observed that under LAW the court dealing with an application for return should act expeditiously when deciding it and , subsequently , when providing for the enforcement of an already issued return order . It would be contrary to that obligation if the court delayed or possibly impeded the return of a child by not ruling or by belatedly deciding the parties\u2019 requests . In that context , it noted that in the present case , after ORG had delivered its decision on CARDINAL DATE , DATE had already elapsed before the case eventually came before it . The delay in the return proceedings caused by the abducting parent \u2019s behaviour was not a fact which by itself exempted the authorities from their obligation to swiftly and adequately implement their duties under international law .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG conceded that , given that the children had meanwhile adapted well to living in GPE and their mental health had become stable , their well - being would be gravely put at risk if the return order was enforced without any safeguards . Nonetheless , it noted that this development was mainly due to the fact that almost four years had elapsed since the return order had become final in DATE . Therefore , the return order was still enforceable as long as it was not established that no adequate measures would be taken to protect the children \u2019s best interests upon their return to GPE . ORG therefore ordered ORG to clarify whether the arrest warrant issued against ORG in GPE could be lifted , to assess whether ORG mother in place of ORG would be willing to accompany the children to GPE and care for them in a child protection institution , and to obtain the NORP authorities\u2019 assurance that the children could live in a child protection institution as close to the applicant as possible . It further held that it was for the applicant to apply to the competent authorities in GPE for temporary care for his children in a child protection institution , and that it was not for the NORP courts to establish contact between him and the children under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG since the establishment of contact for the purposes of the enforcement of a return order fell within the competence of the authorities of the ORG from which the children had been abducted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the NORP authorities for information as requested by ORG in its decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after another oral hearing on CARDINAL DATE and a telephone conversation with the public prosecutor at ORG on DATE , ORG again dismissed the applicant \u2019s request of DATE for enforcement of the return order ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It held that PERSON \u2019s mother was unwilling to stay temporarily with the children in GPE after their return and that , in any event , PERSON had to start serving her prison sentence once she entered GPE . It further noted that the NORP authorities had formulated different ways of avoiding the children \u2019s separation from their mother , but could not give any guarantees in advance ; instead , they had pointed out that PERSON first had to return the children to GPE before any concrete measures could be taken . ORG therefore concluded that the NORP authorities had failed to devise an exact plan which , in particular , would avoid the children being immediately separated from their mother . Given that the children would probably be placed in a child protection institution in a ( for them ) foreign country and without any familiar caregivers around , there would be a severe risk of harm for them within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW if they were returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant against ORG decision of DATE . It conceded that ORG \u2019s behaviour concerning the removal of the children from GPE in itself , but also with regard to her delaying tactics in the present proceedings , was unacceptable . However , it was now for the NORP courts only to decide whether the requirements of LAW ) of ORG were fulfilled , namely whether the children could be returned to GPE without being separated from their mother . In this regard , it held that ORG had correctly concluded that the requirements of LAW ( CARDINAL ) were not fulfilled , since the NORP authorities had not provided sufficient guarantees to ensure that the children would not suffer severe harm upon their return . It had not been established that the children could stay with ORG while she was serving her prison sentence , and since their grandmother was unwilling to accompany them to GPE , they would be left without any caregivers familiar to them .", "CARDINAL . Regarding the applicant \u2019s allegations that ORG had failed to contact the relevant NORP authorities and to ask the right questions , ORG held that the NORP authorities had merely referred to general alternatives without offering any precise answers to the NORP courts\u2019 concerns . The court considered that ORG had already made sufficient attempts to obtain concrete guarantees from the NORP authorities as it was mainly their responsibility to take adequate measures . In particular , the NORP authorities should have given an undertaking that the decision of DATE provisionally determining the children \u2019s main residence with their father would be revoked and that , despite the prison sentence , PERSON would be granted safe conduct in order to be able to participate in the custody proceedings in GPE . ORG also considered that the applicant \u2019s conduct was not in the children \u2019s best interests either , since the enforcement of the decision of DATE and ORG \u2019s criminal conviction appeared to be more important to him than their well - being , and he did not even realise the seriousness of the burden to which he would expose his children if they were forced to return to him after not having seen him for DATE . In sum , ORG concluded that because of a lack of adequate \u201c safe harbour orders \u201d the children \u2019s return to GPE entailed a grave risk for them ; furthermore , since they had meanwhile adapted well to living in GPE , their uprooting would very likely also lead to a severe endangerment of their well - being .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an extraordinary appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the extraordinary appeal on points of law . It confirmed that the children \u2019s separation from their mother in the event of their return to GPE could still not be excluded because of ORG \u2019s prison sentence , and that such separation would very likely severely traumatise and psychologically harm them within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW . It reiterated that the return of the children could not be refused if it was established that the NORP authorities had made adequate arrangements to protect the children \u2019s best interests upon their return . However , if there remained doubts in this respect , the return would have to be refused . Since the measures as set out by the NORP authorities had to be considered insufficient to secure the protection of the children upon their return , the non - enforcement of the return order was justified . Nonetheless , ORG pointed out that the decision was primarily based on what seemed best for the children \u2019s well - being and did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that PERSON \u2019s conduct had been lawful . Lastly , it observed that the applicant still had the possibility of applying to the NORP courts for contact rights .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that , to date , the applicant had not applied to the NORP courts for contact rights .", "DATE . ORG ( bureau de l\u2019entraide civile et commerciale international ) at ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and its NORP counterpart at ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) remained in contact throughout all of the abovementioned proceedings . In their letters , the officials in charge of the case regularly discussed how to protect the children \u2019s best interests upon their return to the applicant . The ORG sent several requests to its counterpart for information on the progress of the case , in particular on the measures taken by the NORP authorities to locate PERSON and the children and the reasons why the return order had not been enforced . The ORG informed its NORP counterpart of the respective state of the proceedings , referred to the parties\u2019 requests and appeals as obstacles to the continuation of the enforcement of the return order and considered the actual address of ORG and the children to be unknown . Regarding the ORG \u2019s requests for safeguards to secure the protection of the children , the ORG pointed out at the beginning of the enforcement proceedings that there were no obstacles impeding the children \u2019s return to their father as the competent NORP judge had already determined that their main residence was at his home ; thus , ORG would not be notified of the children \u2019s return to GPE . However , on CARDINAL DATE the ORG confirmed in a letter to the ORG that if the children returned to GPE , a social worker would meet them at the airport in GPE and take them to their father .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the competent judge at ORG twice requested that the ORG help her establish contact with the judge competent in childcare matters ( juge des enfants \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the children \u2019s judge \u201d ) in GPE because she had doubts as to whether the immediate return of the children to their father would expose them to grave harm and therefore preferred temporary social care for them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed its NORP counterpart that it had been suggested to the public prosecutor in charge of childcare matters that the case be brought before the children \u2019s judge in accordance with LAW ) of ORG , and that the public prosecutor had indicated a wish to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the children \u2019s judge at the GPE tribunal de grande instance appointed an expert psychiatrist and ordered him to deliver a report on whether the applicant was suffering from any form of mental illness ; on DATE he ordered the ORG ( Service territorial \u00e9ducatif de milieu ouvert et d\u2019insertion , a youth welfare service ) in GPE to examine the living conditions at the applicant \u2019s home and his educational and emotional skills .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted the psychiatric opinion obtained by the children \u2019s judge , which stated that the applicant did not suffer from any form of mental illness , could meet a child \u2019s needs and was very much devoted to his children .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG submitted the ORG \u2019s pre - report which confirmed that the living conditions provided by the applicant were appropriate to accommodate his children ; however , the ORG would only be able to assess the applicant \u2019s educational and emotional skills once the children were returned to him .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG confirmed , in reply to the NORP authorities\u2019 concerns about an immediate return of the children to the applicant and their proposal of temporary social care , that the children would not be entrusted to their father right after their return , and that the children \u2019s judge would monitor their best interests and , if need be , take measures of educational support .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted a judgment given by the children \u2019s judge of the GPE tribunal de grande instance on DATE , which stated that no measures of educational support for the applicant had to be taken at that time . According to the evidence taken so far ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , the applicant was able to provide appropriate living conditions for his children and did not suffer from any form of mental illness or sexually deviant behaviour . His educational and emotional skills could only be assessed upon the children \u2019s effective return to GPE , and by the time of their return concrete measures could again be taken into consideration .", "DATE . Following ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE the ORG informed its NORP counterpart that it had forwarded ORG request of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to the public prosecutor at ORG , suggesting that the case again be brought before the children \u2019s judge at the GPE tribunal de grande instance .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the ORG submitted a report which the public prosecutor at ORG had made on DATE , in reply to ORG request of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . According to the report , PERSON , due to the arrest warrant against her , was registered in the NORP register of persons being searched for by the criminal authorities ( fichier des personnes recherch\u00e9es \u2013 \u201c FPR \u201d ) ; thus , she could immediately be arrested once she entered GPE . However , in the event of her return to GPE together with her children , the public prosecutor would be prepared to withdraw her from the ORG on the grounds that the children \u2019s return would make it possible for the applicant to see his children , so that the objective of the arrest warrant would then also be achieved . Hence , ORG would not risk immediate arrest if she entered GPE . The public prosecutor however noted that in any event PERSON would have to start serving her prison sentence , and that suspending it from the outset would not be possible . She could however apply to serve the sentence under electronic surveillance immediately after being imprisoned if she proved that she had a residence in GPE . After serving CARDINAL of the sentence she could then apply for conditional release , which could even be granted earlier if she proved that her children were living with her . As to the civillaw issues of ORG request of DATE , the public prosecutor referred to the children \u2019s judge \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In their letter of DATE , the ORG complemented the public prosecutor \u2019s report by explaining that the children \u2019s judge could order that the children be placed either with their mother , another member of the family or a trusted third party , or eventually in an institution , possibly in the vicinity of the applicant \u2019s home . Such an order would overrule the decision of the ORG tribunal de grande instance family judge of DATE , which had determined that the children \u2019s main residence was with their father . As for PERSON \u2019s prison sentence , it was recommended that she or her counsel contact the competent public prosecutor in advance and already prepare the necessary applications , since it could not be excluded that she would be questioned by the judge in charge of the review of her punishment as early as on DATE of her detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted confirmation by the children \u2019s judge dated DATE that as soon as the effective return of the children was fixed by the NORP authorities he would be prepared to order temporary foster care for them and educational support for the father to reestablish the ties between them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted another report from the public prosecutor at ORG which , in reply to another questionnaire of ORG , repeated the conditions under which ORG could apply for conditional release .
